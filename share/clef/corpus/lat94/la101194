 Taking term limits a step further: If elected in November, Bob New of Glendale 
vows to try his best to be nothing more than a one-term lieutenant governor -- 
or, even better, a one-quarter-term lieutenant governor. New, a member of the 
Libertarian Party, has pledged to work to abolish the office he is seeking. He 
dismisses the lieutenant governorship as a waste of taxpayers money merely 
filled by "an official who waits around for the governor to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Now just a minute. That oversimplification is an insult to the current 
lieutenant governor -- uh, you know, what's-his-name.

 Time for your close-up, Mr. De Mille: Frank Cooper of the Art Deco Society of 
L.A. writes that in our recent piece on important dates in October, we omitted 
Oct. 29, the date of that group's "Hollywood Cemetery Walking Tour." It's a 
celebration of the one set of celebs who are now safe from paparazzi and 
autograph-hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deco Society tours, which cost $7 per person, begin at 10 a.m. at the 
cemetery, at 6000 Santa Monica Boulevard. (The society is a nonprofit 
organization, so no one's making a killing on this event.) 
</P>
<P>
 The tour spotlights not only the stars, pioneers and businessmen who are 
permanently featured there, but also the "the many monumental forms of art and 
architecture, including Egyptian Revival, Moderne, Victorian and Greek 
Revival." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper also sent along the Deco Society's 1994 calendar, which salutes such 
milestones as the April 6, 1931, debut of those twin pillars of sugar -- 
Hostess Twinkies.

 The return of Chicken Boy: Universal CityWalk and the Smithsonian Institution 
weren't interested in giving him shelter. But L.A.'s ARCO Plaza has agreed to 
put up Chicken Boy, a 22-foot-tall fiberglass figure, for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 C.B., who once sat atop a chicken restaurant, has dwelt in a storage yard in 
Monterey Park with his head between his legs ever since the eatery folded in 
1984. Graphic designer Amy Inouye, his current owner, had tried for years to 
find a home for the big guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Chicken Boy will gain a measure of respect Thursday morning when he's 
unveiled during ceremonies at the plaza.  
</P>
<P>
 C.B. owes his temporary freedom to plaza manager Charlene Bu, several 
companies who donated their services and listeners of radio station KZLA-FM, 
who contributed funds. Disc jockeys John Murphy and John Garabo, touched by 
C.B.'s plight, had told listeners of the 500-pound boy/clucker's sorry 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope we can find him a permanent home afterward," said Murphy. "He's weird, 
which is why we feel he's such an important part of L.A.'s heritage." 
miscelLAny Hoover Street, Mt. Wilson and the city of Burbank all carry the 
names of notable Americans -- but not the ones you might assume. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover was named for Dr. Leonce Hoover, a pioneer who came to L.A. after 
serving in the French army. Wilson was named for early settler Benjamin Wilson, 
grandfather of Gen. George S. Patton, the World War II hero. And Burbank was 
named for Dr. David Burbank, a dentist.

NO LAURELS FOR THE 103RD CONGRESS; POLITICAL OBSTRUCTIONISM WAS THE BANNER 
RAISED OVER THE SESSION, AND VOTERS DON'T LIKE THAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American voters are anxious about their futures and angry at politicians. 
Among the deserving targets are those congressional obstructionists who were 
concerned less about the merits of legislation than the opportunity to score 
political points. Thus the increasingly acrimonious 103rd Congress adjourned 
last week after deciding on less than a mountain of important business. 
</P>
<P>
 Included on the political casualty list were some worthwhile bills that could 
have reduced welfare dependency, increased international trade, cleaned up 
toxic waste dumps, protected drinking water, updated ridiculously low mining 
fees set in 1872 and raised grazing fees on public land. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time it must be emphatically said that inaction is not always bad. 
Some bills, such as the 1,400-page-plus health reform legislation, require 
delay for more reflection; a sweeping bill that proposed major changes to 
one-seventh of the economy clearly needed more careful consideration than it 
was getting.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, the Republican minority led an unprecedented number of 
filibusters, stalling and finally killing bills in a display of pre-election 
political hardball. A once rare exception to senatorial courtesy became 
offensively routine.  
</P>
<P>
 Cloture, the motion to limit the hot air to no more than 30 additional hours, 
requires 60 votes. That was difficult to achieve among 100 senators, even 
though 56 of them were Democrats. Mindful of the cloture rule, Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell followed through on his assurances to keep the Senate 
in session into the weekend to bring about a final vote of approval on the 
California desert protection bill. Mitchell's perseverance permitted Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein's two years of tenacious advocacy to end in an eleventh-hour 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans weren't the only obstructionists. Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) 
stood in the way of a vote on GATT, the international trade agreement, in order 
to protect South Carolina's textile trade. His stubbornness will force a rare 
lame-duck session after the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes House Democratic leaders, too, abused their clout. They sat on the 
important crime bill conference report until less than two hours before a vote. 
That absurd procrastination allowed little time for examination of nearly 500 
pages of legislation. What a difference a year makes in Washington. Last year, 
President Clinton and Congress managed to pass the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, an ambitious deficit-reduction package, a family medical leave act 
and an increase in the earned income tax credit to alleviate poverty. This 
year, partisan bickering seemed to take precedence. No wonder more and more 
ordinary Americans are so cynical.

ONE BOND ISSUE TOO MANY: NO ON 181 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spending more to improve rail transportation makes sense in principle, but 
circumstances make it difficult to justify Proposition 181, the proposed 
Passenger Rail and Clean Air Bond Act. We urge a "no" vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 181, the only bond issue on the November ballot, would authorize 
the state to sell $1 billion in general obligation bonds to fund California's 
passenger rail transportation network. The money would be used to buy trains, 
improve and construct track and passenger stations and expand rail service. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond measure would be the final in a series of three $1-billion statewide 
bond issues proposed for rail projects. Voters approved the first in 1990, but 
the second was rejected in 1992 despite a million-dollar campaign for it. 
Proponents of the defeated 1992 measure have displayed little support for 181. 
Even Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), who authored the transportation bill 
that included the bond measures, has, although reluctantly, dropped his support 
of 181. He and some other lawmakers had sought to remove it from the ballot 
because of voters' widespread anti-bond mood; all of last June's bond issues 
failed miserably. Gov. Pete Wilson, however, opposed postponing a vote on 181. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's transportation budget already faces major shortfalls because of 
earthquake repair costs, less-than-expected gasoline tax revenues and the 
defeat of the 1992 bond measure. The main sources of support for 181 seem to be 
the state Business, Transportation and Housing Agency and Los Angeles' 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the measure would produce about $500 
million for Los Angeles rail projects). Voters understandably have doubts about 
giving more funds to the troubled MTA at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 181 would cost about $630 million in interest (if the bonds sold 
at 6%), money that would come from the already-stretched general fund. The 
state's fiscal crisis makes it unwise to take on this added debt. For some time 
this newspaper has agreed with fiscal experts that California should maintain a 
debt ceiling of no more than 5.2% of the general fund. Passage of 181 together 
with the continuing sale of previously authorized bonds would increase 
indebtedness to 5.7% by the 1996-97 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times vigorously backed the two previous bonds and 1990's Proposition 111, 
which raised gasoline taxes to pay for road improvements and rail. We support 
rail transit, but tough fiscal choices require a "no" on 181.

CLINTON SAID 'NO,' AND SADDAM BLINKED; AN ADMIRABLE SHOW OF FIRMNESS BY THE 
ADMINISTRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Challenged by Iraq's menacing military moves toward Kuwait, the Clinton 
Administration responded with a resoluteness and decisiveness in both word and 
deed that do it credit. There has been no ambiguity, no wavering or evidence of 
internal differences in its public statements, beginning with the President's 
at last Friday's press conference. Neither was there any hesitancy in ordering 
to the Persian Gulf area the troops, planes and ships that would be needed to 
oppose any new Iraqi aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his aides immediately and clearly saw what had to be done. Their 
judgment was sound, their actions effective. "We will not allow Saddam Hussein 
to defy the will of the United States and the international community," the 
President said Monday night. In the face of that determination, Hussein 
apparently has chosen to pull his troops back from the demilitarized zone 
between Iraq and Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, accompanied 
his announcement signaling this retreat with an affirmation of sovereignty 
that, in the circumstances, has to be prudently seen as something more than 
routine diplomatic boilerplate. "We reserve the right to move them (the troops) 
any time in the future to wherever we want within Iraqi territory." In other 
words, the army in southern Iraq could again be put on the road south if 
Hussein should again conclude that he has something to gain by demonstrating 
his continuing ability to make trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis, for now, appears to have been suspended. But the implicit threat 
that it could be renewed at any time hangs in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 That could mean that American forces in some numbers will have to remain on 
and around the Arabian Peninsula for a while to come. It could also mean, as 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry has suggested, that at some point U.S. 
forces would simply act to defang Hussein's army in southern Iraq, rather than 
settling in for an extended stay along the border. It's both expensive and 
morale-eroding to keep highly trained forces on indefinite alert far from home. 
What Perry was pointedly implying is that Washington doesn't intend to let 
Baghdad dictate the terms of the U.S. deployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Searching for rational motives in Saddam Hussein's behavior has always been 
something of a fool's errand. As Gertrude Stein remarked in another context, 
there's no there there. He is a master of self-deluding miscalculations, as his 
enormously costly invasion of Iran in 1980 and his brutal attempt to annex 
Kuwait a decade later show. A sense of subtlety is alien to his conduct of 
international relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus is that he hoped by this latest example of belligerent posturing 
to influence the U.N. Security Council to ease the economic sanctions against 
his country. He especially wants to begin selling oil to earn hard currency. 
Until a few days ago Russia, France and China, all permanent members of the 
council, were sympathetic, Russia because Iraq owes it more than $6 billion, 
France because it sees considerable commercial opportunities once the sanctions 
are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. and British view is that the sanctions should stay because Iraq is 
still a long way from proving its readiness to comply with U.N. resolutions and 
abide by the tenets of international law. Its behavior over the last week has 
left no doubt about that.

CONTROVERSY OVER PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Norman Matloff ("American Minorities Try to Hold the Line," Commentary, Sept. 
30) points out how immigrants, legal or illegal, impact the job markets of 
minority groups. No argument -- they do! 
</P>
<P>
 He does not, however, indicate how denying health care or education to illegal 
immigrants impacts these job issues. Most citizens believe that immigration 
control and enforcement are indeed necessary. Prop. 187 offers nothing to 
promote these goals, but only exposes all to the potential of ignorance and 
disease.

 * Re "The Dirty Secret Behind Proposition 187," Column Left, Sept. 29, by 
Robert Scheer: The real issue here is do we or do we not live according to law? 
This is an all or nothing question. If you choose to ignore the laws you don't 
like, then you have no position to complain when you are a "victim of crime." 
Has your car been stolen? Yourself robbed? Raped? Too bad. If we don't enforce 
the laws, then might makes right. Illegal immigrants are not needed. They are 
exploited. They should all be deported. They are not here legally.

 * I have been a longtime fan of Scheer, and his column confirms my judgment. 
His claim that Prop. 187 "rots our soul" cannot be denied. What have we become 
in California if we are willing to punish children for the actions of their 
parents and if we continue to readily exploit their parents to maintain our own 
lifestyles? Proponents of 187 say they just want to send a message to 
Washington. The only message we'll send if this passes is that California has 
no idea what demons it is releasing.

</P>
<P>
 * Carlos Fuentes' opinions (Commentary, Sept. 28) cry for a response. Fuentes' 
remarks are not only incorrect but are also inflammatory by suggesting the 
possibility of strikes and boycotts. This is no way to nurture goodwill between 
our countries. 
</P>
<P>
 His depiction of Gov. Pete Wilson as poisoning relationships between the two 
countries should be reversed. If there is poisoning, it is created by the 
continuing flow of illegals across our borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuentes is quick to bring attention to the possible illegality of Prop. 187 
but remains silent about the illegality of thousands of undocumented people who 
daily violate our borders. He should direct his journalistic talents toward 
opening the eyes of his fellow citizens in Mexico to the ills plaguing his own 
country -- poverty, corruption, violence, civil uprising and assassinations. 
These are the root causes motivating the illegal flow across our borders.

 * As a legal Latino immigrant I am amazed by what I hear and read about Prop. 
187 and illegal immigration in general. 
</P>
<P>
 People talk about civil rights, language rights, health rights, minority 
rights, school rights, these rights and those rights. What about the rights of 
legal residents and citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons I wanted to come here was to leave behind the lapsed law 
enforcement, the corruption, the impunity, the colonial mentality prevalent 
everywhere in Latin America. I was convinced that this was the country of the 
rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the laws in this case are not enforced. Illegal immigrants are 
outside the law, they are outlaws. They infringe on this country's sovereignty. 
That is plainly unacceptable in any civilized society. Our borders should be 
defended by any means, including any necessary level of force.  
</P>
<P>
 I am convinced that legal Latino immigrants and citizens do not want to see 
this motherland of our choice become a banana republic like the places we left, 
whatever the cultural ties we want to keep alive. This will gradually happen if 
the sheer numbers of illegal immigration are not brought under control. 
</P>

 JOSE M. WAECHTER

</P>
<P>
 * Your Oct. 2 editorial critical of Prop. 187 was dead on. The proposal is 
barbaric and retrograde. The provisions against the citizen sons and daughters 
of illegal immigrants undoubtedly violate the 14th Amendment requirement of 
equal protection of the laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent outbreak of the plague in India points up the dangers of the denial 
of medical care. Let's assume an Indian traveler is faced with forms to 
determine whether he's an illegal alien. I can see him responding, "I'm not 
really very sick," and walking out of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN P. TESCHKE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Your editorial related Prop. 187 to the "law of unintended consequences." 
You thereby left yourself open to some unintended inconsistencies. You said it 
would be an "ugly outrage" to require teachers to identify immigration status. 
But you supported earlier legislation that required employers to do the very 
same thing. If reporting criminals is a duty of employers, surely it can be no 
less a duty of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in your editorial you worried about the possible loss of federal aid to 
California if the proposition passed and were implemented. That is the very 
purpose of the legislation -- to reduce both state and federal spending. 
Apparently you believe the proposition will achieve its objective -- its 
intended consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 You argue that the low-wage immigrant keeps the California economy going, yet 
in the next breath you hope the United States and Mexico can work out an 
agreement that will reduce the lure of jobs. You cannot have it both ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if you are successful in reducing the flow of immigrants by reducing 
the lure of jobs, just think of all the people who will not be able to get the 
basic medical care and education that they do get when they come here. Either 
Prop. 187 or your denial of jobs to immigrants would have the same effect. 
Perhaps your heart can now bleed over your own proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 DONALD R. BOOTH 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Your editorial missed mentioning an inevitable consequence of interest to 
many of the right-wingers pushing this initiative -- the national identity 
card. Perhaps a tattoo to the wrist and an implanted computer chip is in our 
future to better identify us as legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no joke -- the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by 
Barbara Jordan, has just recommended a computerized registry (Oct. 1).  
</P>
<P>
 Giving more power to government to regulate our lives is not the answer. If 
welfare were financed by voluntary contributions to private charities, the 
primary concern of the illegal alien issue of Prop. 187 would vanish. The 
problem is that government has coerced contributions to a function (charity) 
for which it has no constitutional authority. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I find it difficult to believe that citizens are naive enough to vote 
against Prop. 187 based on your editorial. Your editorial's putative 
"clincher," that California would "lose" $15 billion in federal payments, is so 
disingenuous as to be asinine. Aside from the fact that without the illegals we 
won't need the money, where do you suppose that $15 billion comes from?

 Grown-ups know that it comes from the pockets of citizens like you and legal

 * As a conservative, it isn't often that I find myself agreeing with your 
editorials. Your denunciation of Prop. 187, however, is right on target. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the truest measure of who should get the benefits of citizenship 
should be the contributions made by the individual or group. Many of the 
immigrants who would be affected by the proposition perform the menial jobs 
that the rest of us consider demeaning -- yard work, cleaning houses, picking 
fruit and vegetables, etc. In doing so, they help many to enjoy a good life. 
These immigrants understand more fully than many native-born Californians what 
this country is all about: Trying to get ahead by honest, hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are many problems created by unwanted immigration, but to 
blame these people for problems created by politicians is disingenuous and 
cowardly.

 * I never believed that I would agree with a Republican, and a conservative 
one at that, but thank God for Ron Unz's commentary arguing against Prop. 187 
(Oct. 3). It's about time someone spoke up about this dastardly, immoral and 
heartbreaking piece of so-called legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Punishing children for their parents' attempts to provide them with a decent 
life is so immoral that it boggles the mind. "Save Our State," indeed. The 
xenophobia of this proposition is astounding, but amazingly, none seem to care. 
I think most Californians, unfortunately, will vote for this, and I'm sure 
their answer, if asked why, would be something along the lines of "We've got to 
save California for real Californians." Didn't someone say that patriotism is 
the last refuge of a scoundrel? I hope and pray that we haven't become a whole 
state full of scoundrels.

 * Re "Clergy Struggles to Address Volatile Issues of Prop. 187," Oct. 3: 
</P>
<P>
 While I have not yet made up my mind on the proposition itself, the spectacle 
of religious leaders speaking out against Prop. 187 illustrates the double 
standard in the media and our culture with respect to the "religious right." 
When people use the Bible to justify conservative positions on issues such as 
abortion, school prayer, and homosexual agendas, such people are branded as 
zealots who wish to impose their religious views on everyone else. However, 
when people use the Bible to support left-wing causes such as expanding the 
welfare state to accommodate illegal aliens, they are simply regarded as 
nonpartisans who are instituting "compassion and morality" for people of all 
faiths. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, you will now be covering stories of how the "religious left" has 
taken over the Democratic Party and is moving it away from mainstream America. 
</P>
<P>
 When are people going to realize that the agendas of religious conservatives 
have every bit as much to do with morality as the religious liberals' agendas, 
and that they are moved by the same ideals?

THE MTA CAN'T STEER AND ROW, TOO; TRANSPORTATION: THE AGENCY SHOULD PROVIDE THE 
FRAMEWORK FOR AN EFFICIENT SYSTEM AND LET THE PRIVATE SECTOR IMPLEMENT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL PETERSON, Neil Peterson was the chief executive of the Los Angeles 
County Transportation Commission from 1989 to 1993, a predecessor agency to the 
MTA. He is currently the director of a public-private transportation project in 
Seattle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The public is rapidly losing what confidence it had in its governmental 
institutions -- the MTA is no exception. A new vision is needed for 
transportation in Los Angeles County. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
needs to focus its attention on providing the framework for making it easier 
for citizens to get around the metropolitan area, and stop the political 
bickering and wrangling. Government should steer the boat, not row it.  
</P>
<P>
 The MTA is bickering over bus versus rail service. It is in the courts arguing 
over whether its fare structure hurts the poor disproportionately. It is asking 
riders to give up the convenient monthly pass, introducing a token and a 
complicated transfer charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA recently settled a strike, but did so without significantly changing 
the economic facts of life that lead to this year's $125-million shortfall. 
Management's relations with its unions and staff are at an all-time low, with 
employees lacking any sense of empowerment and motivation to improve the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has become focused on trying to find scapegoats for the problems 
besetting the construction of the Hollywood segment of the Red Line subway. The 
solution will probably be to fire the most competent construction manager 
they've got, and abolish the Rail Construction Corp.'s board of directors -- a 
group of individuals who are very knowledgeable and experienced in construction 
projects and who must spend their time trying to keep politics out of the 
project. It would replace them with a board of politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The real issue the MTA should be wrestling with is how to set up the framework 
that unleashes the entrepreneurial spirit and drive of Southern California to 
achieve MTA's mission -- to improve mobility in L.A. County. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA needs to take a page from what many families and businesses have had 
to do -- namely, live within their means, drastically cut back to fit the 
available budget, downsize and rethink the traditional way of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Four steps should be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 * Operations should be cut back to the level required to match the revenues 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 * New sources of revenue or income should be identified. The public is not in 
the mood to impose more taxes on themselves. The only option is to charge more 
for the service you are providing. With the quality of the service being 
delivered, it remains to be seen whether people will pay more. Even if the 
courts allow the proposed fare increase to go into effect, it will only raise 
one-third of the monies needed to bridge the operating shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 * New ways of doing business -- ways that provide needed service at lower cost 
-- should be sought. 
</P>
<P>
 * The private sector, the nonprofit sector and individuals should be asked for 
help to provide transportation services to people who would suffer as a result 
of service cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Southern California has been in a recession for several years, the 
entrepreneurial spirit is alive and well. For example, private bus companies 
are eager to provide quality service at lower costs and cheaper fares. The taxi 
and shuttle-van industry wants to increase its market share. Many individuals 
would jump at the chance to own and operate 10- to 20-passenger jitneys, which 
would be cheaper to operate, less costly to the riders, have more frequent 
service and be safer. 
</P>
<P>
 This applies to rail construction too. The answer to the rail construction 
"problems" identified in The Times is not to have the 13-member MTA board try 
to directly manage the very complicated $2-billion project. The 13 elected 
officials are not expert in the management of large capital projects. Their 
agendas and interests and time are divided among competing priorities. They 
cannot focus on getting the job done that the voters have twice voted to have 
happen -- namely, to bring a rail system to Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the board should be asking the private sector to take on a greater 
role and responsibility to complete these large capital projects on schedule 
and within budget. Most other countries have long recognized that the private 
sector is much more capable of building these complicated projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Riordan and others on the MTA board have spoken of the need to move in 
this direction. The time is now.

MUSIC REVIEW; KIROV: FROM RUSSIA WITH BRILLIANCE; THE CONCERT FOCUS WAS ON THE 
DISSOLUTION OF ROMANTICISM IN EARLY 20TH-CENTURY RUSSIA. THE PERFORMANCES WERE 
IMPECCABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A miracle happened at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Sunday night. A Russian 
orchestra came to town and didn't play Tchaikovsky. Nary a slurp. 
</P>
<P>
 This, to be sure, was no ordinary, garden-variety Russian orchestra. This was 
the elite orchestra of the Kirov Theater -- a.k.a. Maryinsky -- in 
sophisticated St. Petersburg. This was the historic, erstwhile imperial 
ensemble refined and polished in modern times by the great Yevgeny Mravinsky 
and his successor Yuri Temirkanov. 
</P>
<P>
 The maestro on duty here was Valery Gergiev, internationally oriented artistic 
director at the Kirov since 1988 and a frequent guest on Western podia. He made 
a most auspicious Los Angeles debut in 1992 conducting our Philharmonic in a 
Russian program and will return for two weeks in May. Last year, he was given 
Verdi's "Otello" as an unorthodox introductory vehicle at the Metropolitan 
Opera, where he earned invariable approval for its heroic vitality and 
reservations from at least one observer (this one) for his unflaggingly nervous 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The symphonic agenda on Sunday bore a striking, probably coincidental 
resemblance to the program chosen by Esa-Pekka Salonen to open the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic season three days earlier. Stylistic cliches and easy effects were 
steadfastly avoided. The focus was on the dissolution of romanticism in the 
early decades of 20th-Century Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergiev began (after a leisurely entrance procession by his players) with the 
theatrical opulence of Rimsky-Korsakov's seldom-performed "Legend of the 
Invisible City of Kitezh" (1905), ended with the brazen exotica of Stravinsky's 
"Firebird" (1910) and used the muted bravura of Prokofiev's D-major Violin 
Concerto (1917) as subtle centerpiece. The performances, in all three cases, 
were brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kirov orchestra is a perfectly balanced, impeccably blended virtuoso 
instrument, and Gergiev plays it with masterly elan. The strings can shimmer 
without losing warmth, focus or intensity. The brass can blast without blaring. 
The winds, agreeably nasal in timbre, savor the impact of the tender caress. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergiev retains the seating plan apparently customary in Russia: violins at 
his left, violas at his right, cellos in the middle, brass at the top. The 
sonic configuration, at first a bit disorienting to foreign eyes and ears, 
creates uncommon vibrancy while it supports textural cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
 The maestro obviously knows his orchestra, and it obviously knows him. He 
doesn't have to concern himself much with such basics as beating time and 
offering cues. He doesn't even use a baton. Like his colleague Temirkanov, he 
prefers to concentrate on illustrative matters -- sculpting phrases in the air, 
flashing emotional signals, miming moods and, for reasons not quite clear to 
the uninitiated, constantly fluttering his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks fussy. But it works. 
</P>
<P>
 In his hands, the "Kitezh" excerpts throbbed with reflective mystery, crashed 
with precision violence and evaporated in climactic serenity. The poignancy was 
exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
 With Viktor Tretyakov as extraordinarily sensitive, properly intimate soloist, 
the Prokofiev concerto offered object lessons in the projection and sustenance 
of feverish delicacy. It will be interesting, and perhaps instructive, to hear 
how the same challenge sounds next week when it is ventured by Julian Rachlin 
(replacing Midori), Salonen and the L.A. Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission (and another leisurely entrance procession for the 
players), Gergiev threatened to give us too much of a good thing. In 
Stravinsky's "Firebird" -- the whole, theatrically extended score, not the more 
reasonable suite -- the maestro dotted every musical i and crossed every t. 
Five times. 
</P>
<P>
 The pervasive attention to minutiae proved refreshing at the outset. The 
distinction between a pianissimo and a pianississimo was tellingly observed. 
The tone painting was carefully dazzling. The lyrical passages emerged 
incredibly ethereal, and the dramatic outbursts threatened cataclysm. Slow 
passages moved very slowly indeed, and fast ones flashed like lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 This was terrific music-making, no doubt about it. After a while, however, 
everything seemed a bit exaggerated, a bit self-conscious and more than a bit 
precious. Gergiev and his followers had taken Stravinsky's taut little ballet 
and turned it into a massive, swollen music-drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach certainly was interesting. The audience loved it. Nevertheless, 
the interpretation flirted with distortion if not perversion. 
</P>
<P>
 There were encores aplenty. Tretyakov repeated the scherzo of the Prokofiev 
concerto before intermission. At the end of the evening, Gergiev, ever 
generous, added the "Rakoczi" March from Berlioz's "La Damnation de Faust" and 
Liadov's "Baba Yaga."

 An Orange County chapter of the Dance Resource Center of Greater Los Angeles 
has been formed to develop audiences and provide support for local dance 
professionals. Dance events in the county will be listed in the DRC's bimonthly 
newsletter, and chapter organizers plan to offer performances and 
lecture-demonstrations in such easily accessible public places as parks where, 
as choreographer Deborah Brockus notes, "dance doesn't normally exist." Basic 
membership is $20 and includes the newsletter. (310) 531-8949 or (213)

THEATER REVIEWS; 'NIGHTINGALE': WARM HOME AND HEARTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of descriptions from "The Iliad" to "Les Miserables" to "Platoon" 
have taught us that war is hell. And it has its effect on the home front, too. 
They also serve who sit and wait. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 C.P. Taylor's "And a Nightingale Sang . . . " is one of those bittersweet 
memory plays that helps to define the attitudes, traumas, laughter and tears 
that are part and parcel of keeping the home fires burning. The working class 
Stott family of England's Newcastle-on-Tyne during World War II is not the 
propaganda family of "Mrs. Miniver." The Stotts are very rough-hewn, and their 
anger and humor are rawboned and basic. 
</P>
<P>
 In his production at Cal State Fullerton, director Dan Kern has captured the 
mood and spirit of their heartbreaks and heroism, their joys and their jinks, 
with not only a noble empathy and understanding but also with a clockwork 
precision of rhythms and tempos that couples Taylor's naturalism with immense 
theatricality. It is a funny play, for wise people laugh to dispel disaster, 
and Kern and his excellent company join in the fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stott's oldest daughter, Helen, played with consummate, iridescent 
artistry by Eve Himmelheber, narrates the play; these are her memories that 
unfold as the war progresses. Himmelheber bridges with finesse the change in 
Helen from a naive young woman, slightly crippled at birth, to a confident 
maturity through a sad relationship with a married soldier. The actress is 
intuitive in choices that always work, and her charm and stage presence help 
illuminate her calm, intricate and truthful characterization. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Leigh Miller's younger sister Joyce, who can never make up her mind, 
also has difficult changes in attitude throughout the action, and Miller 
handles them with aplomb, as she does Joyce's slightly dense but attractive 
view of life. As the Royal Artillery bloke in Joyce's life, Justin Fletcher 
couldn't be better, with a brash Brit sense of humor and a solidity that takes 
Joyce some time to decipher. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing older than themselves, Alan Hixon and Hilary Russell offer fine takes 
on the eccentricities of the parents: George, who can't keep away from the 
piano and the popular songs he loves, and Mam, who can't make a move without 
conferring with her statue of Our Lady. Paul Pederson, playing even older as 
Helen's grandfather, knows the intricate rhythms of the writing, which gets him 
all the laughs and then some (even though his dialect is vague). Andrew Amador 
is Helen's married soldier, a fairly colorless role which he correctly defines 
with a guilt-ridden reticence. 
</P>
<P>
 Sachiko Nakao's layered setting -- of various rooms in the Stott home and the 
outdoors of Newcastle -- has provided a visually attractive ground for Kern's 
interesting staging and is beautifully and subtly lit by Matt Schleicher.

ART REVIEW; HUNG LIU'S FORTUNES REST IN FRESH PAINTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lured by word of an installation by Hung Liu containing 200,000 fortune 
cookies, visitors to the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery well may find several less 
extravagant-sounding works of hers to be more rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in China in 1948, Liu trained at the Central Academy in Beijing as a 
Socialist Realist muralist during the Cultural Revolution. After emigrating to 
the U.S., she earned her master's of fine arts at UC San Diego, a hotbed of 
critical theory. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past decade or so she has painted in what she dryly calls a "social 
realist" style, based largely on old photographs of Chinese concubines posed 
with Western accouterments. These figurative works deftly intertwine political 
and cultural references. 
</P>
<P>
 Her installation "Jiu Jin Shan: Old Gold Mountain" is a more straightforward 
affair. Three-dimensional, shaped paintings of six large and small Chinese 
fishing boats hang on the walls surrounding a veritable mountain of fortune 
cookies. Stationed at four compass points, sundials fashioned from rocks 
display satellite photographs of various parts of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old Gold Mountain" was a phrase used by Chinese emigrants to describe San 
Francisco, the "promised land" that often rewarded sacrifice and hard work with 
rampant discrimination and poverty. (The original version of the installation, 
in San Francisco, included railroad ties recalling the exploited Chinese 
laborers who built the Western portion of the transcontinental railroad.) 
</P>
<P>
 More obviously, the immense heap of fortune cookies and the sundials suggest 
the multitude of hopes and dreams brought to these shores by immigrants from 
many points of the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Such information is efficiently conveyed by the piece, but it doesn't really 
tell us anything we don't already know, and -- like so many other intelligent 
but visually bland installations -- its didacticism overrules its visceral 
appeal. Liu's paintings generally are more arresting in their own right, while 
proposing fresher and more complex views of social issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madame X," for example, is the portrait of a woman who extends her pitiful 
bound feet -- once considered by Chinese men to be the ultimate feminine 
adornment -- directly into the viewer's space. 
</P>
<P>
 The mirror behind her head is blank, effectively canceling out the viewer's 
presence and, by extension, the covetous gaze of any man who would see her as a 
mere physical object. Madame X coolly stares out at the world with a bizarre 
dual identity: physically hobbled victim and mentally liberated observer. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Yellow Pair," clearly based on a vintage photograph, the subjects are two 
unsmiling concubines who recline, holding hands, on a Victorian chaise lounge 
someone has dragged to a river bank (or, more likely, a photo studio's painting 
of the natural setting). 
</P>
<P>
 A slight blurriness in the concubines' faces and the obscuring function of 
thin rivulets of paint give the scene a distant, nostalgic quality -- painterly 
affectations that mirror the aesthetic self-consciousness of the original 
photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 Contemporary Western furniture was considered very chic in turn-of-the-century 
China, as were poses copied from the Western notion of the odalisque or slave 
girl -- ironically, a romanticized version of an Asian original. 
</P>
<P>
 The architectural element attached to the top of the painting -- an Art 
Nouveau frieze of robed figures, possibly Greek gods -- adds one more layer to 
the cross-cultural aesthetic borrowing in this piece. But it also helps to 
point up the sad titillation of packaging young girls for sale in genteel, 
"artistic" poses, as if the studied appearance of culture could eradicate pain 
and degradation. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Jiu Jin Shan: Old Gold Mountain" and other works by Hung Liu remain through 
Oct. 29 at the UC Irvine Fine Arts Gallery in the Fine Arts Village off Bridge 
Road on the UCI campus. Noon to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. Free. (714) 
856-8251. * SHORT STROKES: Ann Phong's roiling paintings at Griffin Fine Art 
are populated mostly by ghosts -- white outlines of figures in Vietnamese 
peasant dress evoking immigrant memories of toil and persecution. Like most 
ghosts, they are most convincing when most elusive. The best work is "Jump": A 
pair of feet, separated from their slippers by a raging torrent, rests on a

 Filming Custody Woes?: Woody Allen is apparently contemplating revenge via the 
big screen. According to Douglas McGrath, Allen's writing partner on the new 
movie "Bullets Over Broadway," the Neurotic One may make a movie about his 
child custody battle with Mia Farrow if he decides Farrow isn't treating their 
kids right. "Woody perseveres and remains optimistic but has told me that if 
the children are not treated with the humanity and sympathy they deserve, he 
may make a nonfiction film of the events," said McGrath, who wrote about the 
possibility in the Oct. 17 issue of New York magazine. Allen and Farrow have a 
biological child, Satchel, and two adopted children, Dylan and Moses. A judge 
last year gave Farrow custody of all three. Allen contends the custody 
arrangement was meant to punish him for his affair with Farrow's adopted 
daughter Soon-Yi Previn, and has appealed. McGrath said Allen will make up his 
mind about the movie after all appeals are resolved. Allen was filming in New 
York on Monday and could not be reached for comment.

 Canadian Ban: Savoy Pictures' new erotic comedy "Exit to Eden" has been banned 
from public viewing in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The Saskatchewan 
Film Classification Board zapped the Garry Marshall-directed, R-rated film 
"because of scenes of explicit sexual activity." In a statement, Savoy 
President Alan Greisman called the Saskatchewan board's action "ludicrous" and 
said the film has "strong sexual content but nothing more than other R-rated 
movies." "Exit to Eden," based on Anne Rice's best-selling novel, opens in 
1,800 U.S. and Canadian theaters on Friday.

 Football for Kids: Fox Children's Network is teaming with NFL Films to create 
a series of half-hour specials designed to introduce kids to professional 
football. The series, called "Grunt & Punt," is structured like a football 
game, with the team of Grunt, a hog, and Punt, a boar, calling the game from 
the broadcast booth. The pair of swine also conduct interviews with animated 
pigskin stars like Trough Oinkman and Boomer Pigtyason. NFL stars scheduled to 
do guest voice-overs include Emmitt Smith, Reggie White, Barry Sanders, Rocket 
Ismail and Steve Young. The program premieres at 10:30 a.m. on Oct. 29. Fox, 
which broadcasts NFL games on Sundays, said it hopes the show will both 
"entertain kids and help bring this exciting game to the attention of viewers."

MUSIC REVIEWS; VENTURA SYMPHONY OPENS WITH 'CONGA" 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under threat of unresolved contract negotiations, Saturday's season opener for 
the Ventura County Symphony at Oxnard Civic Auditorium was nearly the opener 
that wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there the players were, in full regalia, having hammered out an interim 
agreement, launching lustily into a sing-along national anthem, a local 
symphony ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, is that music to my ears," effused avuncular conductor Boris Brott, the 
maestro now in his third season in Ventura, from the stage. By concert's end, 
there was good cause for celebration. Mediation aside, it was an auspicious 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 In his time here, Brott has admirably polished up the orchestra while 
attempting in delicate ways to beat down the demon of provincial conservatism. 
It was that latter effort that yielded this concert's greatest reward, the 
premiere of Miguel del Aguila's riveting "Conga," which deftly -- and a bit 
deviously -- fuses Latin American pop and Western European concert-music 
sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Aguila -- Uruguayan-born, Oxnard-based but with a growing 
international reputation -- introduced a somewhat different chamber version of 
the work with the New Juilliard Ensemble in New York last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In this vivacious and urbane showpiece, a surging and percolating rhythmic 
pulse and orchestral machinations are centered around the nervously 
arpeggiating piano part, performed here by the composer. The work follows an 
increasingly mad dramatic arc as the orchestra swirls through melodic shards, 
odd meters, tart dissonances, manic modulations and a dizzy accelerando toward 
the finale. It's a thing of mad cross-cultural beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Retreating to safe and comparatively dull ground, pianist Oxana Yablonskaya 
brought requisite bravura and introspection to Rachmaninoff's "Rhapsody on a 
Theme of Paganini." 
</P>
<P>
 To close, Mussorgsky/Ravel's "Pictures at an Exhibition," a reliable test of 
an orchestra's mettle, came across boldly, alternately brooding, tender, 
martial and majestic. Brott's reading was mostly crisp and picturesque, if not 
picture-perfect, marred by a few notable gaffes from the soloists. JOSEF 
WOODARD

MUSIC REVIEWS; QUARTET SERVES A STEW FROM LATIN AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crucial difference between the Cuarteto Latinoamericano now and when first 
encountered a couple of seasons back is that its ever-present passion is today 
integral to the sort of polished ensemble that would allow for convincing 
interpretations of any repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to underline the point, the Mexican idiom so brilliantly evoked in their 
very different ways by Silvestre Revueltas and Mario Lavista, composers 
prominent on past Cuarteto programs, was superseded in the Sunday program at 
Schoenberg Hall on the UCLA campus by an attempt to display the cosmopolitanism 
of Latin American music. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't work in the opener, a pair of facelessly didactic "Sketches in 
Quarter-Tones" by Mexico's Julian Carillo, dating from the 1920s, when rigidly 
microtonal composing had its brief innings. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of the Cuarteto -- violinists Saul and Aron Bitran, violist Javier 
Montiel, cellist Alvaro Bitran (the Bitrans are brothers) -- are superbly 
equipped teachers, but their skills were more rewardingly employed elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Metro Chabanco," another Mexican, Javier Alvarez, has produced a witty, 
minimalist-inspired bit of urban motorism, counterbalanced on the second half 
of Sunday's program by the tingling edginess of the equally brief "Four for 
Tango" by Argentina's Astor Piazzolla. Both pieces were delivered with 
irresistible panache and alluring tone. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of two more extended works heard, "Yiddishbuk" (the title of a 
collection of Yiddish "pseudo-psalms" that survive in fragmentary form in 
notebooks of Franz Kafka, it seems to have said in the confusing program 
notes), is a gripping creation by the Argentine Osvaldo Golijov, and which 
might have been written anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Golijov's programmatic references are to Terezin, to Isaac Bashevis Singer and 
to Leonard Bernstein, while stylistic references suggest a wide variety of 
sources, none Latin American. 
</P>
<P>
 The "classic" offering on the program was Heitor Villa-Lobos' voluptuous, 
superbly crafted Eighth Quartet (1946), in which Brazilian folk idiom -- most 
clearly displayed in the carnival rhythms of the swirling Scherzo -- becomes 
part of a highly personal and sophisticated style. 
</P>
<P>
 Its performance by Cuarteto Latinoamericano was masterful: sonorous, 
rhythmically incisive, faultlessly balanced. HERBERT GLASS

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JOSE JOSE GETS A HERO'S WELCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Jose's Universal Amphitheatre concert on Sunday was an emotional affair. 
Not because of the music -- a selection of mild, old-fashioned romantic ballads 
-- but because of the singer's very presence.A little more than a year ago he 
was in a clinic for treatment of alcoholism, and rumors of his death even 
spread through the Latin pop world. 
</P>
<P>
 The near-capacity crowd gave the Mexican star a hero's welcome at Sunday's 
show, his first L.A. appearance in more than two years. The singer, 46, looked 
healthy and relaxed during the whole show. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by a six-piece band, Jose Jose made up for a dreadful version of "New 
York, New York" by concentrating on the old hits from his 31-year career. He 
also presented some songs from his latest album, "Grandeza mexicana" (Mexican 
Greatness), including a duet with his 18-year-old son Jose Sosa, who has just 
launched his own singing career.  
</P>
<P>
 Although his success is due more to his repertoire, his gentle personality and 
his passionate spirit than to his average, high-pitched voice, Jose Jose's 
magic is intact. He is back as a major representative of the old guard of Latin 
romantic singers. ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; STALLONE AND STONE DRAW IN THE FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite downbeat reviews and trailers that elicited laughter in theaters, the 
action film "The Specialist" rode on the draw of its two stars--Sylvester 
Stallone and Sharon Stone--to an opening weekend of $14.3 million--the biggest 
October opening ever. The total beats the $14.2-million record established only 
last year by "Demolition Man," in which Stallone starred with Wesley Snipes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Specialist" notwithstanding, the weekend total of $53.6 million was still 
down 14% from the comparable period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other major opening was the romantic comedy "Only You," starring 
Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr., which grossed an unimpressive $5.7 million.

GIANTS A BUST ON L.T.'S NIGHT; NFC: CELEBRATION SOURS WHEN THE GIANTS FIZZLE IN 
THE SECOND HALF AND LOSE TO THE VIKINGS, 27-10. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 L.T., phone home. You're desperately needed. 
</P>
<P>
 At least you were Monday night when the hometown team, the New York Giants, 
turned in such a clunker of a performance in losing to the Minnesota Vikings, 
27-10, that Giants Stadium seemed to contain more ushers than fans in the final 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually Lawrence Taylor, affectionately known as L.T. during a 13-year career 
in Giant blue, was back at Giants Stadium on Monday night with his jersey on 
for the first time this season. But unfortunately for the Giants, the man 
considered the greatest defensive player in team history was only there to 
retire that jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the game was over, Coach Dan Reeves must have felt like retiring a 
few more. With his players in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene seemed set for such a different finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half ended in a 10-10 tie, the Giants leaving the field on a high 
note. After Minnesota's Fuad Reviez and New York's David Treadwell exchanged 
field goals, Reviez's good from 44 yards out and Treadwell's from 22, the 
Vikings took the lead on a one-yard scoring run by Terry Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 1:27 to play before intermission and the ball on the Giants' six-yard 
line, New York quarterback Dave Brown snapped his team out of its lethargy with 
an impressive run down the field, completing six of seven passes to bring the 
Giants to the Vikings' three-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 On second down from there, Brown covered the remaining distance with a 
quarterback sneak, then joyously hurled the ball into the seats where the crowd 
of 77,294 was celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, out stepped Taylor for his tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 Back onto the field came the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a first down from the 37-yard line on New York's opening drive of the 
second half, Brown, intending a pass for Mike Sherrard, instead threw the ball 
behind his receiver and into the arms of defensive back Anthony Parker, who 
raced 44 yards untouched into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 And so were the Giants, who weren't heard from again the rest of the cold, 
windy night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew the big crowd would be emotional because of L.T.," said Minnesota 
quarterback Warren Moon. "We knew we had to take it away from them early. The 
interception to start the second half took the wind out of their sails." 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing short completions across the middle by Moon under the Giants' deep 
coverage with slashing, effective runs by Allen, Minnesota dominated the second 
half offensively and shut the Giants' offense down to improve to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon, looking as sharp as he ever did in his days with the Houston Oilers, 
completed 23 of 34 passes for 299 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Cris Carter came into the game as the NFL's leading receiver with 41 catches. 
But when the Giants double-covered him much of the night, Moon looked 
elsewhere, hitting Qadry Ismail seven times for 117 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter did manage to catch four for 50 yards. One of those completions went 
for a touchdown. Carter, who got one foot in the end zone before being shoved 
out by defensive back Tito Wooten, was given the six points when the officials 
ruled he had been forced out. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviez closed out the scoring with a 24-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants (3-2) came into the game with the 26th-rated defense in the 28-team 
league and they did nothing to improve their standing, giving up 395 total 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reeves wasn't about to point the finger at any particular phase of play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got beat," he said. "We got beat good. They beat us in almost every phase 
you can think of, as far as coaching, playing and execution." 
</P>
<P>
 Any chance the Giants might have had disappeared along with their running 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hoped that Rodney Hampton, back after missing two games because of a 
kidney bruise, would supply the legs to balance Brown's arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Hampton managed only 27 yards on the ground and averaged 2.1 per 
carry. And the rest of the Giant rushing attack consisted of only 10 additional 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an emotional halftime thanks to Taylor. It wasn't the same after he 
left the field, which is what some people have been saying about the Giants all 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Taylor, the second-leading sacker in league history with 132.5, 
trails only the Green Bay Packers' Reggie White in that department. Taylor, the 
eighth Giant to have his uniform retired, told the crowd, "Without you fans, 
there would have been a Lawrence Taylor, but there wouldn't have been an L.T."

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ALLAN MALAMUD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember all those wild-scoring NFL games the first couple of weeks of the 
season? . . . The average point total for the 12 games played Sunday and Monday 
was a fraction less than 35. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, it is time to install some new rules that favor the offense. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Allow defensive players to make only eye contact with quarterbacks. Extend the 
end zones by 10 yards even if that means the second row of seats at some 
stadiums. Stop the clock after every completed pass. Give the Arizona Cardinals 
five downs instead of four. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What is the most difficult single-game record to break in the NFL book? Fred 
Dryer's two safeties, made by the Ram defensive end against the Green Bay 
Packers on Oct. 21, 1973, at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 As for these Rams, the reason they get outscored in the second half almost 
every week might be that the opposition gets a wake-up call after taking them 
too lightly. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Or, it could be that defenses come to the conclusion that if you stop Jerome 
Bettis, you've stopped the Rams. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Williams showed some moves and speed on those rare occasions when the 
Raiders opened holes for him Sunday in Foxboro, Mass. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But you wonder why the offensive line that protected Jeff Hostetler well 
against New England continues to have trouble on running plays. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Even Emmitt Smith might not be effective behind these guys. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 NFL officials are more intrusive than ever. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Seahawks don't enjoy the same home-field advantage at Husky 
Stadium that they had at the Kingdome. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs will try to break their two-game losing streak against California 
teams on Nov. 6 against the Raiders in Kansas City. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Who needs Mike Ditka when the Chicago Bears' Dave Wannstedt is doing one of 
the best coaching jobs in the league? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: San Diego Charger quarterback Stan Humphries and golfer Mark 
O'Meara. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Athlon magazine must be the only publication to pick UCLA to win the national 
basketball title in a year when defending champion Arkansas has all its 
starters back. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The same magazine selects all-time teams for each school, regardless of 
position. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Bruin team consists of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Walton, Sidney Wicks, 
David Greenwood and Pooh Richardson. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nothing against Greenwood and Richardson, both outstanding players, but how 
could they possibly be chosen over Marques Johnson, Walt Hazzard and Gail 
Goodrich? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I can't find fault with the USC team: Bill Sharman, Harold Miner, Gus 
Williams, Paul Westphal and John Rudometkin. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 All-North Carolina: Michael Jordan, James Worthy, Sam Perkins, Phil Ford, 
Lennie Rosenbluth. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 All-Duke: Christian Laettner, Mike Giminski, Bobby Hurley, Grant Hill, Art 
Heyman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 All-Indiana: Scott May, Kurt Benson, Steve Alford, Calbert Cheaney, Don 
Schlundt. No Isiah Thomas, who deserves to be named despite having played only 
two years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 All-Kansas: Wilt Chamberlain, Clyde Lovellette, Danny Manning, Jo Jo White, 
Darnell Valentine. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The first John R. Wooden Classic -- matching UCLA- Kentucky and Kansas- 
Massachusetts on Dec. 3 at The Pond of Anaheim -- will be telecast live to 32 
countries by the NBC Super Channel. . . . Some nerve of Anfernee Hardaway, 
demanding that he become the highest-paid player on the Orlando Magic. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A slightly more valuable teammate, Shaquille O'Neal, is the one who suggested 
the Magic trade for Hardaway's draft rights after the two became friends during 
the filming of "Blue Chips." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was no surprise the Indiana Pacers signed John Williams. Coach Larry Brown 
always has liked the big fella. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a UCLA-USC doubleheader Wednesday in Westwood, the women's 
soccer teams playing at 1 p.m. at the North Soccer Field and the women's 
volleyball teams at 4 p.m. at Pauley Pavilion. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Best Seven bet is a misnomer. None of the races on Breeders' Cup preview 
day at Belmont on Saturday were included in the wager that has been a flop 
nationwide. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas is known to be bullish on his horses, but I'd never heard him 
mention another of his fillies in the same breath with Landaluce until unbeaten 
2-year-old Flanders won the Frizette Stakes by 21 1/2 lengths. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Lukas, who is on a tear again, probably will have nine starters on Breeders' 
Cup Day Nov. 5 at Churchill Downs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 New Dodger organization catching instructor Mike Scioscia will earn his pay if 
he only teaches how to block the plate.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; MCDANIEL ON A PACE TO BREAK RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After Sunday's three-interception, one-touchdown performance, Terry McDaniel 
has moved up to a class by himself among the league's top cornerbacks. Consider 
that he caught more passes (three) than Tim Brown (two) did against the 
Patriots and has scored more touchdowns (three) than Brown (two) has all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry McDaniel is playing on another level," Coach Art Shell said. "Nobody in 
the league is playing better than Terry McDaniel." 
</P>
<P>
 After making the Pro Bowl the last two seasons, McDaniel has taken his play to 
a higher level. Is there a reason behind McDaniel's play this season? 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry's always been a religious person, but during the summer he was baptized 
and I've noticed a change," said McDaniel's wife, Janna. "It's hard to 
describe. It's like a good, happy newness to him. He's the same person, but 
there's something different." 
</P>
<P>
 With two interception returns for touchdowns, McDaniel already has tied the 
team record for most in a season and at this pace, he could threaten Lester 
Hayes' team record of 13 interceptions in one season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the league deadline for trades, but although the Raiders do not 
expect to make any last-minute moves, Shell did not rule any out Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know," he said. "You can't anticipate things, but there is always a 
possibility of something happening." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the Raiders lost to San Diego, quarterback Jeff Hostetler complained 
about the lack of roughing-the-passer penalties he has received over the last 
two seasons. In the fourth quarter Sunday, New England linebacker Willie 
McGinest, a rookie from USC, was flagged for roughing Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a good call because the guy did strike Jeff in the head after the 
throw," said Shell, who acknowledged that the Raiders had talked to officials 
about late hits on Hostetler. LONNIE WHITE

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; INJURED SLATER, BROSTEK ARE SIDELINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' struggling offensive line suffered two major losses in Sunday's 
24-17 defeat at Green Bay -- right tackle Jackie Slater and center Bern 
Brostek. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater is expected to sit out three weeks because of a slight tear in his 
triceps muscle, and Brostek will be sidelined two to four weeks because of a 
small broken bone in his right leg and a sprained right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gandy is expected to take over as the starting right tackle. Left guard 
Tom Newberry will move to center in place of Brostek, and second-year player 
Chuck Belin is expected to become the starting left guard. 
</P>
<P>
 With the loss of Slater and Brostek, Coach Chuck Knox said the Rams plan to 
work out some free agents this week in hopes of adding depth to the thin 
offensive line, which has struggled in the team's 2-4 start. 
</P>
<P>
 To sign an offensive lineman, the Rams will have to cut a player. With 
quarterback Chris Chandler's sprained left ankle showing improvement, backup 
Jamie Martin, re-signed as an emergency quarterback, could be expendable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams would like to re-sign offensive lineman Jeff Pahukoa, who can play 
guard or tackle, but can't because Pahukoa's contract was guaranteed when the 
team cut him before the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also are in the market for a punter to replace Sean Landeta, who is 
expected to be sidelined two weeks because of a shoulder injury. Tony Zendejas 
is the team's backup punter, but Knox said the team might bring in a free-agent 
punter for a workout as soon as today. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Sean Gilbert took shots in both of his sore shoulders, Knox 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Slater said he suffered his triceps injury while making a block on the 
next-to-last play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brostek was on crutches Monday at Rams Park and said the ankle sprain, not the 
broken bone, is what is going to keep him from playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctors said the fracture isn't the problem -- that should heal in a 
couple of weeks," he said. "The sprained ankle will keep me out longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Brostek suffered sprained ankles in the Rams' 8-5 loss to Atlanta two weeks 
ago, then the right one was re-sprained on the final play of the third quarter 
at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Brostek said he wasn't taking a risk by playing on a tender ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's my job to play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Leigh Steinberg, one of the leaders of Save the Rams, was frustrated 
after a meeting with Rams officials didn't produce the serious response the 
group is seeking for its proposal to keep the team in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy meeting with Ram President John Shaw, Steinberg said the 
Orange County group did not receive a "wish list" from the Rams, similar to the 
one the team had sent to St. Louis officials who are trying to lure an NFL team 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That aspect was pretty frustrating and that was a point we made today," 
Steinberg said. "It was difficult to continue constructing offers unless we 
understood what it ultimately takes to keep the Rams here. 
</P>
<P>
 "They asked a series of questions about different financial aspects about what 
we are proposing, some which will take a little more work." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the team wasn't close to making any deals before the trading 
deadline. . . . The Rams and the Arizona Cardinals are the only teams that have 
not scored at least 20 points in a game this season. MIKE REILLEY

 Joe Montana skipped the Kansas City Chiefs' extended workout to have his 
injured hip examined, and starting nose tackle Dan Saleaumua and starting tight 
end Keith Cash also sat out in the sore-muscled aftermath of a 20-6 loss to the 
San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shoulder is sore," Coach Marty Schottenheimer said of Montana."The hip is 
black and blue." 
</P>
<P>
 Schottenheimer added that he expects Montana to be ready for Kansas City's 
game at Denver next Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, the Chiefs signed wide receiver Eric Martin to a two-year 
contract. Martin, who played the New Orleans Saints for nine seasons, is the 
team's career leader in receptions with 532, receiving yards with 7,854 and 
receiving touchdowns with 48. He replaces Michael Young, who was placed on 
injured reserve Monday.

 New York Jets quarterback Boomer Esiason is expected to start against the New 
England Patriots, but his sore ankle still isn't strong enough to withstand an 
entire week of practice. He will work sparingly this week. . . . Arizona 
Cardinal Coach Buddy Ryan said he lined up a half-dozen unemployed kickers to 
audition today for the team, which will be without Greg Davis, sidelined 
because of a pulled left hamstring. Among them is Roger Ruzek, who held the job 
when Ryan was coaching the Philadelphia Eagles. "We've got everybody who ever 
took a deep breath and tried to kick it through," Ryan joked. . . . Cleveland 
Brown tight end Walter Reeves had back surgery and will be sidelined for the 
season. Reeves is the second starter within a week to undergo surgery. One week 
ago, fullback Tommy Vardell was put on injured reserve after a torn tendon and 
a torn ligament were repaired.

 Colorado State receiver Paul Turner will sit out four to six weeks because of 
two broken ribs and vertebra damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, who entered No. 13 Colorado State's game against Arizona as the team's 
leading receiver, remained hospitalized in Tucson on Sunday -- the day after 
the Rams' 21-16 victory over the 14th-ranked Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner was hurt in the third quarter when Arizona safety Tony Bouie tackled 
him after a reception. 
</P>
<P>
 The status of another Colorado State starter, linebacker Kenya Ragsdale, is 
listed as day-to-day because of a severe chin bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Texas quarterback Shea Morenz, who sat out last week's 17-10 victory over 
Oklahoma because of strained ligaments in his left knee, is expected to work 
out this week and, if ready, will start against Rice on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 James Brown, a redshirt freshman, completed 17 of 22 passes for 148 yards and 
a touchdown and scrambled for 30 yards, including a nine-yard score, against 
Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Mackovic said wide receiver Mike Adams, who suffered strained 
ligaments in his right knee against Texas Christian, is questionable for 
Sunday's game. Adams, who was suspended from the season opener for violating 
NCAA rules by accepting the free use of a rental car, sat out the Colorado and 
Oklahoma games because of the knee injury. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange Bowl Committee members trying to keep their game from moving to Joe 
Robbie Stadium say the switch could harm the event, the city of Miami and even 
the Miami Hurricanes' football program. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters counter they have no choice but to approve the move beginning with 
the 1997 game. The decisive vote might come today. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two conference commissioners in the alliance have said they want the 
game moved to eliminate a possible home-field advantage for Miami in a national 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska quarterback Brook Berringer, who sat out the second half last 
Saturday because of a partially collapsed left lung, went through a limited 
practice, but it will be Thursday or Friday before it is decided if he will 
play at Kansas State this weekend, Coach Tom Osborne said. . . . Alabama 
quarterback Jay Barker said his bruised right shoulder is feeling better, but 
he still is not sure if he will be able to start this weekend against 
Tennessee. An MRI showed no major damage. Meanwhile, Tennessee officials are 
warning fans planning to attend the game to be aware of counterfeit tickets. . 
. . Colorado coach Bill McCartney suspended backup free safety T.J. Cunningham 
for the fourth-ranked Buffaloes' game Saturday against No. 22 Oklahoma. 
McCartney said Cunningham was suspended for breaking a team rule. . . . 
Offensive tackle DeMario Vaughn and defensive tackle Shawn Swayda, both 
suffering from sprained right knees, will sit out Arizona State's game against 
ninth-ranked Washington on Saturday.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; SERMONS' RUNNING IMPRESSES ROBINSON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson expressed delight Monday at the running of freshman 
tailback Rodney Sermons against Oregon State, predicting that the best is yet 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Sermons, pressed into service at Corvallis when starter Shawn Walters awakened 
with flu Saturday, gained 74 yards in 23 carries with a touchdown, a long gain 
of 12 yards and no fumbles. He also scored on a 31-yard screen pass from 
quarterback Brad Otton. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very efficient and made some clutch plays, and he will run a lot 
better too," Robinson said. "Sermons hits the hole very fast and has great 
acceleration. We haven't seen that yet to the degree we will." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Oregon State's freshman quarterback, Tim Alexander, was sidelined for the 
season Saturday on a drive in which the Beavers seemed ready to catch the 
Trojans. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander, a speedster who ran a wishbone high school offense in Florida, had 
turned down offers from Nebraska and Oklahoma to attend Oregon State. Saturday 
was his first action of the season, replacing injured Don Shanklin.  
</P>
<P>
 With USC leading by what would be the final score, 27-19, Alexander accounted 
for 46 yards in a 66-yard fourth-quarter drive, 31 on a run to the USC 14, 
where his season ended. He suffered a broken collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahim Muhammad came in for Alexander, but fumbled the ball away three plays 
later at USC's seven. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, USC's opponent Saturday in Palo Alto, is 1-3-1, but the Cardinal 
leads the Pac-10 in total offense and quarterback Steve Stenstrom and USC's Rob 
Johnson, high school teammates at El Toro, are 1-2 in total offense, 300 yards 
per game for Stenstrom, 209 for Johnson. Stenstrom, with one more game played 
and 72 more attempts, has completed 67% of his passes, Johnson 68%. . . . Wide 
receiver Keyshawn Johnson has come on with a rush, with 12 receptions for 231 
yards the last two games. . . . USC's John Stonehouse leads the conference in 
punting, averaging 42.8 yards. EARL GUSTKEY

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: HIGHS & LOWS THE HALFWAYINT OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A look at the winners and losers at the halfway point of the football season: 
</P>
<P>
 The contenders for No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 1. La Puente Bishop Amat -- A coaching change has had little effect on the 
talented Lancers, who showed their strength by routing highly regarded 
Bakersfield on the road Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Los Alamitos -- The Griffins have the area's best passing game and the 
return of quarterback Kevin Feterik last week made it even stronger. Any 
opponent with a shaky secondary is in for a long night. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Santa Ana Mater Dei -- Depth is a plus for the Monarchs, who have shown 
power on both sides of the ball. Lack of speed is a concern, but a favorable 
schedule should ease the road to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bubble -- Long Beach Poly: A weak league won't help in preparation for 
the playoffs. Newhall Hart: Being in the Southern Section's Division II hurts 
the Indians' chances at finishing No. 1. Loyola or Santa Fe Springs St. Paul: 
The winner of their game will battle Bishop Amat for the Del Rey League title 
and the top spot in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Teams that were expected to contend for No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Rialto Eisenhower -- Heavy graduation losses and the opening of nearby 
Rialto High have taken a toll on the Eagles, who were 14-0 last season but are 
1-4 this year. They are coming off a 31-0 loss to Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Pasadena Muir -- Bizarre coaching changes continue to plague a program with 
many of the area's top college prospects. Mike Harrison was named interim coach 
last week, the school's eighth coach in the past seven years. The Mustangs are 
3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Carson -- City Section football is down again this season. The Colts might 
defend their Division 4-A title, but they were 0-3 in intersectional 
competition, and suffered lopsided losses to Bishop Amat and San Diego Morse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest turnarounds. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Bloomington -- In an area that has been dominated in football by Eisenhower 
and Fontana, tiny Bloomington is stealing some of the spotlight. The Bruins, 
1-9 last season, are 5-0 and the favorite in the Southern Section's Division 
VIII. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Huntington Beach Marina -- The Vikings are 5-0 for the first time since 
1981. They usually struggle in the Sunset League, rarely finishing above .500. 
But they should make the playoffs this year. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Arcadia -- For the last decade, Muir has been the favorite in the Pacific 
League. Suddenly, the Apaches are the top contender with a 5-0 record. Not bad 
for a team that had won only seven games in the previous two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The top coaching jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Don Markham, Bloomington -- He is not winning many friends by running up 
the score, but Markham is working miracles in his first season at Bloomington. 
The Bruins have outscored their opponents, 352-46. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Marijon Ancich, St. Paul -- In the second season of his second stint at St. 
Paul, Ancich has the team in contention for a league title for the first time 
since the early 1980s. The Swordsmen are also playing before capacity crowds at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Gilbert Ruedaflores, Alhambra -- Patience in rebuilding a program has paid 
off for Ruedaflores, who is in his sixth season. The Moors are a surprising 5-0 
after years of mediocrity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches on the hot seat. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Bill Denny, Mission Viejo -- Denny is in only his first season, but a 
boisterous community is not happy about the team's 1-4 start. A program that 
was on top in the 1980s continues to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Dean Bennett, San Dimas -- The move to the Valle Vista League has been hard 
on the Saints, who are 1-14 the last two seasons. Bennett has also had to play 
second fiddle to the basketball program, which has not made his job any easier. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Ed Paculba, Wilmington Banning -- If the Pilots don't advance far in the 
playoffs, Paculba will probably step down. Expectations are high at the school 
and the team has not been living up to them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early top candidates for player of the year: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Daylon McCutcheon, Bishop Amat -- The converted wide receiver is exceeding 
all expectations as a running back. He has gained 918 yards in five games and 
is averaging more than 10 yards a carry. He leads the Lancers with 16 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Reuben Droughns, Anaheim -- The junior running back has the Colonists off 
to a rare 5-0 start. He has gained 805 yards in 123 carries and scored 10 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Rob Toler, Long Beach Poly -- The three-year starting quarterback has been 
the team leader for the undefeated Jackrabbits. Despite having lost 36 players 
from last season, Poly is back on top, thanks in large part to the versatile 
Toler. 
</P>
<P>
 Still in the running -- Billy Miller, wide receiver, Westlake; Greg Marquez, 
quarterback, Sylmar, and Kory Minor, defensive lineman, Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Ignacio Brache of Sun Valley Village Christian tied a state record with five 
field goals in a 29-14 victory over Southern California Christian of Orange 
last Friday. Brache's record performance included field goals of 55 and 56 
yards. Six other players have kicked five field goals in a game. Times' Top 20

OAK TREE AT SANTA ANITA; HOLLYWOOD WILDCAT WINS LADY'S SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though the Breeders' Cup Distaff will be the toughest race of the day to 
win, trainer Neil Drysdale acts as though he can't wait to get to Churchill 
Downs with Hollywood Wildcat, the filly who won the stake a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Running out front, an unusual spot for the 4-year-old, Hollywood Wildcat beat 
Exchange by 2 1/4 lengths Monday in the $106,400 Lady's Secret Handicap at 
Santa Anita, and Drysdale plans to have her on a plane Wednesday for Kentucky, 
where the 11th Breeders' Cup will be run Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Churchill Downs is a track that you should train (a horse) over before a 
race," Drysdale said. "That's according to Charlie (Whittingham). And Charlie 
does well there." 
</P>
<P>
 Before launching his own career 20 years ago, Drysdale worked as an assistant 
for Whittingham, who won the Kentucky Derby with Ferdinand and Sunday Silence 
in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-million Distaff is expected to include Sky Beauty, Heavenly Prize and 
Lakeway, and Phone Chatter is also a possibility, depending on how she performs 
Sunday in the Spinster at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat didn't get back to the races this year until mid-June. After 
finishing third in the La Canada at Santa Anita, Drysdale put her on grass, 
where she won the Gamely Handicap and finished second in the Beverly Hills 
Handicap, both at Hollywood Park. She then ran second again, behind Flawlessly, 
the champion turf mare, in the Ramona Handicap at Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat was back on dirt Monday, winning the same race that served 
as her Breeders' Cup prep last year and finishing 1 1/16 miles in a fast 1:40 
3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridden by Eddie Delahoussaye, Hollywood Wildcat paid $3.40 after carrying 124 
pounds, three more than Exchange. She scored her 11th victory in 19 starts and 
the $61,400 purse boosted her total to almost $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliza was expected to be the pace-setter, but she broke slowly and was 
squeezed by Pub River and Hollywood Wildcat from both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neil told me to make sure I don't get trapped," Delahoussaye said. "So I told 
Neil that we could let her break and see what happens. She broke kind of 
flat-footed, and I tapped her on the shoulder and got her running. All of a 
sudden, I'm on the lead. I thought, 'Where's Eliza? Where are the other ones?' 
She's on the lead easy, and I'm thinking, 'This is beautiful.' I knew that we 
were going slow, and that she was right. I didn't care who came to her, they 
weren't going to beat her. She showed it today." 
</P>
<P>
 Eliza was outside Hollywood Wildcat and Exchange leaving the turn, and seemed 
in a position to overhaul the leaders, but she flattened out and finished last 
in the five-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going around the turn, I thought I might have a chance to catch (Hollywood 
Wildcat)," said Laffit Pincay Jr., who rode Exchange. "(Eliza) was running with 
me, and I wish she would have stayed up there. When that horse dropped back, my 
mare stopped running again." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Spawr, who trains Exchange, said the 6-year-old mare will probably run in 
the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Exchange has 13 victories, seven seconds and three 
thirds in 26 races and has earned more than $900,000. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Valenzuela, who has sat out the last four days of riding -- three at Santa 
Anita and one at Belmont Park -- asked to be given mounts for Thursday's card, 
but the stewards told him he must come in for an interview before they will 
allow him to return. Valenzuela, who has twice been suspended because of 
drug-related incidents, told the Belmont stewards Saturday that he was 
suffering from food poisoning and told the Santa Anita stewards that he 
couldn't ride Sunday because he had missed his plane out of New York. Chris 
Antley replaced him on Eliza in the Lady's Secret. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani rode three winners Monday, giving him 14 in the first six days 
of the Oak Tree meeting. Alex Solis is in second place with seven. Nakatani won 
the Del Mar title with 51 victories, 12 more than runner-up Gary Stevens. . . . 
Apprentice Geoffrey Cooper, 16, won his first race at Santa Anita and was 
showered with tabasco sauce and raw eggs by his fellow riders when he returned 
to the jockeys' room.

 Stocks ended higher in light holiday trading Monday as investors seemed to 
shift their attention from inflation and interest rates worries to 
third-quarter corporate earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.89 points to 3,821.32, the biggest 
one-day rally since Sept. 15. In the broad market, winners topped losers by 2 
to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts noted that trading was light as the Columbus Day holiday kept 
many investors away. Big Board volume was a mere 213 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In energy futures trading, meanwhile, oil prices fell after Iraq appeared to 
have defused tensions in the Middle East by telling the United Nations it was 
withdrawing troops from its southern border with Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Mercantile Exchange, November crude oil futures eased 27 cents 
to $17.99 a barrel after retreating from a high of $18.63 reached early in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil was boosted in the morning as the weekend buildup of Iraqi forces prompted 
Kuwait's western allies to send tens of thousands of soldiers to help protect 
the oil-rich Persian Gulf emirate. 
</P>
<P>
 But as trading wore on, "the market was fairly sure that Iraq was just saber 
rattling," one London oil trader said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, buyers took the opportunity to get the upper hand with 
the "cash" bond market mostly shut down for the holiday. In bond futures 
trading, yields were slightly lower. The 30-year Treasury bond yield had closed 
at 7.90% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks sensitive to the economy -- such as auto, paper and technology issues 
-- were in demand Monday. Many of those stocks had been beaten down in recent 
weeks as investors worried that the Federal Reserve Board would soon raise 
short-term interest rates again to cool the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, however, the government's report on September job creation showed 
solid gains in employment but little wage inflation, suggesting that the Fed 
might not be inclined to move again. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimism about rates allowed investors to focus on the prospect of good 
quarterly earnings reports, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market is expecting solid third-quarter results, said Alfred 
Goldman, director of technical market analysis with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. 
Corporate reporting begins in earnest this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Though volume was thin, the rally was broad, traders noted. The Standard & 
Poor's 500 index, for example, rose 3.94 points to 459.04 and the Nasdaq 
composite index surged 6.85 points to 756.81. Winners topped losers by 15 to 11 
on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were hot, led by depressed semiconductor issues. Texas 
Instruments jumped 2 3/4 to 68 3/8, Micron Technology gained 1 7/8 to 35 1/8 
and Motorola leaped 2 to 52 3/4. After the market closed, Motorola reported 
better-than-expected quarterly earnings of 65 cents a share, up from 48 cents a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel, which unveiled a Pentium chip for notebook computers, gained 1 to 60 
7/16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elsewhere in the tech sector, Autodesk surged 2 7/8 to 66 7/8, Digital 
Equipment jumped 1 3/4 to 27 7/8, Hewlett-Packard soared 3 to 91 1/4, Dell 
gained 1 1/4 to 39 3/4 and Apple jumped 1 7/8 to 38 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many telecom issues were also strong. DSC Communications surged 1 5/8 to 30 
5/8, Nextel Communications leaped 1 5/8 to 20 3/4 and Tellabs jumped 2 1/2 to 
47 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scott Paper rocketed 3 1/4 to 64 3/4 on news that it is selling its S.D. 
Warren Co. unit to an investment group headed by a South African pulp and paper 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other paper producers rallying included International Paper, up 2 1/4 to 77 
7/8, and Georgia-Pacific, up 2 1/8 to 75 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks, recently trading near 1994 lows, rebounded in anticipation of 
strong third-quarter earnings. General Motors rose 1 5/8 to 45 1/2, Chrysler 
gained 1 1/4 to 45 7/8 and Ford was up 1 to 28 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other transportation issues gained as well. The Dow transports index jumped 
17.70 points to 1,462.48. Winners included United Airlines parent UAL, up 2 to 
85 7/8; Conrail, up 7/8 to 49 1/8, and American President, up 1 1/8 to 26 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Frankfurt's DAX-30 index zoomed 64.20 points, or 3.3%, to close at 
2,024.79 on optimism about the ruling party's prospects in this week's 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE 100 index rebounded 33.6 points to 3,032.2. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tokyo market was closed for Japan's Sports Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the downside, Mexico City's Bolsa index slumped 28.16 points to 2,621.63, 
hurt by a plunge in shares of Grupo Televisa. In U.S. trading, Televisa dropped 
7 1/4 to 47 3/8 after brokerage Goldman Sachs cut earnings estimates for the 
company, citing slowing sales of advertising time. 
</P>

 At the same time, gold fell 20 cents to $390.70 an ounce on the New York 
Comex.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS CLOSE UP 23.89 IN LIGHT TRADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks ended higher in light holiday trading Monday as investors shifted their 
attention from inflation and interest rates to upcoming third-quarter earnings 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks sensitive to the economic cycles, such as autos, papers and technology 
led the market higher as investors bet profit reports from those areas would be 
among the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 23.89 points to 3,821.32, while in the 
broader market, rising issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Columbus Day holiday held down Big Board volume to a relatively light 
213.21 million shares, down from 285.58 million on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, oil prices fell after Iraq appeared to have defused tensions 
in the Middle East by telling the United Nations it was withdrawing troops from 
its southern border with Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Merc, November crude oil futures closed 27 cents lower at 
$17.99 a barrel after retreating from a high of $18.63 reached early in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices climbed initially as a weekend build-up of Iraqi forces prompted 
Kuwait's western allies to send tens of thousands of soldiers to help protect 
the oil-rich Gulf emirate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market was fairly sure that Iraq was just saber rattling. This appears to 
be confirmation," an oil trader in London said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks spent the day solidly higher, partly in a carry over from Friday's 
strong showing by the equity and bond markets. That came despite an upbeat 
September employment report and broke a three-day losing streak for the Dow 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's jobs report showed solid gains in employment but little wage 
inflation, allowing investors to focus on the prospect of good earnings without 
worrying about an immediate interest rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors worry that the Federal Reserve will feel compelled to raise rates 
for a sixth time this year in an effort to dampen growth and forestall 
inflation. Stock investors don't like rate increases, which mean companies pay 
more for money and make shares less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that the threat of inflation and higher rates is receding, investors can 
look to earnings," said David Holt, director of technical research at Wedbush 
Morgan Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market is expecting solid third-quarter results, said Alfred 
Goldman, director of technical market analysis, with A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. 
in St. Louis. Corporate reporting begins in earnest next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the rally also was propelled by bargain hunting following last 
week's setback of 46 points in the Dow Jones index, which has been fed by the 
interest-rate jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market's having a technical rebound after the decline of the last two 
weeks," said Bob Dickey, technical analyst at Dain Bosworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, prices of Treasury bond futures rose in light, abbreviated trading, 
strengthened by signs of a possible easing of tensions in the Persian Gulf that 
eased oil prices and soothed concerns among traders about possible inflation 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the 30-year bond for December delivery rose 7/32 of a point in 
futures trading, which ended at 1 p.m. Eastern time. The more widely followed 
U.S. cash market -- bonds immediately available -- was closed in observance of 
the Columbus Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Semiconductor stocks were helped by favorable analysts' comments. Micron 
Technology Inc. jumped 1 7/8 to 35 1/8, boosted by upgrades from Goldman Sachs 
and SoundView Financial Group. Texas Instruments Inc., also upgraded by 
SoundView, rose 2 3/4 to 68 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel Corp., which unveiled a Pentium chip for notebook computers, gained 1 
to 60 7/16. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong showing by technology stocks meant the smaller capitalization 
Nasdaq index, which is heavily weighted in such issues, put in the best 
performance of the major market indexes, rallying 6.85 to 756.81. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scott Paper rose 3 1/4 to 64 3/4 on news that it was selling its S.D. Warren 
Co. unit to an investment group headed by a South African pulp and paper 
producer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other paper producers rallied including International Paper Co., up 2 1/4 to 
77 7/8, and Georgia-Pacific Corp., up 2 1/8 to 75 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Grupo Televisa tumbled 7 1/4 to 47 3/8 after Goldman Sachs cut earnings 
estimates for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors concentrated on the recently struggling auto stocks. General 
Motors Corp. rose 1 5/8 to 45 1/2, Chrysler Corp. gained 1 1/4 to 45 7/8 and 
Ford Motor Corp. was up 1 to 28 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer rose 1 7/8 to 38 7/8 on Nasdaq on reports that it may sell a 
stake to International Business Machines Corp. as part of a broader technology 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were mixed overseas. The German DAX-30 share average shot up up 64.20 
points, or 3.27% to close at 2,024.79. London's Financial Times 100-share 
average closed at 3,032.2, up 33.6 points. The Tokyo Stock Exchange was closed 
for Japan's Sports Day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mexico City's Bolsa index fell 28.16 points to close at 2621.63. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed at 100.35 Japanese yen and 1.545 German marks, down from 
100.67 yen and 1.547 marks respectively on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, gold fell 20 cents to $390.70 an ounce on the New York 
Comex.

 Rides: Struggling Iwerks Entertainment, maker of ride-simulation theaters for 
such places as shopping malls and fairs, said it signed ride-simulation and 
theater projects in Asia valued at $5.7 million. The projects will be built in 
South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines, Thailand and Japan.The company said more 
than 70% of the projects involve ride simulators, which will bring the number 
of its theaters to 65 worldwide. The announcement follows last week's 
disclosure that three directors, including former Major League Baseball 
Commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth, resigned as directors to devote time to other 
interests. The company lost $8 million in the year ended June 30 and has seen 
its stock fall from nearly $40 a share to less than $5.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Mormon feminist who wrote that God has a woman as an equal partner in heaven 
faces ecclesiastical discipline. Janice Allred, who could be excommunicated at 
a disciplinary hearing Wednesday before her local church board, believes an 
essay she wrote in an independent journal is to blame.In the essay, published 
in the journal Dialogue, she said that there is a "heavenly mother" who is 
God's equal partner in heaven. Church leaders have said that while the 
existence of a heavenly mother is a logical and reasonable doctrine, the church 
has not said whether she is God's equal. One of the standards defined by the 
9-million-member church's all-male hierarchy is strict obedience to a 
prohibition on public contradiction or criticism of the leadership. Of the 
disciplinary hearing, Allred said: "I don't see it simply as an issue of being 
able to publish one article. It's an issue of freedom to speak and write."

MCINTYRE FARIES; HELPED PRESERVE OLVERA STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 McIntyre Faries, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge who worked for 
preservation of historic Olvera Street, has died. He was 98. 
</P>
<P>
 Faries, who served on the bench from 1953 until 1966, died Sept. 29 in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Active in Republican politics, Faries was appointed three times by Gov. Earl 
Warren as Republican committeeman for California and was considered a major 
contender for the party's national chairmanship in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Faries became interested in Olvera Street when he served on the California 
State Park and Recreation Commission. He worked with Christine Sterling, 
Concita Pignatelli and Hernando Courtright to create Los Amigos del Pueblo Inc. 
and preserve the area in Downtown Los Angeles as a state historical monument. 
In 1970, Faries was honored as El Gran Hidalgo de Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also board chairman of the Sixth Agricultural District, which formed 
the commission to operate the Coliseum and build the Sports Pavilion in 
Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in China, the son of a missionary physician, Faries grew up in California 
and graduated from Occidental College. The future judge served as a Navy ensign 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Faries studied law in the office of his brother, David, and later worked for 
the Los Angeles County counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 His autobiography, "Rememb'ring, One Man's Journey," was published last year 
by Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice widowed, Faries is survived by two daughters, Barbara Lois Simpson and 
Marjorie Anne Gaines, five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

NOLA LUXFORD; FILM ACTRESS, RADIO FIGURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nola Luxford, former film actress and radio announcer known as "Miss Anzac of 
the U.S.A." during World War II, has died in Pasadena. She was in her 90s but 
did not like revealing her actual age. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of New Zealand, Miss Luxford began her career at Universal Studios in 
1925. Among her films were "Girl Shy" with Harold Lloyd, "A Successful 
Calamity," "Kind Lady" and "Sylvia Scarlett." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1932, she broadcasted reports on the Olympics over Los Angeles radio 
station KFI, which were heard as far away as the South Pacific. In 1936, she 
moved to New York to join NBC's Four Star News. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset of World War II, Miss Luxford formed an Anzac (the acronym 
stands for Australia-New Zealand Army Corps) Club and made shortwave broadcasts 
of soldiers' personal messages to relatives in New Zealand. She also helped 
create the memorial Anzac Gardens on the roof of New York's Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Luxford's wartime efforts earned her the Order of the British Empire from 
King George VI and the U.S. Award of Merit from President Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, Miss Luxford wrote children's stories, including "Kerry 
Kangaroo." 
</P>
<P>
 Married to KFI station manager Glen Dolberg in 1958, she spent her last 
decades in La Canada Flintridge, where she was active in the La Canada Valley 
Beautiful Cub, the Garden Club and Keep America Beautiful. Glenola Park there 
is named in the couple's honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Luxford was named Woman of the Year in 1963 by the Town and Country Fine 
Arts Club for her efforts to promote international understanding and 
humanitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by five nieces and one nephew.

DANNY GATTON; GUITARIST WITH ECLECTIC STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Danny Gatton, who long held a reputation among musicians and in the music 
press as "the world's greatest unknown guitarist," has died of an apparently 
self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was 49. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatton died Oct. 4 at his home in southern Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 The guitarist gained national recognition with a 1991 Grammy award nomination 
for best rock instrumental performance for the album "88 Elmira Street," but 
for most of his career languished in relative obscurity. A legend in the 
Washington, D.C., area for the past 20 years, he was reluctant to leave his 
family for the road. He is survived by his wife, Jan, and daughter, Holly, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatton recently released an album called "Relentless." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was making a decent living for a change," said Dixie Eastridge, a friend 
and president of his current label, Big Mo Records. "He must have had other 
things troubling him." 
</P>
<P>
 She said friends and band mates said they had had no cause to be alarmed about 
his frame of mind. "He was a moody guy, but not excessively so." 
</P>
<P>
 Gatton resented being pigeonholed as a rockabilly stylist, referring to his 
music as "redneck jazz" for its assimilation of influences as diverse as Les 
Paul, Chet Atkins, Scotty Moore, Merle Travis and Charlie Christian. Speed, 
versatility, technique and feeling were the hallmarks of his style. "He could 
play anything," Eastridge said. "It was a freak of nature type of talent, one 
of those unique gifts."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; OPPONENTS OF MEASURE VOW TO SUE IF IT 
PASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Charging that Proposition 187 is immoral, unhealthful and unworkable, leaders 
of California's medical establishment and the civil rights community Monday 
urged voters to reject the ballot measure on illegal immigration and asked the 
federal government to take steps to prevent it from being implemented if it is 
approved on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the 
California Medical Assn. requested federal officials to "act quickly to prevent 
the state from implementing" Proposition 187 by making clear that California 
would lose $9 billion a year in federal matching health funds if the measure, 
which appears to conflict with federal laws, takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical association also said it would file an immediate lawsuit to block 
implementation of Proposition 187 if it is approved by California voters Nov. 
8. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Dr. Robert M. Karns, president of the Los Angeles County Medical 
Assn., declared he is prepared to ignore the measure -- which would eliminate 
all educational and non-emergency health services for illegal immigrants and 
require local health, education and law enforcement officials to turn in the 
names of suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities -- rather than ask 
patients for proof of their legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a law that I will have to break because I'm not going to stop giving 
care to anybody," the Beverly Hills heart specialist said at a morning news 
conference outside Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. "This thing is nuts, 
you've got to be crazy to vote for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Karns, who also quoted the medical ethics code precept "first, do no harm" in 
explaining why he would engage in civil disobedience, spoke alongside various 
civil rights leaders, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson and United Farm Workers 
co-founder Dolores Huerta. 
</P>
<P>
 In pre-election polls, Proposition 187 has shown strong across-the-board 
support among registered voters, including many African Americans concerned 
that illegal immigrants take blue-collar jobs from U.S. citizens and help 
create a labor glut that drives down wages. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson and other African American community leaders, including John Mack, 
Los Angeles Urban League president, and Joe Hicks, executive director of the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles, said that for 
civil rights reasons alone, it is imperative that minority groups work together 
to repel Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is anti-Latino, anti-vulnerable people," said Mack. "If you talk about 
closing the borders to Latinos, the same rule applies to closing the border to 
Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's solve real social issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson called Proposition 187 "inhumane" and "racist," comparing it to the 
interning of Japanese American residents in detention camps during World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we're celebrating Columbus Day," said Jackson. "Let's not forget when 
Columbus landed in America he was considered to be an illegal alien and an 
undocumented worker. But welcome." 
</P>
<P>
 "The character of America is at stake," Jackson said. "Let us celebrate all 
immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even on economic grounds, Proposition 187 does not make sense, Jackson 
continued. For one thing, he said, the jobs of many minority government 
employees would be in peril if services to illegal immigrants were slashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, California risks losing up to $15 billion a year in federal health, 
educational and social service funds if the measure is approved by voters 
because it conflicts with federal statutes and confidentiality requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments by Jackson and others were quickly lambasted by Harold Ezell, 
Proposition 187 co-author and former Immigration and Naturalization Service 
regional director.  
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't a civil rights issue, it's a legal issue," Ezell said. "What about 
the rights of American-born kids?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious that Jesse Jackson has not talked to the African American people 
who live in California who have been majorly impacted by illegal aliens. All he 
has to do is tour schools that used to be in what was referred to as 
South-Central and see American kids -- whether black, white or yellow -- who 
were born here, being taught in Spanish." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, federal Education Secretary Richard W. Riley wrote that passage of 
Proposition 187 could jeopardize federal education funding to California 
because it appears to violate federal confidentiality requirements. The federal 
government now grants about $2.3 billion in annual aid to California schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Medical Assn., in its letter to the Department of Health and 
Human Services, asks that the federal government make clear that another $9 
billion a year in matching Medicaid funds would be jeopardized if Proposition 
187 takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the federal government cannot expressly forbid the measure from 
taking effect, the threat of a funding cutoff might lead to second thoughts 
among voters favoring Proposition 187, said association vice president of 
government relations Steven Thompson. If the measure is approved, a swift 
post-election funding cutoff would lead to a quicker resolution of a medical 
association lawsuit, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If citizens realized all they were doing was spending taxpayers' money on 
lawyers to litigate their action, that might have an impact on how they vote," 
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its letter, the CMA, a leading member of the statewide coalition of health, 
education and law enforcement organizations opposing the ballot measure, 
contends that because of its wording, Proposition 187 would ban health care for 
people applying for refugee status and other individuals who have not been 
granted lawful status but still qualify for such services as Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to federal law, the CMA writes, Proposition 187 also requires doctors 
to withhold services from Medicaid patients unless they can verify their legal 
status at the time of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the ballot measure makes no provision for medical screening exams to 
determine whether an emergency exists when a patient arrives at a hospital, the 
CMA charges. Under the measure's provisions, illegal immigrants qualify only 
for emergency medical care, as is required by federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of Proposition 187 contend there is little political likelihood 
that the federal government would slash funding that amounts to about 25% of 
the state's annual budget if Proposition 187 was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody believes Bill Clinton would take a dime out of California between 
now and 1996, they'd have to be on some other kind of wavelength," said Ezell. 
</P>
<P>
 CMA legal counsel Astrid G. Meghrigian said that federal health officials 
occasionally take action to help quash state health regulations that conflict 
with federal requirements, including a case earlier this year when California 
proposed deferring authorization for "elective" health services under Medi-Cal 
for up to 90 days. In a strongly worded letter, the HHS told the state the 
policy "is not permissible under the . . . Medicaid requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 HHS Regional Director Grantland Johnson, to whom the CMA's letter was 
addressed, was unavailable for comment. His assistant, Emory Lee, said that 
while department officials have yet to study the letter, "we do oftentimes 
respond to inquiries like this."

STUDENTS ADD STAND AGAINST VIOLENCE TO SCHOOL TRADITION; CAMPUSES: IT'S 
HOMECOMING WEEK AT HOLLYWOOD HIGH, WHERE A 17-YEAR-OLD WAS SHOT TO DEATH ON THE 
FIRST DAY OF CLASSES. AMID HOOPLA OF FESTIVITIES, HUNDREDS PLEDGE TO COEXIST 
PEACEFULLY.

<P>
 It is a time of rah-rah, pom-poms, floats and powder-puff football games. A 
time for wearing the Red and White of Hollywood High. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also, for hundreds of students, a time to sign pledges promising 
peaceful coexistence in the face of violence that claimed one of their fellow 
student's lives on the first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hollywood High, this year's Homecoming Week is an exercise in hanging onto 
venerable school traditions amid the encroaching urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think kids are really getting fed up with all the violence," said April 
Hill, a 15-year-old junior. "We really want a peaceful school." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the students kicked off the annual festivities with a new twist -- 
a lunchtime demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a sunny sky, several hundred teen-agers signed certificates vowing to 
extend "peace and friendship to my fellow human being." They pinned yellow 
ribbons to their clothing to show their dedication to keeping violence off 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Students have realized now, more than ever, that they have to hang onto their 
traditions and set an example for the whole community, said April, the junior 
class vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few years, it was difficult to get students to participate in 
homecoming events, she said. But that has changed in the wake of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 60 students tried out for Homecoming Court this year. Last year, there 
were only 25. Normally only a few students wear the school colors during 
Homecoming Week. On Monday, several dozen showed up sporting red and white at 
the lunchtime rally, which students organized with the help of a group called 
the Harmony Coalition from Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to go back to the things that people are used to," April said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood High homecoming rituals sound straight out of an earlier era. 
The freshman girls play the juniors today in a powder-puff football game. On 
Thursday, there will be a hotdog-eating contest. The big game, against Lincoln 
High School, is Friday afternoon, after a pep rally and parade. 
</P>
<P>
 As the students vowed Monday to keep the peace and relish some high school 
traditions, signs of the times were close by. 
</P>
<P>
 A uniformed Los Angeles Police Department officer and several school security 
officers kept a close watch on the gathering, just in case there was trouble. 
Since 10th-grader Rolando Ruiz, 17, was killed Sept. 7 in front of the school 
in what is believed to have been a gang-related shooting, police have 
substantially increased their presence on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Capt. Glenn Ackerman said he is hopeful that building 
interest in school events, such as homecoming, will help keep the teen-agers 
out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the kinds of things that have traditionally existed to build a 
sense of identity and cohesiveness," he said. "They allow adolescents to vent 
their energy in a positive way. It is important to hang on to whatever rituals 
we have, because we don't have much in the way of substitutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Susan Carruthers, a 15-year-old sophomore, added: "The shooting really 
showed me that it could happen anywhere. But by signing these pledges and 
showing our school spirit, we can make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to tell my kids that I went to a school where there was no 
spirit. We may be wearing a gold ribbon on our clothes, but we are also wearing 
it in our hearts."

MTA PANEL RESPONSIBLE FOR TUNNELS MAY BE CUT; SUBWAY: THE AGENCY IS EXPECTED TO 
CONSIDER WHETHER TO DISBAND THE RAIL CONSTRUCTION CORP. AIDES TO RIORDAN HAVE 
REQUESTED A POSTPONEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Board members of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority are expected at a 
special meeting today to discuss whether to seek tighter control over subway 
construction in the wake of the federal government's decision to suspend future 
funding for the troubled project. 
</P>
<P>
 But aides to Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan have requested postponement of 
a proposal to dissolve the subsidiary agency that has supervised construction 
of the multibillion-dollar subway. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's chief executive officer, Franklin E. White, has sought since May to 
dissolve the Rail Construction Corp. subsidiary and may try again today. The 
meeting was scheduled in response to the Clinton Administration's freezing last 
week of $1.6 billion of future subway funding for Los Angeles. Administration 
officials have said the funding will be unlocked when they are satisfied that 
local transit executives can begin competently managing the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's transportation aide, Rae James, said Monday that she asked White to 
postpone action until after the mayor returns later this month from a vacation 
in Europe. She said Riordan, who sits on the MTA board and appoints three other 
members to the panel, has asked White for more information before deciding how 
to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's position -- that a vote should be postponed until after his return 
-- was conveyed to MTA Chairman Ed Edelman on Friday, according to sources 
familiar with the matter. MTA board members postponed voting on White's 
proposal Sept. 21 at the requests of Riordan and Councilman Richard Alatorre, 
both of whom were absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre, who sits on the MTA board as an appointee of the mayor, has said he 
opposes dissolving the Rail Construction Corp. or firing project officials 
responsible for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who could vote as Riordan's personal alternate, 
said he hopes that White proposes a strong package of changes and that the MTA 
board approves them. "I hope Washington won't be flimflammed by small changes 
and tinkering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One top MTA board member, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that he 
expects today's meeting to result in the removal of some personnel involved 
with the subway project. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board has 13 members: all five county supervisors, Riordan, three of 
his appointees and four elected officials from outlying cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some support appeared to be building for White's proposal to dissolve the RCC 
-- and thereby possibly increase accountability for construction of the 
multibillion-dollar subway. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its public session, scheduled for 4 p.m. Tuesday at the Hall of 
Administration, the MTA board is expected to meet behind closed doors to 
discuss unspecified litigation matters related to the shutdown of tunneling 
along Hollywood Boulevard. Excavation was halted Aug. 18 because of surface 
sinkages of up to nine inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should re-evaluate the entire staffing and organization" of the MTA's 
construction staff, said Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 James Cragin, a member of both the MTA and RCC boards, said he favors 
dissolving the RCC and replacing people responsible for the construction. "We 
need a clean slate," said Cragin, a member of the Gardena City Council. "As far 
as I'm concerned, (the RCC board is) the most political thing I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre said he saw no reason to terminate officials or to support White's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, two members of last year's Los Angeles County Grand 
Jury have urged the current panel to conduct a civil investigation into the 
problems with the subway's construction.

HIGH AND NOT SO DRY; WEATHER: 'SUPER SCOOPER' PLANES ARRIVE TO HELP BATTLE 
BLAZES -- IF THEY HAPPEN -- JUST AS MOISTER CONDITIONS ALLOW FIREFIGHTERS TO GO 
OFF ALERT. 
</P>

 Dry desert winds abated enough Monday to decrease the immediate threat of fire 
across Los Angeles County, but residents and fire officials say they are not 
letting down their guard as the one-year anniversary of last year's firestorms 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fire crews were taken off alert and extra personnel were sent home as a 
resurgent flow of ocean air cut into the dry winds that had enveloped Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The return of smog was even a welcome sight at the county Fire Department's 
Command and Control Center in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "That gray and brown crud that got blown offshore is blowing back in now," 
said Los Angeles County Fire Battalion Chief Gene Wolf. "From the standpoint of 
fires, that is just great. If you are trying to breathe, you might not like it 
so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooler conditions and diminished winds permitted county firefighters to back 
down from an alert that began Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers who had been called in to operate several water tankers throughout the 
county were sent home. Fire patrols in pickups -- doubled over the weekend -- 
were cut back to normal levels. And an extra helicopter that had been put at 
the ready was deactivated. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, fire officials said that historically it is in the fall and even early 
winter -- before the rains -- that hillsides are the most parched and prone to 
ignition. In late October of last year, the first in a series of local 
firestorms began in Ventura County, eventually devastating several areas of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The brush is dryer this year than it was a year ago, when 26 fires struck six 
Southern California counties, officials said. And last week's rain did nothing 
to reduce the fire danger, said Los Angeles City Fire Chief Donald O. Manning. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is years and years of good rain to make any difference," Manning 
said. "Otherwise, it's darned if you do, and darned if you don't. If it doesn't 
rain, everything is dry, dry, dry. But if it just rains one year, we get a lot 
of grass, which is just feeder fuel." 
</P>
<P>
 An additional measure of security will arrive this week when the county takes 
delivery of two highly touted "Super Scooper" airplanes. Unlike other 
firefighting aircraft, the planes can take on large loads of water from the 
ocean in just seconds, without landing. 
</P>
<P>
 The two bright yellow and red Canadair CL-215Ts, to be based at Van Nuys 
Airport, will be tested beginning today and will be ready for real action as 
early as Thursday. They will used throughout the county, not just in the 
unincorporated areas that are the responsibility of county firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Super Scooper is not a panacea or guarantee that all fires will be kept 
small, but it has a unique capacity to extinguish California's hell fires," Los 
Angeles County Fire Chief P. Michael Freeman said during a news conference 
Monday at Van Nuys Airport, where the planes will be based. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the planes is being leased from the Quebec government and the other 
donated for county use by Bombardier Inc., Canadair's parent company, which is 
hoping to eventually sell Super Scoopers to the county and other California 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Several fire officials said Monday that preparations are also better on the 
ground than they were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In Topanga Canyon, where three people died and 17,027 acres burned last fall, 
residents have been extremely vigilant about clearing brush and making other 
preparations. "It's better than any other year I can remember," said Los 
Angeles County Fire Capt. Steve Floyd, who is based in the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, several community groups held a disaster preparedness fair at 
the local elementary school attended by about 500 residents, a record turnout, 
said Allen Emerson, civilian coordinator of Community Arson Watch. Residents 
have also been ripping out eucalyptus trees and other ornamental vegetation 
that burns easily, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In La Canada, Fire Capt. Sal Chavez reported "much better participation" from 
homeowners in replacing wood roofs and making other preparations. And Battalion 
Chief David Baisley, who is in charge of the Altadena and La Canada Flintridge 
area, said that all wild land properties in border areas have been inspected 
for adherence to fire codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's fires also helped to remove up to 30 years of accumulated fuel 
from many hillsides. Said Peter McKellar, owner of a liquor store in Malibu 
that was threatened by flames last year: "There's nothing left to burn. It's 
like a moonscape. What's there to burn on the moon?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, at Carbon Canyon's Fire Station No. 70, though, the thought of 
all the acres that did not burn could not be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to get the guys a lot of water and an early lunch because 
typically the fire starts about noon," said Capt. Paul Donohue of the Malibu 
station. "It's not as windy now as last year, but every bit as dry." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everyone who drops by a private mailbox and message service in the 
Topanga Canyon mentions the possibility of another fire, owner Leigh Bloom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it gets hot and dry like this, everyone starts looking around," Bloom 
said. "A lot of people have already moved out. But you can't let it bother you 
or you will move, and this is the best place in L.A. to live."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WEST HOLLYWOOD; 
SIMPSON'S SON QUESTIONED IN HIT-RUN ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 24-year-old son could face misdemeanor charges for allegedly driving away from 
the scene of an accident in West Hollywood, a Los Angeles County sheriff's 
spokesman said Monday night.  
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred about 2 a.m. Wednesday on Santa Monica Boulevard, Deputy 
Matthew Rodriguez said.Jason Simpson, who is not a licensed driver, ran his 
Jeep Wrangler into the rear of Olga Claveria's 1994 Nissan pickup, Rodriguez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Jeep then sped away without stopping and was pursued by a witness who 
wrote down its license plate number," Rodriguez said.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Rich Erickson said Simpson "met with our investigators at West 
Hollywood Station on Sunday, and during that discussion he admitted that he was 
driving the Jeep at the time the collision took place. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking at so far are charges of hit-and-run and driving as an 
unlicensed driver in the state of California, both of which are misdemeanors," 
Erickson said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDENT CINEMA VERITE 
EXAMINES EARTHQUAKE

 They knew the genre well -- how to light the scene starkly and set the camera 
low to achieve an ominous, bigger-than-life effect. But the film students 
figured the only disaster they might shoot would begin and end on a Hollywood 
sound stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Then an earthquake came to town. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost nine months after the Jan. 17 temblor laid their classrooms low, Cal 
State Northridge film students and their professor are putting the final 
touches on a bittersweet project: a documentary film on the quake that left 
them out of school and out of their homes, thoroughly shaken and mourning the 
loss of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Aptly titled "Epicenter U.," the 16-millimeter film is a quirky mix of 
academia and disaster, of therapy and movie making, of rubble and rising from 
it. "It's painful to be in an earthquake, but it's a joy to make a film about 
it," said professor and producer Alexis Krasilovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 A documentary filmmaker for 20 years, Krasilovsky began "Epicenter U." before 
the earth had settled back into itself that Monday morning. When the appliances 
stopped toppling at her Silver Lake home, she calmed her shaken but safe 
6-year-old son and allowed herself a moment of contemplation over their close 
call with a bookshelf. Then she ran for her movie camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings were coming down, flames were rising and the filmmaker's instincts 
took over. 
</P>
<P>
 When her class met next, Krasilovsky asked how many of her students' homes had 
been damaged. Most students raised their hands and shooting began in earnest 
despite far more pressing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 A scene with Salvador Morales is dark and shaky.  
</P>
<P>
 He stands against a chain-link fence, a crumbling apartment complex behind 
him. He speaks in jagged sentences. "This is the building where I live . . . 
yellow-tagged. I have to stay there." 
</P>
<P>
 The setting changes, more rubble. Morales pulls at a shard of drywall. "They 
looted my apartment. They stole my piano. I couldn't believe it, because it's a 
heavy piano. . . . I don't care about what I lost, but you kind of lose faith 
in the human race." 
</P>
<P>
 Working on both sides of the camera, Morales delayed his own student film to 
join the cast and crew of "Epicenter U." The most costly natural disaster in 
U.S history demanded documentation, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dedicated to the memory of CSUN students Manuel Sandoval and Jaime Reyes, 
among the 16 people killed when the Northridge Meadows apartment complex 
collapsed, the film concentrates on the earthquake's effects on the university 
and its students.  
</P>
<P>
 But, said executive producer Deborah Abrams, a former student of Krasilovsky, 
"The film is dealing with emotions that come out of all natural disasters." 
</P>
<P>
 Many film industry professionals experienced the quake firsthand as well, and 
have offered support so the shoestring production will be ready to premiere on 
the quake's first anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 They have donated editing equipment, cameras, film and lighting equipment. A 
man at a production shop would not accept Krasilovsky's check for his work on 
the soundtrack. His Woodland Hills home was demolished, he told her, and he 
wanted only a copy of the finished film as payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Editor Amy Tompkins gave up better-paying feature film work for the rest of 
the year to put the footage together. Some of it is raw and overexposed, she 
said, lending a unique feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the credits roll, the passionate voice of civil rights activist 
and former U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young is heard. It is his commencement speech 
given June 6 to those who graduated despite the quake: "You've been blessed by 
having been born in difficult times. Go and . . . contribute these blessings." 
</P>
<P>
 As Young's voice fades, a grinning graduate runs in slow-motion toward the 
camera, his mortarboard in place, tassel swinging. ERIC SLATER

 Lawyers in the O.J. Simpson double murder case are expected back in court 
today for another skirmish in the battle of the pretrial motions. Overall, the 
prosecution has so far prevailed most of the time. The defense, however, has 
scored subtle victories even when it lost the larger battle. Here is a 
breakdown of the major motions filed so far and the outcomes. Motions that 
remain under seal are not listed.

salvaged by other side: Defense was able to suppress a few items taken from 
Simpson's home, such as papers about his divorce taken from his desk. Defense

WOMAN'S SLAYING PUZZLES RELATIVES; VIOLENCE: THE 77-YEAR-OLD VICTIM WAS 
EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS, GRANDDAUGHTER SAYS. POLICE SAY BURGLAR MAY BE RESPONSIBLE 
FOR THE KILLING IN VAN NUYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The brutal killing of an elderly woman in her Van Nuys home has baffled 
relatives and friends, who described her Monday as a habitually cautious and 
private person who would never have opened her door to a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either you had a key to my grandmother's house or you didn't come in," said 
Monine Horn, one of the three grandchildren of Berneda McMackin, 77, whose body 
was discovered Sunday afternoon by police and neighbors in her closed, burning 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone had gone in and stabbed her, beat her and then tried to set her on 
fire to try and hide the crime," Detective Stephen Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects have been arrested in the slaying, which police say may have been 
committed during a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 News of McMackin's killing left her family distraught and angry and nearby 
residents on Blewett Avenue frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," said one neighbor who asked not to be identified. "You hear 
about things like this happening at other places." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," said another neighbor. "She never bothered anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, whose husband accompanied police into the burning house to find the 
body, said the front and rear doors were closed but unlocked, which relatives 
said was unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn said it was unthinkable that her grandmother, who had lived alone in the 
house since the 1976 death of her husband, a former Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputy, would open her door to a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 McMackin's daughter, Robin Crays of Las Vegas, said detectives showed her a 
mason's tool resembling a putty knife, which they believe was the murder 
weapon, and said the contents of her purse had been dumped on the floor, 
indicating that robbery may have been the motive. She could not tell whether 
anything had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't understand how this person got in," Horn said.  
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "As close as we were, I had only been inside her house once in 40 years," said 
an elderly woman for whom McMackin used to shop. The woman said McMackin would 
stop by her house every few days to chat about their families. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Reed, another neighbor, said that after the Northridge earthquake, 
McMackin would not even let Reed's husband, who works for the Gas Co., into her 
home to make sure her gas was shut off. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wouldn't even open the door to him," Reed said. "So I can't believe she'd 
open the door to just anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors also said one of McMackin's two dogs was extremely protective of 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 McMackin was found by Reed's husband and police in the doorway of her 
smoke-filled kitchen after residents smelled smoke coming from her home about 
2:45 p.m. Firefighters extinguished the blaze within a couple hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband said both doors to the house were still closed, Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crays said that she had talked to her mother on the phone between 11:30 a.m. 
and noon on the day of the killing and that "she was fine" and was waiting for 
a phone call from Horn, who was possibly going to stop by for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a great mother," Crays said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Nebraska, McMackin had lived in the modest house on Blewett Avenue 
since 1949, family members said.

STUNTMAN HURT AT THEME PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A stuntman in the "Miami Vice" show at Universal Studios fell off a jet ski 
during rehearsal Monday and suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The performer, Joe Box, 25, was treated and released from St. Joseph Medical 
Center in Burbank, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, based on the once-popular television series about vice detectives in 
Miami, opened in 1987 and features a speedboat ride through a simulated lagoon, 
among other fast-paced stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts of what led to the accident differed. Universal spokesman Michael 
Gray said the stuntman fell off his ski. But paramedics said they responded to 
a report that Box was hit by another jet skier.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; INJURED SLATER, BROSTEK ARE SIDELINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams' struggling offensive line suffered two major losses in Sunday's 
24-17 loss at Green Bay -- right tackle Jackie Slater and center Bern Brostek. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater is expected to miss three weeks because of a tear in his triceps, and 
Brostek is lost for two to four weeks because of a broken bone in his right leg 
and a sprained right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Slater means struggling rookie Wayne Gandy, is expected to take 
over at starting right tackle. Left guard Tom Newberry will move to center in 
place of Brostek, and second-year player Chuck Belin is expected to become the 
starting left guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said the Rams plan to work out some free agents this week in 
hopes of adding depth to the thin offensive line, which has struggled in the 
team's 2-4 start this season. 
</P>
<P>
 To sign an offensive lineman, the Rams will have to cut a player from the 
roster. With quarterback Chris Chandler's sprained left ankle showing 
improvement, backup Jamie Martin, re-signed as an emergency quarterback, could 
be expendable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams would like to re-sign offensive lineman Jeff Pahukoa, who can play 
guard or tackle, but cannot do so because Pahukoa's contract was guaranteed 
when the team cut him before the season.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also are in the market for a punter to replace Sean Landeta, who's 
expected to be out two weeks with a shoulder injury. Tony Zendejas is the 
team's backup punter, but Knox said the team could bring in a free-agent punter 
for a workout as soon as today.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Slater said he tore his triceps while making a block on the next-to-last play 
of the game. He was replaced by Gandy, who was beaten badly by Reggie White for 
a sack of Chris Miller. Gandy earlier had been called for holding on a sweep 
play on second and goal from the Green Bay two, and the Rams' drive ended a few 
plays later when Miller was intercepted in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching game film Monday, Miller was critical of the Rams' play-calling 
and execution on the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at the film on some of our run plays on third down and short and one 
or two guys just weren't getting it done," Miller said. "They just weren't 
executing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Jerome Bettis averaged 8.8 yards a carry on sweep plays last season, 
but the offensive line has struggled when blocking for him on short-yardage 
pitches this season. Case in point: Gandy's holding penalty on second and goal 
from the Green Bay two. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go outside and don't make it, then we should go inside, right?" Knox 
said. "And if we go inside, then we should go outside. Anybody can have 20-20 
vision on Monday. We just need to execute the play better." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams had scored on Bettis' sweep play from the two, would Knox have 
tried a two-point conversion to win it? "That's foolish for me to say," he 
said. "It didn't come to pass." MIKE REILLEY

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: DIVISION II VOLLEYBALL: NO. 1 FACES NO. 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 He might not have imagined it when he took over the program six years ago, but 
Mark Massey has the Cal State Los Angeles women's volleyball team in position 
to become the top-ranked team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cal State LA is 15-0 and ranked No. 2, the top-ranked team is in its 
conference, Cal State Bakersfield (22-1). 
</P>
<P>
 They will play tonight at Cal State LA, and it should be the best competition 
Division II volleyball has to offer. It is the first of two matches this season 
between the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. powers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, it is a budding rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield, UC Riverside and Cal Poly Pomona have been the most prominent 
CCAA volleyball teams over the years. Cal State has been up and down, mostly 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 But Massey changed that a couple of years after he arrived with a remarkable 
coaching and recruiting job in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He put together a squad with four freshmen from volleyball clubs -- the best 
volleyball at the high school age is on the club level -- who weren't quite 
good enough to play Division I volleyball. After Massey persuaded them to play 
for Cal State LA, he continued his pursuit of walk-ons, plucking setter Adriana 
Huerta out of one of his physical education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those players advanced to the NCAA's elite eight tournament in 1992 and lost 
in the semifinals. Last year, under the new regional tournament format, Cal 
State LA lost in the West Regional to Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a different feeling now," Massey said. "Before, we knew we could 
compete. Now we look at ourselves as an elite team and expect to win matches." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a junior-dominated team, Cal State LA is looking for immediate success and 
not waiting until next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be basically the same team next year, but after losing (in the 
regional), they were very disappointed. They have one goal -- they want 
championship rings," Massey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Eagles can take a big step toward them tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 They have the experience. Huerta is one of the best Division II setters in the 
country, and three of the club recruits -- Andrea Ferchaw, Wendy Dreher and 
Kaili Kimura -- are the backbone of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Massey said his team has been waiting for this match since the loss 
in the regional last year, he says there is no added pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that there never has been a match in season of this significance 
here, but with our conference, we're so used to every match being against a 
ranked team, that we're used to the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield, which has won the last two CCAA championships, has the same 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a significance stand-point, I don't think it is any more significant 
than a lot of others -- it's a real good conference match," Bakersfield Coach 
Carl Ferriera said. "Rankings don't help you, once you start to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Cal State LA draws 100-200 for volleyball matches, but with No. 1 
playing No. 2, the athletic department is making arrangements to accommodate as 
many as 400.

 Cal Poly Pomona will have a dinner and reception to honor the accomplishments 
of former women's basketball coach Darlene May, who retired last summer because 
of breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 It is open to fans and friends of May and is scheduled for Nov. 14 at the 
Kellogg West Conference Center on Pomona's campus. Details: (909) 869-2810. 
Tickets are $35.

 After a disappointing season last year, it appears Claremont-Mudd's water polo 
team is ready to retake the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands won last year, interrupting nearly 11 years of Claremont-Mudd 
dominance. Claremont- Mudd won 110 consecutive games against conference 
opponents and 10 consecutive SCIAC titles before Redlands stopped both streaks. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Claremont-Mudd beat Redlands in the conference opener, 11-7. 
Redlands was without its best player, Greg Milton, who has a torn rotator cuff 
and might sit out the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were playing not to lose last year," Claremont-Mudd Coach Mike Sutton 
said. "We were feeling the weight of the streak. But we're playing well now." 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont-Mudd is ranked 17th with a 5-3 record, the losses to Division I 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss of Milton and a 1-5 record, Redlands is expected to play well 
in conference games and be in the chase for the SCIAC title. Whittier (4-2) and 
Occidental (8-3) will be competitive with anyone in the conference, but have 
yet to take the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 College Division Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Redlands' men's soccer team beat Claremont-Mudd for the first time since 1973, 
a 2-1 victory on Sept. 28. Claremont-Mudd is ranked No. 1 in the West Region. . 
. . Biola's women's volleyball team, winner of seven consecutive matches, is 
ranked second in the NAIA. Biola, 12-6 overall and 6-1 in the Golden State 
Athletic Conference, won 19 consecutive games at one point during the 
seven-match winning streak. Biola will play GSAC rival Azusa Pacific (No. 9) on 
Thursday.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: CYPRESS' PRINE GETS NOTICED BY 
DISHING OUT THE 'ROUGH STUFF' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scoring goals is the easiest way for soccer players to gain attention, but Pam 
Prine of Cypress College has found another way. 
</P>
<P>
 Prine gets noticed by being among the top defenders in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 She was selected as the Orange Empire Conference's most valuable player last 
season as a freshman and also earned All-American honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress Coach Ray Haas and his staff didn't have to spend any time persuading 
Prine to concentrate on stopping goals instead of scoring them. 
</P>
<P>
 She had already put in four years as a varsity defender at Troy High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to mark players," said Prine, 20. "I like the rough stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Haas did have to persuade Prine to play soccer at all after she graduated from 
high school in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Prine, who had played since she was about 6, finally reached burnout as a 
senior and quit after high school. 
</P>
<P>
 But Haas didn't give up. 
</P>
<P>
 He informed her about the program and kept after her to consider coming out. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Prine missed playing and agreed to take part in some tournaments 
in the summer of 1993. After that, she decided to play again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming out of high school," Prine said, "I just freaked out. I wasn't sure if 
I could handle (going to class and playing soccer). So I just went to the 
closest JC with my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Prine plays defense, she is up field often and had nine goals and six 
assists as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Prine already has scored four times for the Chargers (7-0, 5-0 in 
the Orange Empire Conference), the top-ranked team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Prine would like to continue playing next season but realizes there are 
limited scholarship opportunities for soccer players. She is also eager to 
finish college and become a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 But if this is Prine's last season, she definitely wants to end it by winning 
the State title. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress was undefeated last season until the final game, losing the State 
title to DeAnza on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all came back this year because of the loss," she said. "The conference is 
a lot tougher this year but we are starting to finally get it together." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rushing to a record: Orange Coast's Jeff Clayton is one of the few bright 
spots for the Pirates this football season. Clayton, a sophomore from Trabuco 
Hills High, needs six yards to become OCC's all-time rushing leader. 
</P>
<P>
 He has gained 100 or more yards 10 times in 15 games, and has 1,868 yards in 
his career. Tony Accomando (1974-75) holds the all-time OCC record with 1,873. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, who had 426 yards in 80 carries this season, is almost certain to 
break the record Saturday when OCC (0-4) plays at San Diego Mesa (2-2) at 6 
p.m.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Women's volleyball: Golden West further entrenched itself as the top-ranked 
team in the state by dominating the College of the Sequoias tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers were 8-0 in pool play Saturday, then went 4-0 in best-of-three 
matches Sunday in the championship round. Neither counts toward a team's 
overall record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers, the defending State champions, beat second-ranked San Joaquin 
Delta, 15-11, 15-6, for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemia Astarabadi, Golden West's setter, was selected as the tournament's most 
valuable player. She had 148 assists, 16 aces and 15 blocks in 13 games. Becca 
Foltz, an outside hitter, also made the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rustlers face a solid test this week in Orange Empire Conference play. 
Golden West (5-0, 2-0) plays host to Orange Coast (4-3, 2-0) tonight, is at 
Saddleback (7-0, 3-0) Wednesday, then plays host to Rancho Santiago (5-2, 1-1) 
Friday. All three matches start at 7. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Football poll: Bakersfield fell from the top spot of the Southland poll thanks 
to a 23-20 loss to Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino (4-0), unranked at the start of the season, is the current No. 1 
team. Cerritos (4-0) is second but the teams meet at 7 p.m. Saturday at 
Cerritos. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (3-1) moved from sixth to third. Los Angeles Valley (5-0) is 
fourth, Long Beach (4-1) fifth, Bakersfield (4-1) sixth, Moorpark (3-1) 
seventh, Mt. San Jacinto (4-0-1) eighth, Pasadena (2-1-1) ninth and Mt. San 
Antonio (2-1-1) 10th. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Men's soccer: Cypress ended a long winless streak against Orange Coast Friday 
with a 4-3 victory in an Orange Empire Conference match at OCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast had a 15-0-3 record against Cypress dating to 1986. Cypress' Tony 
Trevino had two goals in the victory. "It was a nice victory and gives us a 
great start in the conference," Cypress Coach Tony Baca said.

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; MOVE IMPROVES GOLFER'S GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Shawn Morley ever gets a chance to try for his PGA Tour card, he'll have an 
advantage over the rest of the golfers battling the pressures of qualifying 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Morley, who left his home in Australia two years ago to try to make the golf 
team at New Mexico State, found that there were almost 100 others vying for 
three open spots on the Aggie team. 
</P>
<P>
 He ended up finishing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Morley spent the next year trying to condition his Sydney sinuses to the arid 
Las Cruces air and then tried out again. Again, the competitors filled an 
entire day of foursomes, but this time they were vying for only two spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Morley finished third, a stroke shy. 
</P>
<P>
 He had picked New Mexico State -- sight unseen with the exception of brochure 
pictures -- because it offers a golf management program and he hopes to someday 
be a club pro. Unable to make the team and completely unimpressed with the 
landscape, Morley decided to become an economics major and try to make the team 
at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say (Las Cruces) didn't do much for me," he said, smiling. "I got 
there, looked around, and said, 'What is this?' It was really weird and I 
didn't know how it was going to last. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up near the ocean and now I live with a group of guys down near 31st 
Street (in Newport Beach) and I get out in the water to body surf a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The change of scenery seems to be helping. Last month, Morley finished second 
in the Grand Canyon Classic at Hillcrest Golf & Country Club in Sun City West, 
Ariz., leading the Anteaters to the title of the 17-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday and Saturday, however, he'll be back on New Mexico State's University 
Golf Course as the Anteaters compete in the Wimberly Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a lot of local knowledge," said Coach Steve Ainslie, unable to keep 
from laughing. "I guess he's not too excited about returning to his old 
stomping grounds, but he's played that course a couple of hundred times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he called me out of the blue and I fell into a really good player, a 
really good guy, with Shawn. He's one of the most popular players on the team 
and a heck of an athlete. We were just working out together and he was in there 
pumping iron and wearing out the Stairmaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Morley, who started playing golf as 5-year-old when his family lived on a golf 
course, would probably still be playing rugby if he hadn't suffered a 
career-ending ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until the time I was 12, we would sneak on every day after school and I 
was a pretty promising junior player," Morley said. "But after that, I was 
fully into rugby. That took up all my time until I got hurt when I was 18." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take him long to get his game back on course. Morley, who possesses 
the dynamic duo that every golfer dreams of -- he's both very long and very 
straight off the tee -- says all the time away from the links didn't hurt much 
from a physical standpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had played the whole time, I would probably be farther ahead mentally, 
though," he said. "Golf is a game where you are always learning and relearning 
how to score." 
</P>
<P>
 After he gets his degree, Morley intends to play amateur golf for one year and 
then hopes to turn pro and play on the Australian tour, maybe some mini-tours 
in the United States, maybe even the PGA someday. 
</P>
<P>
 "College golf out here is so competitive, it's really good for your game," he 
said. "I guess the whole experience has been good for me because right now I 
feel like I'm not far away from getting my 'A' game and really tearing it up." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Countdown to ecstasy? The men's basketball team begins practice Saturday and 
there's a definite aura of optimism around the offices of Rod Baker and staff 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, 10-20 and 4-14 in the Big West last season, had a very good recruiting 
year, yet the Anteaters also lost some good players during the off-season. But 
the pluses seem to outweigh the minuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the pluses: 
</P>
<P>
 * Kevin Simmons. The 6-foot-8, 230-pound freshman who attended a prep school 
in Troy, N.Y., last year to meet NCAA academic requirements, apparently has the 
game to be an immediate force inside. He will replace DeForrest Boyer, who set 
a school record with 59 blocked shots and averaged 6.7 rebounds as a senior. 
Simmons, who averaged 21 points and 17 rebounds as a senior at Brooklyn Tilden 
High, figures to provide a better balance of offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raimonds Miglinieks. The 6-3 point guard from Riverside College was being 
recruited by schools such as California, Arkansas and Seton Hall. Miglinieks 
had 828 assists in two seasons at Riverside. He will replace the 
talented-but-often-out-of-control Lloyd Mumford. Mumford made things -- both 
good and bad -- happen, but Miglinieks makes everyone he plays with better. 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Tate. Tate, a 6-5 transfer from Ventura College, averaged 12 points 
and 10 rebounds and was an All-Western State Conference selection. He'll be 
playing in the power forward spot vacated by Jermaine Avie, who quit the team 
during the off-season. Avie became less of a force as last season wore on; 
consistency is Tate's forte.  
</P>
<P>
 * Brian Keefe. The 6-4 shooting guard from Winchester (Mass.) High, where he 
averaged 28 points as a senior, was a last-minute signee, accepting a 
scholarship in mid-September. He has impressed Irvine coaches with his work 
ethic and his shooting ability. He fills the void left by Todd Whitehead. 
Whitehead left school because of academic problems; Keefe was named to the 
Boston Herald's All-Scholastic team.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wind-aided: Junior Shaun Battle, who was named to the Big West All-Freshman 
basketball team in 1992-93, is reportedly in the best shape of his life. The 
6-6 forward can be an intimidating defensive player and dominating rebounder, 
but he spent the first couple of months of his first two seasons sucking air. 
If he's fit, he can give opponents fits. Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Senior P.J. Polowski continues to find the back of the net with amazing 
regularity. In two seasons of soccer, the transfer from Orange Coast College 
has established Irvine's career goals record, scoring his 23rd on a penalty 
kick Sunday against Nevada Las Vegas. Polowski, with 12, is one goal shy of the 
single-season mark set by Ken Gunn in 1984. He's No. 1 in the Far West and No. 
3 in the nation with 31 points this season.

 GRAND WHAT? It's an annual problem, how to get a wide variety of people -- 
meaning in age and ethnicity -- to give a year of their lives for grand jury 
service. But the Orange County Grand Jurors Assn. and the Superior Court have 
come up with a new way to attract recruits: An orientation breakfast for 
potential jurors, Wednesday at 8 at the Crown Sterling Suites hotel in Santa 
Ana. . . . Says recruiter Jodie Harrod: "This is the first time we've tried 
this. It's for people who might want to apply, but don't know enough about what 
a grand juror does." 
</P>

 CRABBY ATTITUDE? How's this for a California landmark: You enter a seafood 
restaurant within the claws of a giant crab -- 17 feet tall. Gary Coburn is 
planning the crab-designed awning for Joe's Crab Shack, to open soon at 2607 W. 
Coast Highway in Newport Beach. . . . One sticky problem: city planning 
commissioner Anne Gifford felt the crab would be a sign, violating the city's 
ordinance against signs that size. But the other commissioners liked the crab, 
and voted her down. Commissioner Tod Ridgeway chided her playfully: "I hope 
that crab bites you." 
</P>
<P>
 REALLY LIVE: Cable TV live interviewer Larry King will be among those inducted 
Saturday into the National Broadcasters Hall of Fame at the Disneyland Hotel in 
Anaheim. He'll have some heavyweight company: Art Linkletter, the McGuire 
Sisters, Ted Turner and local radio personalities Gary Owens and Robert W. 
Morgan. . . . Ronald Reagan makes it too, based on his early sports 
broadcasting stint in Iowa. He won't attend, but he's sending a taped 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 MAD COMEDY: And you thought vaudeville was dead . . . the Brea Improv is 
accepting auditions from just about anyone for its "Absolute Madness" skits. 
It's a pro-am comedy-variety the Improv is calling "the new vaudeville." Brea 
Improv manager Robert Hartman says he'll look at anyone with an "oddity" 
talent. The skits are running Wednesday through Sunday through the end of the 
month.

 Many Valley shopping malls that escaped major earthquake damage are enjoying a 
10% to 30% jump in sales over the same time last year.Now they hope for the 
best Christmas season in years, which is especially important because 40% of 
retailers' sales come during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 While some Valley malls are benefiting from pent-up consumer demand, layoffs 
in many industries continue to plague the region, warned John Golisch, chief 
retail consultant in Southern California for Arthur Andersen & Co. He wonders 
if the sales gains at some stores will last because they have come at the 
expense of closed malls and from an influx of earthquake assistance funds.

 Dear Commish: 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called final report of the strike-shortened 1994 MIBL season has 
finally arrived at the Chatsworth headquarters of the Nippon Ham Fighters. As 
you know, this report claims that the Hams finished in fifth place among 10 
teams, following the "champion" Ballbusters, the Disgruntled Postal Workers, 
the Four Baggers and -- well, waddaya know? -- your very own Power Mongers. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that I am disturbed is an understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 You may think the season is over, but I say we have some unfinished business 
to discuss. Indeed, the Nippon Ham Fighters hereby lodge a formal protest of 
the alleged standings and demand immediate redress. 
</P>
<P>
 I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that I, as a baseball fan, am 
simply venting my frustration over the fact that it is now October and there is 
no World Series for the first time in 90 years. You're thinking that I feel 
cheated by people like the owners' strongman Bud Selig and players' rep Donald 
Fehr. You're thinking that I, like thousands of other fantasy or "rotisserie" 
team owners, feel bamboozled for having built our teams with the belief that a 
full, 162-game schedule would be played. 
</P>
<P>
 And no doubt you're thinking: "Sour grapes!" You're thinking I'm a sore loser. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sticks and stones. What I'm seeking here is justice.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's true that the alleged standings showed the Nippon Ham Fighters in 
fifth place with 5,197 points, a piddling three points behind your Power 
Mongers. Yes, this tiny margin -- the difference between a bloop single and an 
out, basically -- kept the Fighters out of the money. Yes, it cost me my $75 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's get down to business: 
</P>
<P>
 First: The report shows that the Ballbusters, to use your words, "played 
Strike Ball to their advantage" by signing three free agents after major league 
play stopped. One was the Brewers' Kevin Seitzer, whom the Busters played at 
third base. It just so happens that I was scouting Seitzer myself and can 
assure you that, during much, if not most, of the season, he played first base. 
As you know, to qualify for the Busters' lineup under MIBL rules, Seitzer would 
have had to play a plurality of games at third base. 
</P>
<P>
 It's galling enough that the Busters' key player was Steve Howe, the former 
cocaine abuser "banned for life" from baseball yet who somehow is still 
playing. It shouldn't be surprising that the Busters, in the tradition of the 
champion Northridge Little League All-Stars, would try to slip an illegal 
player into their lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll recall that after Northridge got caught early in their playoffs, they 
had to bench the player. If, as I strongly suspect, the Busters played Seitzer 
illegally, they would have to bench him and would lose his 297 points. This 
would drop the Busters to fifth place and the Disgruntled Postal Workers would 
then be the champions. My Nippon Ham Fighters would be elevated to fourth 
place, enabling me to recoup my $75 investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the chances are slim to none that I'm wrong about Seitzer. No matter. 
There is a second issue that cries out for attention: the lamentable rule 
limiting teams to only two roster changes. 
</P>
<P>
 May I remind you that the Nippon Ham Fighters, in light of the strike, 
petitioned for this rule being relaxed to allow more trading. After a few days, 
I graciously accepted on faith your statement that my proposal had been 
rejected by my fellow owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's apparent that I shouldn't have been so gracious -- that I should have 
demanded a full and open vote of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, how suspicious it is that your Power Mongers are the only team that would 
have suffered by my proposal! Your conflict of interest is so blatant! Face it: 
You're the Bud Selig of MIBL. You own a franchise and you pretend to serve the 
best interests of MIBL as commissioner. The name of your team is oh, so 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, sure. You're thinking that I'm still kicking myself because I failed to 
use one of my two trades to deal the Pirates' Zane Smith, a solid pitcher on my 
bench, for extra hitting. You think I'm just mad because, had I dealt Smith, 
the Hams would have easily finished in fourth place and might have even grabbed 
the third-place money. Why, the Hams probably would have nailed down the 
second-place purse, since my protest against the Busters is certain to be 
upheld. Hell, if it wasn't for the damn strike, my Hams would have copped the 
MIBL crown. We were really coming on strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this season has been a travesty, and all because of power and greed. The 
vices that have poisoned both the major leagues have infected MIBL as well. 
It's sad to think that the Ballbusters would want to win so badly as to resort 
to chicanery, and sadder still that you would abuse your trust as commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you for forgetting that it's just a game. 
</P>
<P>
 And one more thing: Get a life. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely, 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Harris 
</P>
<P>
 Owner, Nippon Ham Fighters 
</P>
<P>
 (Editor's note: After an investigation, the MIBL commissioner found no 
legitimate basis for the Nippon Ham Fighters' protest, noting that Kevin 
Seitzer played 43 games at third base, 35 at first. Furthermore, it was 
determined that if Harris had signed Seitzer, the Hams would have earned three 
more points, tying the Power Mongers for fourth place.)

SCHOOLS AND HOMEOWNERS BRACE FOR MEDFLY SPRAYING; CAMARILLO: OFFICIALS FIELD 
QUESTIONS AT LEISURE VILLAGE ABOUT EFFECTS OF MALATHION. SOME RESIDENTS 
COMPLAIN THE ANSWERS WERE TOO VAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 As state agriculture officials finalized plans Monday to spray the properties 
of 32,400 people in the eastern Camarillo area with malathion to stop a Medfly 
infestation, homeowners and health and school officials prepared to deal with 
the aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 Elementary schools within the 16-square-mile spray zone were preparing to 
cover sandboxes and hose down blacktop and lunch tables before children arrive 
the morning after the first spraying, scheduled to begin at 9 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Convalescent homes were advised by public health officials to take similar 
precautions for outdoor eating areas. And residents were making arrangements to 
cover cars, fishponds and children's outdoor toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's regrettable that this is necessary," said Dr. Gary Feldman, Ventura 
County health officer. "But given the economic consequences and the fact that 
the health risks are negligible, I do think this is the appropriate decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman was one of several state and local officials on a panel at Leisure 
Village on Monday afternoon, where about 400 people crowded into the retirement 
community's recreation complex to voice concerns and hear comments from 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions focused on whether people on medications or those who were ill would 
be more susceptible to adverse effects. 
</P>
<P>
 But many people also wanted to know what they should do to protect their 
skylights and cars and whether the spraying would have any effect on birds or 
beneficial insects. 
</P>
<P>
 It will not affect birds but would kill beneficial insects as well as pests, 
officials said. Cars should be covered, and skylights hosed off. 
</P>
<P>
 As he left the meeting, 80-year-old Franco Filzi said the officials had not 
answered many of his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very vague," he said of official answers about health questions. 
"They don't know probably themselves the answers. We are so confused."  
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Edwards, 55, who lives in Camarillo Heights, agreed that officials' 
answers were superficial. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to joke and kid," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rose Gassman, 77, said if the Medfly were allowed to spread, many workers 
would lose their jobs. "We're all concerned about it," she said of the 
spraying. "But it has to be done. After all, this is a big agriculture county." 
</P>
<P>
 Sid Silversher, 78, said he trusted the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know what they're doing. I approve of it because of the impacts to the 
agriculture. We live a lifestyle where everything is a trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Agriculture Commissioner Earl McPhail told residents that the 
three pesticide-carrying helicopters would reload three times during the three 
to four hours it will take them to cover the area, so residents might hear 
helicopters pass overhead more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 "But be assured you are not being treated three times," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee said she had pointed out to agriculture officials 
that Leisure Village was a retirement community where seniors may be sensitive 
to the spray. But she was told the area had to be included because of the 
number of trees and host fruits grown there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support the decision to spray, not because I think it's wonderful, but 
because I believe it's necessary," she said. "It's a safe and effective method 
of eradicating the Medfly." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, one local opposition group plotted strategies Monday on how best to 
inform the public of their point of view and persuade officials to cut short 
the 10 to 12 applications planned over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Economics and politics drove the decision to spray the area without proper 
concerns for health effects, said Leonard Mehlmauer, a holistic practitioner 
with a degree in science and herbal and other types of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have politicians who are getting big stars for helping to get this going," 
Mehlmauer said. "Chemical companies will make a lot of money, the agriculture 
people will get their crops sprayed and a lot of people will have health 
effects over this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plain and simple, we're being poisoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo resident Bonnar Quint said he also is trying to make the public 
better informed of the health risks through a copy of a state report issued in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are not paying attention to their constituents, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Why aren't they asking our opinion?" he asked. "Our city leaders are rolling 
over and playing dead on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Quint said officials should take recommendations from their own report, which 
called for alternatives to aerial spraying, including the use of sterile male 
flies that would mate with fertile females. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both the California Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture can and should conduct vigilant early pest detection programs and 
maintain abundant sterile insect production capacity, not just while this 
recent episode is fresh in everyone's mind, but as long-term public policy so 
that repetitive aerial malathion-bait applications are not again needed," the 
report states. 
</P>
<P>
 Public health officials have said the very young, the elderly and the sick 
could be vulnerable to skin or respiratory problems after the spraying. 
Otherwise, state and local officials said, health risks are negligible for most 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night will mark the first session of aerial spraying in the 
eradication zone. Three helicopters will cover the 16-square-mile area in three 
to four hours beginning at 9 p.m. unless winds are too high for them to be 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopters will not fly if winds are stronger than 10 m.p.h. because the 
spray would spread too far outside the target area, said Carla Agar, 
spokeswoman for the California Department of Food and Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth helicopter will fly alongside to guide the three carrying the 
pesticide. The helicopters are equipped with navigation systems that help them 
pinpoint when to spray and when to hold back, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agar said no new flies had been found within the mile core area over the 
weekend because inspectors are no longer checking the traps there daily.  
</P>
<P>
 "We know there are Medflies in the core area," she said. Efforts are now being 
concentrated around the periphery of the St. John's Seminary property. Of the 
total of 63 flies trapped, 62 of them, including two egg-carrying females, were 
trapped on the St. John's property. A third female was trapped about a mile 
northeast of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Agar said investigators have not come to any conclusions about the source of 
the infestation, but they were looking into whether visitors or seminarians at 
St. John's may have brought in tainted fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 A delegation from Japan, which imports more than a third of the county's 
$216-million lemon crop, were due to tour the county Wednesday and Thursday. 
Area growers and agriculture officials fear that the Japanese may decide to cut 
off imports from the entire county, not just the 86-square-mile quarantine 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-square-mile eradication zone is home to about 32,400 people, 2,700 of 
them under age 5, and 3,900 over age 70, said Steve Wood, senior county planner 
and demographics expert. Earlier estimates had placed the population at 29,000, 
but those figures were refined Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 There are eight schools within the area, including six elementary schools, two 
of which include grades seven and eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The elementary schools are Las Colinas, Sierra Linda, Dos Caminos, Los 
Nogales, El Rancho and Somis School. Los Altos Intermediate School and 
Camarillo High School are also within the eradication zone. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supt. of Schools Charles Weis on Monday sent out memos to all the 
schools advising educators to use caution to protect children and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that schools wash drinking fountains, lunch tables and door 
handles with soap and water, that asphalt and concrete play areas be hosed off 
and that children be kept off grassy areas and allowed to stay inside before 
class, during recess and physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel there is a risk, but if parents don't want their children on 
the grassy areas, then we want to give them an option," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pleasant Valley School District, which includes six of the eight affected 
schools, planned to send memos home with students today in Spanish and English. 
</P>
<P>
 The district planned to cover sandboxes and asked parents to tell them if any 
students were especially sensitive because of allergy or skin problems. The 
district also planned to close the schools to community groups by 8 p.m. 
</P>

PETITION SEEKS TO LIMIT USE OF PROP. 172 FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's top law enforcement officials joined a cluster of would-be 
supervisors Monday to launch a petition drive that would ensure sales tax 
dollars from Proposition 172 are spent dousing fires and curbing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and Sheriff Larry Carpenter announced the 
drive at a news conference at the Ventura County Government Center on Monday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, they presented County Clerk Richard D. Dean a list with the 
signatures of five voters who want to make sure that millions of dollars 
targeted for law enforcement stay in public-safety budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with a sharp deficit earlier this year, the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors directed more than $1 million of the $28 million in sales tax to 
departments outside public safety, such as the medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 It also left about $4 million in Proposition 172 funds undesignated. 
</P>
<P>
 With another multimillion-dollar county deficit looming next year, Bradbury, 
Carpenter, four supervisorial candidates and a group called Citizens for a Safe 
Ventura County have vowed to make sure that doesn't happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors "should assume that this is a call to arms," said Carpenter, 
despite having received millions from the board to hire new deputies and staff 
a new jail. "If you believe you should have a say in how your money is spent, 
then sign the petition." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors also refused to give any of the Proposition 172 funds 
to the county Fire Department, which supervisors criticized for its management 
of a $48-million budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would need the signatures of more than 18,750 voters to qualify 
for the next general election -- scheduled for June, 1996 -- or more than 
37,000 signatures to force a special election, the county clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
 An official of the citizens panel predicted the group would force an immediate 
election by gathering 40,000 or more signatures on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll cover almost all of the precincts," said Steve Frank of the citizens 
group. He said they would stand outside the polling places, adding, "People are 
there to vote. We'll get close to it. That's the goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean said a special election would cost about $400,000. But Frank said the 
supervisors have left them no choice other than to pursue the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Board of Supervisors had kept their promise and abided by the will of 
172, then we wouldn't have to spend the money," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 172, which won huge support from California voters a year ago, 
called for an extension of a half-cent sales tax that was to expire Jan. 1. It 
stipulated that the extra tax would fund additional public safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the supervisors struck a deal with law enforcement officials to 
provide $24 million from Proposition 172 to expand existing public safety 
programs. But following a series of lengthy budget hearings in July, 
supervisors voted 4 to 1, with Supervisor John K. Flynn opposed, to divert more 
than $1 million to other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who is not seeking reelection to the board, 
declined to discuss the petition drive Monday. But Supervisor Maggie Kildee 
defended the board's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board has consistently said that we will give Proposition 172 money to 
public safety and that's what the board has done," she said. "We're already 
spending the money on public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Other California counties have used the Proposition 172 money simply to fund 
existing programs, rather than expand services or hire new officers as Ventura 
County has done. But several candidates attending Monday's announcement 
disagreed with the supervisors' action. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second District candidate Trudi Loh said the board should have cut into 
reserves instead of diverting money that voters designated for public safety to 
other county-run agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the obvious first -- and very painless -- place to cut," Loh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo, running for the seat now held by 
VanderKolk, called on the board to direct Proposition 172 funds strictly to 
public-safety agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that we have to spend all this time and all this money to do 
something that should have been done in the first place," Schillo said.

AN EDUCATION THAT PUPILS CAN BANK ON; THEY HAVE CHECKBOOKS AND ATM CARDS, PAY 
THEIR BILLS AND PLAN FOR THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Lupita Valencia is a clothing designer. She makes $60,000 a year, owns her own 
house, has a car and is considering opening a money-market account. 
</P>
<P>
 At least in theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupita actually is a 10-year-old student in the fifth grade at Emilie Ritchen 
School in Oxnard, and she is learning the value of money and the hardship of 
life through a hands-on classroom program. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the program, fifth- and sixth-grade students at Evelyn 
Ybarra-Grosfield's class have assumed the fictitious lives of physicians, 
teachers, professional soccer players and police officers and embarked on a 
classroom journey to a simulated adult life. 
</P>
<P>
 They have checkbooks and automated teller machine cards, donated by the Bank 
of A. Levy, and they pay bills using grocery receipts and utility statements 
already paid by their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in college, I got myself in a big financial mess because I was 
never taught how to use a credit card or a checking account," Grosfield said. 
"Now I want to teach those kids that they shouldn't have the attitude that 'I 
can spend it now and pay it later.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Grosfield said that as a student she thought economics was a dry and 
threatening subject, and her fear of failure kept her from learning how to 
control her finances until she charged her credit cards to the limit.  
</P>
<P>
 "I learned the hard way," Grosfield said. "That's why I want to teach my 
students how important it is for them to be able to manage their finances and 
what that means for them in a long run."  
</P>
<P>
 The program is probably the first time that most of the 34 students in 
Grosfield's class have been exposed to a credit card and checking account -- 
even if fake ones, Grosfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For various reasons, a lot of the parents of those children don't have a 
checking account or a credit card," said Grosfield, who teaches a bilingual 
class. "So I want to provide them with the opportunity to learn."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grosfield began the program by helping the students decide what they want to 
be when they grow up. Once they selected an occupation, she assigned them a 
yearly salary and opened "bank accounts" for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on their "salaries," students write checks to pay bills, make house 
payments and open savings accounts. They learn how to balance their checkbooks 
and are allowed to buy extras such as clothing or computer games as long as 
they can pay without getting in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule is "do not spend more than you have," Grosfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 For every class, students have to write reports on their household finances 
and make sure they do not overdraw money. 
</P>
<P>
 "By managing their bogus finances, they are also learning math, writing and 
reading," Grosfield said. "We are tying classroom work with real-life events 
and that makes it more interesting for them." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the school year, Grosfield hopes to have taught students about 
bonds and Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the hands-on program, Grosfield asked the Bank of A. Levy if it 
could provide literature on banking. The bank not only sent her the 
information, but also printed the students' names on ATM cards and mailed them 
individually to each student in care of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 When the cards arrived, students eagerly tore open the envelopes and signed 
their names on the cards. Then they softly repeated their personal 
identification numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 As they proceeded to begin to pay their bills, the physicians had $100,000 in 
their fictitious bank accounts. The police officers had $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they see the difference in the amount of money that they make, some want 
to change their occupation," Grosfield said. "But I tell them if they want to 
be a highly respected doctor they should strive to go to schools such as 
Harvard and Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As part of her real-life teaching, Grosfield has requested catalogues in 
various fields of study from several universities nationwide, and she plans to 
go through them with her students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing research in various careers will help them to decide on how much 
training and college preparation they are willing to invest on themselves," 
Grosfield said. "Knowing the difference between a community college and an Ivy 
League school will widen their dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Ernest Morrison, who said the program is the first of its kind in 
the school, said he is grateful for Grosfield's creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's giving meaning to their school work, teaching them a work ethic that 
they will remember for the rest of their lives," Morrison said. "They will 
learn how to look at a big picture and that life is not going to hand them 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the children, they are thrilled for having a career and a checking 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to be a designer," said Lupita Valencia, wearing a flannel 
dress that she designed and her mother made. "Now it's like I'm a real 
designer."

ELECTIONS / VOTER REGISTRATION; INSTRUCTORS BRING SIGN-UP EFFORTS INTO 
CLASSROOMS; EDUCATION: TEACHERS' GROUP ENCOURAGES THE ACTIVE ROLE. USE OF CLASS 
TIME IS APPROVED BY OFFICIALS OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

<P>
 Students enrolled in Ventura County's three community colleges have been 
encouraged to vote by an unusual source over the last few days: their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Faculty Assn. of California Community Colleges, a Sacramento-based 
legislative advocacy group for community college instructors, is asking its 
members to bring voter registration cards to their classes and encourage 
students to fill them out before the registration closes today. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, dozens of teachers at Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura colleges have 
been handing out the cards in class or participating in registration drives 
outside of class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked up about 350 or 400 voter registration cards last week and brought 
them here," said Gary Morgan, an Oxnard College instructor and president of the 
campus's academic senate. "By (last) Friday, about two-thirds of them were 
gone. I would guess we must have registered somewhere around 200 or 300 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 Completed voter registration cards must be postmarked by today or turned in at 
the county Elections Office by the close of business today, elections officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind a small card table propped up outside of Oxnard College's 
administration building on Monday, student volunteer Juan Solorzano signed up 
as many people as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes down to voting, I'm starting to take it more seriously than 
before because there are a lot of issues that affect me personally," the 
25-year-old art student said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 10 minutes, Solorzano had signed up four new voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were talking about a lot of the issues in class, so I really wanted to 
become a part of it," said Monique Carruthers, a 19-year-old sociology major 
who registered Monday with the American Independent Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Using class time to help register students has been approved by officials of 
the California Community Colleges in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voter registration activities are not only permissible, but should also be 
encouraged," according to an August letter from Vice-Chancellor Thomas J. 
Nussbaum to college presidents and superintendents statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all instructors in the Ventura County Community College District support 
taking class time to register potential voters, however. The academic senate 
president at Ventura College advised instructors there to work to register 
voters before or after class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I discouraged that because that's not what (class time) is supposed to be 
used for," said Bill Robinson, a math instructor. "The only thing I would 
disagree with is using class time to register students." 
</P>
<P>
 But at Moorpark College, more than 400 full- and part-time teachers were given 
a half-dozen blank voter registration cards to distribute to students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time they've been in the classroom," said Steven Pollock, the 
president of the Moorpark College academic senate. "But faculty members on 
their own have done this in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a strategy that the faculty this time used to encourage individuals 
to register," Pollock said. "This is just another attempt to attract those 
students who have not yet registered to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 The executive director of the Faculty Assn. of California Community Colleges 
said he expects the statewide registration drive to net tens of thousands of 
new voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "By Tuesday at midnight, we think we'll have registered approximately 100,000 
newly registered community college students," said Patrick McCallum. "Newly 
registered people are the most likely to vote, so that's going to put 80,000 
(new) voters in the polling places." Voter Registration Today is the last day 
to register to vote in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who may register: You must be a U. S. citizen, at least 18 years old on or 
before Election Day, and a California resident for 29 days before the election. 
If you move within 28 days of the election, you may vote by returning to your 
former precinct or by obtaining an absentee ballot for that precinct. If you 
are in prison or on parole for a felony conviction you are ineligible to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reasons to register or re-register: 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have never registered to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have moved since the last election. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you have changed your name. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you want to change your party affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 * How and where to register: Mail-in voter registration forms are available at 
county offices, city halls, fire stations, post offices, libraries and the 
state Department of Motor Vehicles. Voters can also call the Ventura County 
Elections Division office at 654-2781. The elections office is at 800 S. 
Victoria Ave. in the lower plaza of the Hall of Administration. Office hours 
are 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Absentee ballots: Applications for absentee ballots are on the back page of 
your sample ballot. They may also be obtained in person or by sending a written 
request to the Elections Division, County Government Center, 800 S. Victoria 
Ave., Ventura, 93009. Written applications for absentee ballots must be 
received in the office by Nov. 1. You can obtain an absentee ballot in person 
at the elections office through Nov. 8, with the option of immediately casting 
your ballot in the office.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER HOUSING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard officials are seeking $2.2 million in federal funds to launch a public 
housing program that would keep homeless parents from losing custody of their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Housing Authority has been invited by the U.S. Department of 
Housing and Urban Development to apply to its Section 8 Family Unification 
Program.The Oxnard City Council is set to approve an application today for 50 
rental units for separated families. 
</P>
<P>
 The $77.5-million program provides rental vouchers to parents whose children 
are at risk of being put in foster homes or already are in out-of-home care due 
to the family's inadequate living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are homeless people living in the street, in their cars, and their kids 
are being taken away," said Oxnard Housing Programs Coordinator Virginia Nunez. 
"If the . . . children are about to be put in foster care, this program allows 
the family to receive a certificate for safe, sanitary housing to keep them 
together." Families must meet regular maximum-income requirements to be 
eligible. Ventura and Camarillo already receive HUD family unification funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Public Social Services Child Welfare Agency, which wrote a 
report in 1992 detailing the need for a unification program, would refer 
homeless families to the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Blesener, deputy director of protective services for Ventura County, 
said children are not taken away from their families for lack of proper housing 
per se, but for related health and safety violations. 
</P>
<P>
 When that happens, he said, "certain housing conditions have to be met before 
the child can be released into custody. That is a big problem for some parents. 
They can't get their children back." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL OKS $215,000 FOR CAMERAS, SOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council Monday approved a $215,000 upgrade of the council 
chamber's sound system and television cameras, part of a new public awareness 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Barbara J. Kam said the sound system now in the council chamber is 
21 years old and rapidly failing.However, the new audio-visual system will do 
more than end the era of broken microphones. 
</P>
<P>
 It will add four new remote-controlled cameras to replace the single, 
hand-operated one that currently broadcasts council meetings into the homes of 
cable television viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the expenditures said the city's success depends on an involved, 
informed public. "I view this as a pro-democratic move," Councilman Stephen 
Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said the money could be better spent on other programs. "The amount 
of $215,000 really seems outrageous," Councilman Jim Monahan said. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; 2 HIKERS INJURED IN 2 DAYS AT 
'PUNCHBOWL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two hikers were injured on consecutive days in a gorge north of Santa Paula, 
authorities said Monday. Both had leapt from a high ledge into a pool of water 
in the area known as the "punchbowl." 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend accidents, neither of which resulted in serious injuries, occurred 
in a pool of water bordered by rock walls rising above Santa Clara Creek. 
Authorities say it is the most common rescue site in Ventura County because of 
diving injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, an unidentified 14-year-old girl suffered a broken ankle after 
jumping about 25 feet into the body of water, Matthews said. He said 
search-and-rescue volunteers carried her more than a mile down a rocky canyon 
before she was transported to Santa Paula Memorial Hospital for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jered Saindon, a freshman at nearby Thomas Aquinas College, suffered minor 
back injuries after jumping about 30 feet into the pool about 5 p.m. Sunday, 
Sheriff's Sgt. Earl Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saindon, 20, of Seymore, Wis., was taken by friends to nearby Big Cone Camp, 
not far from the Sespe Condor Sanctuary in Los Padres National Forest, Matthews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a four-wheel-drive vehicle, the search-and-rescue team took a dirt road 
to the camp and transferred Saindon to the college. He said Saindon did not 
require hospital treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go there more than any other individual place (for rescues)," said 
Matthews, a search-and-rescue supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing wrong with the canyon. It's just the way people act up 
there," he added. "It's a rugged and beautiful area, and people should respect 
it. But they often don't." GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; THREE OFFICERS HURT IN STRUGGLE WITH MAN

 Three Oxnard police officers suffered minor injuries after struggling with a 
pipe-wielding man who had broken windows in four homes early Monday in Oxnard, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers -- Randy Latimer, 29, Michael Radziewicz, 32, and Senior Officer 
Johnny Gomez, 43 -- suffered minor cuts and bruises in the 10-minute struggle 
in the back unit of a duplex in the 500 block of North McKinley Avenue about 
1:20 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Refugio Paramo, 36, was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly 
weapon and assault of a police officer, police spokesman David Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor said that Paramo broke seven windows in his residence and three in 
neighboring residences. Neither the neighbor nor Keith knew why Paramo was 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found Paramo in an open closet in the far corner of the back unit, 
armed with a four-foot pipe and a three-foot broom handle, Keith said. Paramo 
refused to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after one of the officers used pepper spray to subdue him, Paramo fought 
back with his fists and his weapons, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramo, who sustained minor injuries in the scuffle, was taken to St. John's 
Regional Medical Center but refused treatment, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Fred Bustillos said Paramo, who also goes by the last name 
Aguilar, was being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail. He is to 
be arraigned Wednesday, Bustillos said. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 8TH-GRADERS TO VISIT MUSEUM OF TOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To help teach the destructive consequences of bigotry, the Ventura Unified 
School District is sending all 1,200 of its eighth-grade students to visit a 
Los Angeles museum dedicated to racial and ethnic tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next week, eighth-grade classes from the district's four middle 
schools will take turns piling into buses for trips to the Museum of Tolerance 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The trips are sponsored by the district and the nonprofit United Jewish Appeal 
of Western Ventura County, Inc., which is raising most of the $9,000 needed for 
museum admission and bus rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum features multimedia presentations on the history of prejudice, said 
Eitan Ginsburg, executive director of the United Jewish Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides general exhibits on bigotry against blacks, Jews, Latinos and other 
groups, the museum has large displays on the history of American slavery and 
the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon entering the Holocaust exhibit, visitors receive cards with the faces and 
names of real people who lived in Europe before World War II. By the exhibit's 
end, they learn whether these people perished or survived, Ginsburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura teachers are building lessons on the history of racial and ethnic 
conflict around the museum trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa Middle School teacher Bob Shirley, for example, gave his class 
vocabulary words such as demagogue and bigot this week. And for the week 
following the museum visit, Shirley has invited to the school a Holocaust 
survivor and a retired U.S. serviceman who helped liberate a concentration 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 To donate money for the school trips, call the school district at 641-5000 or 
the United Jewish Appeal at 647-7800. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; WOMAN HELD AFTER CHILD IS ABANDONED

<P>
 An Oxnard woman was arrested Monday after she walked through a crowded 
intersection, gave her 14-month-old son to two joggers and wandered away in an 
drug-induced haze, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kimberly Osmond walked through traffic on Harbor Boulevard about 6 a.m., 
two joggers concerned about the toddler's safety persuaded Osmond to get out of 
the road, according to Oxnard police. 
</P>
<P>
 Osmond then reportedly handed the child to the joggers and kept walking 
southbound on Harbor Boulevard. The joggers called police, who took the baby, 
which was clad only in diapers. Minutes later, they arrested Osmond near the 
intersection of Channel Islands Boulevard and Victoria Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 She was held in Ventura County Jail on suspicion of felony child endangerment, 
child abandonment and being under the influence of a controlled substance. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was under the influence, so we weren't able to learn too much from her 
about what she was doing," said police spokesman David Keith. He said police do 
not know what drug she was suspected of taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Police turned over the child to the county protective services agency, Keith 
said. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SUPERVISORS URGE AUDIT OF JOB AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Ventura County supervisors are calling for a financial review of the 
millions of dollars that flow through the local Job Training Policy Council, an 
agency that seeks to put poor people to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors John K. Flynn and Susan K. Lacey will ask the Board of Supervisors 
today to approve a request for an auditor to review the financial records of 
the council, which spends more than $11 million a year on various job-training 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey said she is asking for the review primarily because of a law passed in 
1992 that makes local elected officials partly responsible for the finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we appointed the board members, met and agreed on the way they 
worked, but we had no direct liability or power," Lacey said.  
</P>
<P>
 Armando Lopez, a spokesman for the job-training council, said he welcomed the 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's in keeping with the spirit of cooperation this agency has with the 
county," he said. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: AHMANSON RANCH; CALABASAS REQUIRING PERMIT FOR ROAD 
PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council has upheld a decision by the city Planning 
Commission to require the developer of Ahmanson Ranch to apply for a special 
permit to extend Las Virgenes Road 15 feet to the Ventura County line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just felt the application was incomplete, and that additional information 
is needed to adequately process the application," said Mayor Karyn Foley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agreed to go along with the ruling" and apply for the special permit, said 
Mary Trigg, a spokeswoman for Ahmanson Land Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land initially filed for an encroachment permit to extend Las 
Virgenes Road to make way for the project, said Steve Harris, Calabasas' 
community development director. After reviewing the application, the city's 
planning staff sent Ahmanson a letter saying the application was incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 To complete its application, Ahmanson must file for a conditional-use permit 
and conduct an environmental review of the road-extension proposal, Harris 
said, because the area is part of the Las Virgenes Road Scenic Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson appealed the matter to the Planning Commission, which upheld the 
staff recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 square 
feet of commercial space in a hilly area southeast of Simi Valley near the 
border of Los Angeles County. The Las Virgenes Road extension is considered 
crucial to the project because it would be part of a major road system to the 
proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire project has met fierce opposition from residents and municipalities 
in the area, who say it would disrupt surrounding neighborhoods. Several 
communities, including Calabasas, have sued the developers in an effort to 
block the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers maintain that they have done all they can to minimize the 
impact of the project, approved two years ago by the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors. An environmental study done on the project demonstrates that 
clearly, Ahmanson officials maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the city of Calabasas' actions to date on the road-extension proposal 
have dealt with technical issues, city officials said. Eventually, the city 
will begin studying the actual merits of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted in August to appeal a Superior Court judge's ruling 
that Calabasas was legally bound to allow the widening of Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard to make way for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Trigg said Ahmanson wants to try to resolve the various lawsuits -- which have 
been condensed into one -- before moving forward with the project. FRANK 
MANNING

NO MAIN STREET PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sidewalks on Ventura's Main Street near the bus-provided benches and 
public telephones are like open sewers.The walks reflect the nightly episodes 
of conflict, leaving their stains of blood and urine.  
</P>
<P>
 There are suggestions about beautifying old Ventura. Why spend the money where 
there is so little civic pride? 
</P>
<P>
 The kids on skateboards whiz and whirl upon pedestrians, frightening timid old 
people like me. 
</P>
<P>
 When I talked to a local merchant, he said that he feared reporting them.

VANDALS WENT TOO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five students are suspended in the vandalism of a rival school (Sept. 30), and 
the damage reported included graffiti on the exterior of the gym, yellow paint 
on lockers, raw eggs tossed against a building, whipping cream smeared on the 
handball courts and dog food dumped near Buena High's school sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the assistant principal of Ventura High is quoted as saying, "I agree that 
their intentions were honorable and spirited," but went on to say that the 
outcome was different.More appalling was the Ventura High principal: "To an 
extent it's normal kid behavior that just goes a little too far. I don't see 
that it's a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Please tell me that the principal and assistant principal have been misquoted. 
Otherwise, I am repelled by the twisted values which their statements imply. 
Any disrespect by students to persons or property should be unacceptable to 
school officials, if the inculcation of values has any place in the school 
curriculum. "Just a little too far" indeed.

 Opponents of an initiative that would deny a host of public benefits to 
illegal immigrants will take to the streets Wednesday to urge defeat of the 
Nov. 8 ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Foes of Proposition 187 will march from Ventura College to the Ventura County 
Government Center starting at 2 p.m. A rally is scheduled to take place at the 
government center at 4:30. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure would deny schooling, non-emergency health care and other 
public benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our effort is to try to get out the vote and to demonstrate what would happen 
in our community if Proposition 187 passes," said Armando Garcia, head of the 
Ventura County Immigrant Rights Coalition.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; LIBRARY REOPENS, TALLIES BOOK LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks Library reopened Monday after closing down for nearly a week 
due to water damage from last week's rainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 books were damaged during the two-day storm as rain poured into 
the library, which was in the middle of a re-roofing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers and librarians sorted through the library's 325,000 books Saturday, 
trying to determine which ones were waterlogged. Although damage totals have 
not been completed, library officials estimate that $5,000 to $10,000 worth of 
books were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are discarding them," deputy library director Steve Brogden said of the 
wet, moldy books, which were found throughout the library. "I do know that one 
section that got hit hard were the bird books and auto repair manuals in the 
reference section." 
</P>
<P>
 The construction company handling the roofing project has agreed to pay the 
replacement cost of the damaged books, and roofers hope to seal the leaky roof 
this week, Brogden said. TRACY WILSON

<TEXT>
<P>
 I am at a loss to comprehend the rationale behind the "back-to-basics" school 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition seems to center around the fact that because some parents are 
not sufficiently attentive to their child's educational nurturing they will not 
permit those parents who are attentive to structure a curriculum to fit their 
own children's needs. Did I get that right? 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, using reverse logic, the attentive parents must permit the 
inattentive parents to structure the curriculum to which the attentive parents 
must then submit. Did I get that right also? 
</P>
<P>
 How does it work one way but not the other?

 Abused, abandoned and neglected children will benefit from more than $35,000 
raised by the Camarillo Rotary Clubs in a golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the city's two Rotary clubs will present a check at noon on 
Wednesday to Casa Pacifica, a residential children's crisis care center in 
Camarillo, officials at the center said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica officials said the money was raised by 110 golfers in July at 
the second annual "Care for Kids Golf Classic," which included a dinner and an 
auction. 
</P>

 Cal State Northridge will host a workshop this month for employers who want to 
learn about the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Workforce 2000: Increasing Diversity in the Workplace" will take place Oct. 
27, said Terri Goldstein, a spokeswoman for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning seminar covers tax breaks and other incentives available to those 
who employ people with disabilities and also to those who remove architectural 
barriers or provide other special accommodations in the workplace.  
</P>
<P>
 The Internal Revenue Service, state Employment Development Department and 
other organizations will send representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon, employers can meet with people with disabilities so the 
employers can learn about their specific problems, said Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is hosted by the Students with Disabilities Internship Project, the 
Center on Disabilities, National Center on Deafness and the Office of Disabled 
Student Services. 
</P>
<P>
 To register or obtain further information and times, call Goldstein at 
885-3148 or 885-3066. FRANK MANNING

TOXIC THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The controversy over the flooding in the Ormond Beach estuary seems to be 
pointless at the moment since during the last storm the water in the estuary 
broke through the sand bar, which was acting as a dam. This is the normal cycle 
for this kind of estuary. 
</P>
<P>
 I think this was advantageous for the city of Port Hueneme, which at this time 
chose to initiate a change in the course of Bubbling Springs Creek. It appears 
that the normal discharge from the creek is being piped directly into the 
Pacific Ocean. So what does this mean? For one thing, the estuary will be 
deprived of its major, continuous, historical source of freshwater, leaving 
only the polluted urban, industrial and agricultural runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a bright side to this for some individuals. The wetlands will shrink 
due to the average water level in the estuary being lowered and, because of 
this, the number and the type of plants, animals and insects will decline (some 
possibly being endangered species). This would make it easier to develop the 
surrounding areas because these individuals could say that the adverse impact 
is minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ormond Beach wetlands is a unique and wondrous place, a stronghold for 
several threatened and endangered species. This area has been under assault for 
many decades by being used as a landfill by the city of Oxnard and currently as 
a dump for industrial waste. 
</P>
<P>
 This last change to the discharge of Bubbling Springs Creek may be one of the 
most devastating moves yet to an endangered habitat. Has anyone seen an 
Environmental Impact Report?

 A major contribution, $1,000 from the Oxnard Elks Lodge, was overlooked in the 
Sept. 24 article regarding the new video security system at the Oxnard Public 
Library. Additionally, there have been many contributions from members of 
Friends of the Library and other concerned citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Amateur Radio Club kicked off the fund-raising for the 
system with a $1,000 donation in April, 1993. The club recently gave another 
$1,000 for the second phase of the system.

A DOG'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The story that you printed about the little cockapoo who was rescued from the 
freeway was very heartwarming. I'm sure that this story with the photos was 
responsible for getting this dog adopted. The diligent work of animal 
regulation officers and highway patrol officers saved her life once. You saved 
it a second time. Bringing the follow-up story to our attention, the fact that 
she would be euthanized (killed) because she was unclaimed and unwanted, 
certainly brought those people to the shelter willing to give her a good an 
loving home. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that this little dog's story helps to make the public aware of just how 
many wonderful dogs and cats are sitting in our shelters right now, waiting for 
a home. They don't have their pictures in the paper. There are two basic 
reasons that these animals are sitting in shelter cages. Too many people didn't 
get their animals spayed or neutered. Approximately 18,000 animals are killed 
in our county each year because they are not wanted.  
</P>
<P>
 The other reason is that people who adopt or purchase an animal do not see 
this as a lifetime commitment to the pet. At the first sign of a behavior 
problem in the animal, such as digging or chewing, instead of working with a 
reliable animal behavior consultant or even reading a book on training, the 
animal is discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that all the people who were touched by the story of the little dog 
will remember the thousands of others who need loving homes. Some of them will 
die today.

 I am writing with regard to the article "Fight Grows Over Missing Dog" on Oct. 
2.  
</P>
<P>
 I am the owner of several dogs and currently have my dogs Identichipped, which 
is a microchip. The microchip is the AKC-recommended form of identification for 
dogs.  
</P>
<P>
 Had Lady/Cassie been microchipped, there would be no questions as to her 
identity. The animal control officers could simply pass the scanner over the 
dog and determine immediately if in fact she was the Frenches' dog.  
</P>
<P>
 Had Lady/Cassie been microchipped, it would have minimized the Frenches' 
heartache, eased Ms. Warwick's doubts and saved us the taxpayers the cost, 
which we will ultimately bear, for the lawsuit and the enforcement.

SIMI TO BUILD NEW BOYS & GIRLS CLUB; RECREATION: THE CITY APPROVES $3.3 MILLION 
FOR A 25,000-SQUARE-FOOT BUILDING NEAR CITY HALL. THE GROUP WILL PAY $1.5 
MILLION FOR A 45-YEAR LEASE.

<P>
 More than a decade after pledging to better serve Simi Valley children, the 
City Council on Monday agreed to pour $3.3 million in city funds into a new 
Boys & Girls Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many cities help Boys & Girls Clubs, Simi Valley's plan to build a 
new club is noteworthy, said Neil Macready, the clubs' director of development 
in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one is, I think, exceptional," Macready said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is the envy of the six other local Boys & Girls Clubs. Most receive 
subsidized rent and thousands of dollars in city support each year, but nothing 
quite so grand as the Simi Valley project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very generous of Simi Valley to do this," said Jane Goldschmidt, 
executive director of the Ventura club. "We've received some very nice grants 
from Ventura, but certainly not enough to build a new building." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Simi Valley will construct a 25,000-square-foot building 
near City Hall and pay its full $3.3-million cost. The 2,000-member club is now 
squeezed into an old school building at the east end of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club, which will share the building with the city's parks 
district, has agreed to pay $1.5 million for a 45-year lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton acknowledged that the deal is unusual, 
especially for a city government that prides itself on pinching every penny. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a unique agreement, but if you look at the numbers, this is a very 
young city," Stratton said. "We've built and run a center for our seniors, but 
up to now we've done very little for the youth. This is our way of turning that 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Club President Timothy Shannon said the organization hopes to pay off the 
45-year lease within eight years and is planning a five-year fund-raising 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people see that this is really going to happen, I think we'll get a lot 
of community support," Shannon said. "This is really going to benefit everyone 
in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Club directors began trying to relocate in the early 1980s, when a developer 
promised to build a new club in exchange for city approval of a housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
 When that deal fell through, club leaders looked to the city for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognized the need for a place for kids to go, but we didn't have any old 
buildings sitting around that we could give them," Stratton said. "So instead, 
we offered them a piece of property." 
</P>
<P>
 The city pledged money for the structure, too, after club officials said that 
they could not raise the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was initially set for construction in 1992. But it has been held 
up by a legal dispute with a neighboring property owner, who argued that the 
new club would block his view. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court refused to hear the owner's appeal in May, clearing 
the way for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "After hundreds and hundreds of hours of planning and talking and working to 
make this happen, I couldn't be happier to see that this is finally going 
forward," board member Linda White said. "I think we're all really thrilled."

RARE ADVICE; STUDENTS COPE WITH COUNTYWIDE SHORTAGE OF HIGH SCHOOL COUNSELORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oak Park High School, where nine out of 10 students go on to college, has only 
one counselor for 660 students -- one of the worst ratios in a county woefully 
short of counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park students complain that the ratio -- which is about twice as high as 
the statewide norm -- is so poor they simply don't bother with counseling 
services. And that worries counselor Tess Wilkoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something gets neglected for one student's college application this year 
because of a fragmentation," she said. "That is when it becomes detrimental." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park's problems are echoed countywide, where financially burdened school 
districts have reduced the number of counselors in past years. 
</P>
<P>
 Counselors schedule classes for students, help them apply for college and 
financial aid, administer the required statewide tests and deal with social 
issues, such as child abuse or sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the wide variety and increasing number of cases she handles every day, 
Wilkoff, 44, said she fears someone's problem will slip through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think of all the types of interactions that come in and out if this 
office every day," she said, "it leaves me with a feeling of being fragmented 
and feeling like I haven't met all the needs that are out there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Student-to-counselor ratios vary across Ventura County, but Oak Park's is 
among the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura Unified, for example, the ratio is 400-to-1 and in Simi Valley 
Unified it is 576-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Conejo Valley Unified School District the ratio has swelled to more 
than 600-to-1. Newbury Park High School, for instance, has two full-time and 
one part-time counselor for about 1,500 students. Thousand Oaks has as many as 
four for about 2,200 students, far exceeding the 400-to-1 ration recommended in 
counselors' contracts with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide guidelines suggest a ratio of 300-to-1, but educators acknowledge 
that ratios are typically about 450-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park Unified Supt. Marilyn Lippiatt said a district committee is looking 
into the high school's counseling situation, but cautioned that funds for 
another position are limited. A full-time counselor could cost $40,000 to 
$50,000, with an added $20,000 in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "With no additional income, we are going to have to be very selective about 
our priorities," she said. "It will literally mean we will have to give up 
something to add services." 
</P>
<P>
 But school officials say another counselor is needed. "It is a priority as far 
as we are concerned," said Principal Jeff Chancer. "My goal is to get a 
part-time counselor here." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park High currently enrolls about 660 students, compared to 617 last year. 
The sudden influx of new students has been attributed to the community's rapid 
growth and the district's academic reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park students have consistently outperformed their peers around the county 
on standardized tests, and the district's schools have garnered numerous awards 
for academic excellence. The percentage of graduating seniors going on to 
college is one of the highest in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But given the rapid development of Oak Park and the school's enrollment boom, 
administrators there are struggling with how to manage that growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkoff and many Oak Park students said adding a new counselor to the school 
would be a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hearing, 'We need two of you here,' " she said of the student's response 
to the situation. "I would love to see an additional counselor here, part time 
or full time. It would relieve a lot of the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Rheana Mantooth, a junior who had to wait two days for a counseling 
appointment last week, said students are frustrated with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I come into the office to talk to her, there is usually a long line 
in front of her door," 16-year-old Rheana said. "In no way is she insufficient, 
it's just the ratio between students and counselor is greater." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students forgo counselor visits because of the usual two-day wait. "I 
would like to see her, but it is impossible to get an appointment, so I don't 
bother," said Robert Weide, a 16-year-old junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tess is a really nice lady, and she tries her best, but she needs help," said 
freshman Amanda Vinson. "I think just to add at least one more counselor would 
cut her load in half."

NOTEBOOK; DUAL-MEET LOSS ISN'T A CONCERN FOR IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no need to feel too sorry for Irvine, the defending State Division I 
girls' cross-country champion that lost last week to Corona del Mar in a Sea 
View League meet. The Vaqueros aren't concerned nearly as much about October 
results as November ones. And that's one of the reasons Irvine -- then-ranked 
No. 1 -- didn't have the county's top runner, Jessica Corbin, in the lineup 
during its 23-32 dual-meet loss to Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 The story can be traced to the beginning of the season, when Corbin had hip 
problems -- her muscle was putting pressure on a sciatic nerve. As part of the 
treatment, Irvine Coach Randy Rossi said, Corbin was prescribed heavy doses of 
ibuprofen, which caused some internal bleeding; Corbin lost some strength, 
became susceptible to illness and developed viral bronchitis. She wasn't able 
to participate in the team's faster-paced workouts and her condition didn't 
improve. 
</P>
<P>
 So Rossi decided to let Corbin rest last week. "We didn't want to lose to 
Corona del Mar, but the more important meets are farther down the road," Rossi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with the Orange County Championships, which are Saturday morning at 
Irvine Regional Park, but even that meet might not foreshadow what will happen 
later. Irvine was eighth last year but went on to win the State title, and 
times from the State meet indicated the Vaqueros would have been the county's 
best team in any division. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will find that situations will change from Oct. 15 to (next month) when 
you run the section and State finals," Rossi said. "It is important and we want 
to run well, but if I had my choice, I'd rather be my best in late November." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine was second in the state in 1992 and finished fourth the two seasons 
before that. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna-Kaisa Niemi, an exchange student from Finland, Erin Livermore, Stacey 
McMullen and Rachel Newhouse are just as important as a healthy Corbin to 
produce similar results. 
</P>

 Sunny Hills water polo, arguably Orange County's most dominant program the 
past 25 years, suffered a rare loss Wednesday. Troy beat the Lancers, 11-10, in 
overtime, becoming only the second team to beat Sunny Hills in a Freeway League 
game since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Troy's first victory over Sunny Hills in league play in 27 years of 
water polo. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy's first-year coach, Chris Dyer, had been around for only five of those 
seasons -- four as a player and one as an assistant coach -- but that didn't 
diminish his joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunny Hills kind of had a stranglehold on us, so it felt really, really good 
to beat them," Dyer said. "I was jumping around so much I almost fell in the 
pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills' last league loss came in 1991 to Buena Park, ending a Southern 
Section record for consecutive league victories (120). Now the Lancers are 
133-2 since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't complain too much," Sunny Hills Coach Keith Nighswonger said, 
"except that loss No. 2 was the last game we played. That's the only thing that 
dampens that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills reached the section Division II title game last season, but only 
one starter and one reserve returned. The Lancers have won only three of their 
16 games this season, but Nighswonger still sees an attainable goal for his 
team. Sunny Hills has won a section-record 24 league titles in a row, and the 
Lancers still have four league games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Nighswonger also has a message for the rest of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably our most vulnerable season," he said, "so you better enjoy 
it while you can." 
</P>

 San Clemente, ranked No. 1 in Division I, plays host to No. 2 Long Beach 
Wilson in nonleague water polo at 6:45 tonight at Saddleback College, but it 
might not be the only time the teams meet this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and San Clemente are seeded Nos. 1 and 2 at the inaugural Southern 
California Invitational Friday and Saturday at Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament also includes No. 3 Corona del Mar, No. 4 Foothill, Servite 
(ranked No. 1 in Division II) and San Diego Section power Coronado. The title 
game is scheduled for 4:45 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament is the brainchild of Foothill Coach Jim Brumm and Wilson Coach 
Ricardo Azevedo, who patterned it after the California State Invitational, a 
Northern California event that matches eight teams from the north and eight 
from the south. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Orange County tournament, which began Monday, also is set for Friday 
and Saturday. It features three teams ranked in the county's top 10: No. 6 
Brea-Olinda, No. 9 Newport Harbor and No. 10 Costa Mesa. The round-robin title 
games are at 3, 6 and 9 p.m., Saturday at Independence Park in Fullerton.

 Five of the six girls' volleyball teams in the Sunset League are ranked in the 
top 10 in Orange County or Southern Section Division I, and newcomers Los 
Alamitos and Esperanza are struggling in their new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos (1-5), the defending section Division II champion that finished 
18-1 last season, and Esperanza (2-4), opened league play with two losses each. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm searching for something to say to the kids because we're not used to 
having four losses this early in the season," Esperanza Coach Kurt Kersten 
said. "Two very good teams from this league are going to miss the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza, which finished 16-3 last season, lost to Edison and Huntington 
Beach. Los Alamitos lost to eighth-ranked Marina and Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two Orange County top 10 matchups highlight the girls' volleyball schedule on 
Thursday. Second-ranked Huntington Beach plays at No. 3 Edison in the Sunset 
League and No. 5 Sunny Hills plays at No. 6 La Habra in the Freeway League. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday No. 9 Calvary Chapel is at No. 8 Marina. Also, the Garden Grove 
League's best meet today when Los Amigos (6-2, 5-0) plays host to Pacifica 
(6-2, 5-0) at 5 p.m.

 UCLA's softball staff is doing all it can to get one of its top recruits, 
Cypress shortstop Julie Adams. At last Tuesday's Cypress-Kennedy volleyball 
game, the Bruin softball team showed up to cheer on Adams and the Centurions.

</P>
<P>
 Which football league is best? The Sunset League has four teams in the Orange 
County Top 10 and the six teams in the league have a combined record of 21-9. 
But the Sunset League doesn't have the best combined record against nonleague 
opponents. That honor belongs to the Orange League, which has a 22-7-1 record 
and is the home to unbeaten Anaheim and Western. 
</P>
<P>
 Following are the Sea View (19-11), Century (16-13-1), South Coast (16-14), 
Pacific Coast (15-15), Freeway (13-17), Garden Grove (11-12), Empire (10-20) 
and Golden West (6-24) leagues.

 Jacobs, the county leader in pass receptions, kept giving the Comanches 
chances to pull out a victory Friday against Corona -- on defense. Jacobs 
intercepted three passes in the fourth quarter, but Corona shut down the Canyon 
offense after the first two.On the third, Jacobs returned the ball 58 yards 
before going out of bounds at the 31 with five seconds left. "He knew he wasn't 
going to score and he was very aware of the clock," Canyon assistant Loren 
Shumer said, "so he stepped out of bounds." Clay Kilbarger then kicked a 
46-yard field goal to give Canyon a 6-3 victory. Jacobs shares the county 
interception lead with five. Cross-country

COUNTY'S UNREGISTERED VOTERS ARE THE LIFE OF THE PARTIES; POLITICS: TODAY IS 
THE DEADLINE TO SIGN NEW ELECTORS. THE REPUBLICANS ARE OUT TO REGAIN THE 
DEMOCRATS' SOLE LEGISLATIVE SEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On this balmy autumn afternoon, the political mercenaries are out looking for 
new recruits for the big war that is just four weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
 A frazzled-looking young woman bites her thumbnail as she roams the parking 
lot of a Lucky supermarket in Santa Ana -- ground zero for the Orange County 
battle in a year when Democrats nationwide are struggling to keep their 
legislative seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Clutching a clipboard, the woman asks shoppers to register to vote before 
today's deadline and then almost scolds them when they say, "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't vote? Do you pay taxes?" she shouts to one man as he rolls past her 
on in-line skates. "Take a stand against Pete Wilson by registering Democrat to 
vote!" she yells at another man who avoids eye contact while hastily grabbing a 
shopping cart. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few paces away, a Newport Beach retiree takes a less combative 
approach. She sits erectly in a folding chair near the entrance to the 
supermarket, her clipboard on her lap. Her Republican voter registration sign 
is posted on the brick wall behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sir, are you registered to vote?" she asks with a smile. The woman then turns 
to a visitor and explains: "This is basically a Democratic area. We are asked 
to just be more of a service than aggressive. I usually just lay back to see if 
they even speak English." 
</P>
<P>
 But she is competitive. Earlier in the week, when a Democratic Party worker 
tried to engage in one-on-one combat for some of the same shoppers, "I told him 
I was already here and there's another door," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Democratic worker seems to be under more pressure, it's because her 
party is under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year when the Democrats are expected to take a sound beating at the hands 
of Republicans in the Nov. 8 election, the local GOP is mounting an assault to 
take away the only Orange County legislative seat now held by a Democrat, the 
69th Assembly District being vacated by Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the pressure on the Democrats are charges by Republicans that they 
have artificially inflated voter registration rolls in central Orange County, 
where both parties are battling for control. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) has vowed to spot check the list of 
Democratic voters that gets turned in before today's voter registration 
deadline, and he plans to monitor the polls in central Orange County on 
Election Day to ensure that no Democrat attempts to vote twice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats claim the Republican threats are attempts to intimidate Latinos from 
voting in an area of the county that has a large minority population. They 
contend that the GOP is simply angry that Democrats have climbed to a 22-point 
voter registration edge over Republicans in the 69th District, which includes 
parts of Santa Ana, Anaheim and Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats deny the Republican charge that they have registered non-citizen 
Latinos to vote. On the other hand, Democrats allege that Republicans have 
illegally registered non-citizens in the Vietnamese community in past 
elections, a charge the GOP denies. 
</P>
<P>
 Proving these allegations, said Donald Tanney, the county's registrar of 
voters, is nearly impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet you every campaign has had problems," he said, adding that his office 
is constantly fielding voter complaints about both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, at the urging of Conroy and other local Republican officials, Tanney 
ran a computer check of duplicate voter registrations for all political parties 
and purged 4,053 names. The duplications could have been caused by a computer 
error, or because people re-registered under new names -- most likely the 
result of marriages or divorces, Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no evidence to prove Republican charges of voter fraud by 
Democrats, he added. "We found not one that attempted to vote twice in the same 
election," Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans and Democrats concede that some of the perceived abuses in the 
voter registration programs come from a practice often used by both sides: the 
hiring of "bounty hunters" who are paid for each new voter registration card 
they turn in to their political bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 69th District, the hunt for new voters before today's deadline has been 
intense. 
</P>
<P>
 As he pounded the pavement Saturday in search of voters at the Lucky 
supermarket in Santa Ana, 48-year-old James E. Jackson says he was drawn to the 
Democratic cause by money. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployed Anaheim resident says the Democrats are paying him $5.40 per 
hour for a six-hour shift, but he could boost his pay to $3 per card if he 
turns in more than 10 new Democratic voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go out and bust your butt and if you bring in more than your salary, 
you get paid more," Jackson says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson complains that he isn't having a good day. He has collected 10 
cards so far, but he says he would have had many more if four Democrats -- 
non-paid volunteers -- had not shown up and competed with him earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican who is also competing with him, Newport Beach resident Marge 
Price, says she was not doing it for the money; she just wants to help her 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she is getting paid $5 an hour, with a chance to earn $2 for every 
voter registration card if she averages more than two cards per hour. During 
her first three hours on duty, she has collected only six voter registrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no major problems have so far appeared with the voter registration 
drives now ending, Tanney warns potential voters to check with the county if 
their voter identification cards do not arrive two weeks before the election -- 
particularly if the voter was registered by a member of the opposite party. The 
law requires campaign workers to turn in all registration cards they collect, 
but that does not always happen, Tanney said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite possible that a person is not going to get paid if he mails a card 
for the wrong party," Tanney said. "The card may get thrown away. We have heard 
stories, but you cannot verify them because we don't have the evidence, sad to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Tanney's office discovered a batch of voter registration cards 
turned in by local Democrats that were believed to be fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like some creative writing was being done," Tanney said. "We called 
the campaign and referred it to the district attorney." He said the campaign 
voluntarily purged the cards that were collected by the person under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has not been resolved, Tanney said, adding that he expects little 
will come out of it, as in most other complaints involving voter registration. 
"The reality is: It's not a high priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Guerry, who was hired by Democratic leaders in Sacramento to run their 
Orange County voter registration program, downplayed the episode. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all been taken care of," Guerry said. "Someone was turning in good 
ones (voter registration cards) with bad ones. Unfortunately, there are some 
people who are more concerned about money."

GRADE SCANDAL BLAMED ON CONFUSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN and MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Massive confusion about policies and job responsibilities plagued Brea Olinda 
High School during the time when hundreds of student grades were illegally 
changed, but no employee willfully broke the law, according to a new report. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Wenkart and Val Fadely, attorneys for the Orange County Department of 
Education who were asked to investigate the transcript-tampering scandal, 
suggested in their report to the school board Monday night that it draft clear 
policies and job descriptions.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was a great deal of confusion, misunderstanding and miscommunication," 
Fadely told the board. "There was a lack of policies and a lack of consensus 
about what district practices were." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite about 75 hours of interviews with 26 current and former district 
employees, many questions remain, in part because many employees offered 
conflicting explanations about the situation, said the attorneys, who were 
peppered with questions from school board members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a lot of different answers when we asked questions," Wenkart said. 
"This is much more complicated than we thought when we got into it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think you need to decide which decisions should be made at the school level 
and by whom, which decisions should be made at the district office and which 
decisions should be made by the board. That's an issue you need to grapple 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 In a closed session, school board members discussed whether to discipline any 
employees involved in the grade changing but did not reach a conclusion. Supt. 
Peggy Lynch said the trustees need time to review the 27-page, single-spaced 
report. Some board members have previously said they would consider firing 
employees because of the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have some problems to wrestle with regarding personnel," board 
President Susie D. Sokol said at the end of Monday's open meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 An audit of the school's records this summer showed about 600 transcript 
changes, affecting nearly 300 students in the classes of 1994, 1995 and 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of course titles were changed, letter grades were illegally switched 
to "pass" notations and scores of students received double credit when they 
repeated courses in which they received poor grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted upon learning of the transcript changes in May to 
correct the record and immediately lower the district graduation requirements 
to the state's minimum so no students would be held back. 
</P>
<P>
 In their report, the attorneys said the practice of giving "pass" notations 
dates back to 1978-79 but has spun out of control over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members and the attorneys on Monday attributed part of the problem to 
major turnover in counseling and administrative staff at the high school and to 
glitches in the computer software program used to record grades. The attorneys 
recommended training employees to use school computer software. 
</P>
<P>
 Some trustees and teachers, however, were not satisfied with that explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everybody was aware that changing grades was not appropriate, and it was 
still done, why did it happen?" Trustee Bernie Kilcoyne asked in an interview 
after the meeting. "In my opinion, this shouldn't have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Burgard, a longtime Spanish teacher at the school, was one of several 
people steaming in the crowd as the attorneys presented their report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was whitewash," Burgard said after the meeting. "I'm angry that 
they would say that this was all accident. . . . I'm so mad, I hope the board 
has the gumption to take care of the source." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators have previously said a former counselor and former registrar 
were responsible for the bulk of the changes, but trustee Todd Spitzer said 
Monday night that the attorneys' full report indicates the entire counseling 
staff at times changed grades and course titles on the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Spitzer, and several school staff members in the audience, expressed outrage 
that the school board was not notified of the situation until a teacher filed a 
grievance last May. Principal Don Johnson learned of the grade changing as 
early as July, 1993, and discussed it with about a half-dozen staff members 
throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was nothing that wrong or bad, then why didn't anybody just come to 
us?" Spitzer said during the meting. "It's completely common sense, anybody who 
ever went to school knows you don't change teachers' grades, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Education Code, teachers must be notified if 
grades are to be changed. Administrators can only change grades in case of 
clerical error, fraud, bad faith or incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
 Spitzer, who has been outspoken regarding the grade changes, said he was 
dissatisfied with attorneys' report and asked for full transcripts of the 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every category, everybody's pointing at everybody else," he said angrily. 
"There's complete contradiction here." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the attorneys' recommendations were to develop an atmosphere in which 
school employees feel comfortable telling superiors about problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Tennison and Joanne Rizuto, two former employees who blew the whistle on 
the scandal, were among many in the crowd upset that district officials were 
not told when the grade changes were first discovered.

HOUSING ACTIVISTS SEEK AFFORDABLE S. COUNTY UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It began with a small meeting of a dozen South County residents interested in 
a prickly issue: creating affordable housing in one of the most expensive parts 
of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Today that little group has grown into a quietly busy and growing platoon of 
advocates for low-income housing, lobbying and keeping watch over use of funds 
earmarked for residential projects to benefit low-income people. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are savoring their first victory as the nonprofit Mary Erickson 
Foundation. In August, the group closed escrow on an eight-unit, $590,000 
apartment complex on West Canada, for which the city of San Clemente 
contributed $225,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariners Bank provided a $265,000 loan, and the county put up the rest of the 
funds.  
</P>
<P>
 The real estate buy capped more than two years of tedium, but it has given the 
group a successful start upon which to build. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's remarkable that we were able to do it," said Lee Steelman, 
president of the South Orange County Community Services Council, which had held 
that first meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50 South County residents now make up five advocacy groups in San 
Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, Dana Point, Laguna Beach and Laguna Niguel. Lake 
Forest is next on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation members, including a banker, a company president, a contractor and 
a real estate consultant, have chosen a method of gentle yet firm persuasion. 
They are well versed in the world of financing and South County demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent San Juan Capistrano Planning Commission meeting, Jessica Dean and 
Pauline Leonard introduced themselves as part of the San Juan Housing Advocates 
and told the panel that 31% of the city's residents qualified as low-income. 
They also gently reminded city leaders of their legal and moral obligation to 
provide some low-income housing and recalled that the city had about $1 million 
set aside, but languishing, to do just that. And they offered their "support." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to stay," Dean told the council. "We're serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary La Husen, foundation board chairwoman, said the group intends to take a 
patient approach to the difficult issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be," La Husen said. "Otherwise, we'd have been gone by now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 La Husen said the group is putting more effort into buying existing rental 
properties than building new projects, which requires expensive raw land. 
Still, Husen said, "one of the problems with acquiring affordable housing by 
the beach (is) the prices are high." 
</P>
<P>
 The $590,000 for the San Clemente apartment complex was below asking price and 
close to the appraised value, La Husen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rents for the foundation-owned apartments, which have two or three bedrooms, 
range from $450 to $550. Before the property changed hands, rents were between 
$700 and $900. 
</P>
<P>
 La Husen said most of the tenants are families who earn minimum wage, or a few 
dollars more per hour, working in service jobs in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is housing for low-income families with children -- the lost 
generation," said Leonard, a senior citizen who realizes that her own age group 
competes for the same money for affordable housing in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Korsgaard, foundation vice chairman, said, "We do have people down here 
who are homeless, and there are people who are paying too much for rent." 
(Korsgaard is president of Mariners Bank, which made the loan for the San 
Clemente complex.)  
</P>
<P>
 Leonard said city officials there have come to respect the housing advocates, 
who named their group after a San Clemente schoolteacher who was instrumental 
in urging city officials to spend special funds for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities are required by the state to file housing plans, showing a range of 
scenarios to meet future needs, including lower-income housing, said Cystal 
Sims, director of litigation for Legal Aid Society of Orange County. Cities 
with redevelopment agencies must commit a certain amount of money on moderate- 
and low-income homes.  
</P>
<P>
 But many are slow to move such projects forward, Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Friess, former mayor of San Juan Capistrano and a member of the 
foundation's advisory board, said there are pockets of affordable housing in 
South County, but it ultimately will disappear as prices rise and nothing is 
built or preserved to take its place. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can get 100 units in the next 10 years," Friess said, "they will have 
made a difference."

SOUL MATES; PROJECT SHUE BRINGS SENIORS, KIDS TOGETHER TO LEARN FROM ONE 
ANOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Lucy Witt is 59 and does not speak a word of Vietnamese. Hiep Duong is 7. He 
has been in the United States just two years, and hardly speaks English. 
</P>
<P>
 But barriers of age, culture and language disappear when the unlikely pair get 
together five times a week under Project SHUE, a program that brings seniors 
and children together to share and learn from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Project SHUE pairs seniors with latchkey kids in an after-school program at 
the Westminster Senior Center. The program was designed to help "at-risk" 
children as well as provide extra income for retirees. It is funded through 
private donations and federal community development block grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it wonderful that these two groups who really need each other could 
come together?" said Betty Goyne, who started the program three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The name Project SHUE (Safety, Health, Understanding and Education) comes from 
the nursery rhyme about an old woman who lived in a shoe and had so many 
children she didn't know what to do, said Goyne, supervisor of the senior 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the 30 seniors are paid a small stipend, many are volunteers, 
including Orpha Price, 85, who teaches music and plays the piano for the 
children. The 6- to 9-year-olds live in apartments on Westminster Boulevard 
across the street from the center. Most speak Vietnamese or Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings back a lot of memories," said Price, who volunteers for an hour on 
Wednesday afternoons. "I taught piano to kids on my street during World War II, 
and that got them off the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Price said she teaches music the way she learned it from her mother: imitating 
the sounds and the words. She says she feels like she is handing down American 
tradition by teaching popular children's songs. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she wished she could spend more time teaching her own 10 
grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt, another retiree, said the opportunity to work again and be around 
children was a blessing. "I feel that finally, I'm doing what I wanted to do," 
said Witt, who came to California from Missouri as a bride in 1958. "I had 
always wanted to be a schoolteacher, but never had the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a grandparent, Witt said she enjoys the company of children, "especially 
those whose culture I didn't know before. . . . I have a lot more patience now 
than when I was raising my two boys." 
</P>
<P>
 The program also includes some younger volunteers like Sara King, 17, who 
helps the children with their homework and supervises art lessons. King said 
volunteering at the center has helped eradicate some of her own resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Any resentment against other races goes away when you are with small 
children," King said. "Sometimes, you only see the negative side -- that they 
don't speak English. But they're trying to adapt. They seem to be happy kids." 
</P>
<P>
 King said that she helps the children with their homework, reads stories to 
them, and supervises them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty children are currently enrolled in Project SHUE, Goyne said. This year, 
she said, fourth- and fifth-graders, who were in the program before, are 
serving as mentors to the younger children. Some parents have started to 
volunteer as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the kids feel better that their parents are there," Goyne said. "The 
parents, too, learn to speak English better." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Goyne said, some seniors were against the Senior Center opening its 
doors to children, fearing that the youngsters would disrupt their activities. 
As it turned out, those fears were unfounded:The after-school program begins at 
2:30 p.m., when most of the seniors have already left for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, the camaraderie between the senior volunteers and the 
children was evident as Witt and Hiep worked on an art project. 
</P>
<P>
 Using hand gestures, Witt coaxed Hiep into putting together colored cutouts of 
Winnie the Pooh. The boy grinned broadly. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's my friend," he said, hugging Witt.

MAN SOUGHT IN SLAYING OF FORMER GIRLFRIEND; CRIME: POLICE SAY THE SUSPECT, WHO 
WAS UNDER COURT ORDER TO STAY AWAY FROM THE VICTIM, WAS SEEN RUNNING FROM HER 
ORANGE APARTMENT SHORTLY AFTER SHE WAS SHOT DEAD WHILE HER TWO CHILDREN SLEPT.

<P>
 A woman who had a court order to keep her ex-boyfriend away was shot to death 
Sunday night as her daughters slept, and police are looking for the boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Maria DelMarie Alcocer, 25, suffered multiple gunshot wounds to 
the upper torso and was pronounced dead in the apartment in the 3800 block of 
Garden Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities on Monday were seeking James Allen Booker, Alcocer's former 
boyfriend, who was reported seen running from the apartment shortly after shots 
were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old laborer and bodybuilder took a cross-country bus from Detroit 
late last week to win back the woman with whom he had lived off and on for four 
years before their break-up in August, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 After the split, Alcocer obtained a restraining order to keep Booker away and 
tried to persuade him to turn back during several telephone calls he made while 
traveling from Detroit, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was jilted," said Lt. Timm Browne, a spokesman for the Orange Police 
Department. "After the dispute in August, he left. She got a restraining order. 
. . . She didn't want him back in the residence." 
</P>
<P>
 Booker was arrested in Orange last year on suspicion of abusing Alcocer, 
Browne said. Booker also was charged in Santa Ana in 1992 with attacking 
Alcocer's father with a deadly weapon, a misdemeanor, authorities said.

 The 1992 incident began with an argument between Booker and Maria Alcocer as 
they watched television at her father's house in Santa Ana, according to Santa 
Ana Police Lt. Robert Helton. Booker left the house but returned 30 minutes 
later, demanding that Maria Alcocer leave with him, Helton said. Luis Alcocer 
intervened, grabbing a fireplace shovel, but Booker took it away and struck him 
in the side of the head, Helton said. Booker was arrested four months later on 
a warrant, Helton said. Helton did not know how the case was decided.  
</P>
<P>
 Alcocer obtained the court order after the two broke up, Browne said. Booker 
subsequently moved to Detroit but got on a bus last Thursday in hopes of 
reconciling, Browne said. Booker called Alcocer along the way, and she tried to 
talk him out of returning, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She kept telling him, 'Don't bother,' " Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcocer was on the telephone with a friend about 11 p.m. Sunday night when 
someone removed a screen and climbed into the first-floor apartment through a 
window, Browne said. Neighbors called to report gunfire and witnesses said they 
recognized Booker running away, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcocer's 4- and 6-year-old daughters, who are not related to Booker, were 
asleep in another room during the shooting and did not wake up. They were 
carried sleeping to a neighbor's apartment where relatives came for them, Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents at the 104-unit Park City Apartments were shaken by the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very nice person and took good care of her children," said a 
next-door neighbor, who asked that her name not be used. The neighbor said the 
couple had moved in about a year ago and seemed to get along well. 
</P>
<P>
 "They always seemed pleasant. He always took the children anywhere he went. He 
seemed very nice," said the neighbor.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA HABRA; DRYING CLOTHES IN THE FRONT YARD WON'T WASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though the City Council has adopted an ordinance allowing residents to 
use clotheslines, it banned any clothes drying on front yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, which Councilman William D. Mahoney said will keep La Habra from 
"oppressing poor people," is being seen the opposite way by residents who heard 
of the new law this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are already poor. A lot of people will continue drying their clothes in 
their front yards because they have no place else to dry their clean clothes," 
said Juan Maciel, a longtime Grace Avenue resident. "The city is making life 
even tougher for poor people. Not only can we not afford to buy dryers, but now 
we won't be able to pay the fines if we get cited for drying our clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lee Risner said it is unlikely the city will fine residents for 
violating the new law and that if people are caught drying laundry on front 
yards, the city "will do whatever it can to help the residents solve the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members had postponed voting on the ordinance five times since July, 
when outraged residents accused them of trying to discriminate against the 
poor. The original ordinance proposed banning clotheslines in front and side 
yards visible from the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The law prohibits people from drying clothes on front yards altogether. But 
most residents will be allowed to dry clothes on side yards, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot has been made of the clothesline situation," Mahoney said at last 
week's council meeting. "We're just going to have to learn that you can't make 
everybody buy dryers. . . . I don't want to go out and tell poor people, 'You 
can't dry clothes.' Let's just say what we're trying to say." 
</P>
<P>
 While some residents dislike the ordinance and predict that it will cause 
financial hardships, others are happy it will allow them to continue drying 
their clothes on their side yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad I'll still be able to dry my clothes on the fence beside my home," 
said Carmen Reyes, who had opposed the original ordinance. "At least I'll be 
able to do that."MIMI KO

KILLINGS

<P>
 Two men already in custody have been accused of the shooting deaths of a 
Huntington Beach couple in a trailer park last year, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis Scott Frederiken, 23, and Richard Darren Fleck, 29, are being held in 
the Dec. 7 deaths of Michelle Lawson, 32, and Joshua Wells, 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederiken, who was in the Davis County Jail in Utah on unrelated drug 
charges, was arraigned on first-degree murder charges on Thursday in Orange 
County. He is being held without bail in the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleck, who also was being held on drug charges in a state prison in Blythe, 
will be arraigned here later this week. He too will be charged with murder, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't really be specific about how the men were found because the 
investigation is still going on," Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Chuck Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police do not know when Fleck was incarcerated and could only say he had been 
in prison for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson and Wells were found by police lying next to each other in a trailer 
early on Dec. 7 after neighbors reported hearing gun shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are trying to determine the relationship between the two 
suspects and the victims, Thomas said.NANCY HSU

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; DRY WINDS ABATE BUT FIREFIGHTERS STAY ALERT

<P>
 The dry desert winds that put Southern California firefighters on alert over 
the weekend abated Monday, although fire officials said they are remaining 
vigilant for trouble from a lingering Santa Ana condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a year after parts of Laguna Beach were devastated by a firestorm that 
claimed 441 houses and caused $528 million in damage, fire officials said they 
were relieved Monday by a regional cooling trend.Even the smog looked good -- 
signaling the return to the dominant weather pattern of onshore winds, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Santa Ana winds are waning, fire officials said they remain on a 
high-level alert. Extra fire crews are on standby and are poised to extinguish 
blazes caused by the extremely dry conditions, which were further aggravated by 
this weekend's hot winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana winds -- compressed by high pressure over the desert and shot 
through mountain passes toward the sea -- usher in arid, fast-moving air and 
the greatest danger of brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 As an added precaution, officials will dispatch additional fire engines to 
routine fire calls and will monitor three weather stations that track wind, 
humidity and temperatures in tinder-dry hills and wilderness areas. If 
conditions warrant, officials will position strike teams in sensitive areas and 
send out patrolling fire engines. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said crews will stay on a high alert, probably until the arid 
areas receive rainfall.MARTIN MILLER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; RECALL GROUP OUSTS ACCUSED SECRETARY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 W. Snow Hume, a leader of a successful recall effort against three City 
Council members, has been forced to resign as secretary of the Fullerton 
Recalls Committee after being ordered to appear in court on vandalism charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Police last week served Hume with an order to appear in court Oct. 18 -- the 
day of the special recall election -- on charges of tearing down campaign signs 
belonging to City Council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked (Hume) to resign, and he did, mainly because of the sign issue," 
said Recalls Committee Chairman Thomas Babcock. 
</P>
<P>
 Hume, one of the most outspoken recall leaders, said he deliberately disobeyed 
a committee order to stay away from any campaign sign controversy because he 
was fed up with seeing campaign signs placed illegally throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was under explicit orders to not get involved with the sign controversy, 
but I got involved, so I had it coming," Hume said about being forced to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he did remove some signs but that he had permission from property 
owners to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Rector, an original recall proponent, will serve as the committee's 
secretary, Babcock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they charged Hume with vandalizing signs belonging to council 
candidates Peter Godfrey and Jan Flory. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they investigated the thefts of hundreds of signs belonging to 
Godfrey, Flory and recalled Councilman Don Bankhead. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; PRIORITIES ARE LISTED FOR CODE INSPECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's code enforcement office has a new priority list, approved by the 
City Council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfenced pools will be top priorities, for example, but trash cans and cars 
parked on lawns will go to the bottom of the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Code enforcement officers receive about 2,000 calls a year, according to 
senior enforcement officer Jim Morrie. The priority list will allow the 
officers to devote energy to a task force established to launch a citywide 
attack on blight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force -- which includes officers from police, health, public works 
and the fire departments -- will approach property owners in deteriorating 
areas to resolve violations that make neighborhoods vulnerable to crime, Morrie 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group currently works in the Jackson-Fillmore area of the city but will 
expand into more neighborhoods after Jan. 1, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all council members were enthusiastic about the idea of making any code 
violation a low priority, although Morrie assured them that every violator will 
at least receive an advisory letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Donna L. Chessen said that a car parked on a lawn would be a high 
priority to a neighbor living next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Arthur C. Brown summed up the prevailing view, however: "Is it more 
important to attack blight in a neighborhood where crime is growing or go after 
some guy for leaving his trash can out?" Brown asked. LESLEY WRIGHT

 Local watchdogs who spend years berating city councils about "misuse" of 
taxpayer money or "unwarranted" increases in taxes no longer work in isolation, 
according to the credo of a new countywide group. 
</P>
<P>
 The multicounty Committees of Correspondence now meets monthly in Orange to 
offer aid, strategizing and networking to lonely anti-government 
activists.Watchdogs from 31 cities have joined the Committees of 
Correspondence, along with such groups as United We Stand. 
</P>
<P>
 The stated goal of members is to "achieve unity in the battle against 
oppressive taxes and acts of tyranny by government," according to a mission 
statement drafted by Bill Mello of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's W. Snow Hume, for example, gave about 80 participants some 
tongue-in-cheek and legitimate background on the workings of municipal 
redevelopment agencies at the group's third meeting last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blindness, madness and death," he began. "Is it tertiary-stage syphilis or 
just redevelopment agencies?" 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hume, the invisible hand of socialism can be found behind every 
city's redevelopment agency. He noted that the agencies -- which technically 
are charged with redeveloping blighted areas -- are funded by property taxes 
and require that 20% of all redevelopment create affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Schlahta of San Bernardino offered some quick advice on how best to 
approach residents when gathering signatures for referendums and recall 
petitions. "We don't educate them, we don't argue with them, we don't do 
anything but get them to sign the petition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will meet on the first Wednesday of every month at Orange City Hall, 
300 E. Chapman Ave. Because so many members are involved in election campaigns, 
no meeting is scheduled for November. LESLEY WRIGHT

 Willows were the first trees planted by the German winemakers who settled 
Anaheim in 1857. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40,000 trees, which outlined the colonists' 1,165 acres, were intended to 
keep wild horses from eating the vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 Another old-timer in the county's tree history is the eucalyptus. Introduced 
near Orange in 1870, the tree was touted as a high profit-maker. But the boom 
went bust when local eucalyptus trees failed to grow straight enough to be used 
as railroad ties. They didn't cut well for furniture-making, either.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; CHILDREN'S PROGRAM RUNS ON RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By TOM RAGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar Santoyo, 30, has been around at-risk children long enough to know how to 
handle them. 
</P>
<P>
 And the director of Save Our Youth has a theory: If you treat them with 
respect and don't look down on them or condescend in any way, then you're 
pretty much set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to dis(respect) a kid if he fools around," said Santoyo, a 1982 
graduate of Estancia High School who was born in Costa Mesa. "I cut them a 
little slack, but I know when to draw the line." 
</P>
<P>
 And, so far, the children and the SOY director have gotten along greatly since 
a recreation center opened for at-risk youngsters in May, 1993. There children 
can play pool instead of getting into trouble on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they can watch television, lift weights or do a little sparring in the 
boxing ring. If they get into trouble, they can call Santoyo on his beeper. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part things run smoothly, and SOY, located at Hamilton Street 
and Meyer Place, "has become a place to kick back and relax," Santoyo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everything in the center was donated by various organizations. "It's a 
place for the kids to come when they've had enough at home," said Santoyo, a 
part-time radio production director and announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 He made his living in radio until he discovered he liked working with children 
who come from broken homes -- a bug he picked up while working for a Milwaukee 
radio station and finding time on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he came from a stable family, Santoyo said he has found a certain 
amount of solace in being there for the youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up on the west side," said Santoyo, referring to the predominantly 
Latino neighborhood in Costa Mesa. "Back then, things weren't as bad and there 
wasn't as much violence as there is today."TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; SCHOOL FIRE THAT DID $250,000 DAMAGE WAS 
SET TO COVER CLASSROOM BURGLARY 
</P>

<P>
 Arson was the cause of a fire Sunday evening at Dr. Leroy L. Doig Intermediate 
School that resulted in an estimated $250,000 damage to three classrooms, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a case of classroom burglary with the fire set to cover up," said 
Capt. Bill Dumas, arson investigator for the Garden Grove Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began about 7:30 p.m. and was brought under control within 30 
minutes. School and fire officials declined to discuss what was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, classes were held in the school's library and cafeteria. Teachers 
who lost their classrooms were short on textbooks and other teaching materials, 
so they used the fire as a topic for classwork, which included essays and 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight years worth of my teaching is now a pile of ashes outside the door," 
said Austin Sharp, an eighth-grade English teacher whose classroom was 
burglarized and set on fire. "I'm like a brand-new teacher now, I have 
nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The things he'll miss most are "the stuff you can't replace," Sharp said, 
including videos of past drama productions, letters from former students, and 
student portfolios from the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal James Smith said he doesn't know when classrooms will be 
reconstructed. For now, fans are set up at the doorways to disperse odor from 
the fire, and the blackened furniture has been piled in a heap for disposal. 
Smith plans to call area schools for donations of seventh- and eighth-grade 
English textbooks, as well as other teaching materials. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made in connection with the fire. The blaze is believed 
to be the first arson in the school's 32-year history, Smith said. THAO HUA

<P>
 The Fire Department has received a $5,304 grant from the state Department of 
Toxic Substances Control. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant was about $3,000 less than the department had requested, but is 
still enough to pay for a laptop computer for the city's hazardous-materials 
response crew van. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department spokesman Paul Mathias said the computer will allow 
firefighters easy access to volumes of information in cumbersome books and 
should shorten containment time for many incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach crew works in conjunction with one from Huntington Beach to 
respond to hazardous-materials emergencies in northwestern Orange County 
cities. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; SPORTS FACILITIES NOT IN NORTHWOOD PLANS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Irvine's fourth high school opens in the fall of 1997, residents will be 
paying higher taxes for a campus lacking many athletic facilities, according to 
school board member Tom Burnham. 
</P>
<P>
 When Irvine's fourth high school opens in the fall of 1997, residents will be 
paying higher taxes for campus athletic facilities, Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is asking fellow Irvine Unified School District board members to take a 
closer look at plans for the Northwood High School. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent community meeting, parents expressed concerns about the lack of 
athletic amenities planned for the new school, and the potential for overload 
at the district's existing sports facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said there is no funding for the stadium that was 
originally planned for the $28-million school. The district's only stadium is 
at Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
 A swimming pool, tennis courts and baseball field are not in the Northwood 
plans either. 
</P>
<P>
 "This needs to be a comprehensive high school," Burnham said. "This community 
has some pretty high demands." 
</P>
<P>
 Burnham said the district should not repeat the mistakes it made 14 years ago 
when it built Woodbridge High. "We just broke ground at Woodbridge to put in 
tennis courts," he said. "We just built a baseball field there three years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the district's other high schools, the construction of Northwood High 
is funded by a community facilities district tax levied on homeowners. Burnham 
said that nearby residents will be paying a "premium price" in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But district Deputy Supt. Dean Waldfogel said it is common for high schools to 
share athletic facilities: "Swimming pools and stadiums are not common 
occurrences at most high schools. Ideally, if you had the money, these 
facilities should all be on each campus. But historically, that has not been 
the case." RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; POLICE ARREST RIVERSIDE MAN IN THRIFTY 
HOLDUP

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have arrested a man identified as one of two suspects in the armed 
robbery of a Thrifty store last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie Lumica Stocker, 20, of Riverside was arrested Friday at the Probation 
Department in Orange after detectives lured him there to inquire about a 
probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Mike Handfield, who headed the team investigating the case, said that 
Stocker and a companion are suspected of robbing the Thrifty in the 9000 block 
of Chapman Avenue on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 According to their investigation, Handfield said, two men tied up the 
employees at gunpoint and fled with about $2,600 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Handfield said that the suspects wore ski masks. Stocker became a suspect 
after a store employee told police he may have recognized the voice of one of 
the robbers as that of Stocker's, who used to work at the store, Handfield 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Handfield said that investigators contacted Stocker, informed him about "a 
minor probation violation" and arrested him when he inquired about it at the 
Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocker was on probation for an offense as a juvenile, Handfield said. He is 
being held at County Jail while awaiting his arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Stocker's arrest, search warrants were served in Huntington Beach 
and Riverside, but the second suspect is still being sought, Police Lt. John 
Woods said.BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; 2 BURGLARY SUSPECTS CAUGHT AFTER CHASE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Santa Ana men whose car is believed linked to a flurry of burglaries 
countywide were arrested Sunday night after twice ramming a police cruiser 
during a brief chase, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police captured the men in Santa Ana after a patrol officer noticed 
that their red 1985 Ford Mustang fit the description of a getaway car seen 
leaving 13 store burglaries since July, Sgt. Dick Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the suspects fled when the officer tried to pull the car over shortly 
before 7 p.m. near Deere and Red Hill avenues in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 During a short chase on the northbound Costa Mesa Freeway, the suspects' car 
spun around and rammed one of the two pursuing cruisers, Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase ended minutes later when the suspects' car again rammed the cruiser, 
then stalled near Santa Fe and 2nd streets in Santa Ana, police said. The 
passenger, Vincent Tapia, 19, ran but was caught, Bowman said. The driver, 
Keith Patrick O'Brien, 24, was arrested without incident. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon on a police 
officer, felony evading arrest, conspiracy and commercial burglary. He was held 
on $50,000 bail in Orange County Jail, Lt. Sam Allevato said. Tapia, who was 
booked on suspicion of commercial burglary, conspiracy and resisting arrest, 
was held on $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were seeking to find out Monday if the two men are connected to 
a wave of commercial burglaries in Irvine, Fountain Valley, Fullerton and Yorba 
Linda since July 22. KEN ELLINGWOOD

 Undercover police arrested 37 men for soliciting prostitution during a sting

 Three female officers posing as prostitutes were involved in the 6 1/2-hour

Lt. John Woods said After an absence of two to three years, prostitutes appear 
to have returned to the street, Woods said, apparently chased out of Anaheim 
and Santa Ana.Both those cities have created police programs that target men 
soliciting prostitution. 
</P>

 "We have received information that activities have begun to reoccur," Woods 
said. He added that the "john operation," conducted from 8:30 p.m. Friday to 3 
a.m. Saturday, will be repeated.

<P>
 The Westminster School District has approved a plan to sell the library 
collection at Virginia K. Boos Elementary School for $41,000 and spend the 
money on new books for the district's other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees voted unanimously last week to sell the collection, 
which includes about 7,000 books. The school closed in June. Live Oak School 
District in Santa Cruz County purchased the collection, district spokeswoman 
Audrey Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials initially hoped to get about $27,000 for the book collection, 
Brown said, "so this is quite a bit more money than we expected. We'll be able 
to buy almost 3,000 new books." JON NALICK

LOCAL ELECTIONS / YORBA LINDA; CANDIDATES SEPARATED BY HOW THEY'D SPEND CITY 
MONEY; THE FOUR RUNNING FOR TWO CITY COUNCIL SEATS SEEM TO AGREE THINGS ARE 
GOOD THE WAY THEY ARE. THEY DIFFER ON WHAT TO FUND TO MAKE THINGS BETTER. 
</P>

<P>
 With a hefty budget reserve, enough money for expensive projects like a 
gymnasium and sports park, and a low crime rate, candidates for two seats on 
the City Council have little to bicker over except how to spend the city's 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem facing Yorba Linda residents, said council incumbent John 
M. Gullixson, is the traffic jam every morning at Esperanza Road and Imperial 
Highway.  
</P>
<P>
 "And that's not even in Yorba Linda. It's in Anaheim," Gullixson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Henry W. Wedaa, whose term is also up, is not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullixson is not the only one who sees a lack of major problems in the city. 
Christine Norris, Gene Wisner and Todd Tande, all candidates along with 
Gullixson for the council seats, share the same basic list of concerns, which 
mostly involve keeping the city the way it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Where the candidates start to diverge is in how to spend the city's money. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullixson has frequently led the effort to expand and improve the city's 
sports facilities. One pet project has been the effort to annex Esperanza High 
School from Anaheim, not for educational reasons but to gain access to the 
sports fields and gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 But Norris, a real estate agent who ran unsuccessfully two years ago, wonders 
if the city has overextended itself on building and buying sports facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest concern is, do we have the money to maintain all the new 
facilities we're building," Norris said. "I don't want to have to close 
facilities later because we don't have the money to maintain them." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Tande and Wisner would like to see more money spent on police service. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisner, a retired shoe-store owner who served on the council from 1982 to 
1992, said he would call for an increase in the number of patrol hours the city 
buys from Brea Police Department, with which it contracts for police service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 issue facing our city is public safety," Wisner said. "It's a 
concern no matter where you live, on the east side or the west." 
</P>
<P>
 Tande, a county fiscal analyst, said he would also want officers to spend more 
of their time in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think at some point we are going to need a police building in Yorba Linda. 
Officers patrolling on the east side of town have to drive all the way back to 
Brea when they arrest someone," Tande said. "That's done at the expense of 
patrol time."

IBM TO UNVEIL LATEST SHOT AT MICROSOFT INC.; COMPUTERS: BIG BLUE'S NEW OS/2 
WARP SYSTEM IS AIMED AT TAKING BUSINESS AWAY FROM THE DOMINANT PC INDUSTRY 
PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 IBM Corp. today hopes to sneak through a window of opportunity created by the 
folks who wrote the book on Windows -- Microsoft Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 At a media event in New York, IBM will unveil a bells-and-whistles version of 
its 7-year-old operating system for personal computers, OS/2, which until now 
has been a costly and embarrassing failure. The Armonk, N.Y., computer giant 
will pump $50 million into a high-profile advertising campaign to promote the 
product, due in stores late this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The new version, OS/2 Warp, is designed to appeal to home and small-business 
users, and, unlike earlier versions, it has drawn high praise from reviewers. 
With Warp, IBM launches perhaps its last, best campaign to unseat or at least 
unnerve Microsoft, the industry's dominant player, which has delayed the 
rollout of its own new operating system, Windows 95, until mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The war's not over," said Mike Nolan, manager of consumer software marketing 
for IBM's Personal Software Products division in Boca Raton, Fla. "A very 
exciting battle is coming up." 
</P>
<P>
 As Warp makes its debut, rumors continue to move at warp speed through Silicon 
Valley and Wall Street that IBM and Apple Computer Inc. are finally close to 
agreement on a common standard for personal computers that use the snazzy 
PowerPC chip, jointly developed by IBM, Apple and Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an agreement would enable Apple, IBM and possibly others to sell PCs that 
use one another's software -- thus bridging the gap that has long separated 
Apple from the rest of the industry and possibly posing a real threat to 
industry standard PCs that use Intel Corp. chips and Microsoft software. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies say they are optimistic that an agreement will be reached soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Machines based on the Intel-Microsoft combination have dominated the PC 
business for years, reaping immense profits for those two firms while leaving 
the rest to struggle with thin profit margins and mount one futile attempt 
after another to find alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 A few believers say OS/2 Warp might finally begin to make a dent, though they 
agree that IBM faces an uphill battle.

 "It looks to me that IBM has finally found the right combination to make OS/2 
a hit," said William F. Zachmann, president of Canopus Research, a market 
research firm in Duxbury, Mass. "The folks at Microsoft are getting a little 
edgy about the whole thing." He likes the idea that OS/2 Warp can be installed 
right over Windows or DOS so users can still run all their existing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Several analysts on Monday praised OS/2 Warp for offering great value at a 
projected price of less than $100. It requires far less memory than earlier 
versions -- or than Windows 95 is likely to demand -- and comes equipped with 
several applications, such as a spreadsheet, faxing capabilities, personal 
information manager and access to the Internet.  
</P>
<P>
 But some doubt it will capture significant market share. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warp is a vast improvement" over OS/2, said David Coursey, editor of P.C. 
Letter, an industry newsletter. "Its proponents might even say it does more now 
than Windows 95 will do eight months from now." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Coursey noted that IBM, because of its own bumbling of the 
compatibility issue, "has lost the ability to determine new standards."

REGIONAL BELLS MAY SPIN OFF RESEARCH UNIT; TELECOM: INTER-COMPANY STRIFE HAS 
THE FIRMS PURSUING DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. BUT BELLCORE'S VALUE IS UNCLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Increasingly at odds over how best to capitalize on the booming 
telecommunications market, the seven regional Bell operating companies are 
considering spinning off their powerful jointly owned research arm. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-member board of Bell Communications Research, better known as Bellcore, 
has discussed selling the nation's largest research consortium in a public 
stock offering or letting private investors buy a stake, according to company 
and industry sources. But no decision has been reached by the board, which 
includes executives from each of the regional Bells as well as three from 
Bellcore itself. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been conflict over Bellcore almost since it was formed more than a 
decade ago as part of the breakup of the old Bell system. While AT&T retained 
the bulk of the famed Bell Laboratories research organization, one part of Bell 
Labs was split off to provide research and technical support to the newly 
formed regional Bell companies and to assure the long-term technical integrity 
of the phone system. 
</P>
<P>
 But the consent decree governing the breakup also prohibited the regional 
Bells from designing or manufacturing telephone equipment, thus limiting 
Bellcore's value and causing some of the Bells -- notably US West -- to 
complain almost from the start that Bellcore was costly and unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bellcore's owners are pursuing widely divergent strategies, and they don't 
necessarily want to be bound to partners not of their own choosing. The cash a 
Bellcore sale could raise, moreover, might be able to fund some of the new 
ventures -- though it remains unclear who would be interested in buying into 
Bellcore or how much the operation might be worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baby Bells' "ability to leverage off of Bellcore's technical finds is 
somewhat limited" now because of the consent decree, said Paul Aran, a 
telecommunications analyst for Bear Sterns in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellcore, which holds 439 U.S. patents, is also being pressured to relinquish 
perhaps its most crucial function: controlling the allocation of phone numbers, 
including area codes, five-digit long-distance carrier identification codes, 
some local phone numbers and codes for toll-free and 900-prefix information 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission is examining whether Bellcore should 
continue those functions or whether they should be handed off to a new, 
independent commission including representatives from local and long-distance 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Bellcore's research has focused recently on compression technologies 
that make it possible to squeeze more information and data through phone lines. 
That technology is beginning to pay dividends -- but now the consortium's 
owners are as likely as not to find themselves in competition with one another 
in providing new services that use the technology. Bickering among them is now 
commonplace, and is even being blamed for the collapse of a federal measure 
that would have granted their long-sought goal of entry into the long-distance 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * US West, which paid $2.5 billion last year for a 26% stake in Time Warner 
Entertainment and which has its own research unit, is aggressively pursing 
entertainment and multimedia technology. The company is said to be interested 
in offering its wares in rival Nynex's lucrative New York market, where Time 
Warner operates a cable system serving millions of subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pacific Bell, which spun off its cellular phone unit this year, as well as 
Bell Atlantic have launched multibillion-dollar efforts to modernize their 
phone lines to provide movies, cable shows and other video fare. Meanwhile, 
Ameritech, which serves the Midwest, has concentrated on its bread-and-butter 
phone business while lobbying for entry into the long-distance phone business. 
</P>
<P>
 * BellSouth, whose $16 billion in annual revenue outstrips its rivals, 
recently joined with QVC to make an unsuccessful bid for Paramount 
Communications and has funded a huge modernization of its phone network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their visions of the future are completely different," said Betty Massick, a 
telecommunications analyst with S.G. Warburg & Massick. "I think they (the Baby 
Bells) are finding that it's getting harder to operate a business like Bellcore 
where you always need a consensus" of opinion.

'VALUE PRICING' DRIVES GM SALES; INNOVATIVE STRATEGY HELPS AUTO MAKER BOOST 
CALIFORNIA MARKET SHARE TO 22% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a decade of losing ground to foreign car makers and domestic rivals in 
the all-important California car market, General Motors Corp. appears to 
finally have launched an effective counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks partly to an innovative -- though not universally acclaimed -- sales 
strategy called value pricing, GM has boosted its long-sagging California sales 
across its seven divisions by 20% during the 1994 model year, the company said. 
In contrast, during the same September-August period, car and truck sales were 
up 4% for the balance of the automotive industry, GM said, citing figures 
compiled by J.D. Power & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The sales surge lifted GM's share of the California market to 22.1% through 
June, up 1.6 percentage points since August, 1993, according to the latest 
statistics available from R.L. Polk & Co. That was the best showing by any auto 
maker and a remarkably hefty gain for a company that watched in agony as GM's 
California market share slid 10 percentage points in 10 years, finally crashing 
at 18% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 1995 model year gets under way, GM says it is in a virtual dead heat 
with Ford Motor Co. for the top spot in the California car market, and GM's 
sales momentum won't be hurt now that the recent strike has been settled at its 
plant in Flint, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of factors contributed to GM's California turnaround, including a 
sharp decline in the value of the dollar against the Japanese yen in the past 
year. Exchange rate pressures have pushed up the price of Japanese cars sold in 
the United States, making many American models a better deal. As a result, GM 
said, Japanese auto makers lost 3.4 percentage points off their California 
market share from September through June. 
</P>
<P>
 A gradually recovering California economy has also boosted GM sales. But if 
you ask GM officials why their company's gains outpaced the advances of Ford 
and Chrysler Corp. over the past year, the answer is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Value pricing is mostly responsible," said Ann Pattyn, who orchestrates the 
GM program from its regional headquarters in Thousand Oaks, the company's nerve 
center for its Southern California dealer network and sales strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 To GM, value pricing means limiting option packages to just one or two 
combinations per vehicle and selling at discounted sticker prices that, in 
theory, are not negotiable. Through value pricing, GM undercuts the competition 
on similarly equipped cars. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, GM's Pontiac Grand Am SE comes with an air bag, a stereo, air 
conditioning and other options for a no-dicker price of $13,995. A comparably 
equipped Toyota Camry DX, GM said, is listed at $20,822.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a value-priced Chevrolet Lumina is $3,000 less than a comparably 
equipped Ford Taurus GL. The aim of value pricing, Pattyn said, is to simplify 
car shopping and eliminate the haggling that makes car buying so unsavory. 
</P>
<P>
 But some GM dealers say the introduction of popular new designs, such as the 
Pontiac Firebird, and vastly improved quality ratings of GM cars have had much 
more to do with enhanced sales than value pricing has. 
</P>
<P>
 At Livingston Motor Car Co., a Buick and Pontiac dealership in Woodland Hills, 
sales have surged 16% over the past model year. But sales manager Terry 
Billingsley said that to attribute that increase to value pricing "is a real 
stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many GM dealers say they have been hurt by value pricing because it 
boosts GM's profit at their expense.  
</P>
<P>
 Gil Schneider, who operates GM dealerships in Van Nuys, said sales of 
Oldsmobiles and Buicks are up 9% this model year, thanks largely to value 
pricing, but his profit per vehicle is $200 less.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I could triple my volume, I could make it that way," Schneider said. "But 
GM isn't in a position to triple my volume." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, GM is clearly smitten with the program because it helps do away 
with rebates, financing incentives and other costly promotions. Also, offering 
just a few option packages on most vehicles simplifies GM's production process 
and boosts its profit by forcing consumers to buy cars loaded with more 
features than they might otherwise choose. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 months since the program was launched in August, 1993, GM sold 
232,093 vehicles in California, 38,288 more than a year earlier. And though 
less than half of GM's 1994 models were value-priced, they accounted for more 
than 70% of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 GM considers the program such a huge success that it is expanding it. In 1995, 
the number of value-priced models will be increased to 70 from 46, and Pattyn 
said she expects those vehicles to account for up to 85% of sales. And though 
value pricing has until now been largely a California experiment, the company 
is slowly moving to expand it nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Value pricing has boosted sales of certain GM models, Billingsley said, but 
not others. For example, sales at his Woodland Hills dealership of the Buick 
Regal have more than tripled to 15 a month since the car was value-priced, but 
sales of the Buick LeSabre are unchanged at 12 a month.  
</P>
<P>
 Both cars are luxury sedans, but unlike the Regal, the LeSabre lacked leather 
seats, a keyless entry system, a power antenna and a few other features. Even 
so, the LeSabre's sticker price was $1,500 higher than the Regal's. 
</P>
<P>
 GM has squeezed dealer margins by lowering suggested prices for consumers 
while often raising the price dealers pay the factory. At Livingston, for 
example, a well-equipped 1994 LeSabre lists for $20,195, about $300 below the 
1993 sticker price before value pricing was instituted. Meanwhile, the 
wholesale price Livingston pays GM has gone up by about $1,350, Billingsley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealers also complained that even though value pricing is supposed to mean no 
price dickering with customers, competition among GM dealers is so fierce that 
they often feel compelled to sell below the sticker price. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers rarely pay sticker prices anyway, said James Bragg, who operates the 
Fighting Chance consumer information service in Long Beach, so GM "reducing" 
the sticker price doesn't necessarily mean consumers are paying less.  
</P>
<P>
 Bragg also complained that GM is using value pricing to attract buyers to 
slow-selling models, while some of GM's most sought-after vehicles -- including 
the Chevrolet Camaro, the Oldsmobile Aurora and the newly designed Chevrolet 
Blazer -- are conspicuously missing from the value-priced list. 
</P>
<P>
 "If value pricing is good for everyone, then why doesn't GM put it on the cars 
that people really want to buy?" said Bragg, who offered another question: "How 
come no one else is rushing to follow GM into Value-pricing Land?" 
</P>
<P>
 The simple answer, analysts say, is they don't need to. Chrysler, which has 
enjoyed brisk sales in recent years, has all but sworn it won't engage in value 
pricing. And Ford employs the strategy on only a handful of its models. "We 
only really do that where we see a situation where the segment has shrunk, or 
there is a value problem," said Keith Magee, general manager of Ford's 
Lincoln-Mercury division. 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine with GM, which wouldn't mind cornering the value-pricing market. 
</P>
<P>
 This strategy "was perceived as high-risk in the beginning," Pattyn said. But 
now, for the first time in years, GM is talking about its once-soaring market 
share not as a painful memory, but as a realistic long-term goal. "It's 
possible," Pattyn said.

JUSTICE DEPT. STARTS PROBE OF AUTO PRICING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Justice Department has begun an antitrust investigation of the way 
prices are set on cars and trucks, including "value pricing" designed to limit 
haggling, a trade journal reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has asked for information from current and past officers of the 
National Automobile Dealers Assn. and contacted at least one of the Big Three 
domestic auto makers, Automotive News reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The request covers documents on topics that include one-price selling and 
value pricing, and any correspondence that mentions the price of any motor 
vehicle, the report said, citing unidentified sources familiar with the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiries were made under antitrust provisions of federal law and sought 
evidence that competition has been restrained in the sale of new and used 
vehicles, Automotive News said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very large fishing expedition," James Lust, 1993 president of the 
dealers association and a Chevrolet-Buick dealer in Aberdeen, S.D., told the 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Offices at the Justice Department and the dealers association were closed 
Monday for Columbus Day and officials could not be reached for comment on the 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Automotive News said the investigation is separate from a Justice Department 
inquiry into auto makers' sales to rental fleets, which was reported last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the pricing inquiry deals with the growing practice called value 
pricing, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The method is auto makers' response to consumers who dislike the negotiating 
that has traditionally been part of buying a car or truck. A value price 
implies that there will be little or no dickering because the price is fair for 
the vehicle and the options it includes. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. has been the most aggressive of the Big Three in using 
value prices. Its Saturn subsidiary and Oldsmobile division have adopted the 
system completely, and GM's California marketing strategy relies on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford and GM spokesmen said Monday that the companies had received no Justice 
Department inquiry on pricing practices. A Chrysler Corp. spokeswoman told 
Automotive News that the department had asked for some information.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: RADIO PROGRAMMER ERN CELEBRITY-SURFING TO SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After managing the characteristically short-lived careers of teen idols such 
as Rick Springfield, Andy Gibb and Corey Hart, Dana Miller has found a job he 
can do in his shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is the co-chairman of Entertainment Radio Networks, a fast-growing 
syndicator of radio programming based in Malibu. His casual beachfront office 
is a place where the Endless Summer meets endless ambition -- a place where 
people still find time to catch the perfect wave when they're not busy running 
a company that expects $12 million in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
 ERN has 27 shows on the air worldwide. Its bread and butter is 
personality-driven programs such as "Entertainment Tonight" and "Blockbuster's 
Top 25 Countdown," both hosted by Leeza Gibbons. The company also produces 
"Countryline USA from Disneyland," "Fight Back! With David Horowitz" and the 
talk show of conservative commentator Ken Hamblin. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's attitude about his work is as casual as his lifestyle. "Radio gets no 
respect," he observed over lunch in Malibu recently. "But that's OK, because 
we're quietly making tons of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives attending this week's National Assn. of Broadcasters annual Radio 
Show at the Los Angeles Convention Center might draw some lessons from Miller's 
story. His formula for success is surprisingly obvious: celebrity sells. 
</P>
<P>
 "In national radio, we're becoming more star-driven," says Miller, 39. "The 
reason stations take my shows is I give them something they can't do 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts agree. Jeff Pollack, chief executive of Pollack Media Group, says the 
airwaves are already cluttered with syndicated shows. Building programs around 
brand-name talent is one of the only ways of breaking through, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievably crowded out there," Pollack said Monday. "These days, you 
either have to have a remarkably fresh perspective to your show or a host that 
is extremely desirable." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who grew up in Southern California and graduated from USC, started 
Entertainment Radio Networks in 1986 after stints as a disc jockey, concert 
promoter and manager. His work on behalf of the Beach Boys led to deals with 
teen heartthrobs such as Springfield, Gibb and Hart, which in turn led to 
promotional campaigns that exposed him to the world of radio. 
</P>
<P>
 ERN's first program was "Hitline USA," a weekly celebrity call-in show that 
ran for eight years. From there the company formed relationships with 
personalities such as Gibbons. But not everyone on the air is a known 
commodity. Miller hosts some of the shows himself, including its monthly 
country program from Disneyland and live shows from the Roxy. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller manages the day-to-day operation with a staff of 27. His co-chairman, 
James-Paul Brown, plays more of a background role but is still remembered 
fondly in radio circles for creating the psychedelic "Earth News" feature that 
ran twice daily on stations in the 1970s and early '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller points to the company's relationship with Gibbons as one of the keys to 
its success. He met the perky TV hostess when she filled in to host one of 
ERN's country shows, and he convinced her to do a radio version of TV's 
venerable "Entertainment Tonight." The popular show, which Gibbons tapes from 
her home, is projected to gross $2 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says one key to getting and keeping talent is sharing the wealth. 
Gibbons and other ERN personalities are partners in their shows. "If I had 
given Leeza $500,000 a year in salary and the show succeeded, she would have 
come back for more money anyway," he reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say ERN is still small potatoes next to syndicators such as ABC and 
CBS or Infinity Broadcasting. But the privately held company gets points for 
creating shows that play well in major radio markets, thereby attracting 
big-name sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hitline USA" was backed by Pepsi. Blockbuster Entertainment, which recently 
merged with Viacom Inc., sponsors the "Top 25 Countdown." Quaker State, Sharp 
and Reebok have also supported ERN shows, and Sony Electronics recently signed 
a $1.5-million deal with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have the right properties is what it boils down to," said analyst John 
S. Reidy of Smith Barney. "If you have a Howard Stern . . . you can make a 
profitable business. It's like anything else. It depends on the names you 
attract and what people will pay . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says radio is a natural outlet for sponsors who can't afford TV anymore 
but who still want to be affiliated with a particular person or show. It's also 
a natural outlet for Miller, who loves the freedom of piloting his satellite 
truck from one location to another. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicts that the company's annual sales will reach $20 million by decade's 
end, and laughs off suggestions that new forms of media will eventually erode 
radio's audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as people get in their cars and drive to work, we're going to be in 
business," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stand tall time: Sony Corp. of America President Michael P. Schulhof is 
spending at least part of the week at the company's Sony Pictures lot in Culver 
City. Sources say Schulhof is in from New York on routine business. He's said 
to be going over film and TV projects with senior executives in the wake of 
Chairman Peter Guber's recent departure. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Sagansky, Sony Corp. of America's new second-in-command, is expected 
to join Schulhof in Culver City today. Entertainment executives look for Sony 
to ramp up production in a bid to reclaim its lost market share and attract the 
attention of investors.

 Strong Drug Sales Boost Abbott's Third-Quarter Profit: Abbott Laboratories 
Inc. reported that its profit rose 11% in the third quarter, citing strong 
worldwide sales of pharmaceutical products.The medical supply company earned 
$351.3 million, or 43 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, up 
from $316.2 million, or 38 cents per share, for the same period last year. 
Sales rose 9% to $2.25 billion, from $2.06 billion. "We experienced good 
worldwide performance from each of our major businesses," Chairman Duane 
Burnham said. "The strong sales gains this quarter, however, were driven 
chiefly by the worldwide growth of our pharmaceutical business."

 Volvo Recalls 32,000 Cars: The Swedish auto maker said its 850 Turbo series of 
1994 model cars requires modification to keep the accelerator mechanism from 
freezing and jamming in cold weather and high humidity.The company said an 850 
Turbo owner in Canada drove off the road when the accelerator mechanism froze. 
Owners in North America and Sweden have also reported several problems with the 
engine in cold weather, it added. The problem was eliminated in the 1995 design 
of the car, a spokesman said.

 New SBA Chief Voted In: Hours before adjourning Saturday night, the U.S. 
Senate unanimously confirmed Philip Lader's appointment to head the Small 
Business Administration.Lader, 48, traded jobs with former SBA chief Erskine 
Bowles, who is now a deputy chief of staff. "Phil knows business," President 
Clinton said in a statement. "His extensive private-sector experience, as well 
as his work at the Office of Management and Budget and in the White House, make 
him an ideal administrator." Lader, a South Carolina businessman and educator, 
promised to build on the momentum created by Bowles.

 Magma Board Urges Shareholders to Reject Bid: San Diego-based Magma Power Co. 
said it found California Energy's $840-million tender offer inadequate, 
describing it as an attempt to acquire Magma at a price that is "less 
attractive to Magma and its stockholders than remaining independent." Last 
Thursday, California Energy began offering $35 cash per share for the first 51% 
of Magma's outstanding shares as part of an overall per-share acquisition price 
of $25 cash and $10 in California Energy stock.In a release, Magma criticized 
the tender's "coercive" feature of offering all cash only to the first 51% of 
shareholders and said the bid is overly conditional and "does not remotely 
reflect Magma's intrinsic value and long-term strategic promise." Magma 
operates seven geothermal energy plants in the Imperial Valley. Officials at 
Omaha-based California Energy, which operates six geothermal plants in the 
state, were not available for comment.

R.J. REYNOLDS TO INTRODUCE LESS-SMELLY CIGARETTE; CONSUMER PRODUCTS: TOBACCO 
FIRM SAYS NEW SALEM MENTHOL BRAND IS MADE WITH PAPER THAT REDUCES STALE ODORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., which tried and failed to market a smokeless 
cigarette in the late 1980s, announced plans for a sweeter-smelling cigarette 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, the company will introduce a new version of its Salem 
menthol brand featuring a cigarette paper that reduces stale odors, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smokers were asked, other than price, if we can change something about our 
product, what would they change," RJR spokeswoman DeeDee Whitt said. "They said 
they would change it to get rid of the lingering stale smell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're addressing a growing social concern that perhaps some people don't like 
the smell of cigarettes in their clothing, car and hair," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sample magazine advertisement for the new brand, called Salem Preferred, 
reads, "I love what you're not wearing." It says Salem Preferred has a "less 
lingering stale smell" and lists four problem areas where the smokey smell can 
linger: hair, clothes, home and the car. 
</P>
<P>
 RJR said Salem Preferred uses a patented paper technology that changes the 
smoke odor and gives the cigarettes a smoother taste. While the company won't 
elaborate on the process, Whitt said it is done by adding a "very common food 
additive" to the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Salem Preferred will be introduced this month in stores on military bases 
across the country, Whitt said. She said she did not know when they will be 
available to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope it's a great success and we'll roll it out even further," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, RJR had a short-lived trial for a smokeless cigarette, known as 
Premier. Company officials have since said Premier was introduced prematurely 
and had an unusual taste and odor that bothered some smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 RJR has no immediate plans to wrap all its brands in the new paper, Whitt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like the cork-tip (filter) and 85-millimeter length are preferred by 
some of our customers, some of our customers prefer this," she said. Asked if 
the new menthol brand will also please nonsmokers, she said, "You'll need to 
check with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wall Street Journal on Monday quoted Timothy Hensley, a spokesman for the 
Centers for Disease Control's Office on Smoking and Health in Atlanta, as 
saying Salem Preferred could draw attention to what has been an unregulated 
part of cigarettes: their paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, cigarette companies are required to disclose only the ingredient 
list for the tobacco and any additives to it, not the composition of the paper, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitt said RJR anticipated questions about the paper's composition and has 
provided details to federal regulators.

SOUTH AFRICAN FIRM TO BUY DIVISION OF SCOTT PAPER; ACQUISITIONS: THE UNIT, S.D. 
WARREN CO., CONTROLS 27% OF THE U.S. MARKET FOR COATED PAPER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Scott Paper Co. said Monday that it will sell S.D. Warren Co., its printing 
paper division, to an investor group led by South Africa's Sappi Ltd. for $1.6 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The highly leveraged deal is the first significant foreign acquisition by a 
South African company in the United States in 20 years. It would make 
Johannesburg-based Sappi the world's largest producer of coated wood-free 
papers. 
</P>
<P>
 The other investors are DLJ Merchant Banking Partners and its affiliated 
funds, and UBS Capital Corp., the U.S. private investment arm of Union Bank of 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal ends a major part of a restructuring by the world's largest tissue 
producer. Scott, which is trying to transform itself from a lumbering paper 
giant into a low-cost, fast-moving consumer products company, previously 
announced plans to slash a third of its staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, which was put up for auction in May, controls 27% of the nation's 
coated paper market, roughly twice that of its nearest competitor. It produces 
1.25 million tons a year of coated, uncoated, specialty and technical papers at 
two mills in Maine and one each in Michigan and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott stock rose $3.25 to close at $64.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. Some 
analysts had questioned whether Scott would ever find a buyer for Warren, no 
matter what the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of skepticism about the deal and the possibility of getting 
more than $1.5 billion for Warren," Bear Stearns analyst Linda Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott had initially hoped to raise $2 billion from the sale, but a number of 
big U.S. bidders had dropped out of the running. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale marks the completion of one of the key initiatives by Chairman Albert 
Dunlap, who was hired in April to revitalize the 115-year-old company. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company will soon begin trying to sell other paper-related 
holdings such as woodlands, pulp mills and energy corporations. The first of 
those decisions could be announced in a month, Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am more optimistic than ever about Scott's future," said Dunlap, who took 
over the company in April and has been streamlining ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Sappi, Africa's leading paper and forest products company, has previously 
acquired paper manufacturing subsidiaries in Germany and England. It is the 
third-largest manufacturer of coated free-sheet paper in Europe, with net sales 
of $1.7 billion so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sappi will contribute $250 million to the equity of Warren, with $25 million 
by UBS and $125 million by DLJ, a unit of Equitable Cos.  
</P>
<P>
 Chemical Banking Corp. will provide $1.1 billion in debt financing. The DLJ 
Bridge Fund will make a $375-million short-term bridge loan, which will be 
refinanced after the deal closes through an offering of high-yield bonds 
underwritten by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is expected to close by mid-December, subject to approval by South 
African, European and U.S. regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said proceeds from the sale would be used to develop its core tissue 
business and pay down corporate debt. It will also consider a new stock buyback 
program following the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 In six months, Dunlap has slashed Scott's work force by 11,000 using 
aggressive methods that have earned him the name "Chainsaw" and "Rambo in 
Pinstripes." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, with assets of $1.6 billion, had sales of $1.16 billion last year and 
accounted for 24% of Scott's revenue.

 Motorola Inc. Profit Near Top of Wall Street Expectations: The Schaumburg, 
Ill.-based company said global growth in wireless communications, 
semiconductors and advanced electronic products boosted its third-quarter 
profit by 50% to $380 million. Earnings amounted to 65 cents a share, compared 
to $254 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier, Motorola said. The number 
of cellular subscribers in the third quarter rose by about 50% from the end of 
1993 to nearly 50 million, it said. Growth in its cellular division helped fuel 
a 63% jump in the systems sector, the company said.

 September Semiconductor Book-to-Bill Ratio Falls: The pace of new 
semiconductor orders slowed in September, the Semiconductor Industry Assn. 
said. The trade group said the September book-to-bill ratio, which measures new 
orders against billings, slipped to 1.03, compared to a revised figure of 1.05 
in August.A 1.03 ratio means that for every $100 of products billed, 
manufacturers received $103 of new orders. The August figure was revised upward 
from 1.04, the association said. Although off slightly from the previous month, 
the book-to-bill ratio was slightly higher than the 1.02 figure of September, 
1993, and marked the 10th straight month the figure has surpassed the 1.00 
break-even mark. The industry set a new billing record of $3.16 billion 
worldwide for September, the association said.

 Lilly, Mylan Reach Agreement: The Indianapolis-based drug maker said it and 
Mylan Laboratories Inc. will produce a generic form of its antibiotic 
Ceclor.The drug is one of the most popular in the world, but sales of the 
brand-name version have been falling since its patent ran out in December, 
1992. Worldwide sales last year were about $910 million, down about 2%, 
according to estimates by securities firm Salomon Bros., which expects further 
declines. Like other drug makers whose products have lost patent protection, 
Eli Lilly & Co. hopes that selling a cheaper generic version will take back 
business from other generic drug makers.

 New Gasoline Payment System Implemented: When drivers say, "Fill 'er up," 
they'll now be able to pay for a tank of gas at many Mobil stations with a 
check and service station owners will know immediately whether the check they 
received is good. Under a new program with National City Processing Co., Mobil 
Corp. said, customers will be able to pay for gas, repairs or other services 
with a check, which will be given immediate approval through a new 
point-of-sale system. The system will be made available to Mobil's 9,000 
service stations nationwide.

NATURAL GAS PIPELINE FIRMS PLAN $830-MILLION MERGER 
</P>

From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 Panhandle Eastern Corp., one of the nation's largest interstate natural gas 
pipeline companies, said Monday that it will buy Associated Natural Gas Corp. 
in a stock swap worth $830 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, which would create the third-largest independent natural gas 
pipeline company in the country, each share of Associated would be converted 
into the right to receive 1.5725 to 1.8750 Panhandle shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Panhandle President Paul Anderson said the merger should boost the value of 
both company's shares. "This action is a part of Panhandle's strategic plan to 
further expand its activities beyond its core gas transmission services 
business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panhandle Eastern provides natural gas transportation to the Midwest and 
Northeast. Associated sells natural gas across the country and in Canada and 
Britain.

COMPANY TOWN; EURO DISNEY SHARES OFF 3.3% AFTER FRENCH MAGAZINE PROJECTS LOWER 
PARK ATTENDANCE; ENTERTAINMENT: THE COMPANY CONDEMNS THE REPORT AS HAVING 'NO 
BASIS IN REALITY,' SAYS IT WILL PROVIDE ITS OWN FIGURES NEXT MONTH.

<P>
 Euro Disney shares fell 3.3% on Monday after a French business magazine 
reported the park will show substantially lower attendance in the year ended 
Sept. 30, along with disappointing merchandise and food spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme park, whose parent company is 49%-owned by Walt Disney Co., quickly 
refuted the report by L'Expansion, saying it had "no basis in reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney's results for the fiscal year are expected to be released next 
month. Analysts have expected the company to stem the flow of red ink after 
losing close to $1 billion in its last fiscal year. In addition, Chairman 
Philippe Bourguignon said earlier this year that losses would be lower, but he 
didn't elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which is also operated by Disney, underwent a financial 
restructuring -- including a $1-billion rights issue -- with its 61 banks 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 French securities regulators put a warning in the prospectus saying that the 
company is not expected to be profitable before fiscal 1996. Euro Disney has 
been plagued by soft attendance since opening in April, 1992. It has been 
trying to boost the number of visitors to the park by slashing prices and 
launching special promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 But attendance has been falling steadily. In its first year, the park outside 
Paris had 10.5 million visitors; that fell to 9.8 million in the fiscal year 
ended Sept. 30, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The L'Expansion article claimed total attendance at the park won't exceed 8.2 
million in fiscal 1994. Previously, Euro Disney officials had forecast about 9 
million visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also said Euro Disney attracted 25,000 visitors on some days in 
July and that in August the average was 40,000. It added that visitors were 
spending much less on food and Disney merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also said the average spending on food by each visitor totaled 51 
francs, compared to the 53 francs forecast by the company at the time of a 
restructuring. In addition, average spending on merchandising totaled 48 francs 
per head, compared to Euro Disney's forecast of 53 francs, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The article also said revenue will be lower than the $919-million figure in 
fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attendance figures published in L'Expansion don't bear any resemblance to 
reality," said Jacques-Henri Eyraud, a spokesman for the company. "These 
figures are wrong, and Euro Disney deplores the slapdash journalism of a 
magazine whose article contains a number of factual errors." 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney declined to comment specifically on L'Expansion's account of 
tourist spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The company did not supply its own numbers, but it said it will provide data 
when its results are published in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Euro Disney has blamed its problems on the slow European economy, the strong 
French franc that has made the park more expensive for visitors from 
surrounding countries and the lack of spending by visiting tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudi Prince Al Waleed ibn Talal ibn Abdulaziz al Saud recently announced he 
would acquire up to 24% of the park. He is believed to own about 10% now. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's stock closed $1.125 higher at $39 on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Monday.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: OXNARD BENTON OIL & GAS RAISES $15 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benton Oil & Gas Co., an Oxnard-based petroleum exploration and production 
firm, said it has issued $15 million in unsecured notes to John Hancock Mutual 
Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13% notes are due Sept. 30, 2002, with principal repayments of $3 million 
due annually beginning in 1998.The company also said it has issued warrants 
entitling John Hancock to purchase 250,000 shares of Benton stock, or 1% of the 
company's outstanding common shares, at $9 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the proceeds, the company said, will be used primarily for 
drilling development wells and building production facilities for the company's 
Venezuelan project, where Benton is under contract to reactivate and further 
develop three oil fields. The balance of the proceeds will be used for drilling 
and development activities in the company's projects on the Gulf Coast and in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The issuance of notes to John Hancock will help alleviate the financial bind 
Benton has faced since February, when Venezuelan investors forced the company 
to pay off $15 million in commercial paper. 
</P>

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: JANEX AGREES TO SETTLE LAWSUIT BY SHAREHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janex International Inc. in Woodland Hills, formerly named With Design in Mind 
International Inc., said it has agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit 
accusing the toy company of securities law violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company agreed to pay $75,000, including $15,000 in cash and the remainder 
in a combination of cash and stock.The settlement also includes 200,000 
warrants issued by Janex to acquire its common stock, with each warrant 
exercisable at 50 cents above the closing price of Janex stock on the trading 
day preceding the date of the final agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit was filed by shareholders against the company in 1993 after the 
former top executives of With Design were ousted and accused of embezzling 
company funds. The original shareholder complaint was dismissed by the court 
earlier this year, but an amended complaint was filed in U. S. District Court 
in Los Angeles in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Steven Zuloff, former With Design chief executive, and Barry 
Benjamin, its former chief financial officer, each pleaded guilty in federal 
court to two counts of tax evasion and one count of securities fraud for 
siphoning more than $1 million from the company. Both men agreed to repay about 
$1.17 million -- the amount diverted from With Design between 1988 and 1991. 
They each face up to 20 years in prison and a $1.5-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
 While the company denied any liability for the embezzlement, it said the 
settlement is in the best interests of shareholders and was weighed against the 
risks of continuing litigation. It said final settlement is subject to court 
approval.

SUPERIOR INDUSTRIES POSTS 36% PROFIT INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Industries International Inc., a Van Nuys supplier of aluminum car 
wheels, benefiting from strong demand for autos, reported earnings and sales 
gains for its third quarter and nine months ended Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 In the September quarter, Superior had a profit of $12.6 million, a 36% 
increase from its $9.29 million in net income a year earlier.Its sales rose 
30%, to $107.4 million from $82.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the recent nine-month period, the company earned $40.6 million, up 24% 
from a $32.6-million profit a year before, while sales grew 16% to $334 million 
from $287.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior attributed the improved results to production remaining high at a 
time when auto assembly plants typically retool for new model changeovers. 
</P>
<P>
 But it noted that operating profits were squeezed somewhat by the start of 
production at its plant in Chihuahua, Mexico, and expansion of its 
Fayetteville, Ark., plant.

SALES SOARING, BUT HOME PRICES REMAIN LOW IN SEPTEMBER; REAL ESTATE: A TOTAL OF 
937 SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSES CHANGE HANDS, UP 21% FROM '93, WHILE MEDIAN SALES 
PRICE DROPS TO $180,000. TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TILL 1995.

<P>
 In September sales of single-family homes in the San Fernando Valley once 
again continued at a brisk pace, but the soaring sales volume did little to 
boost median sales prices, which continued to scrape bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, sales of single-family homes in the Valley totaled 937, up 21% 
from September of 1993, when 774 homes changed hands, according to the San 
Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, median sales prices fell to $180,000, down 5% from $190,000 a year 
earlier, though up 3% from August. The median price means that half the homes 
sold for more than $180,000 and half for less. The average sales price of a 
home last month was $236,800, down 3% from $244,100 a year earlier, and 3% 
below the average sales price during August. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Valley real estate market still crawling out of a crater created by 
California's economic recession and the January Northridge earthquake, Valley 
homes are selling at prices last seen in 1988, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Link, executive vice president of the association, said 1995 sales 
activity should continue to improve, but prices will remain flat. "We'll see 
strong activity, but we don't see the economic factors in place that would 
drive prices higher," Link said. "The key next year will be to see what type of 
inventory will come on the market after all the earthquake-damaged properties 
are repaired or sold." 
</P>
<P>
 Quake-damaged properties being sold as-is have deflated median sales prices, 
keeping prices depressed despite a diminished supply of available homes, which 
would normally push prices higher. There were 6,236 active listings of 
single-family houses last month, the association said, down 34% from 9,507 in 
the same month a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Link also expressed concern that climbing interest rates would dampen the 
local real estate market's recovery. If the Federal Reserve continues to boost 
rates, first-time home buyers "risk being pushed out of their affordability 
range," Link said. In the local housing market, first-time buyers are driving 
the real estate recovery, Link said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 1,072 single-family homes and condominiums changed hands in 
September, up 16% from a year earlier, when 924 closed escrow. The latest sales 
figures were down 3% from August, when home sales for that month hit a six-year 
high at 1,099, but the association pointed out that sales typically wind down 
in fall, as summer vacations end and schools reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 The median sales price of a condominium last month was $111,500, 13% below the 
median price of $127,900 a year ago, and 3% below the August median of 
$115,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The average sales price of a condominium in September was $114,200, down 18% 
from $139,500 a year ago, and down 8% from $123,600 in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley realty group, the largest in California, has 7,800 members from 
North Hollywood to Calabasas. Its figures generally do not include sales of new 
homes.

MALLS HOPE FOR HOLIDAY RUSH; BUT RETAILERS WONDER HOW STRONG THE DEMAND WILL BE 
AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout the nation, retailers are decking the halls and expecting the best 
holiday shopping season in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christmas holidays are especially important to retailers, given that 40% 
of their sales typically come during that time of year. But can shopping malls 
in the San Fernando Valley area, still haunted by Southern California's deep 
and lingering economic woes and rebuilding from the January earthquake, also 
hope for a merry Christmas? 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, many say yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're feeling that customers are buying more now," said Annette Bethers, 
marketing director at the Topanga Plaza mall in Woodland Hills. "We feel it's 
going to be an extremely strong Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Valley, many malls that have finished their earthquake repairs -- 
or escaped major damage in the first place -- are reporting sales increases of 
10% to 30% over this time last year. Some mall retailers even say sales are so 
brisk that year-to-date totals are up from last year's numbers -- despite 
temporary closures after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But while some Valley-area malls are benefiting from pent-up consumer demand, 
layoffs in aerospace and other industries continue to plague the region, warned 
John Golisch, chief retail consultant in Southern California for the business 
services firm Arthur Andersen. And he wondered if the sales gains reported by 
some stores will last, since so far they've come largely at the expense of 
closed malls and from the influx of earthquake insurance and federal assistance 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether sales increases "will be sustaining when the rest of the capacity 
comes back will really depend on the mood of consumers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One less-than-upbeat consumer is Pat McGarry of Sherman Oaks, who enjoyed a 
cup of coffee while his wife shopped recently at the Fashion Square mall in 
Sherman Oaks. "It's my great hope," he said, to persuade his wife to spend less 
this year because his earthquake insurance didn't cover all of their damage. 
"I'm sort of resigned. That's going to cut into Christmas this year." 
</P>
<P>
 And not all local shopping centers are toasting the holidays. The 
quake-devastated Northridge Fashion Center remains closed, and only the 
Broadway and Sears stores there will reopen next month, in time for Hanukkah 
and Christmas shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinsons-May is the only store open at Laurel Plaza in North Hollywood, and 
mall management still won't say if the center will ever reopen. And other malls 
that were partially closed for several months while undergoing repairs can 
hardly expect to make up for lost business just from the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Bullock's Northridge mall store not due to reopen until fall 1995 and 
the Sherman Oaks Bullock's fully reopening only this month, Michael Steinberg, 
chief executive of Macy's West/Bullock's, acknowledged that even a huge holiday 
season won't compensate for lost sales in the Valley this year.  
</P>
<P>
 But after four years of hard times for Southern California retailers, he's 
optimistic. "I really believe that we're out of the worst aspects of the 
recession," Steinberg said. "That translates itself into retail business." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Pickering, vice president of City Freeholds Inc. USA, an Australian 
company that owns Fashion Square in Sherman Oaks, is also expecting its best 
Christmas season in three years. But so far this year the mall's sales are down 
about 30% because it was closed for two months after the quake, the parking 
garage was badly damaged and the Broadway and Bullock's stores are only now 
back to normal.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're never going to pick up that lost period," Pickering said. "There were a 
lot of apartment units damaged, especially in this area. We lost a lot of our 
customer base." 
</P>
<P>
 Most retail chains say they're not planning any extra sales events for their 
quake-rattled stores. Indeed, the Northridge Broadway and Sears, while planning 
splashy reopenings, are mainly relying on luring former customers back to 
familiar surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the damage at several malls, and with the Northridge mall basically 
closed all year, shopping traffic has recirculated through the Valley and their 
losses have been others' gains. Indeed, spokesmen at the malls that have been 
experiencing strong sales admit that the increases are largely due to the 
customers they've picked up from Northridge Fashion Center and other heavily 
damaged shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the Northridge mall fully reopens next year, at least some of the 
increased traffic that Topanga Plaza and others are experiencing may evaporate 
-- which again makes this Christmas season so critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, 61% of consumers said they plan to spend more money or the same 
this holiday season, and it was the most optimistic forecast since 1990, 
according to a survey conducted in September by Chicago research firm Leo J. 
Shapiro & Associates.  
</P>
<P>
 But while this region's retailers should see an improvement in Christmas 
season sales, given the depressed local economy recently "it would be 
relatively easy to beat last year's numbers," noted George Rosenbaum, Leo J. 
Shapiro president. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, after a tough year, the mood of Valley consumers might best be 
described as mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 While shopping recently at Topanga Plaza, Florence Sussman of Calabasas and 
her mother, Ida Giniger of Encino, said they were "feeling more optimistic" and 
planned to spend more on their various children, grandchildren and 
great-grandchildren this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Annie Farkas, shopping at the same mall, said she will spend less because 
she and her husband had no earthquake insurance and now have to repay the 
$25,000 Small Business Administration loan they used to make repairs to their 
Woodland Hills house. Also, the new mother has cut back her hours at her 
teaching job. But her sister, Lisa Aamoth of North Hills, said she'll spend 
more this year because her $80,000 in earthquake damage was covered by 
insurance -- and her newborn has added to her shopping list. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many local mall stores expect brisk sales this holiday season, and they 
are stocking up on items they think will be hot sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicky Crisp, co-manager at Topanga Plaza's Victoria's Secret store, said sales 
are booming and she can't keep the "Miracle Bra" -- one of the new 
gravity-defying push-up varieties -- in stock. She also expects silk lingerie, 
flannel goods and thermal night wear to sell well for the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Maccarone, manager at the Imaginarium toy store in Topanga Plaza, 
which was closed for only a few weeks after the quake, said her store's sales 
are up 20% so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides gaining sales while the Imaginarium store at the Northridge mall is 
closed, she said her store is also getting a boost from the "baby boomlet" of 
the past few years, and anticipates strong sales this holiday from such 
classics as train sets. The Crate & Barrel shop in the Topanga mall is also 
seeing "gangbusters business" for its dishes, glasses, pots and pans, said area 
manager Geri Given. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sherman Oaks Galleria, Kamran Hedjasi, assistant manager at Sam Goody, 
said sales of recorded music and videocassettes are up 5% over last year, in 
part because of a program the mall started for frequent shoppers to earn 
discounts, coupons and free merchandise. Hedjasi also sees a boost to holiday 
sales from the release of Walt Disney's "Snow White" on video this month. At 
The Limited women's clothing store in the Galleria, co-manager Jocelyne Maalouf 
said sales have picked up recently and "we're crossing our fingers that we will 
have a good season." 
</P>
<P>
 Some malls say the earthquake, while destructive, forced their anchor 
department stores to modernize facilities and overhaul merchandising 
strategies, which should also help sales. The Robinsons-May store at Topanga 
Plaza, for instance, which is reopening Nov. 10, will have more selling space, 
new architecture and expanded furniture, consumer electronics and housewares 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sherman Oaks Galleria, the two Robinsons-Mays were also updated and 
merchandise was rearranged so that women's apparel is now in one store, men's 
apparel and home goods in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 While all the local malls that escaped major earthquake damage say their sales 
are up strongly over a year ago, as more rival stores reopen, it remains murky 
exactly which malls will end up with the biggest increase in shopper traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Strle, vice president at the O'Connor Group, owner of the Promenade in 
Woodland Hills, said he's optimistic that his mall will continue enjoying the 
30% increase in comparable-store sales it's had since the earthquake -- even 
after other shopping centers return to full operation. Patrons of other malls 
"have rediscovered the Promenade," he said. "We hope we've converted them to 
regular shoppers." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Callahan, manager at Panorama Mall in Panorama City, reported sales are 
up 35% there over last year. The small center, whose only department store is a 
Broadway, "is the only game in this part of town," she said. Callahan also 
hopes to hold onto customers she's picked up since the quake because, she 
believes, the rebuilt Northridge mall will be even more upscale when it 
reopens, and shoppers will still be looking for bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Fallbrook Mall in Canoga Park, General Manager Eric Knudsen also thinks 
his discount center has benefited from customers' hunting for low prices. Sales 
there are up 30% so far this year, and the JC Penney outlet's sales were so 
strong it opened a second floor last month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even malls relatively far away from Northridge say they've picked up sales 
that would have otherwise gone to Northridge Fashion Center. At Media City 
Center in Burbank, "business is booming," said General Manager Daniel Millman. 
"I think we'll finish the Christmas season 20% ahead of last year." And the 
Glendale Galleria, which attracts customers from all over Los Angeles, says the 
percentage of its sales to Valley residents has increased to 24% from 14% 
before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Valencia Town Center, 1994 "has really been a fabulous year for our 
merchants," said General Manager Kristin Mueller, because of Northridge Fashion 
Center's closure, damage to freeways that encouraged local residents to shop 
locally and an improving economy. Mueller expects such a busy holiday shopping 
season that she's planning to run shuttles from off-site customer parking 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In a possible sign of things to come, though, Ruth Ann Moore, marketing 
director at the Antelope Valley Mall, said she's noticed a tapering off from 
sales increases seen immediately after the quake, as other malls get back to 
full strength. She still expects to finish the year with total sales up about 
10%, and is encouraged by growth in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But some mall operators are wise enough to admit that predicting retail sales 
is a guessing game, and guessing wrong can leave retailers stuck with unsold 
inventory. "I think everyone would like for it to be a gangbuster holiday 
season," said Sherman Oaks Galleria General Manager Joy De Backer. "Is there a 
guarantee for it? No." Shopping Mall Update 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into the all-important holiday shopping season, some local malls are 
limping along with earthquake repairs still under way. Here is a quick 
reference guide to what is open, and what is not. Shopping mall: Antelope 
Valley Mall Status: All stores open. * Shopping mall: Fallbrook Mall Status:

QUAKE VICTIMS ENCOUNTER TAXING DELAY AT ASSESSOR'S; RESIDENTS AND BUSINESS 
OWNERS WAIT FOR PROPERTY-TAX RELIEF AS OFFICIALS ARE STILL WADING THROUGH 
49,000 EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE-RELATED APPLICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The one-year anniversary of the Jan. 17 earthquake will probably have come and 
gone before thousands of residents and businesses receive property-tax 
reductions or refunds on taxes already paid on their quake-damaged parcels, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 49,000 applications for quake-related property-tax relief have been 
filed in the eight months since the earthquake rumbled across the Southland, 
said John Crowner, director of appraisals at the Los Angeles County assessor's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the office initially hoped to finish processing all the relief 
applications by Sept. 30, only about one-third of the claims had been handled 
by that date, Crowner said, and the task is now expected to stretch into 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more time-consuming than expected, and we have had to streamline our 
operations," Crowner said. As a result, many property owners who filed for 
temporary reductions in property-tax assessments because of quake damage could 
still be waiting in February for tax refunds or revised tax bills to arrive in 
the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to damage from the quake, as much as $1.4 billion may be trimmed from 
local property values, mostly in the San Fernando Valley, Crowner said, and up 
to $19 million in county property-tax revenues could be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has also been dealing with a separate batch of claims for 
reductions in property taxes. Property values throughout the county have also 
declined in recent years because of the recession in Southern California. Under 
a state law that allows owners to seek tax relief in such cases, 35,899 parcels 
were reassessed in the year that ended June 30 for a total devaluation of $5.8 
billion, the assessor's office said. About 3,000 applications submitted last 
year under this law are still being processed. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners whose parcels have suffered quake damage are taking advantage 
of a state law that permits owners of disaster-damaged properties to seek tax 
relief by having their property values temporarily reduced, until property 
owners make repairs and the values of their parcels are restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, property owners pay taxes of about 1.25% of the assessed value of 
their parcels each year, with the 1% portion going to the county and local 
governments and the remainder paying off voter-approved debt. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, quake-damaged properties have been devalued by an average of $35,000, 
though devaluations range from millions of dollars for crumbled commercial 
properties such as the Northridge Fashion Center to a few thousand dollars for 
"something a few blocks away where the garden wall is down," Crowner said. The 
average reduction in an annual property-tax bill for quake-damage claimants, 
Crowner said, is about $350. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, property taxes are paid twice a year, with the first 
installment due in December and the second due in April. Following the quake, 
about 26,000 property owners met an early application deadline and were granted 
deferrals on their April, 1994, tax payments. Many of those owners are now 
waiting for revised tax bills to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who did not receive deferrals paid their April installments in full and 
are waiting for refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, bills for the current property-tax year are scheduled to be 
sent out within a few weeks. Owners whose quake-damage claims have already been 
processed should receive reduced bills, Crowner said. Most owners who filed 
quake-damage claims will have to wait for bill correction notices to arrive 
later. But even those who received deferrals on their April tax payments 
because of quake damage must still pay their December, 1994, tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the quake-damage claims, total assessed property values increased 
countywide by 1.3% to $497 billion for the past fiscal year. But that was one 
of the smallest annual increases in memory, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As already strapped local governments consider the gloomy tax implications of 
that news, the assessor's office must continue to climb a paperwork mountain. A 
special team of 40 assessors -- all temporarily lured back from retirement -- 
has been assembled to handle the damage claims. Still, by the end of September, 
only 17,000 of the 49,250 applications submitted had been processed, Crowner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until about a month ago, assessors called every property owner who submitted 
an application, seeking to verify information or get updated damage estimates. 
The practice slowed the process considerably, said Rod Herman, who supervises a 
crew of assessors handling quake-related applications in a cramped corner of 
the assessor's office in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Some owners couldn't be located, said Herman, 64, a county assessor for 32 
years before he retired in 1988. Others, Herman said, "were still so 
traumatized they didn't want to talk about the earthquake or damage to their 
property." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to speed things up, assessors are now calling owners only when 
applications are incomplete. Even when the amount of damage listed on a claim 
totals $500,000 or more, Herman said, the application will usually be processed 
without a call or a visit to the parcel as long as the owner submitted 
sufficient evidence, such as pictures of the damage, a repair estimate signed 
by a contractor or a signed insurance claim. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the assessor's office is processing quake-damage claims at a much 
faster pace. Last month, the office plowed through 3,162 claims in a week, 
Crowner said, about four times as many as a month earlier.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PREMIERE RADIO TO GET MILKEN TRUST FINANCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Premiere Radio Networks Inc. in Sherman Oaks is set to receive $14.8 million 
in financing from an investment partnership partly owned by a trust set up to 
benefit the children of former junk bond financier Michael Milken and his 
brother, Lowell Milken. 
</P>
<P>
 Archon Capital Partners L.P. of Los Angeles has agreed to pay $4.025 million 
for 500,000 shares of Premiere's common stock and 814,500 warrants to purchase 
additional stock at $7 a share.If the transaction is completed, Archon would 
then hold stock and warrants that together would allow it to own up to about 
44% of Premiere's common shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining $10.8-million investment will be made in the form of seven-year 
debentures carrying an annual interest rate of 9%. The debentures would include 
1.08 million warrants exercisable into common stock at $7 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Premiere's President and Chief Executive Steve Lehman 
would remain in his post along with other senior managers, and members of 
Archon would join Premiere's board of directors. The management group has 
agreed to hold at least half their Premiere shares for at least four years. The 
financing deal is subject to certain conditions, including Premiere receiving 
shareholder approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiere produces and syndicates radio programs and services. It said it would 
use the funds to fuel its growth, create new programming and expand its 
advertising sales division.

IT'S A RESELLERS' MARKET; COMPUTER RETAILER'S O.C. PARTNER AIDS BUYERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robin Kennedy is a personal shopper for corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Newport Beach company, Centric Resources Inc., has teamed up with giant 
computer retailer MicroAge Inc. to help companies decide what equipment they 
need and then order it. 
</P>
<P>
 Centric opened in March and already has $10 million in contracts to provide 
computers to corporations including Unocal Corp., Hughes Aircraft Co., Northrop 
Corp. and Rockwell International's Rocketdyne division. 
</P>
<P>
 Such partnerships between so-called resellers like Centric and major 
manufacturers are increasingly common, said Steve Kedzior, senior vice 
president at MicroAge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is definitely becoming a trend," he said, citing similar agreements set up 
by MicroAge competitors Intelligent Electronics and Inacom Corp. with various 
resellers. 
</P>
<P>
 What's happening at Centric represents a trend sweeping the industry, said 
Evelyn Walker, a spokeswoman for Intelligent Electronics at its Exton, Pa., 
headquarters. "Every major computer aggregator is setting these up." 
</P>
<P>
 The role of a reseller such as Centric is narrowly defined: It does not 
operate retail outlets, maintain inventory, configure equipment or collect 
payment. What it does is consult with corporations on what they need to operate 
more efficiently, then arrange for purchase of the equipment. The manufacturer 
does the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Resellers," Kedzior said, "are sales people and computer people." 
</P>
<P>
 Such go-between companies are not new, and not all of them are small. CompUSA, 
for example, the Dallas-based computer reseller, is a retailing giant, with 
annual sales of more than $2 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 But in a highly competitive field where technology is quickly outdated, size 
does not guarantee success, analysts say. CompUSA, for example, recorded a loss 
of $16.8 million for its latest fiscal year, a sharp contrast with profit of 
$12.3 million for the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's fierce price war among computer manufacturers is putting 
additional pressure on resellers and does not appear likely to end soon, said 
Tony Cherbak, a retail analyst in the Costa Mesa office of national accounting 
firm Deloitte & Touche. 
</P>
<P>
 However, MicroAge is convinced that it will benefit from its arrangement with 
Centric, which pays a fee to represent the manufacturer. "So long as they are 
successful," Kedzior said, "the more volume they do with us." 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership appears to be paying off handsomely for Centric too. The 
company, which opened eight months ago with only three staff members -- 
Kennedy, the founder and president, and partners Barry Noebel and Andy Anderson 
-- now employs 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy projects that her company, which is paid a percentage of the profit 
from each deal, will arrange $20 million in sales for its first full year of 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, 35, started the company after having worked 10 years as a computer 
saleswoman for a number of companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into business for herself was definitely the right decision, said 
Kennedy, who started the company with $300,000 that she and her partners raised 
from "personal resources." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question it is a good field for women," she said. "There don't 
seem to be the same kinds of gender biases women face in other industries."

 America West Airlines began offering vacation packages to Orange County last 
week, a move that could boost the local tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 America West Vacations, the airline's tour packaging division, is marketing 
the three-day air fare and hotel deals for $124 per person from Phoenix, $194 
from Portland, Ore., or Seattle, and $334 from Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California is one of the country's most popular year-round vacation 
destinations," said Karen Cahn, manager of California and Florida marketing for 
America West Vacations.  
</P>
<P>
 The packages include tickets to Knott's Berry Farm in Buena Park, which has a 
marketing agreement with America West. 
</P>
<P>
 The packages aid a tourism industry that is bouncing back from recession. 
Though hotels and attractions are still heavily discounting, recent hotel 
occupancy figures attest to the Southland's appeal as a vacation destination.  
</P>
<P>
 After riots, earthquakes, fires and floods, the worst may be over.

FOLICK TO LEAVE PACIFICARE FOR UNITED HEALTHCARE; MEDICAL CARE: PRESIDENT AND 
CEO OF CYPRESS COMPANY WILL JOIN LARGE MINNEAPOLIS-BASED OPERATOR OF HMOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeffrey M. Folick is leaving his job as president and chief executive officer 
of PacifiCare of California to become president of health plan operations at 
United HealthCare Corp. of Minneapolis, one of the nation's largest operators 
of health maintenance organizations, company officials confirmed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Folick, 47, has been president of the Cypress-based PacifiCare since April, 
1993. PacifiCare of California has more than 900,000 HMO members and is the 
main business unit of PacifiCare Health Systems Inc., of which Folick is also 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Lipeles, the corporation's executive vice president and former 
president of PacifiCare of California, will take over Folick's duties on an 
interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Hoops, PacifiCare Health System's president and CEO, had no immediate 
comment on Folick's resignation, which sources said he tendered unexpectedly on 
Friday. On Monday, PacifiCare issued an internal memo indicating that Folick 
would leave the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Folick, a Tustin resident, declined to comment Monday, saying he did not want 
to speak before the formal announcement of his appointment, which is expected 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Noreen Conway, a spokeswoman at United HealthCare, said, however, that Folick 
will accept a new position at the company. She said: "He will oversee 
operational execution and strategic planning" for 20 HMO plans that United 
HealthCare owns and manages, with more than 3 million members. 
</P>
<P>
 Conway said Folick will join the company at the end of October. United 
HealthCare, a fast-growing company flush with cash, also provides 
specialty-care products to 20 million people. In the six-month period ended 
June 30, the company had revenue of $1.8 billion. For the two quarters ended 
June 30, PacifiCare had revenue of $1.47 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Folick joined PacifiCare Health Systems in December, 1989, as vice president 
of Secure Horizons, PacifiCare's health plan for Medicare recipients. Thirteen 
months later, he became president of that division, which now has 290,000 
members in California, and in May, 1992, he was appointed chief operating 
officer of PacifiCare of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Folick became president and CEO of PacifiCare of California the following 
April when the company selected a new management team. Since then, PacifiCare 
of California has added more than 100,000 members, helping boost the company's 
systemwide membership to 1.26 million members and lifting the company's 
revenue, earnings and stock price. 
</P>
<P>
 PacifiCare's common stock has surged about 50% since April, closing Monday at 
$74.50 on Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that Folick figures to leave PacifiCare with a handsome sum from 
the stock option plan given to key executives. They said Folick has a strong 
industry reputation, particularly in the Medicare business, and that he is 
moving to a bigger, more national operation with greater challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is known as being a good manager and a good team leader," said John 
Edelston, president of HealthPro Associates, a health-care consultant in 
Woodland Hills. "From a challenge standpoint, it's got to be a feather in his 
career cap."

 Sprucing Up: The Airporter Garden Hotel is getting a new name to go along with 
its new look. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel on MacArthur Boulevard in Irvine will become the Atrium Marquis 
Hotel when its $4.5-million renovation is completed next month.All of the 
hotel's 212 rooms will be renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have created a virtual resort atypical of most business hotels," said 
Daniel Monnet, the general manager. Room rates will range from $89 to $150 a 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel's entrance is being redesigned with an atrium featuring a stone 
column that was hand hewn in Mexico, silk-and-wool carpet from Thailand and 
lush landscaping throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel is being renovated by its new owners, Golden Hotels, which purchased 
it for $10 million. It is directly across the street from John Wayne Airport, 
so it is well positioned to take advantage of recent increase in business 
travel to the area.

ALLIANCE IMAGING MISSES $1-MILLION LOAN PAYMENT; MEDICAL SERVICES: THE 
ORANGE-BASED PROVIDER OF MRIS IS NEGOTIATING WITH LENDERS TO EASE ITS DEBT 
BURDEN. SUCH PROBLEMS ARE INDUSTRY-WIDE. 
</P>

 Alliance Imaging Inc., operating in a lackluster medical imaging services 
industry, said Monday that it has missed a $1-million principal payment on a 
loan but continues to negotiate with lenders to ease its high-interest debt 
burden. 
</P>
<P>
 The provider of magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, said that it did make its 
interest payment Sept. 30 on senior notes held by Cigna Corp. and that the 
insurance company gave Alliance until Nov. 4 to pay the principal and clear up 
other technical defaults. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have paid the principal, though it would have depleted us to a point 
that I think would have been imprudent to do business," said Terrence M. White, 
Alliance's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance is negotiating with Cigna and four other insurance companies holding 
another series of notes to lower the 12.5% interest rate on the notes, to 
convert some of the debt to common stock and to extend the payment period. 
White said the lenders have agreed to do all three, but how far they will go in 
easing the burden is the subject of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Nov. 4 deadline for the missed principal payment could be extended 
if the talks show "substantive progress." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three months, White said, the company has found it more difficult 
to obtain equipment financing, so it has had to use its $6 million in cash on 
hand to buy equipment outright or to make a higher down payment to finance 
capital expenditures.

 Alliance is weighed down with $63 million in debt from a 1988 leveraged 
buy-out and stuck in an industry that is foundering. The prospect of health 
care reform has caused doctors to rely less on MRI machines. At the same time, 
an oversupply of machines has lowered the cost of the equipment and the 
pictures they produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts are no more worried about Alliance than they are about others in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like things are going downhill at the company," said analyst Mark 
Matheson at the brokerage Crowell, Weedon & Co. in Los Angeles. "The technology 
is still state of the art. The tough thing is that the price per scan has been 
dropping from a range of $600 to $900 to a range of $300 to $600." 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance lost $14.7 million last year on revenue of $60.7 million. For the 
first six months this year, it lost $2.1 million on revenue of $28.7 million. 
White said third-quarter results, to be released later this month, will likely 
show a loss. Alliance Imaging at a Glance

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: MOVING QUICKLY, RENO AIR TO BEGIN FLIGHTS FROM JOHN 
WAYNE NOV. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reno Air Inc., moving quickly after Orange County supervisors changed airport 
access rules, said Monday that it will begin five daily nonstop flights out of 
John Wayne Airport on Nov. 1 and add a sixth on Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The discount airline's first five daily flights will go to San Jose, with 
connecting flights available to Portland, Seattle and Colorado Springs.The 
remaining nonstop flight will go to Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 One-way coach fares to San Jose will be as low as $34.50 for companion tickets 
and $49 for advance purchase, while coach fares to Reno will be as low as $44 
one way. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air leapfrogged over other airlines waiting for access to the airport 
through its affiliation with American Airlines. The county's Board of 
Supervisors voted Oct. 4 to allow such arrangements to take precedence over the 
airport's waiting list of carriers wishing to begin service at John Wayne.

 Coram Health Care Corp.: The Newport Beach home-infusion company said Monday 
it will pay $25 million and sell $50.6 million of warrants to settle a 
class-action shareholder fraud suit filed against subsidiary T2 Medical Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was in 1993 before T2's merger with Coram, which is in the process of 
moving its corporate headquarters to Denver.The suit, filed in U.S. District 
Court in Georgia, alleged wrongdoing by T2, an Atlanta company that supplies 
intravenous drugs and nutrients to patients in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Coram agreed to pay $500,000 to end a two-year investigation by 
federal regulators into whether T2's infusion therapy centers violated federal 
anti-kickback laws. Without admitting wrongdoing, T2 Medical agreed to stop 
managing centers owned jointly by physicians and T2.

PLAYERS SUBMIT NEW PLAN; HOCKEY: LEVY RATES ARE ADJUSTED. BETTMAN, NHL 
GOVERNORS WILL MEET TODAY TO DECIDE IF GAMES WILL BE PLAYED SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman found something he could work with in the 
long-awaited new proposal submitted by the players association, he was not 
saying so on Monday after a 3 1/2-hour bargaining session in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to that question -- and whether there will be any hockey played on 
Saturday -- is expected today when Bettman meets with the league's Board of 
Governors in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Union chief Bob Goodenow called Monday's move "a significant 
counter-proposal," in the first meeting between the players association and the 
NHL since the NHLPA rejected two league proposals last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most significantly, the NHLPA's new revenue-sharing proposal revealed on 
Monday now uses a graduated levy on player payrolls of the top 16 revenue teams 
-- starting at 5.5%, with the highest rate at 7% -- hitting the top spenders 
the hardest. The other 10 clubs would pay no levies. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, there was a reduction in the levy on gate receipts, moving from a 
proposed rate of 5.5% to 3%. The NHLPA plan "guarantees" a revenue pool of $20 
million, $1 million more than the NHL suggested with its most recent proposal.  
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow spoke about the graduated rates on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always felt that any tax is a drag on salaries," he said. "The simple 
notion of taxes on salaries is repugnant to the players and to the players 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's move is very significant. We've gone that extra mile." 
</P>
<P>
 NHLPA President Mike Gartner of the Toronto Maple Leafs agreed that the levy 
on salaries runs against the players' interests but contended they were trying 
to accommodate the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the owners see that," he said. "But I do not know how they'll react." 
</P>
<P>
 There are many options, depending upon the reaction of Bettman and the owners. 
If Bettman determines he has seen enough movement, he can accept the union's 
no-strike, no-lockout pledge made on Sept. 29 and start the season on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 He also could announce another postponement to Nov. 1 or later. Or, he could 
start the season, allowing for negotiations in a specified time frame, and if 
no agreement is reached, impose a lock-out. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost everyone seems to agree that a decision to start playing games on 
Saturday will have to be made no later than Wednesday. Management, coaches and 
players believe they would need at least two or three days of practice before 
playing games. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Goodenow discussed the difference between the union's plan and 
the NHL's most recent proposal, saying they had produced enough movement for 
the season to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . The NHL's plan will not achieve any revenue sharing, since it will 
drive the high-paying clubs to cut their payrolls to avoid paying the tax," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This remains the critical difference between our respective plans: Our tax 
plan will create a guaranteed pool of money to distribute to clubs and would 
result in a greater after-tax balance in the revenues of all clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NHL plan remains designed to encourage clubs to avoid paying the tax by 
slashing their player payrolls, producing very little money for the 
distribution pool and operating as a salary cap."

FOR RAIDERS, ONE VICTORY A GOOD START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One victory does not make a comeback, but it's a start. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the feeling around the Raiders' El Segundo practice site Monday, the 
day after their 21-17 road victory over New England. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite 11 penalties and four turnovers, the Raiders improved to 2-3, thanks 
to their defense and perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The football team played for 60 minutes," Coach Art Shell said. "Whenever 
something bad happened, they responded. It wasn't like, 'Here we go again.' It 
was like, 'Let's get the ball back.' Everyone contributed, and that's a real 
positive as a football team." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest positive was the five-play goal-line stand in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "To stop them from going in . . . that's a big lift," Shell said. "Especially 
with all of the opportunities they had." 
</P>
<P>
 After a touchdown run by Jeff Hostetler that put the Raiders ahead by 21-17, 
New England appeared to be on the verge of retaking the lead with a drive that 
began on the Patriots' 27-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the passing of Drew Bledsoe, New England needed only six plays to reach 
the Raider six-yard line, thanks to a 24-yard catch by Ray Crittenden. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the Patriots' problems began: 
</P>
<P>
 -- First down: Marion Butts struggled for a three-yard gain over right tackle 
before being tackled by Winston Moss and Patrick Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Second down: Butts, plunging behind the left side of the line, was stopped 
by Greg Biekert at the Raiders' one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Third down: Butts was stopped for no gain over the middle by Chester 
McGlockton and Biekert, but the Raiders' Anthony Smith was penalized for being 
offside. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Third down II: Butts again was stopped for no gain, by Aundray Bruce and 
Biekert over the left side, but this time the Raiders' Nolan Harrison was 
penalized for being offside. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Third down III: Fullback Kevin Turner tried to dive over the middle but was 
hit by a leaping Biekert and then fumbled, Bates recovering for the Raiders at 
the one. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a big-time stand," Shell said. "We had to have a couple of things 
happen to make a play like that. The linemen had to get penetration, 
(linebacker Rob) Fredrickson had to make a great hit on a blocker for Biekert 
to make the big hit on the ballcarrier. It was just a good team effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting that type of effort is something the Raiders have talked about for the 
last two weeks and was precisely what they needed on a day when they still had 
their fair share of miscues. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a 10-7 lead in the second quarter, New England got a big break on 
the ensuing kickoff when the ball bounced in front of Rocket Ismail and was 
recovered by Steve Hawkins at the Raiders' 22-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots then went on to score their second touchdown only after taking 
three points off the scoreboard, because of an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty 
on Andrew Glover. The officials ruled that Glover had used a defensive lineman 
as a steppingstone in an attempt to block Matt Bahr's 24-yard field goal. Three 
plays later, Leroy Thompson scored on a three-yard pass from Bledsoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything he did was legal," Shell said of the call against Glover. "There's 
no doubt in my mind that that was a bad call. (Glover)'s our jumper. It's 
unfortunate that he was called for that." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth quarter, the Raiders tried to be charitable again when Tyrone 
Montgomery fumbled after catching a 14-yard pass from Hostetler. New England's 
Myron Guyton recovered at the Patriots' 43-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders made another blunder later in the quarter when, with the ball on 
the Patriots' 45-yard line, Hostetler floated a corner pass over Glover's head 
into the hands of Maurice Hurst at the 17-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 In their previous four games, mistakes like those would have signaled a 
blowout. This time, however, the Raiders responded with defense. 
</P>
<P>
 New England had to rely on its passing game as the Raiders limited the 
Patriots to only 54 yards rushing in 29 attempts. The Raider pass rush, led by 
Anthony Smith's two second-half sacks and a key pass deflection on the 
Patriots' final drive of the game, kept pressure on Bledsoe throughout the 
game.  
</P>
<P>
 That pressure helped Terry McDaniel intercept three passes, and it is the type 
of pressure the Raiders will need for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things happened in the game that, from our standpoint, were tough," 
Shell said. "But we were able to overcome and win against a good football team 
on the road."

JIM MURRAY: LIKE HIM OR NOT, WE NEED HIM

<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the weekend football scores, the saddest for me was Arizona State 36, 
Stanford 35. Not that I have anything against Arizona State. And I didn't go to 
Stanford. But I worry about the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Man and boy, I guess I've known Bill Walsh for -- what? -- 20 years? It's 
funny, but when I first heard about him, he was an assistant at Cincinnati. 
Under Paul Brown, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 This was an awful lot of genius for one staff. And the word on Walsh was that 
he was exactly that -- a genius. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was the kind of guy, it was said here, who has to be kept in an ivory 
tower with a playbook and a box of chalk. He set policy, he didn't implement 
it. He drew these great fancy stratagems. But it was up to someone else to get 
them in the game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the book on Walsh. Brilliant but aloof. A thinker, not a leader. A 
part of the general staff concerned with the big picture, the great offensive. 
Someone else led the troops. A dreamer, almost. A guy who should have had a von 
in his name, Field Marshal Wilhelm Von Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Walsh went from Paul Brown to Al Davis, to Tommy Prothro and Sid 
Gillman. Every one of them kept him back at the drawing board. He was also Bob 
Cratchit. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a funny thing happened. He went, of all places, to Stanford. Now, 
Stanford was a member of the Pacific 10 football conference, but not really, if 
you know what I mean. It considered itself Harvard and not, let's say, Oklahoma 
or Florida State, to drop a name or two. 
</P>
<P>
 It had a proud tradition in West Coast football. After all, Pop Warner had 
coached there. He invented the single wing. In 1940, Clark Shaughnessy, a kind 
of early day Bill Walsh, brought the T-formation to football there. Another guy 
with a reputation as an X's and O's guy, not a hands-on coach. But he went 10-0 
and won the Rose Bowl and national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford had the "Vow Boys," a squad that, after a series of humiliating 
defeats by the USC Trojans, vowed never to lose to them again. And didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford was Walsh's first head coaching stop. And he confuted his image as a 
purely theoretical or laboratory scientist by producing 9-3 and 8-4 seasons and 
going to two bowl games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford was almost embarrassed. I mean, would Harvard go to the Bluebonnet 
Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Cardinal turned back into a pumpkin again. Walsh left to take over 
the San Francisco 49ers, a bunch of chronic underachievers who had never really 
won anything. 
</P>
<P>
 He went 2-14 his first season, 6-10 his second. "Ah, now!" said the wise guys, 
"Walsh has finally gotten in under his head. He should be up in the attic, 
drawing diagrams and letting them down by rope to the staff." He was miscast as 
a battlefield commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh always managed to convey the sense that he was slumming on a football 
sideline, that he belonged in a box at the opera. Even though he had spent part 
of his youth as a prize fighter, I always had the sense he was listening to 
Bach on his headset, not the assistant coaches. You figured him to be the only 
coach in the league who would know Prokofiev was not a linebacker from 
Washington State. He could probably hum him. The movies he watched didn't 
always have football players in them. 
</P>
<P>
 But his teams became the scourge of the pros. They went from 2-14 to 15-1 at 
length. Not since Vince Lombardi had a coach put a team on the field as 
immaculately prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh scripted the first 20 plays of every game -- and most of the rest. Never 
had a team seemed to have a key receiver open on every play the way the 49ers 
did. You could deliver the pass by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Super Bowls later, Walsh felt he had made his point. He took his 
football and left. He was a Hall of Fame coach by now, mentioned in the same 
breath as Warner, Rockne, Yost and Lombardi. No longer was he the ethereal 
figure who, like Moses, went up the mount and got his game plan every week. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he went back to Stanford, the football world was stunned. Here was a 
guy going back to knocking on high school athletes' doors, hoping to persuade 
them to join a football program that in no way resembled that of Miami, or even 
Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easier for a rich man to get into the kingdom of heaven than for a 
football player to get into Stanford. For one thing, you have to be able to 
spell. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford got good football players. But they didn't get 90 of them -- 15 or 
20, maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no secret how some schools are beating good teams around the country this 
fall, 62-14. There are about nine of them and they have all the certified arm 
breakers and head crackers in the country on their squads. 
</P>
<P>
 You are always afraid Stanford will cop out of all this and go into Division 
II football and actually start to play Yale, Harvard and Brown. Coast football 
would be poorer without the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
 For Walsh, it's a Sisyphean job. He's 62. But Pop Warner coached long after 
that. And Walsh's teams are not deep but they're smart, resourceful. Some are 
even students. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooting for Stanford is not a civic duty. And it's not exactly like rooting 
for David. But we need more Stanfords. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford players don't call their signals in logarithms. They don't play 
Handel's "Messiah" in the locker rooms. They're not the Vow Boys or the Wow 
Boys. They are not America's Team. But what would West Coast football be 
without them? What would college football be without them? NFL II?

PUTTING VLADE IN HIS PLACE; DIVAC HAS ALWAYS PLAYED LIKE A POWER FORWARD -- AND 
NOW HE IS ONE, CHANGING SPOTS WITH CAMPBELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was hardly a patent on the thought. Del Harris, like many others before 
him, looked at Vlade Divac and saw a mobile 7-footer with a soft shooting touch 
away from the lane, a player who felt so comfortable on the perimeter that he 
has had to be discouraged from trying to make like a point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if the program listed him as a center. Divac was really a power 
forward and everyone knew it. Now Harris, at the dawn of his Laker coaching 
career, knew it, too, and he wanted to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Harris saw his new starting center. Elden Campbell looked back and saw a 
used-car salesman disguised as a coach bringing the big sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell had tried that spot once before, for a brief time during his second 
season, and didn't much like it, all that low-post defense against stronger 
players being more like a turn at slam dancing. Then again, that was two years 
and 25 pounds ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, though, remained reluctant. So Harris showed him game films, 
pointing out why this wouldn't be such a dramatic change from what he had been 
doing anyway. Harris showed the Lakers' starting power forward he could be a 
success as the Lakers' starting center. Campbell signed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Right then, two career paths took turns. Were they sloping, gentle bends or 
90-degree jerks? That will be answered during the next several months, starting 
with the exhibition opener here Friday against the Sacramento Kings, but for 
now the proper response is probably that the decision by Harris was somewhere 
between a considerable gamble and an obvious move that is really nothing more 
than semantics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way that I use (the positions), they play off each other so much that 
often times it's hard to distinguish who is a center and who is a power forward 
in the first place," Harris said. "You've got to remember these are names that 
have been given as labels. Dr. (James) Naismith never heard of either one of 
them. As coaches, I think most of us just look at guys as ballplayers." 
</P>
<P>
 It could be that simple. Or it could be a risk, because Divac is coming off 
his best and most consistent season as a pro, a level the Lakers had waited 
four frustrating years for him to reach. And now his position is being changed, 
after he became the first person to lead the team in scoring and rebounding 
since Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in 1984-85. 
</P>
<P>
 He goes from 14.2 points and 10.8 rebounds, the latter good for 12th in the 
league, to new defensive assignments and, perhaps, fewer chances to hit the 
boards on a team that is desperate for rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike Campbell, Divac embraced the idea from the outset and thinks his 
career got a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing in my head was, 'OK, now I can do a lot of things that when I 
did them before, people told me, "You shouldn't do that, you're a center," ' " 
Divac said. "Now I'm a power forward. I can do those kind of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harris: "Vlade will play the way he's been playing. Vlade has been 
playing like a power forward his entire career. This is power forward without 
the guilt. People are not going to ask why he's not down by the basket all the 
time, like Kareem and other traditional centers, which they've been saying for 
years. They won't have to say that any more. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll be around (the basket) some, like all power forwards are around there 
some. But Vlade is a versatile player and a good player, and we've got to allow 
him the freedom to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, meanwhile, was hardly as diplomatic as his teammate about the move. 
He remembers objecting to returning to the nightly rigors of the trenches and 
being an afterthought in the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, an ordained minister, continued to preach his message, though, until 
finally convincing Campbell that he was pretty much playing center already. 
Pretty much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they're making it official," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, the Lakers hope to capitalize on Campbell's quickness and leaping 
ability. This is the player who finished 11th in the league last season in 
blocked shots despite playing only 29.6 minutes per game, meaning he could move 
into the top 10 merely by playing closer to the basket as a center. No telling 
how far he could jump in the rankings if he played 35 minutes per night. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harris: "I think probably the most common thing I've been asked since 
coming here is, 'What about Elden? Is this Elden's year?' This (switch) is as 
much for Elden. The focus has been on Vlade, but to me it's a dual spotlight. 
It's just as big a deal for Elden because I think this is where he can thrive, 
where he can come in and establish himself as a center in this league. We're 
counting on him. I think he'll come in and have the best year of his career." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Campbell: "When I first thought about it, that center spot is so 
limiting. You stand there and wait. You set picks. For the most part, you're 
waiting for the offense to be brought to you, and that's not really the 
position I like to be in. But the way (Harris) is putting it, I'll be involved, 
even if it's just passing the ball. Being involved is the key really." 
</P>
<P>
 He is in the right place to cut his teeth on a new position, the Pacific 
Division, the land of Joe Kleine, Ervin Johnson, Elmore Spencer or Stanley 
Roberts, and Olden Polynice as starting counterparts. Campbell immediately 
becomes one of the two or three best centers, provided Chris Webber stays at 
power forward in Golden State.

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; NOT ONLY FANS' HEADS ARE SPINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Funny, wasn't it, that the Flyers and Whalers "accidentally" faxed to 
reporters last Thursday an NHL memorandum advising general managers what to say 
about the labor talks.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it could have been a mistake. They really meant to fax their lunch 
orders and hit the wrong buttons on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 No tuna on whole wheat, and no error. It was part of an NHL public relations 
drive to put a positive slant on its position in the labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Most clubs called news conferences last week so executives could spout the 
party line. Of course, they all obeyed a previous memo that told them they are 
free to make public statements, but added, "It is critical that we continue to 
present a united front." 
</P>
<P>
 The players association is equally eager to put its spin on things. Every time 
a player appears on TV, he wears a cap with an NHLPA logo on it. And a sweat 
shirt. And a jacket. And says owners are making so much money off TV fees and 
merchandise, the league can't be losing money, as it claims. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first stage of the PR campaign, each side blamed the other for the lack 
of talks over the summer. Copies of correspondence from the NHL to the union 
detailing the union's supposed refusal to meet landed in the hands of selected 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHLPA, responded by saying the NHL 
knew all along he wouldn't meet if a salary cap was part of its proposal, and 
the cap was always there. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the dueling calculator phase. The NHL says it gave Goodenow the 
financial data he wanted. He says he got nothing regarding profits and losses. 
Then the New York Post obtained information showing that the NHL lost $32 
million for the 1992-93 season. Days later, Commissioner Gary Bettman 
acknowledged that the figure didn't count $100 million in expansion fees gouged 
from Tampa Bay and Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all was the name-calling stage. Players started it by criticizing 
Bettman's stature, his lack of hockey knowledge and his wife's supposed love 
for shopping. They went too far when Chris Chelios implied Bettman's family 
might be in danger. Chelios later apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 Management replied by insulting Goodenow. Boston's Harry Sinden called him 
"hopeless." John McMullen, owner of the New Jersey Devils, said he was not "an 
intelligent union leader." Bettman apologized -- but only for McMullen. 
</P>
<P>
 Now is the conspiracy-theory stage. Union backers claim Bettman is in cahoots 
with top baseball negotiator Richard Ravitch to impose a salary cap, because 
getting one in hockey will set a precedent for Ravitch to get one. Owners are 
saying that Goodenow has been led astray by Donald Fehr of the baseball players 
union, claiming Fehr has directly instructed hockey players on strategy. The 
union laughed that off. 
</P>
<P>
 Had they put as much energy into negotiating as they have put into 
campaigning, the season would be under way by now. TAKE A MEMO 
</P>
<P>
 That misdirected NHL fax, written by NHL senior vice presidents Jeff Pash and 
Brian Burke, listed the key issues and how to rebut what players say. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlights: Management says Goodenow has withheld crucial aspects of the 
league's offers, including guarantees that players won't make less in salaries 
than they do now. Said the memo, "ALL of this information has been omitted, as 
far as we can tell, in any union briefings to players and agents." 
</P>
<P>
 It also repeats McMullen's claim that Mike Gartner, president of the NHLPA, 
acknowledged that the league's plan is not a salary cap. Gartner has not 
commented.  
</P>
<P>
 In response to players' claims that the NHL's rising marketing revenues make 
the league financially sound, it says, "The figure of $1 billion represents 
gross retail sales figures. The players presently participate in this revenue. 
The actual net to each club is approximately $1 million. In addition, the 
players have their own licensing program, which generates several million 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Licensing sales figures for major league baseball approach $4 billion, and 
licensing sales figures for the NBA and NFL approach $3 billion." A VOTE 
AGAINST THE SENATORS 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't say much for Ottawa that Radek Bonk turned down a three-year 
contract worth about $3 million to play for Las Vegas of the International 
Hockey League, where he will earn about $200,000 per season. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do the Senators lose a potential scoring leader in Bonk, the third 
pick in June's draft, they must cope with Alexei Yashin's trade demands and the 
prospect that Alexandre Daigle will flop. Daigle, who signed last year for 
$12.5 million over five years, was benched during the exhibition season. 
STRANGE WEATHER 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say the season is extended to make up delayed games. Let's say it goes 
into July. Let's hope Boston Garden can hold up in the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 24, 1988, a Stanley Cup final game between the Bruins and Edmonton 
Oilers had to be suspended because of a power failure in the Garden. The series 
had to shift back to Edmonton, where the Oilers won the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Garden -- which is in its farewell season -- couldn't hold up through a 
hot May night, what might happen in June or July? 
</P>
<P>
 Many NHL teams can't maintain good ice surfaces in the early and late months 
of the season, when the weather is warm. Their ingenuity and their ice-making 
equipment will be sternly tested if they are still playing when the calendar 
says it's summer. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota Moose, a first-year team in the IHL, offered Mike Modano and 
Neal Broten of the Dallas Stars $1,000 a game to play in St. Paul while they 
are locked out. Both considered it but are almost certain to pass it up because 
of insurance considerations. In addition, if they were injured while playing 
for the Moose, their NHL contracts could be voided. . . . Cliff Fletcher, 
Toronto's general manager, deserved his three-year extension. He is a smart, 
aggressive trader who molded a non-playoff team into a conference finalist each 
of the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Players aren't being paid, but referees and linesmen -- the principals in last 
year's labor dispute -- are getting paychecks. . . . Still to be determined: 
whether teams that sent draft picks back to their junior teams to stay in shape 
will be allowed to recall them. Usually, after junior-age players are returned, 
they can be brought back only under emergency conditions. . . . Insiders say 
that Neil Smith, the Rangers' president and general manager, won't be hurt by 
the shake-up that left Knick boss Dave Checketts in charge of Madison Square 
Garden.

A TIME FOR TRUCE -- AND GOLF; HOCKEY: DUCK PLAYERS AND MANAGEMENT COME TOGETHER 
ON THE FAIRWAYS IN THE NAME OF CHARITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a gorgeous day at Tustin Ranch Golf Club -- and a strange one in the 
history of labor relations. 
</P>
<P>
 With NHL owners and players in a dispute that has put the season on hold, 
Mighty Duck players and management laid down their arms Monday and picked up 
their clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-one NHL games have been postponed since Commissioner Gary Bettman 
delayed the start of the season until at least Saturday, and Duck players will 
miss their first paychecks on Thursday. But they joined front-office types on 
the fairways for a charity tournament anyway -- a testament to their support of 
the Disney youth hockey program the tournament benefits . . . and their 
affection for a complimentary round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "This event has been planned for quite a long time," captain Randy Ladoucuer 
said. "We're not in such a bad relationship with our team that we're going to 
cancel something like this and hurt a charity organization like Disney GOALS. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell the truth, we have a pretty good relationship with our management. I 
still have only good things to say about (General Manager) Jack Ferreira and 
(Coach) Ron Wilson and (President) Tony Tavares and the entire organization. . 
. . It's unfortunate a situation like this is happening, but I don't hold 
anything personal against those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Players milled about wearing caps or shirts with the NHL Players Assn. logo, 
only to face a counterattack from Ferreira, who dug out a black cap with a bold 
orange NHL logo from the back of his closet. Then he posed for a 
my-cap-vs.-your-cap photo with defenseman David Williams -- sticking up two 
fingers behind Williams' head like rabbit ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no animosity between our players and ourselves," Ferreira said. "I 
respect their position and I think they respect ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares -- an outspoken critic of union leadership last week -- sat at the 
registration table for the charity tournament chatting with Bob Corkum, the 
players' representative to the union and an outspoken critic of Commissioner 
Gary Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little odd," goaltender Guy Hebert said as he registered. "But the 
problem isn't between Tony Tavares and myself. He's a businessman. He's doing 
the best he can to stick together with his side and we're sticking with ours. 
Here in Anaheim there's no personal animosity." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson enjoyed his first workout with his players in 11 days, but the only 
hockey sticks around were the ones used in a gag putting contest, and the 
toughest competition was in a long-driving contest. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the odd sights on an odd day was the presence of Terry Yake, who was 
traded to Toronto on Sept. 28 -- two days before the season was put on hold. 
The Maple Leafs told him it was up to him whether he reported at once, and Yake 
and his wife, Tanya, decided to stay in Anaheim and pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ducks told me when I got traded they'd be short of guys and I could come 
on out if I wanted to," Yake said. "It's for a charity, and these are still all 
my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 11 a.m. shotgun start, Tavares and Ferreira were on their way to 
New York, where the Board of Governors will meet today to decide whether the 
season will be postponed even further. Ferreira said he didn't know what the 
players' latest proposal was and wouldn't speculate. Forward Stu Grimson, the 
assistant player representative to the union, didn't know the details either, 
but what he knew didn't give him much hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so far apart coming into this, and I don't think at this stage 
anybody's willing to concede that much," he said. "We're prepared to hold out 
indefinitely, whatever that may be. Guys have resolved themselves to a long 
fight. But it's impossible to speculate on how it's going to play out."

WOMAN SETS CATALINA SWIM MARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Colorado woman broke both the men's and women's records Monday for swimming 
across the channel between Santa Catalina Island and the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Burton, 32, of Monument, Colo., swam the 22-mile span in 7 hours 43 
minutes 6 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired," Burton said. "But I was really happy with it. I was especially 
happy because it was a really good day. The water was as flat as a pancake." 
</P>
<P>
 Her time beat the women's record of 8:33 set by Penny Lee Dean of Upland in 
1976, said John York of the Catalina Channel Swimming Federation, which 
monitors such swims. The men's record of 8:14.46 was set on Sept. 24, 1993, by 
Chad Hundeby of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Escorted by a charter boat and a kayak, Burton left Doctor's Cove on the west 
end of the island about 12:05 a.m. and finished her swim on the rocky shores of 
Rancho Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton swam the English Channel last year.

DESPITE PROBLEMS, GANDY SET TO START FOR RAMS; PRO FOOTBALL: FIRST-ROUND DRAFT 
PICK HAS STARTED SLOWLY, BUT INJURY TO SLATER FORCES TEAM TO PICK UP THE PACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rookie offensive tackle Wayne Gandy, the Rams' first-round draft pick with a 
knack for making big-time gaffes, appears to be getting a promotion. And not 
everyone is comfortable with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy is expected to get his first start Sunday against the New York Giants in 
place of an injured Jackie Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gandy's not quite ready to go yet," said Ram quarterback Chris Miller, who 
started Sunday's 24-17 loss at Green Bay after sitting out two games because of 
a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that was a pretty tough test against (Green Bay's) Reggie White. Wayne 
can get it done. The only way you'll find that out is in a game situation 
because it's hard to put him in a game late when Jackie's banged up and 
Reggie's lubed and lathered and going full bore." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gandy: "That's Chris' opinion. He has a job to do and I have a job they 
pay me to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's cause for concern stemmed from the final play of the Green Bay game, 
when Gandy replaced Slater, who suffered a slight tear in his triceps muscle. 
White, football's all-time sack leader, beat Gandy badly and sacked Miller, 
forcing a fumble that was recovered by Green Bay's Sean Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Gandy, playing left tackle, had cost the Rams a possible touchdown 
with a holding penalty on a Jerome Bettis sweep play on second and goal from 
the Green Bay two. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox said it's a "big possibility" that Gandy will start 
Sunday against the New York Giants. But can Gandy handle the responsibilities 
of a starter? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a matter of whether he can," Knox said, "but whether he has to." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams selected Gandy out of Auburn with the 16th overall draft pick. He 
failed to beat out veteran backup Clarence Jones in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 In an exhibition against New England, Gandy was called for four penalties for 
20 yards when he lined up off the line of scrimmage. Against San Francisco, he 
failed to report as a tight end to officials, costing the Rams a touchdown pass 
to Troy Drayton. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a pretty tough season," Gandy said. "I came here and a lot of 
people had big dreams about me, and I still have the same ability, talent and 
desire to reach those goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always known how to deal with adversity coming through the bad times 
(NCAA probation) at Auburn. And people write that Gandy shouldn't play, or 
Gandy is a bust. But I'm still going to show up as long as somebody still 
thinks I have the talent." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have slowly brought Gandy along, using him as a backup to Jones and 
Slater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to contribute," Gandy said. "They shouldn't be paying me all this 
money just to let me stand over there and drink water during a game and watch 
everybody else play. Now I'm getting my opportunity."

OGDEN IS A QUARTERBACK'S BEST FRIEND; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: AT 6-8 AND 305 POUNDS, 
THE UCLA TACKLE GIVES COOK MAXIMUM PROTECTION. BUT LOSING STILL IS NO FUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Compassion? Understanding? Sympathy? 
</P>
<P>
 Forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jonathan Ogden calls home to Washington, D.C., he gets a reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad will say, 'You could be playing at Florida,' " Ogden said. "It was my 
second choice, but it was too hot and humid there." 
</P>
<P>
 Or Notre Dame -- "Too cold." Or Virginia -- "Too close." All offered 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Ogden is at UCLA, spending his Sundays trying to forget the 
Saturdays. His play stands out like a beacon, and not only because he's 6 feet 
8. Only one defender Ogden has blocked has touched a quarterback, and that was 
well after Wayne Cook had thrown a pass against Tennessee. But there is a 
four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 No sacks. No pressures. But no victories. 
</P>
<P>
 And his run blocking has been pretty good too. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had five Jonathan Ogdens, you'd have no problems," Coach Terry Donahue 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, there is only one Ogden, and the Bruins have plenty of problems. The 
losses have become hard to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to win," Ogden said. "There's a little bit of satisfaction in 
playing well, but not that much. Nobody pays any attention to what I do as a 
lineman. When the team does well, it means everybody is doing well, so that's 
what I want." 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't getting it, which makes the time between defeats difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just try to put (losing) behind me and look forward to next week," he said. 
"It's not easy, though. It's getting real hard now. I got up, watched pro 
football all day (Sunday) and didn't even think about our game. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last three weeks, Donahue said Monday, the offense has been 
counterproductive, giving up 16 points on a safety and two interceptions 
against California; 10 points on an interception return for a touchdown and a 
field goal after a turnover at Washington, and a touchdown after a pass 
interception against Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems are all over the place, Cook said. Except maybe at left tackle, 
where Ogden's junior season has been his best. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll kid him and say, 'Hey, Jon, has your guy made a tackle yet?' " Cook 
said. "And he'll say, 'Well, uh, I don't know.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is, usually not. Of more personal importance, though, Ogden has 
become something of a refuge for Cook, who only learned how much his sense of 
self-preservation depended on his left tackle by watching film of the game 
against Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 That game followed one in which Cook was sacked seven times, none of the 
defenders having come through Ogden.

 "When I looked at the film of the Washington game the next week and found I 
was moving away from pressure that really wasn't there, I was actually moving 
toward Ogden," Cook said. "I don't think I was consciously doing it, but 
unconsciously I guess that's where I sensed it was safe. Of course, it's tough 
to throw over him." 
</P>
<P>
 That barrier Cook has to throw over is part of the reason for Ogden's success. 
He became a starter in the seventh game of his freshman season, played all last 
season and has lined up for every play through UCLA's first six games. 
</P>
<P>
 At 305 pounds, Ogden has little speed, but he has the quickness to handle the 
linebackers that Pacific 10 schools generally line up at defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 "That quickness allows him to do something not many linemen can do," said Mike 
Sherman, UCLA's offensive line coach. "He can make a mistake on a guy and still 
recover in time to block him. Usually you only get one chance." 
</P>
<P>
 While others muse about playing pro football, Ogden accepts that he will make 
a living at the game, barring injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I was little, I've wanted to play in the NFL," he said. "When I 
look at games on TV, I always look at tackles and say, 'I can do that.' I see 
people who don't have any more talent than me, at least in my eyes, and I say, 
'If they can do it, I can do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Agents and their recruiters call, an annoyance during a losing streak. He has 
no car, they remind him. Come on out for the draft a year early, and he could 
have any car he wants from an NFL contract. 
</P>
<P>
 If losing at UCLA gets him down, there is sanctuary in track and field. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden is a shotputter and he loses himself in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "In track, you really don't have to depend on anybody else to have a good 
meet," he said. "In football, you can have a good game and the team can still 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, graduation is expected. His mother, Cassandra Sneed, has a law 
degree. His father, Shirrel Ogden, has one in business administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told my parents I would stay here," Ogden said. "Unless something 
drastic changes, I'm still going to be here. That's something drastic like 
somebody calls me and says, 'We want you in the first round, as our top pick. 
Would you think about coming out?' I don't want to come out as a second- or 
third-round pick." 
</P>
<P>
 He will test the draft after the season, using a form letter devised by the 
American Football Coaches Assn. to an NFL committee that will tell him his 
status within broad parameters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I joke that I could be with No. 1 in the country at Florida, but 
I'd rather be here," Ogden said. "College is not all football. If it was all 
football, I don't think I would be here. I'd probably be at Notre Dame if 
that's all I cared about."

KIROV: FROM RUSSIA WITH BRILLIANCE; THE CONCERT FOCUS WAS ON THE DISSOLUTION OF 
ROMANTICISM IN EARLY 20TH-CENTURY RUSSIA. THE PERFORMANCES WERE IMPECCABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A miracle happened at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Sunday night. A Russian 
orchestra came to town and didn't play Tchaikovsky. Nary a slurp. 
</P>
<P>
 This, to be sure, was no ordinary, garden-variety Russian orchestra. This was 
the elite orchestra of the Kirov Theater -- a.k.a. Maryinsky -- in 
sophisticated St. Petersburg. This was the historic, erstwhile imperial 
ensemble refined and polished in modern times by the great Yevgeny Mravinsky 
and his successor Yuri Temirkanov. 
</P>
<P>
 The maestro on duty here was Valery Gergiev, internationally oriented 
artistic-director at the Kirov since 1988 and a frequent guest on Western 
podia. He made a most auspicious Los Angeles debut in 1992 conducting our 
Philharmonic in a Russian program and will return for two weeks in May. Last 
year, he was given Verdi's "Otello" as an unorthodox introductory vehicle at 
the Metropolitan Opera, where he earned invariable approval for its heroic 
vitality and reservations from at least one observer (this one) for his 
unflaggingly nervous energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, Gergiev brought the Kirov orchestra to Costa Mesa for a program 
to be reviewed in Wednesday's Calendar. The symphonic agenda on Sunday bore a 
striking, probably coincidental resemblance to the program chosen by Esa-Pekka 
Salonen to open the Los Angeles Philharmonic season three days earlier. 
Stylistic cliches and easy effects were steadfastly avoided. The focus was on 
the dissolution of romanticism in the early decades of 20th-Century Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergiev began (after a leisurely entrance procession by his players) with the 
theatrical opulence of Rimsky-Korsakov's seldom-performed "Legend of the 
Invisible City of Kitezh" (1905), ended with the brazen exotica of Stravinsky's 
"Firebird" (1910) and used the muted bravura of Prokofiev's D-major Violin 
Concerto (1917) as subtle centerpiece. The performances, in all three cases, 
were brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kirov orchestra is a perfectly balanced, impeccably blended virtuoso 
instrument, and Gergiev plays it with masterly elan. The strings can shimmer 
without losing warmth, focus or intensity. The brass can blast without blaring. 
The winds, agreeably nasal in timbre, savor the impact of the tender caress. 
</P>
<P>
 Gergiev retains the seating plan apparently customary in Russia: violins at 
his left, violas at his right, cellos in the middle, brass at the top. The 
sonic configuration, at first a bit disorienting to foreign eyes and ears, 
creates uncommon vibrancy while it supports textural cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
 The maestro obviously knows his orchestra, and it obviously knows him. He 
doesn't have to concern himself much with such basics as beating time and 
offering cues. He doesn't even use a baton. Like his colleague Temirkanov, he 
prefers to concentrate on illustrative matters -- sculpting phrases in the air, 
flashing emotional signals, miming moods and, for reasons not quite clear to 
the uninitiated, constantly fluttering his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 It looks fussy. But it works. 
</P>
<P>
 In his hands, the "Kitezh" excerpts throbbed with reflective mystery, crashed 
with precision violence and evaporated in climactic serenity. The poignancy was 
exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
 With Viktor Tretyakov as extraordinarily sensitive, properly intimate soloist, 
the Prokofiev concerto offered object lessons in the projection and sustenance 
of feverish delicacy. It will be interesting, and perhaps instructive, to hear 
how the same challenge sounds next week when it is ventured by Julian Rachlin 
(replacing Midori), Salonen and the L.A. Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission (and another leisurely entrance procession for the 
players), Gergiev threatened to give us too much of a good thing. In 
Stravinsky's "Firebird" -- the whole, theatrically extended score, not the more 
reasonable suite -- the maestro dotted every musical i and crossed every t. 
Five times. 
</P>
<P>
 The pervasive attention to minutiae proved refreshing at the outset. The 
distinction between a pianissimo and a pianississimo was tellingly observed. 
The tone painting was carefully dazzling. The lyrical passages emerged 
incredibly ethereal, and the dramatic outbursts threatened cataclysm. Slow 
passages moved very slowly indeed, and fast ones flashed like lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 This was terrific music-making, no doubt about it. After a while, however, 
everything seemed a bit exaggerated, a bit self-conscious and more than a bit 
precious. Gergiev and his followers had taken Stravinsky's taut little ballet 
and turned it into a massive, swollen music-drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The approach certainly was interesting. The audience loved it. Nevertheless, 
the interpretation flirted with distortion if not perversion. 
</P>
<P>
 There were encores aplenty. Tretyakov repeated the scherzo of the Prokofiev 
concerto before intermission. At the end of the evening, Gergiev, ever 
generous, added the "Rakoczi" March from Berlioz's "La Damnation de Faust" and 
Liadov's "Baba Yaga."

HARVEY TAKES UNCONVENTIONAL APPROACH TO PIANO ARTISTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The more one talks to Michael Kieran Harvey -- the Australian co-winner of the 
controversy-riddled Ivo Pogorelich International Piano Competition in Pasadena 
in December -- the more extraordinary he seems: He's a competition winner with 
big ideas and unusual concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a pianist who not only dared the outre modernisms of Berio, Messiaen, 
Carter, Berg and little-known Australian composer Carl Vine amid the 
ultra-conservative confines of a piano competition, but who now also makes the 
shocking confession that his interpretation of Prokofiev's Seventh Sonata in 
the finals -- a deeply impressive one to critics -- was "ironic." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was actually 'sending it up' as a piece of music, because I think it's the 
most stupid piece," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a competition winner who refuses to play the Tchaikovsky Concerto: "I 
don't feel very much affinity for it, to be I'm probably shooting myself in the 
foot here and wiping out a whole lot of possible engagements, but that doesn't 
really interest me. I don't think I could play it with any sense of 
conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 And here is a competition winner who reads , and not just comic books. He has 
just tackled the I Ching, one of the five classics of Confucianism. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have commented on his "utter artistic conviction," his "formidable 
intellect." He's a composer as well; his recital at Ambassador Auditorium on 
Thursday will include his own "Toccata DNA." 
</P>
<P>
 Friendly and soft-spoken, father of one with one on the way (to be named 
Raphael, he says, beaming), Harvey is just in from New York where he was busy 
making connections and commissioning new works (he split $150,000 with Edith 
Chen as co-winner of the Pogorelich) from the likes of Milton Babbitt, Earle 
Brown, Mario Davidovsky and Steve Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 Strongly committed to presenting new music as an integral, rather than token, 
part of his programs, Harvey initially met with indifference from these 
composers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I started talking to them about my ideas, about performance mainly, 
how their music would be presented and then specifically what I would like (as 
a pianist) -- then they started to get interested. I think composers need to 
have almost like a recipe for writing music. They need to have an idea which 
can come from the performer." 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old Melburnian continually ponders his relationship with 
audiences, too. 
</P>
<P>
 He is "passionate about making the recital format relevant to the time we live 
in. . . . You can't ignore the tremendous influence technology has. You can't 
ignore the fact that a lot of young people these days are growing up with MTV 
and with the video image. You can't ignore that a lot of people see classical 
music as a class thing now and can't afford to go." 
</P>
<P>
 But he too often observes "a gulf of arrogance between the audience and the 
performer." Harvey has experimented using live video and projected photos in 
his recitals, and thematically incorporates the new music he plays with older 
music the audience can get a handle on. 
</P>
<P>
 The period since his Pogorelich victory has been difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really do feel like I've started to self-destruct this year. . . . You're 
not really told how to live as an artist, and you're certainly not given the 
tools for dealing with successful situations -- at least, I wasn't." In 
addition to "Overcoming the Fear of Success" (another book read recently by 
Harvey), he has had to deal with widespread indifference, even hostility, in 
Australia to his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's (what we call) the 'tall poppy' syndrome, which is that anyone who is 
extremely successful in Australia sort of gets cut down to size pretty quickly. 
. . . I'm the first Australian who has actually done this well in an 
international competition in history. I leapfrogged over a number of other 
musicians who are very high profile in Australia, and I guess that's 
threatening -- I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey also has a problem with nerves, describing his preconcert condition as 
"paralytic," but he has come to respect the "heightened consciousness" it gives 
him. He knows he needs it for the repertory he plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, I lost my virginity with 20th-Century music. It's not enough to 
simply play music that I understand, anymore. I also have to be playing music 
that I don't understand. I don't pretend to understand Milton Babbitt. I don't 
pretend to understand people such as Elliott Carter. But their music speaks to 
me in a way that is sometimes really scary, but it's also thrilling for me to 
try and understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Harvey performs at 8 p.m. Thursday at Ambassador Auditorium, 300 W. Green 
St., Pasadena, (800) 266-2378. $18-$21.

THE TYPE YOU CAN'T TYPE; FROM 'PULP FICTION' TO 'MONTH BY THE LAKE,' UMA 
THURMAN'S AT EASE WITH A RANGE OF ROLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GRITTEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the age of 24, Uma Thurman has an enviable acting career. She has played a 
wide range of roles and has been noticed for all the right reasons -- for her 
versatility and skill as an actress.  
</P>
<P>
 Sure, she was once on the cover of Rolling Stone's 1989 Hot Issue, and 
Mademoiselle magazine once called her "a thinking man's sex symbol," but 
Thurman herself has done nothing to pursue such hype. Yes, she did appear in 
some steamy bedroom scenes in playing the bisexual wife of novelist Henry 
Miller in "Henry and June"; but, hey, that was an art-house film, so it was all 
for a higher purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, Thurman's work hasn't been dogged either by scandal or controversy 
in the eight years she has been acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 She plays Mia, a gangster's wife, in "Pulp Fiction," the Quentin Tarantino 
film that opens Friday. It is fair to say that one particular sequence 
involving Thurman is destined for infamy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mia is escorted on an evening's date by John Travolta, a sidekick of her 
violent husband, who is out of town. In a retro '50s restaurant they dance 
charmingly together; she flirts with him. He frets because his boss is jealous; 
the last man she tried to seduce ended up dead at his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Back at her place she snorts what she thinks is cocaine but is really a deadly 
heroin cocktail, and lapses into a coma. Fearing for his life, Travolta carries 
her to his car and takes her to the home of his drug dealer. The two devise a 
way to save her life, in a jarring, hilarious and unforgettable scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wondered about doing it at first because the script was so shocking," 
Thurman says now. "I haven't made a habit of doing films with a lot of 
violence, and from what was on the page it was hard to tell, because in anyone 
else's hands it could become a sick movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I let Quentin talk me into it, and I believe in him. It was a matter of 
finding out what was in his heart, and what was in it was good, nothing 
malicious or full of hatred or exploitative. He has a pure, wild, crazy sense 
of humor, and a passion for filmmaking. And the film's funny. Horrifyingly 
funny, perhaps, but still funny." 
</P>
<P>
 She also enjoyed working with Travolta. "That dance scene was so camp, I 
couldn't pass it up. To dance with Travolta was like being able to do a Western 
with John Wayne; you'd happily play some barroom slut just for the 
opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 She relates all this sitting on a hotel terrace overlooking Lake Como, a place 
of tranquil beauty where she is making a very different sort of film. In "A 
Month by the Lake," directed by John Irvin, and based on an H. E. Bates 
novella, Edward Fox plays a middle-aged English major vacationing in the late 
1930s at an Italian lakeside hotel who becomes stupidly infatuated with the 
young American nanny played by Thurman. She toys with his affections, then 
becomes swiftly and openly bored; this sends him on the rebound toward an 
English woman of his own age, played by Vanessa Redgrave. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew members are tiptoeing around Redgrave and cater to her every whim, trying 
not to incur her ill humor. Due homage is paid to legendary Italian actress 
Alida Valli, who has a small part in "A Month by the Lake"; she is now 73 and 
in her sixth decade of filmmaking. Cinematographer Pasqualino de Santis, who 
made Visconti's "Death in Venice" look ravishing, must be addressed as 
"maestro"; he and his camera crew sit separately from the others at meals and 
eat with their own cutlery, china and linen; none dare to draw near. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet all the talk on set is not of these people, but of Thurman. The crew 
discuss her comings and goings, wonder out loud if she will be difficult or 
easy during the coming day, and speculate on the possible cause of her 
occasional mood swings. She is an object of infinite fascination. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Thurman poses for a photographer in the banquet hall of an 
18th-Century villa. She wears a long 1930s-style dress, which accentuates her 
tall, slim frame; her hair has been gathered into frizzy curls at the back. 
Something seems to happen to her before a camera's unblinking lens; she 
softens, warms and glows.  
</P>
<P>
 The sight of her reduces Fox to incoherent British schoolboy slang. "Stunning, 
isn't she?" he hisses. "Crikey. I'll say. Yes. Stunning. A . . . a knockout, 
really."  
</P>
<P>
 The attention Thurman effortlessly commands is, on the face of it, puzzling. 
In eight years as an actress, she has never starred in a hit film, and in fact 
has appeared in notable flops. The one unqualified success to her name was 
Stephen Frears' "Dangerous Liaisons," in which she played a 15-year-old virgin 
in 18th-Century France, but her role was subordinate to those of Glenn Close, 
John Malkovich and Michelle Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She has played a feisty Maid Marian in a made-for-TV version of Robin Hood, a 
kooky young girl in the commercially neglected John Boorman film "Where the 
Heart Is" and a Botticelli Venus on a clam shell in Terry Gilliam's flamboyant 
romp "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen." In "Mad Dog and Glory," opposite 
Robert De Niro, she played a young woman sent by a gangster as a "gift" to a 
man who saved his life. "She was an indentured servant," Thurman says acidly of 
the role. 
</P>
<P>
 This year has seen no upswing in her fortunes as yet. In Gus Van Sant's "Even 
Cowgirls Get the Blues," she played Sissy Hankshaw, a bisexual cowgirl with 
large thumbs, which facilitate her main activity, hitchhiking. The film bombed, 
despite re-cutting after preview audiences proved lukewarm. "It could have been 
funnier," Thurman says flatly. "It should have been funnier." 
</P>
<P>
 It all adds up to a checkered resume, yet Thurman's reputation remains 
unsullied, and she is always in demand for prestigious movie roles. Somehow she 
can make a string of indifferent movies, but rise effortlessly above them. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, on the hotel terrace overlooking the lake, Thurman immediately starts 
railing against "that stupid thing about being an actor. The pure acting itself 
is something I can truthfully say I love. Everything else about it I have an 
ambivalent relationship with, that whole thing about being an actor in the 
celebrity sense. But as my mother would say, that's just tough titty." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many American women of her generation, she is not given to Valley 
Girl-speak and does not say the word like every few seconds; she speaks coolly 
in complete paragraphs, rounding off her thoughts precisely. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father still wants me to become an academic," she says. "But not having 
had a formal clear road in my education, not having gone to college, my 
interests are as varied as my reading list. I love literature, so I'd probably 
have gone charging off into English studies." 
</P>
<P>
 She is from a liberal, academic, Bohemian background. Her father is a 
professor, a leading expert in Tibetan studies. Her Swedish-German mother, once 
married to Timothy Leary, is now a psychotherapist. Her name, Uma, is a Hindu 
word meaning "bestower of blessings." She had two yearlong sabbaticals with her 
parents in India; at age 15 she persuaded them to let her drop out of boarding 
school and try acting. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved to New York and precociously set up house in Hell's Kitchen, where 
junkies, muggers and hookers stalk street corners; the experience has clearly 
given her a sophisticated edge. The gamble worked: In New York she landed roles 
in two low-budget films, "Kiss Daddy Goodnight" and "Johnny Be Good," and her 
career began. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman radiates an almost European sensibility on screen and explains that 
her mother insisted her children should not think of themselves as American, 
even though they spent most of her childhood living in New England college 
towns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been presented to the world through European films," she says. "I've 
worked so much with European directors: Terry Gilliam, Stephen Frears, John 
Irvin, John Boorman. 'Henry and June' was about a European woman. And in 
general I have a taste for European films." 
</P>
<P>
 She also seems to pursue work in what some would say is a European way, 
choosing roles for their own value rather than the career breaks they might 
bring. Tell her the main characteristic of her career has been its immense 
range of roles, and she positively beams: "Glad you noticed. To say that is the 
one thing that can flatter me." 
</P>
<P>
 It has never been truer. "A Month by the Lake" is a period piece, a gentle 
romantic comedy of manners. While it is not from the Merchant Ivory stable, 
it's about English folk in Italy, and is the sort of film whose extras wear 
cream suits. It could hardly be further removed from "Even Cowgirls Get the 
Blues" or "Pulp Fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the story," Thurman says, "the idea of the major having misplaced his 
concept of what he loved and needed in his life, and finding himself eventually 
with (Redgrave's character). It's a story about tender, 'less important' 
emotions, and it expresses them beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
 She relishes the contrast but hasn't always felt so bullish about her career: 
"Around the time I was 21, I decided it takes an active relationship with your 
life in order not to be gobbled up by being a movie actress and all the crap 
you deal with, that sense of alienation." 
</P>
<P>
 She took a break from acting, and spent time with her brother. "At that time, 
I didn't exactly love a lot of the scripts I was being offered. And there were, 
um, a few other circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed there were. In 1991, Thurman married British actor Gary Oldman; the 
couple had been an item for some three years. But the marriage ended after 18 
months amid speculation that Oldman's volatile personality had wrecked the 
union; indeed, her association with Oldman has fueled talk that Thurman is 
something of a wild child herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Her colleagues don't necessarily disagree. Redgrave says, "She's special, a 
fantastically good actress as well as being very beautiful. She has a 
marvelously individual sense of character and comedy." John Irvin adds: "She 
has an idiosyncratic way of finding a character -- there's a wildness about 
her.  
</P>
<P>
 "The joy of Uma is she's never dull, predictable or safe."

 Dueling Rosies. 
</P>
<P>
 That's tonight's exotic television matchup as PBS opens a two-part biography 
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Fox premieres its one-nighter quickie about 
Roseanne (the former Roseanne Arnold and Roseanne Barr). 
</P>
<P>
 The latter is a Fox crotch job, with "Roseanne: An Unauthorized Biography" 
doing to its subject pretty much what she did to the national anthem a few 
years back.

 Much more melodic is "The American Experience: FDR," a 4 1/2-hour documentary 
about the nation's 32nd chief executive, whom many historians regard as having 
redefined the presidency while leading the United States through the Great 
Depression and horrific World War II. Charismatic and commanding despite being 
disabled by polio, Roosevelt was a "President like no other," narrator David 
McCullough notes tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's Roseanne, star of tabloid headlines, of squabbles with her estranged 
spouse, Tom Arnold, and of her own hit ABC sitcom, who's much the better known 
today. Such is our obsession with boisterous celebrities who are ultimately 
devoured by the very media they spend much of their careers manipulating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there wasn't a broad streak of show business in Roosevelt, whose own 
epic manipulation of the press is arguably unmatched in modern presidential 
politics. "You and I are the two best actors in America," he's recalled saying 
to Orson Welles in tonight's "FDR," a memorable documentary from David Grubin, 
whose impressive PBS credits include a grand 1992 biography of Lyndon Johnson 
and "Marshall, Texas; Marshall, Texas," an extraordinary chronicle of Bill 
Moyers' return to his hometown a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, happy days are here again, so to speak, for despite offering little 
that appears new, Grubin's "FDR" is a fascinating, meaningful rendering of 
history, stylishly crafting diverse data into an irresistible narrative that 
has great relevance for a 1994 audience. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it was Roosevelt whose bold signature in the 1930s and early 1940s 
was the kind of big government that today is increasingly reviled by outspoken 
politicians, reformers and others who insist that only through federal 
smallness can a troubled United States ever achieve salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 "FDR" shines a light on the complex man behind the caricatured broad grin and 
long cigarette holder. By and large, it's a warm light -- one that also leaves 
some shadows, for, as we're told here, he was a "charming but a distant figure" 
even to those who were closest to him. 
</P>
<P>
 They included his controlling, ever-looming mother, whom we meet here as 
matriarch of the Hyde Park estate that symbolized young Franklin's cocooned 
upbringing as a product of old-monied New York royalty, a family that was 
already represented in the White House by FDR's cousin, Theodore Roosevelt, 
when Franklin graduated from Harvard with his own aspirations for the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1905, he marries his distant cousin, Eleanor, who will also have an 
enormous influence on him while much later becoming a renowned political figure 
in her own right, her independence growing after she discovers his affair with 
her social secretary, Lucy Mercer, in 1918. After this, Eleanor moves to a 
separate cottage two miles from Hyde Park, and the couple never again "shared 
the intimacies of married life," McCullough says, a political union supplanting 
their marital partnership. This relationship continues through Franklin's dozen 
years in the White House, which ended with his death in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 The uniqueness of that relationship is described here, as are FDR's famed 
Depression-era policies, the tactics he used to aid England even before the 
United States was drawn into World War II and his special relationship with 
another epic figure of history, Winston Churchill. Roosevelt was "flawed, 
inconsistent and often deceitful," McCullough says. But, most agree, he was 
very good at being President. 
</P>
<P>
 Of special interest here are unusual old photographs and home-movie footage 
that relate a separate story about an FDR whose paralysis was much more severe 
than most of the public ever realized. There he is in 1921, at age 39, after 
contracting the dreaded polio, the last time he is seen standing alone on his 
own feet. And there he is cavorting in a pool with children at the Warm 
Springs, Ga., clinic he established for victims of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 And quite stunningly, there he is in a four-second sequence, played in slow 
motion, appearing to walk even though he couldn't. Knowing that to be disabled 
in those days was "political poison," he devised a rocking-motion technique -- 
one hand pushing down on a cane, the other on the arm of one of his sons -- 
that gave the illusion of him walking. "I don't think five in 100 Americans 
even knew he was paralyzed," says observer Alistair Cooke.  
</P>
<P>
 Wearing black braces that blended in with black pants and black socks helped, 
as did a "conspiracy of consent" on the part of White House photographers -- 
which would be unthinkable in the 1990s -- to not reveal the extent of the 
President's disability. 
</P>
<P>
 For whatever reason, "FDR" has its own information blackouts -- never telling 
us how Roosevelt felt about his paralysis, for example, or his feelings about 
civil rights for blacks, an issue on which Eleanor apparently pressed him. The 
program also dismisses in a couple of inadequate sentences FDR's approval of 
Japanese Americans being rounded up and interned after Pearl Harbor and his 
decision not to intervene in the Nazi death camps.  
</P>
<P>
 What does come through is the personal magnetism that he relied on. "Meeting 
Roosevelt," Churchill said at a eulogy for the President, "was like uncorking 
your first bottle of champagne." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's film on Roseanne (NBC has another scheduled later this month) is the 
cork minus the champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Denny Dillon occasionally locating glints of humanity beneath her 
subject's shrill veneer, and David Graf persuasively cloning Tom Arnold's 
mannerisms, "Roseanne: An Unauthorized Biography" is as dispensable as all 
those self-serving photo ops and talk-show appearances these two orchestrated 
en route to their noisy breakup.  
</P>
<P>
 If there is anything new to say about them -- given the clanging media music 
that has accompanied every aspect of their volatile lives -- this mishmash of 
flashbacks and flash forwards doesn't say it. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne moves through her troubled adolescence (she's institutionalized after 
blindly walking in heavy traffic with a towel over her head), then through her 
teen pregnancy, until one day, a year later, she wakes up looking like Denny 
Dillon, who, in some of the wigs she's given to wear, looks like Meat Loaf in 
drag. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox says certain characters and events in its movie (directed by Paul 
Schneider and written by Karen Harris) have been "fictionalized," so take it 
literally at your own risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon's Roseanne is part witch, part victim, miserable as a kid in a 
dysfunctional environment, later miserable in a marriage with her first husband 
-- a beer-guzzling, belching good old boy. More misery awaits at the end of her 
marriage to Tom, whom she meets at a comedy club in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time she's already lived to the hilt, doing guys for money while 
working as a cocktail waitress. Tom does drugs. Then he's in rehab. Then Tom 
and Roseanne are in a mansion. Then Roseanne's chewing out someone. Then Tom 
and Roseanne are chewing out each other. Then Roseanne chews out her family, 
accusing her father of molesting her after Tom says he was molested as a kid. 
Then they chew each other out again. Then Roseanne locks Tom out. Then Tom 
pounds on the front door. Then Roseanne hides under the sheets. 
</P>
<P>
 This gets you to the end credits. Meanwhile, if you really haven't had your 
fill of Roseanne, she's available playing herself on Wednesday's season finale 
of HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show." The script has Roseanne helping poor Larry 
recover from his own prescription-drug addiction. If he reveals he's in rehab, 
Larry's producer warns him, "Fox will make a TV movie about you before the end 
of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 That you can take literally. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The American Experience: FDR" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and 
KPBS-TV Channel 15, and at 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. "Roseanne: The 
Unauthorized Biography" airs at 8 tonight on Fox (Channels 11 and 6). "The

MACNEIL CONFIRMS HE WILL LEAVE PBS 'NEWSHOUR' IN 1995; TV: HE CITES PROGRAM 
BUDGET SHORTFALLS, FINANCIAL PRESSURES AT WNET. JIM LEHRER WILL ANCHOR ALONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Robert MacNeil confirmed Monday that he will retire as co-anchor of PBS' 
"MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour" next year and said his decision was influenced by 
funding difficulties in public television. 
</P>
<P>
 MacNeil, 63, told "NewsHour" staffers that he intends to leave in October, 
1995, the newscast's 20th anniversary. Jim Lehrer, 60, who co-anchors the 
hourlong weekday broadcasts from Washington, will then become solo anchor, with 
all operations being consolidated in the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "My close colleagues know that I've been thinking about when to retire, and 
the 20th anniversary provides a nice symmetry," MacNeil said in an interview, 
"but what confirmed me was the coincidence of our need to save money. We were 
faced with a budget shortfall in our funding, and the situation with WNET meant 
that we were going to have to pay even more money to stay in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 "NewsHour," one of the most popular and critically praised series on the PBS 
schedule, with an annual budget of $25 million, is facing a 7 1/2% shortfall 
this year because one of its three major corporate underwriters, PepsiCo, 
dropped out last July. Meanwhile, WNET-TV, the PBS flagship station here, is 
said to be losing an estimated $4 million a year on its studio operation and 
has asked "NewsHour" to pay more in rent. The station has only committed to 
keeping the studio running through June. 
</P>
<P>
 "NewsHour" executive producer Les Crystal said that "the financial problems of 
WNET mean that they're not sure they can keep the studio open past next June. 
That financial instability was a factor in our decision" to consolidate 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 William F. Baker, president of WNET, said he didn't know yet what the impact 
of losing "NewsHour" will be. "We have to run a very tight ship economically in 
these times," he said, "and we have to decide whether the best use of our 
limited resources is in a studio or in other areas such as program 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 MacNeil said he believes "NewsHour" will not suffer editorially from the 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started the two-city operation years ago when we were a single-subject 
hour with talking heads," he said. "Today we've got a variety of voices and a 
greater variety of elements within the show, and we don't need that 
Washington-New York scaffolding the way we did. This is a show that focuses on 
public-policy issues and (that) views Washington as the news capital of the 
world. Jim Lehrer has always been more than half of this partnership, and he 
will continue to do outstanding work." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlayne Hunter-Gault and other members of the New York reporting staff are 
expected to work out of Washington. Lehrer told staffers that Hunter-Gault, 
Margaret Warner, Elizabeth Farnsworth and Kwame Holman will regularly do focus 
and newsmaker interviews as part of a regular sub-anchor system when MacNeil 
retires. 
</P>
<P>
 But the anchors and producers said they do not know yet how many jobs will be 
eliminated in the consolidation. "NewsHour" has about 50 staffers in New York 
and 40 in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 MacNeil, who has written several novels, said he hopes to write more fiction 
and nonfiction after he departs "NewsHour."

JAZZ TAKES ROOT IN ANOTHER LAND; HAROLD JR. CONTINUES THE LEGACY OF HIS FAMOUS 
SAX-PLAYING FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harold Land Jr. has one of the most distinguished names in jazz: his father's. 
</P>
<P>
 Land Jr. -- a pianist who has worked with the likes of Gerald Wilson, Pharoah 
Sanders and Marvin Gaye -- is the son of Harold Land, a saxophonist who was at 
the forefront of the be-bop movement in the mid-'50s as a member of the Max 
Roach-Clifford Brown quintet. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, seeing the name on a billboard can mean one of three things: You'll 
hear Land Sr. blowing mature, assured tenor. Or, you'll get the 44-year-old 
pianist who can swing and play funk. Or, you'll get both (they often perform 
together). 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been some mix-ups," the younger Land admitted in a phone 
conversation from -- wouldn't you know it? -- his father's home in Los Angeles. 
Land Jr. will play tonight at Spaghettini in Seal Beach with singer LaTonya 
Reed, bassist Richard Reid and one of the best-known drummers in jazz, Billy 
Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the Lands have different middle names. But that isn't enough for 
most people to discern between them. So the "Jr." was added to help keep things 
straight -- but it wasn't added by the father or the son. 
</P>
<P>
 Land Sr. had been scheduled to play a club in the Valley and when it turned 
out that he couldn't make it, younger Harold agreed to take the spotlight. "The 
(club) owner went out and added 'Jr.' to the name on the marquee," young Harold 
recalls. "Since then, I've used it." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up with Harold Land as a father had obvious advantages. Land Jr., who 
began taking piano lessons at age 7, says his parents encouraged his musical 
pursuits but weren't overly pushy about it. His mother was not a trained 
musician, although she took a few guitar lessons and enjoyed listening and 
dancing to jazz. "We always had a lot of records around the house," the son 
remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to cite his earliest influences, he named musicians with whom his 
father played: drummer Frank Butler, bassist Curtis Counce, pianist Elmo Hope, 
trumpeters Carmell Jones and Jack Sheldon. "A lot of different people played in 
his groups and those guys were instrumental to me, providing the right kind of 
example. I would get home from school and see them at the end of a rehearsal. 
Occasionally, I would get to go to one of the gigs. Seeing all of them work 
like that really made an impression on me." 
</P>
<P>
 But what really turned him onto jazz piano was a pair of albums by Sonny 
Clark, "Cool Struttin"' and "Leapin' and Lopin'." "(Clark) really touched me. I 
liked his warm sound, yet rhythmically he was still real smooth." 
</P>
<P>
 If young Harold had any doubts about a future playing jazz, they were erased 
when he heard the John Coltrane Quartet at Shelly Manne's Manne Hole in 
Hollywood in the early '60s and, later, when he caught the Miles Davis band 
that included pianist Herbie Hancock, bassist Ron Carter, saxophonist Wayne 
Shorter and drummer Tony Williams. Those performances "made me realize that 
jazz was something that could be kept fresh, that it didn't need to be kept on 
a shelf and dusted off whenever it was needed." 
</P>
<P>
 As a young pianist, he made such an impression on his elders that his parents 
helped arrange a club date for him at the Tropicana Club in L.A. before his 
16th birthday. His first professional gig as a sideman came just before his 
high school graduation, with Crusaders trombonist Wayne Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met him through a friend of my father's, (Crusader's pianist) Joe Sample. 
At that time the Crusaders were burned out on travel so Henderson was hoping to 
put a band together that could do some weekend gigs." He cut two albums with 
Henderson, including the cult favorite "People Get Ready." 
</P>
<P>
 He credits bandleader Wilson with giving him his first "pure" jazz gig, which 
came shortly after Land Jr. finished high school. He has maintained a 
relationship with Wilson and appears on his "Orchestra of the '80s" release. 
</P>
<P>
 Land Jr. accumulated a number of important credits during the '70s, touring 
with guitarist Kenny Burrell and saxophonist Sanders. His most visible gig was 
with Marvin Gaye in 1976. "We toured all over the South and then did a couple 
of shows at Radio City Music Hall. He would often come out and play basketball 
with members of the band. I always thought of him as a quiet, reflective type 
of person who loved sports and music." 
</P>
<P>
 Land Jr. also has worked with the late guitarist Eric Gale, saxophonist Joe 
Henderson, vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson and funk vibist Roy Ayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another side of him is surfacing through his work on a musical history of jazz 
that he hopes to present to schools and cultural groups. "I thought it would be 
good to look at jazz all the way back to the black church music and past to 
Africa, to show how it developed," he said. The project -- which includes his 
father, drummer Higgins and bassist Henry Franklin -- offers examples of many 
of jazz's various periods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to remember where things come from," Land Jr. said. And given 
that he is the son of one of the true jazz giants, you know he means it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harold Land Jr. plays with drummer Billy Higgins, bassist Richard Reid and 
singer LaTonya Reed tonight at 7:30 at Spaghettini, 3005 Old Ranch Parkway, 
Seal Beach ((310) 596-2199) and with singer Reed every Sunday at 6 p.m. at 
DeMario's, 17 Monarch Bay Plaza, Laguna Niguel ((714) 240-9436).

BRUTAL SLAYING OF WOMAN, 77, BAFFLES THOSE SHE KNEW; VIOLENCE: GRIEVED 
RELATIVES SAY BERNEDA MCMACKIN, FOUND STABBED AND BEATEN IN HER BURNING HOME, 
WAS PRIVATE AND VERY CAUTIOUS.

<P>
 The brutal killing of an elderly woman in her home has baffled relatives and 
friends, who described her Monday as a habitually cautious and private person 
who would never have opened her door to a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either you had a key to my grandmother's house or you didn't come in," said 
Monine Horn, one of the three grandchildren of Berneda McMackin, 77, whose body 
was discovered Sunday afternoon by police and neighbors in her burning house on 
Blewett Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone had gone in and stabbed her, beat her and then tried to set her on 
fire to try and hide the crime," said Detective Stephen Fisk of the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects have been arrested for the slaying, which police say may have been 
committed during a burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 News of McMackin's killing left her family distraught and angry and nearby 
residents frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary," said one neighbor who asked not to be identified. "You hear 
about things like this happening at other places." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," said neighbor Margaret Reed. "She never bothered anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, whose husband accompanied police into the burning house to find the 
body, said the front and rear doors were closed but unlocked, which relatives 
said was unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn said it was unthinkable that her grandmother, who had lived alone in the 
house since the 1976 death of her husband, a former Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputy, would open her door to a stranger, and no windows had been 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 McMackin's daughter, Robin Crays of Las Vegas, said detectives showed her a 
mason's tool resembling a putty knife, which they believed was the murder 
weapon, and said the contents of her purse had been dumped on the floor, 
indicating robbery may have been the motive. She could not tell whether 
anything had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't understand how this person got in," Horn said.  
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "As close as we were, I had only been inside her house once in 40 years," said 
an elderly woman for whom McMackin used to shop. The woman, who asked not to be 
identified, said McMackin would stop by her house every few days to chat about 
their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said that, following the Northridge earthquake, McMackin would not even 
let Reed's husband, who works for the gas company, into her home to make sure 
her gas was shut off. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wouldn't even open the door to him," Reed said. "So I can't believe she'd 
open the door to just anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors also said one of McMackin's two dogs was extremely protective of 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 McMackin was found by Reed's husband and police in the doorway of her 
cluttered, smoke-filled kitchen after residents smelled smoke coming from her 
home about 2:45 p.m. Firefighters extinguished the blaze at 4:11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crays said she had talked to her mother on the phone between 11:30 a.m. and 
noon on the day of the killing and that "she was fine" and was waiting for a 
phone call from Horn, who was possibly going to stop by for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a great mother," Crays said. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Nebraska, McMackin had lived in the modest house on Blewett Avenue 
since 1949, family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew her described McMackin as an extremely active and strong woman 
and an avid recycler who collected papers and cans and cleaned homes to earn 
extra money. 
</P>
<P>
 McMackin was also known as a generous grandmother who showered her six 
great-grandchildren with candy and as a thoughtful friend who would help anyone 
she could. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother had no enemies," Horn said. "She never did anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish she were still here. It's so unfair how things turn out."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; VAUGHN CHARTER SCHOOL SETS SAIL FOR EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an elaborate morality play of a 1990s, media-savvy variety, the students, 
faculty and staff of the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center staged the 
landmark events of the school's history by borrowing from the story of 
Columbus' discovery of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The 800-plus cast put on the allegorical search for the "New World" of 
education Monday -- the official observance of Columbus Day -- during a 
ground-breaking ceremony for a new, 14-class academy to be built at the edge of 
the Vaughn campus in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 On the land where the academy will be located are two houses whose tenants 
were evicted because they sold narcotics there, school and local government 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaughn Next Century Learning Center is a charter school, which means it is 
a self-governing, community-based public educational institution that is free 
from state regulations, although still part of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, through emphasizing school attendance and cutting down on 
administrative duties, Vaughn saved $1.2 million of its budget. Between 
$700,000 and $900,000 of the $1.2 million will be used toward the construction 
of the new academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Yvonne Chan said that the academy, equipped with more than 50 IBM 
computers, will be devoted to acquainting youngsters with the so-called 
information superhighway.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the extra classrooms will allow the school to run at full 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, two-thirds of the enrolled students are at school at one time. 
"It's going to be a true year-round school," said Chan, who plans to extend the 
year to more days of instruction and have all students attending at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not only relieve overcrowding, but it will be the only school to have 
additional instructional time," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy is expected to be completed by July, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, in a grand fanfare complete with ladies-in-waiting with cone-shaped 
hennin hats made of poster-board and colored tissue paper and knights with 
aluminum-foil swords, a pint-sized Christopher Columbus -- 10-year-old Miguel 
Ortiz -- asked for a charter for Vaughn. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbus bowed before Leticia Quezada, a school board member, in the role of 
Queen Isabella; School Board President Mark Slavkin as King Ferdinand; district 
Supt. Sid Thompson as the ship's commander, and Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), playing an ambassador. He was granted the charter, thus embarking 
on the journey to the New World.

 Three classrooms, representing the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria, set 
sail across the playground, facing stormy weather and nasty pirates, until they 
reached the two houses where the flags of the United States, California and 
Vaughn were planted. 
</P>
<P>
 As ambassador to the New World, Katz rode a bulldozer that took the first 
whack at tearing down one of the houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a 100% win situation," said Katz, pointing out that not only is 
Vaughn helping turn a crack house into a schoolhouse, but also helping the 
area's economy by working with local construction companies. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ALEX THEATER TO SHOW 'GONE WITH THE WIND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Though the Alex Theater's first year as a performing arts hub has been rocky, 
a group of local film enthusiasts is convinced the venue's future is anything 
but "Gone with the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, members of the nonprofit Alex Film Society have slated a gala 
screening of the 4 1/2-hour 1939 MGM Civil War drama at 7 p.m. Nov. 17 as a 
kickoff for what they hope will be a revival of classic American films at the 
Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing classic films in the Alex is like reliving them," said Brian Ellis, 
president of the film society and first assistant director of the NBC sitcom 
"Frasier." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our events won't be panned, scanned, colorized or cut for time like on TV, 
and seeing films at the Alex is vastly superior to viewing the tiny theaters of 
multiplex cinemas," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said the group plans to show popular musicals and dramas from 
"Hollywood's golden years" -- the 1930s through 1950s. Plans are in the works 
for possible screenings of restored prints of "The Wizard of Oz" and "Doctor 
Zhivago." 
</P>
<P>
 Located at 216 N. Brand Blvd., the Alex's days as a movie house were over by 
the time the Glendale Redevelopment Agency bought it from Mann Theatres in 1991 
for about $800,000.  
</P>
<P>
 After a $6.5-million restoration it was reopened as a venue for musical 
theater and concerts in January.  
</P>
<P>
 But Theater Corp. of America, the firm hired to book shows and run the 
operation, balked midway through the first year of a five-year contract and the 
city is suing the company and looking for a new theater manager. The theater is 
being run intermittently by the Alex Regional Theater Board, a nonprofit group. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Armstrong, Glendale's director of redevelopment, lauded the film 
society as a group of "dedicated volunteers" intent on bringing movies back to 
the Alex.  
</P>
<P>
 She said the Redevelopment Agency helped the group locate equipment that had 
been put in storage after Mann Theaters closed the Alex, including a 
35-millimeter film projector and a sound system. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong said there had been little discussion of showing movies at the Alex 
because when the Redevelopment Agency purchased the theater from Mann, it 
agreed not to screen movies on a commercial basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agreement has a covenant stating that we cannot compete with the Mann 
Theaters (in the Exchange, a nearby office and retail complex)," Armstrong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But onetime screenings to benefit a charity or nonprofit group are allowed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Alex Film Society is busily working to get the theater ready for movie 
screenings in time for the Nov. 17 event. The original movie screen was removed 
during the theater's renovation and the film society and the Redevelopment 
Agency are reportedly buying a replacement screen for about $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said one of the best things about the return of movies to the theater is 
the price tag. Whereas tickets to musicals at the Alex have cost up to $35, 
admission to the movies will be $7.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Three screenings of "Gone with the Wind" are slated -- Nov. 17 and 18 at 7 
p.m. and Nov. 20 at 1 p.m. For information, call (818) 243-2539. STEVE RYFLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE, BURBANK; FORUMS WILL PROBE BALLOT MEASURES

<P>
 With election day approaching, students at Glendale College and community 
groups have slated educational forums and debates on two controversial 
statewide ballot initiatives aimed at reforming health care and curtailing 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Assn. of Latin American Students and the college's ethnic studies 
department will host the first of two forums on Proposition 187, the measure 
that would deny education, health care, welfare and other government services 
to illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 A panel of health care workers, lawyers, educators, social workers and others 
will discuss the issue from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the campus center, and the 
student group will make a "major announcement" on the proposition at the 
conclusion of the event, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second forum on Proposition 187 will be held from 7 to 9 p.m. Thursday on 
the second floor of the campus center. 
</P>
<P>
 Also today, Verdugo Hills Hospital will present a forum and discussion on 
Proposition 186, the California Health Security Act, also known as the 
"single-payer initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 The event, slated from 7 to 9 p.m. in the council room of the hospital, 1812 
Verdugo Road, will feature as panelists Jon Gilwee of the Hospital Council of 
Southern California, Dr. Vincent Gualtieri and state Assemblyman James Rogan 
(R-Glendale.) 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 20, the League of Women Voters of Glendale/Burbank will host an 
"advocacy forum" on Proposition 186 at 7:30 p.m. in the First Methodist Church, 
700 N. Glenoaks Blvd., Burbank. "Obviously, health coverage is an important 
issue for us all," said Dick Seeley, an organizer of the event. He said the 
forum's aim is to counteract "misinformation, both spoken and written" about 
the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the forums are free and open to the public. Information on the events 
at Glendale College: (818) 240-1000, Ext. 5470; on the event at Verdugo Hills 
Hospital: (818) 952-2227; on the League of Women Voters forum: (818) 248-1793.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND; RESIDENTS TO CLEAN TUJUNGA PONDS AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunland residents have organized a cleanup of the Tujunga Ponds, a spot near 
the point where Foothill Boulevard crosses over the Tujunga Wash that has been 
polluted by litter and illegal swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's trashed everywhere," said Phil Tabbi, a community police representative, 
who is organizing the Oct. 22 cleanup."The fences have been cut." 
</P>
<P>
 The ponds are within the protected Tujunga Wash and swimming there is illegal. 
However, trespassers have cut the protective wire fencing and have been 
swimming at the ponds "for some time," Tabbi said. He visited the site recently 
and saw piles of garbage, including disposable diapers, three feet high, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, police have started to cite the illegal swimmers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup already has local 4-H clubs and Scouting, equestrian and church 
groups pitching in to help. But more volunteers are welcome, Tabbi said. The 
cleanup, which also includes local streams, will start at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A small pedestrian bridge and picnic benches have been broken as well, Tabbi 
said. Two local women had been trying to clean up the area on their own, but 
they can only do so much, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to help should contact Tabbi at (818) 768-0988. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PANORAMA CITY; GOODWILL SALE TO OFFER SPECIALTY ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An antique Rolex watch -- a steal at $1,000 -- will be among the choice items 
on sale at Goodwill Industries of Southern California's Preferred Merchandise 
sale Saturday and Sunday . 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Chanel suits donated by a movie star were a featured item at the 
sale, whose proceeds support Goodwill's programs for disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with a two-day sale earlier this month in Los Angeles, the event -- 
now in its sixth year -- will offer more than $200,000 worth of previously 
owned goods, including antiques, china, furs, collectibles, Oriental rugs, 
crystal, jewelry, paintings and designer clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale will be held from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Sunday at Goodwill's Panorama City plant, 14565 Lanark St. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the year the charity receives donations of merchandise sold in its 
thrift stores. The most unique items are held back and offered for sale at the 
annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chance to get an Armani suit for $50, or a Coach purse for $25," said 
Jill Nickerson, a spokeswoman for Goodwill.  
</P>
<P>
 Nickerson said she hopes that people will also come to support the work that 
Goodwill does, and that those who aren't familiar with its programs will gain a 
better understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its programs are a training course for deaf people to learn 
computer-related job skills, a job placement program for mentally disabled 
people and employment workshops for disadvantaged people. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwill made $50,000 from its Los Angeles sale and hopes to make $25,000 from 
the sale at its smaller San Fernando Valley plant. Nickerson said that Valley 
residents will get the first crack at the Panorama City plant's inventory, not 
the remainders of the Los Angeles sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodwill helps 1,800 people a year and aided 170 people in finding jobs in 
1993, Nickerson said. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD IN NEED OF QUAKE REPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard to believe some of the greatest Little Leaguers on Earth once took 
batting practice at this ballpark. Cracks line the stucco walls of the dugouts. 
Swaths of infield are more gravel and dirt than grass. The clubhouse is no 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Granada Hills Little League baseball field was clean and green in 1964, 
when the previous year's world champs moved from a nearby park to practice 
under the looming Los Angeles Department of Water and Power transmission 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1994, the field in the 16000 block of Rinaldi Street was in serious 
disrepair, but at least the green-and-white buildings stood. Then came the 
Northridge earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 When the temblor hit, the clubhouse collapsed, as did a 500-foot-long block 
wall. Two dugouts were severely cracked and two others were damaged. Pipes 
broke, grass dried up and the taps in the two snack bars began dispensing brown 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and players worked quickly after the Jan. 17 quake, shoring up 
structures and removing enough rubble so teams could play on the four diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that baseball season is over, the dust has settled and the extent of the 
damage has become clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "That earthquake messed us up," said Joe Cook, who manages a team of 11- and 
12-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, who learned to hit a curve ball at the field in the early 1970s, now 
manages his 12-year-old son Chris' team. And he, his wife Sue and other son 
Ryan spend much of their free time refurbishing the battered park, along with 
several other players and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have the people to get the job done," said league president Irwin 
Rosenberg. "It's dollars we need." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty thousand of them. Big money to a Little League that operates on a yearly 
budget of about $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs us $10,000 a season just for baseballs," Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have decided the restrooms are too badly damaged to be open next 
year without repair. The clubhouses need more, as does the sprinkler system. 
And the 1995 season is looming, with registration beginning later this month 
and tryouts taking place in January. 
</P>
<P>
 A local physician has offered $5,000 for rebuilding, Rosenberg said, but more 
money as well as materials and equipment are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in making a donation or pitching in to help can call 
Rosenberg at (818) 368-8441. ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; REPAIRS PLANNED ON FLOOD-PRONE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Repair work is scheduled to begin this month on a stretch of Old Topanga 
Canyon Road in an unincorporated area near the city of Calabasas, county 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch of road, north of Zuniga Road, is prone to flooding and is 
considered a safety hazard, according to a statement issued by Supervisor Ed 
Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 The hillsides above the road were denuded by last year's wildfires, and 
officials fear that runoff will create flooding on the road below, said Donna 
Guyovich, a spokeswoman for the county's Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A contract has been awarded for $196,101 to Seasand Construction Co. of 
Lawndale, according to Edelman. The work will include construction of a 
double-barreled, reinforced concrete box culvert that will replace existing 
pipe.  
</P>
<P>
 Eight trees will be removed because they interfere with the operation of the 
culvert, Guyovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Office of Emergency Services and Federal Emergency Management Agency 
will reimburse the county for a portion of the cost, Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to take about 50 working days and end in December, he 
said. Traffic on Old Topanga Canyon Road may be reduced to one lane after 
construction begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers concerned about delays are advised to seek alternative routes, 
Guyovich said. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; MAYOR PLANS COAT DRIVE FOR THE NEEDY

<P>
 Despite recent soaring temperatures, Calabasas city leaders know the mercury 
will be dropping soon, and with it, the living standards of the San Fernando 
Valley's homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why Mayor Karyn Foley has started a drive to collect outerwear, which 
will be distributed to the needy during the winter holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said she got the idea from reading a magazine article about a similar 
project in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we collected food -- (but) everybody collects food," Foley said. "I 
wanted to do something a little independent of what everyone else does." 
</P>
<P>
 The drive will be launched at the City Council meeting in City Hall on Oct. 19 
at 7:30 p.m. People can bring sweaters, jackets and coats for children and 
adults, either to City Hall or to the book booth at the Calabasas Farmers 
Market on Saturday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley is organizing the drive with Troy Trimmer of the Salvation Army, which 
will receive the donated clothing and distribute it among the needy. The mayor 
said she hopes the drive will net a few hundred coats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very cold winter coming up," Foley said. "There's a lot of children 
and adults that simply won't have anything to keep them warm, especially the 
homeless. If we can give them some coats and jackets, then we're doing our 
part." KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY WANTS PERMIT FOR AHMANSON ROAD PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council has upheld a decision by the city Planning 
Commission to require the developer of Ahmanson Ranch to apply for a special 
permit to extend Las Virgenes Road 15 feet to the Ventura County line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just felt the application was incomplete, and that additional information 
is needed to adequately process the application," said Mayor Karyn Foley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agreed to go along with the ruling" and apply for the special permit, said 
Mary Trigg, a spokeswoman for Ahmanson Land Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land initially filed for an encroachment permit to extend Las 
Virgenes Road to make way for the project, said Steve Harris, Calabasas' 
community development director. After reviewing the application, the city's 
planning staff sent Ahmanson a letter saying the application was incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 To complete its application, Ahmanson must file for a conditional-use permit 
and conduct an environmental review of the road-extension proposal, Harris 
said, because the area is part of the Las Virgenes Road Scenic Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson appealed the matter to the Planning Commission, which upheld the 
staff recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson Land wants to build 3,050 homes, two golf courses and 400,000 square 
feet of commercial space in a hilly area southeast of Simi Valley near the 
border of Los Angeles County. The Las Virgenes Road extension is considered 
crucial to the project because it would be part of a major road system to the 
proposed development. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire project has met fierce opposition from residents and municipalities 
in the area, who say it would disrupt surrounding neighborhoods. Several 
communities, including Calabasas, have sued the developers in an effort to 
block the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The developers maintain that they have done all they can to minimize the 
impact of the project, approved two years ago by the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors. An environmental study done on the project demonstrates that 
clearly, Ahmanson officials maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the city of Calabasas' actions to date on the road-extension proposal 
have dealt with technical issues, city officials said. Eventually, the city 
will begin studying the actual merits of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted in August to appeal a Superior Court judge's ruling 
that Calabasas was legally bound to allow the widening of Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard to make way for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Trigg said that Ahmanson wants to try to resolve the various lawsuits -- which 
have been condensed into one -- before moving forward with the project. FRANK

MAN SHOT TO DEATH AFTER CONFRONTATION IN PARK; CRIME: POLICE CONTINUE TO SEARCH 
FOR GUNMAN, WHO ALLEGEDLY THREATENED ADULTS AND CHILDREN IN A PUBLIC RESTROOM 
AT VAN NUYS-SHERMAN OAKS PARK. 
</P>

<P>
 Police continued to search Monday for a killer who shot one man to death and 
wounded another after a confrontation that began in a public restroom at Van 
Nuys-Sherman Oaks Park and continued at a bus stop several blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben Ortiz, 36, of Van Nuys died at the scene after being hit several times 
in the face and chest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Reyes, 37, wounded twice, was hospitalized and released, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing I want to do more than catch the guy who did this," said 
Albert Ortiz, Reuben's brother and a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy. "My 
brother was not a violent person. The whole thing just baffles me." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great kid," said Ortiz's mother, Gloria Romero. "Everybody always 
said he was the best friend anyone could have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble started Sunday at about 4:30 p.m., when several children, 
accompanied by at least two adults, walked from the softball diamond where 
Ortiz and Reyes played on a softball team to the park's restroom, said 
Detective Stephen Fisk. 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's room, the group found one of the stalls locked, so they knocked 
on the door, the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man whom witnesses described as "dirty, possibly homeless" was inside the 
stall, apparently washing up, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was angry because they were knocking on the door," Fisk said. "He told 
them, 'I'll kill you, I'll kill your family, I'll kill your children.' Then he 
walked away." 
</P>
<P>
 When the family members came back to the softball field to tell their friends 
about the incident, four men -- including Ortiz and Reyes -- hopped in a car to 
look for the man, police said. They took a baseball bat with them. 
</P>
<P>
 After searching Van Nuys Boulevard, the four men spotted the man sitting on a 
bus bench at Van Nuys Boulevard and Riverside Drive, about two blocks south of 
the park, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, when Ortiz got out of the car carrying the bat and 
approached the man, the latter drew a pistol and opened fire, striking Ortiz 
several times in the upper torso, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two shots missed Ortiz and hit Reyes, who was in the back seat of the car, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then another man got out of the car, police said, and -- with the bat -- 
chased the gunman down a path and into the Los Angeles River channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman fired at least two more shots while being chased but did not hit 
anyone, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Ortiz said the Ortiz family is in turmoil because of conflicting 
stories from police, witnesses and friends who were with Reuben Ortiz just 
before he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Reuben Ortiz who were playing softball with him Sunday told his 
family that the men went looking for the homeless man only to detain him until 
police came, said Albert Ortiz. "They were only planning to talk to him because 
they knew he was armed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most weeknights, Reuben Ortiz could be found playing softball at various parks 
in the San Fernando Valley. He would go from his job as a delivery driver for 
Crane Hydro-Aire in Burbank to the park to play softball four times a week, his 
brother said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, residents living near the park have complained that a temporary 
probation office in the neighborhood would attract criminals. But Fisk said 
police have no reason to believe the gunman had any ties to the office. He said 
police also do not believe the gunman visited the park regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services have not yet been scheduled, Albert Ortiz said.

TRIAL DATE IN HUBER KILLING SET FOR OCTOBER NEXT YEAR; COURTS: ATTORNEYS FOR 
HANDYMAN SUSPECTED OF MURDERING THE FORMER NORTHRIDGE WOMAN WILL HAVE TIME TO 
PREPARE FOR POSSIBLE DEATH-PENALTY CASE. 
</P>

 It probably will be a year -- if not longer -- before a handyman goes on trial 
on charges of sexually assaulting and murdering a former Northridge woman and 
keeping her nude body in a freezer for more than three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary has set an Oct. 2, 
1995, trial date for John J. Famalaro to give attorneys sufficient time to 
prepare for what may be a death penalty case. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, 37, is accused of kidnaping, sexually assaulting and bludgeoning 
Denise Huber, 23, of Newport Beach after her car broke down on an Orange County 
freeway in June, 1991. Famalaro, a former Orange County resident, was arrested 
in July after authorities found Huber's body in a freezer in a stolen rental 
truck parked in his driveway in Prescott, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys say they need the time -- and may even ask for more -- to 
examine thousands of documents and other items seized from Famalaro's cluttered 
home. Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia said he also anticipates tracking 
down 400 to 500 people who may have known Famalaro in the past to begin 
building a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big job," Gumlia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also adding to the need for more preparation time, Gumlia said, is that 
complex DNA evidence will likely become an issue in the case because 
authorities say Huber was sexually assaulted, based on the discovery of semen 
in her frozen body. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Dennis Bauer, a DNA expert at the Orange County district 
attorney's office, is joining Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans in 
prosecuting the case.

MAN HELD IN DEATH OF TRAVEL AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 30-year-old Glendale man has been arrested in connection with the slaying of 
a travel agent found shot to death in her office last week, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Garen Zakarian was arrested about 6 p.m. Friday at his home in the 400 block 
of West Wilson Avenue and charged with the murder of Benita Mikailian, said 
police spokesman Chahe Keuroghelian.Police do not have a motive for the 
slaying, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keuroghelian did not disclose why officers suspect Zakarian, but said police 
may hold a news conference today to discuss the case in more detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikailian, 40, owned Benita's Travel Town, a travel agency in a small, 
two-story office building at 1110 N. Brand Blvd.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said last week they believed she was killed sometime after 8 p.m. 
Wednesday. Her body was discovered at about 8:30 a.m. the next day by an 
employee arriving at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquaintances said Mikailian had a successful business and lived alone at the 
exclusive Park Towers condominiums on Pioneer Drive, just blocks from her 
office.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; REAL ESTATE BROKERS ARE PUTTING STRESSFUL TIMES BEHIND THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Is it safe? Is it safe? 
</P>
<P>
 These days in the San Fernando Valley, the question takes on more significance 
than as a line from the 1970s film "Marathon Man." The earthquake may be 
history, but the Valley's real estate market continues its wobble. 
</P>
<P>
 As sellers struggle to secure insurance funds to repair damages and place 
their homes on the market, wary buyers are looking more closely at just what 
they might be getting for their money: Are homes here really safe? What damages 
might lie hidden within? 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a still-shaky market that lags behind the rest of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtor Fred Sands, who has 37 offices regionwide, seven of them in the 
Valley, talked about the quake devastation and what it will take for the Valley 
to rebuild its real estate market, brick by brick. 
</P>
<P>
 Sands, with nearly 30 years in the business, admits that he is an optimist. 
Fred Sands Realty, he says, has sold 3,000 homes this year, up 25% from last 
year -- quake or no quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for many homeowners here, that optimism is being put to the supreme 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's been the reality of being a San Fernando Valley real estate 
broker since January's earthquake? Has it been tough times here?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Not exactly tough times. I'd say stressful times. What happened after 
the earthquake is that a lot of our agents dropped out of selling real estate 
to get involved in repairing their own homes and putting their lives together. 
If your agents are not working, sales are not happening. We had one manager who 
ultimately left the state because she developed an earthquake phobia. During 
one meeting somebody dropped something outside and she dove under the table. 
She thought it was another earthquake. We had another manager who stood up in 
the office and said, "Don't sell condominiums. They're not safe." He also 
ultimately left the area. So, we lost two managers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you sell real estate in the Valley with a straight face these days?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. I feel totally comfortable selling real estate in the Valley. I 
think there are wonderful opportunities and good values in the Valley. I think 
the earthquake is behind us. And if one lives in Southern California, one knows 
that the possibility of an earthquake exists. We like to think that the Big One 
is behind us and that perhaps the Valley is the safest place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A recent report concluded that the economic recovery in the Valley was 
moving along faster than expected and that the area was going to pull out of 
its doldrums just fine. Does the same go for its real estate market?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Considering the earthquake, the market here is coming along just fine. It 
would probably be a little stronger, of course, if not for the quake. There are 
a lot of foreclosed properties on the market now. There'll be more coming as 
the moratoriums go off. After the quake, some lenders told people not to make 
their payments for a while. So some people who now have to make payments on 
these houses that were badly damaged and where they have no equity will be 
walking away from the properties. So there will be that kind of property on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 But at sales meetings, my people have been complaining of a lack of inventory, 
that they have buyers out there and there aren't enough homes to sell. Now, 
that's not to say that someone could put their home on the market and overprice 
it. The buyers today are very, very price conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, the market here is still depressed?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's only depressed as to prices. It's not depressed as to sales activity. 
I you look at statistics from the San Fernando Valley and the L.A. Board of 
Realtors, sales are at a high. Sales activity is good. For our company in the 
San Fernando Valley -- and we certainly represent a big part of the Valley -- 
we're running about 25% ahead of last year. Prices are just not where they 
should be. If somebody puts their house on the market and prices it right, it 
sells relatively easily. If they put it on overpriced, it just sits there. In 
the '80s, people would pay anything. In the '90s, they want to know they're 
getting a good buy. If not a bargain, at least a good buy. Look at what's 
happened in Malibu: fires, floods. The people just rebuilt because they love 
Malibu. The Valley is the same way. The people are very resilient. They go on 
with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Nonetheless, The Valley still lags behind the rest of Southern California's 
real estate market. How long will it take the area to catch up?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We're somewhat behind the rest of Southern California. Amazingly enough, 
not as far behind as one would think. One reason is that some people are having 
a hard time getting their money from insurance companies to reconstruct their 
houses and, in some cases, putting those houses on the market after they've 
done it. We're probably 10% behind the rest of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, what does that mean, that 10% fewer homes are being sold or that 
sellers are getting 10% less for their properties here?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think, both. Sales are down. And people are getting a bit less money for 
the homes that do sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How long did it take real estate to bounce back in other quake-stricken 
areas such as San Francisco, Whittier or Upland, and what can the Valley learn 
from those places?  
</P>
<P>
 A: As soon as the earthquake occurred, I talked to people in our company who 
had been through the Sylmar quake, and I said "What happened? How was it? How 
many years did it take to recover?" And I was shocked at the answers I got. 
They said that as soon as the quake was over people went out and got their FEMA 
loans, started to reconstruct. Once that was under way there was a lot of 
activity in the construction industry, and then the market gradually returned 
to normal. It's not what I would have expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Bay Area companies say it was terrible at first but that it was a short-term 
blip. I'll tell you something. After a natural disaster, the market recovers 
very quickly. But something like the riots were much more difficult. People 
didn't know how to address that civil unrest. There was more of an unease, and 
the market took longer to recover than from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Just what is the Valley's real estate image in Southern California?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The image is that there was a terrible earthquake, that the people are 
rebuilding, have rebuilt and that it's all coming back. We don't see fear of 
ghost towns or empty stores. In fact, there was tremendous commercial leasing 
activity because so many people were displaced from damaged buildings. For 
instance, we lost our Sherman Oaks East office to the earthquake. We found a 
location down the street that had been vacant a year and a half, a former bank 
building. Lo and behold, there were two offers -- one from us and one from 
another tenant who wanted it. So here's a place vacant for a long time, and 
we're suddenly in a bidding war with another company to get the space. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you say to people whose knees are still knocking when it comes to 
buying a piece of San Fernando Valley real estate?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Maybe you shouldn't be living in Southern California. We have earthquakes 
here. But look what happened in Florida. It was just a different kind of 
natural disaster. Wherever you live, there's going to be some type of fear. You 
can go to North Dakota and freeze your tail off. Southern California just has 
so many positive things going for it that they outweigh the negative things 
twentyfold. That's what I tell them.

TOPPLED VEHICLE IGNITES BRUSH FIRE

<P>
 An off-road vehicle overturned and burst into flames Monday on a hillside 
above the Simi Valley Freeway, igniting one of two small brush fires in the 
northern part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver was not injured in the 4:50 p.m. accident near the De Soto Avenue 
exit from the freeway, said Brian Humphrey of the Los Angeles Fire Department, 
but rush-hour traffic was congested for a few hours afterward by motorists 
slowing to get a better view of the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 Two water-dropping helicopters and 50 firefighters on the ground put the fire 
out in about half an hour, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other blaze burned for about an hour in a dry, grassy area near Sand 
Canyon and Soledad Canyon in Santa Clarita. It was extinguished at 5:30 p.m. by 
100 firefighters, according to Inspector Emil Moldovan of the Los Angeles 
County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 No homes or businesses were threatened by either fire, authorities said.

STUNTMAN INJURED IN STUDIOS SHOW

<P>
 A stuntman in the "Miami Vice" show at Universal Studios fell off a jet ski 
during rehearsal Monday and suffered minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The performer, Joe Box, 25, was treated and released from St. Joseph Medical 
Center in Burbank, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, based on the once-popular television series about vice detectives in 
Miami, opened in 1987 and features a speedboat ride through a simulated lagoon, 
among other fast-paced stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts of what led up to the accident differed. Universal spokesman Michael 
Gray said the stuntman simply fell off his ski. But paramedics said they 
responded to a report that Box was hit by another jet skier, the Los Angeles 
County Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very, very minor accident," Gray said. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WORKER IMPALES ARM ON FENCE

<P>
 A 38-year-old worker on an earthquake-repair project fell two stories from a 
scaffold Monday, impaling his upper arm on a wrought-iron fence. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken with part of the fence still transfixing his arm to Northridge 
Hospital Medical Center, where he was listed in serious but stable condition 
after undergoing surgery to remove it, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The worker, whom authorities declined to identify, was working on a house in 
an exclusive gated community in the 4600 block of Westchester Drive about 3 
p.m. when he fell onto a pointed security fence, said Brian Humphrey, a Los 
Angeles city Fire Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paramedics held him steady as they cut him off the fence with the Jaws of 
Life," said Humphrey, referring to a device often used to remove accident 
victims from crushed automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have caused further injury if they pulled it out, so they wrapped it 
in place and transported him to the hospital." JEANNETTE REGALADO

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HIKERS FIND LIVE GRENADE IN DESERT; DANGER: 
BOMB SQUAD SAFELY DETONATES THE MILITARY DEVICE, THE LATEST DISCOVERY OF 
EXPLOSIVES IN THE AREA.

 Two hikers in a desert area south of Palmdale spotted a live military hand 
grenade Monday morning, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's bomb squad members, summoned to the location, detonated the device 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
 The hikers, whose names were not released, discovered the grenade about 8:15 
a.m. near Barrel Springs Road, not far from the California Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The hikers contacted the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station, Deputy Benita 
Hinojos said. The explosives experts determined it was a "live anti-personnel 
military hand grenade," Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities could not determine where the grenade had come from. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared to have been there for some time, as evidenced by rust and ground 
erosion around it," said Lt. Joe Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb squad decided it was best to explode the device where it rested 
rather than attempt to move it, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrel Springs Road was closed briefly to traffic while bomb squad members 
attached a charge and detonated the grenade from a safe distance, deputies 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been numerous occasions of live explosives being left in remote 
areas of this desert region. On May 20, a women looking for bottles and other 
collectibles along a desert road near Littlerock set off an explosive device. 
Lynn Standish, 33, of Pearblossom, was killed in that incident, and her son, 
Michael Wayne Hepburn, 4, suffered a serious leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators have obtained a warrant for the arrest of Scott 
Douglas Hamby, 32, in connection with Standish's death, but the suspect remains 
at large, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Standish's mother, Virginia Holmes, said Monday that Michael has fully 
recovered from his leg injury.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 3-YEAR PLANNERS CALL FOR CITY TO EXPAND 
BOUNDARIES; GOVERNMENT: BRAINSTORMING RESIDENTS AND COMMUNITY LEADERS ALSO 
ADVISE TAKING CONTROL OF ECOLOGICAL AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City leaders should quintuple Santa Clarita's size and take control of 
ecological areas now under county protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least they can cut back on efforts to get a Nordstrom store. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the consensus reached by about 100 residents, business leaders, 
school officials and city personnel during an eight-hour brainstorming session 
on Saturday to formulate a new, three-year Community Strategic Plan for Santa 
Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the top issues identified by participants -- new roads, more youth 
programs, defeating a proposed landfill, reducing gangs, greater economic 
development -- are already being addressed by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say, as an organization, we are fairly in tune with our 
constituency," said City Manager George Caravalho. 
</P>
<P>
 The most ambitious suggestion on the list was to expand city boundaries from 
43 square miles to the entire 200-square-mile Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 If accomplished, it would be about the same size geographically as the state's 
third-largest city, sparsely populated California City in Kern County. This new 
Santa Clarita would, for example, encompass twice as much land as Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Cameron, a resident who suggested the larger boundary, said institutions 
ranging from school districts to the phone company already address the Santa 
Clarita Valley as a single entity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial proposal for the city was 200 square miles," said Cameron, who 
was involved in the cityhood drive that resulted in Santa Clarita's formation 
seven years ago. "It was only after the nasty, vile Los Angeles County 
governing process that we got this peculiar little aberration of 39 square 
miles." Santa Clarita covered about 39 square miles when it became a city. 
</P>
<P>
 Also thinking big, participants Saturday called for taking over areas 
identified by Los Angeles County as significant ecological areas that deserve 
special protection. Those areas include the Santa Clara River, San Francisquito 
Canyon, an oak savanna west of the Golden State Freeway and a woodland habitat 
also west of the highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Less traditional ideas such as creating a Santa Clarita float for the annual 
Rose Parade in Pasadena, building a small airport, launching an additional 
local newspaper and renovating an elementary school auditorium for use as a 
community theater earned little support among the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, when residents first met to formulate a plan, city officials 
were surprised by the clamor for a Nordstrom store. The department store chain 
has not yet opened a local branch, and some residents mentioned that they 
wanted it in the new plan. But this time the idea did not generate enough 
support to make the cut.

<P>
 Other items in the 1991 plan that have not yet been obtained for the area are 
a state university and a conference center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strength of this program is getting people here to participate," said 
Councilman H. Clyde Smyth. "Long-range, as the city does things, you've got a 
nucleus of people who were here and part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members are scheduled to review a final draft of the strategic plan in 
November.

SAVE THE RAMS STILL AWAITING A 'WISH LIST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sports agent Leigh Steinberg, one of the leaders of Save the Rams, was 
frustrated Monday after a meeting with Ram officials didn't produce the serious 
response the group is seeking for its proposal to keep the team in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy meeting with Ram President John Shaw, Steinberg said the 
Orange County group did not receive a "wish list" from the Rams, similar to the 
one the team had sent to St. Louis officials who are trying to bring an NFL 
team there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That aspect was pretty frustrating and that was a point we made today," 
Steinberg said. "It was difficult to continue constructing offers unless we 
understood what it ultimately takes to keep the Rams here." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Wedin, chairman of the Orange County Economic Development Consortium and 
a member of Save the Rams, also attended the meeting. He also believes it's 
imperative the Orange County group and the Rams are on the same page. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a request for clarification and elaboration from both parties and a 
willingness by both parties to respond to that," Wedin said. "John (Shaw) 
wanted to make sure that he thoroughly understands our proposal and we want to 
make sure that we understand thoroughly the areas of interest to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at numbers, it could mean one thing to me and something else to 
you. It's not that either of us are mean-spirited, it's just that people look 
at numbers differently. And it's to both parties' advantage to make sure there 
is total understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides proposing $60 million to $70 million in renovations to Anaheim 
Stadium, the Orange County group will guarantee sales of 45,000 season tickets 
and 138 luxury boxes in the stadium if the team agrees to a new lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the economic proposals by Save the Rams enough to keep the team? 
</P>
<P>
 "We continue to ask what it takes," Steinberg said, "but we've got no 
response." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wedin: "I feel positive. That does not imply that John has made a 
commitment, because he hasn't. But the tone of the meeting was very 
constructive." 
</P>
<P>
 The Save the Rams proposal isn't expected to be able to compete with offers 
from St. Louis or the other cities trying to get the Rams, Baltimore and 
Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw is expected to meet on Wednesday with members of FANS Inc., the group 
trying to get the team to St. Louis. The St. Louis group is expected to make a 
formal proposal, including commitments from groups interested in 86 of the 100 
luxury boxes at the city's domed stadium currently under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Oriole majority owner Peter Angelos, who has met with Shaw regarding 
the city's interest in the Rams, said last week he is looking for a "yes or no" 
answer from the team very soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County has stepped forward and made a very attractive offer," 
Steinberg said. "I also made the point (in the meeting) that it's not in the 
best interest of the NFL or the current Rams management . . . that when 
franchises move from place to place that it destroys the fan base. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we made the point that we don't expect to be on a level playing field in 
terms of other cities' offers. But the Rams have been here for 50 years, and 
that ought to count for something." 
</P>
<P>
 But can the Save the Rams' offer compete with the other cities from a 
financial standpoint? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bidding against ourselves," Steinberg said. "We truly don't know what 
the offers are from Baltimore, St. Louis or Hartford. We have our suspicions 
and ideas, but I'm not positive what they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore and St. Louis are entering the serious stages of discussions, and 
would like to know of the Rams' intentions by Nov. 1, when owners discuss 
realigning divisions at the league meetings in Chicago. But after Monday's 
meeting, Steinberg said the Rams "convinced me they're moving in a slow, 
deliberate process." 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously there are outside pressures," Steinberg said. "But they appear to 
be moving slowly, and from our standpoint, that's good. The more time goes on, 
the more support solidifies here and we can flush out more aspects of our 
plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's proposed stadium for the Rams 
and Raiders also was discussed with Shaw. Steinberg said Save the Rams will 
seek the help of the commissioner's office to keep the team in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said he plans to meet with Shaw again within a week, and has again 
requested a meeting with Ram owner Georgia Frontiere.

DUCKS; A TIME FOR TRUCE -- AND GOLF; HOCKEY: DUCK PLAYERS AND MANAGEMENT COME 
TOGETHER ON THE FAIRWAYS IN THE NAME OF CHARITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was a gorgeous day at Tustin Ranch Golf Club -- and an odd one in the 
history of labor relations. 
</P>
<P>
 With NHL owners and players in a dispute that has put the season on hold, 
Mighty Duck players and management laid down their arms Monday and picked up 
their putters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-one NHL games have been postponed since Commissioner Gary Bettman 
delayed the start of the season until at least Saturday, and Duck players will 
miss their first paychecks on Thursday. But they joined front-office types on 
the fairways for a charity tournament anyway -- a testament to their support 
for the Disney youth hockey program the tournament benefits . . . and their 
fondness for a free round of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "This event has been planned for quite a long time," team captain Randy 
Ladoucuer said. "We're not in such a bad relationship with our team that we're 
going to cancel something like this and hurt a charity organization like Disney 
GOALS. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell the truth, we have a pretty good relationship with our management. I 
still have only good things to say about Jack Ferreira and Ron Wilson and Tony 
Tavares and the entire organization. . . . It's unfortunate a situation like 
this is happening, but I don't hold anything personal against those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Players milled about wearing caps or shirts with the NHL Players Assn. logo, 
only to face a counterattack from Ferreira, the team's general manager who dug 
out a black cap with a bold orange NHL logo. Then he posed for a 
my-hat-versus-your-hat photo with defenseman David Williams -- sticking up two 
fingers behind Williams' head like rabbit ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no animosity between our players and ourselves," Ferreira said. "I 
respect their position and I think they respect ours." 
</P>
<P>
 Team President Tavares -- an outspoken critic of union leadership last week -- 
sat at the registration table chatting with Bob Corkum, the players' 
representative to the union and an outspoken critic of Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little odd," goaltender Guy Hebert said as he signed up. "But the 
problem isn't between Tony Tavares and myself. He's a businessman. He's doing 
the best he can to stick together with his side and we're sticking with ours. 
Here in Anaheim there's no personal animosity." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Wilson enjoyed his first workout with his players in 11 days, but the 
only hockey sticks around were used in a gag putting contest, and the toughest 
competition was in a long-driving contest. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the odder sights on an odd day was the presence of Terry Yake, who was 
traded to Toronto on Sept. 28 -- two days before the season was put on hold. 
The Maple Leafs told him it was up to him whether he reported at once, and Yake 
and his wife, Tanya, decided to stay in Anaheim and pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ducks told me when I got traded they'd be short of guys and I could come 
on out if I wanted to," Yake said. "It's for a charity, and these are still all 
my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yakes plan to go home to Manitoba, Canada, if nothing breaks soon, 
reasoning it makes no sense to rent a home in Toronto if Terry isn't playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely weird," Yake said. "If anything, it's going to make the 
transition easier. This way I can get things in order before I start over with 
a new team." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 11 a.m. shotgun start, Tavares and Ferreira were on their way to 
catch a plane for New York, where the Board of Governors will meet today to 
decide whether the season will start Saturday or be postponed further. Ferreira 
was guarded, saying he didn't know what the players' latest proposal was and 
wouldn't speculate. Forward Stu Grimson, the assistant player representative, 
didn't know the details either, but what he knew didn't give him much hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so far apart coming into this, and I don't think at this stage 
anybody's willing to concede that much," he said. "We're prepared to hold out 
indefinitely, whatever that may be. Guys have resolved themselves to a long 
fight. But it's impossible to speculate on how it's going to play out." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he said, players have been diligent about staying in shape -- between 
rounds of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like the more pessimistic we get and the bleaker it seems, guys are 
going to be less motivated to work out. Both sides have to be very professional 
about this. We need to be sure we're in decent shape to be ready to play. There 
isn't a great deal of optimism today, but that could change in a week. It could 
change in a couple of days." Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials said the golf tournament raised about $38,800 for Disney GOALS, 
a hockey and academic program for underprivileged youth. . . . Players who did 
not participate were forwards Paul Kariya, Tim Sweeney and Patrik Carnback and 
defensemen Don McSween and Myles O'Connor, who have returned home, and forward 
Jim Thomson, who is rehabilitating after shoulder surgery.

NCAA RULES TITANS' WAGNER INELIGIBLE; HE QUITS TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NCAA has declared Cal State Fullerton pitcher Matt Wagner ineligible for 
the upcoming season because of a violation of NCAA rules and Wagner has left 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Coach Augie Garrido Monday confirmed Wagner's ineligibility, but would 
not comment on the reason. Other university officials also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, reached by telephone, also declined to discuss specifics, saying: "I'd 
rather just keep it to myself. It's a rules violation, and that's where I want 
to leave it right now. I just wish I could be out there pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, Big West pitcher of the year last season as a sophomore, said he plans 
to remain at the university this year, and see what develops in the June pro 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could have been reinstated after one year, but he chose not to participate 
on those terms," Garrido said. "There will be some interest in him by 
professional teams, and he has interest in that as well. I expect that will be 
what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Under NCAA rules, Wagner could have practiced with the team this season had he 
chosen to do so, Garrido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner was a key figure for the Titan team that was 47-16, shared the Big West 
championship, won the NCAA Regional at Oklahoma State and advanced to the 
College World Series in Omaha. The Titans were eliminated by Georgia Tech in 
the semifinal round. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, a 6-foot-5 right-hander from Plano, Tex., had a 12-1 record during the 
regular season, the third-best won-loss mark in the nation, and his 2.15 
earned-run average ranked 30th among college pitchers. He held opponents to a 
.212 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner didn't fare as well in postseason play, however. Wagner started two 
games and appeared in four, with no decisions. His ERA soared to 7.45 for the 
postseason. He pitched only four innings in Omaha, starting one game, and gave 
up five runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner's loss will leave the Titans without four starting pitchers from last 
year's team. Dan Ricabal (12-1), Mike Parisi (11-4) and Chad Rolish (7-4) 
signed pro baseball contracts and played in the minor leagues this past summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner transferred to Fullerton after pitching for Abilene Christian as a 
freshman. He started the 1994 season in the bullpen, but moved into the 
starting rotation after a series of strong performances in long relief early in 
the season.

FINDING AN INTIMACY AMONG STRANGERS

 Long live the bicycle! It is a friend to man, like the horse. -- Henry Miller 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Had I been more courageous or foolhardy, I might have proceeded on. But the 
rain and lightning spooked me, and I pulled off Route 412 to wait out the storm 
and recharge my spirits before heading into the desolate Oklahoma Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I declare, you look a mess," the motel clerk said as I wheeled my bicycle 
into the lobby. I explained that I had fixed a flat tire a few miles back and 
couldn't avoid getting lathered up with the chain's grease. "Soap'll fix you," 
she observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since leaving Pawnee at dawn -- where a kindly merchant the previous night had 
found me a room of sorts in an abandoned five-unit motel -- I had covered 72 
miles, and Enid's grain silos looming on the horizon were a welcome sight. 
Enid, 1,575 miles from my home in Virginia, took me into the second half of my 
journey to California, and from my saddlebags I withdrew a new, untattered map, 
marked "The Western United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The America I glide through at 10 m.p.h. is an America I had forgotten 
existed. It is a place where kids wear caps with the visor facing forward and 
John Deere is a more popular logo than the Chicago Bulls. Keys are left in the 
ignition of parked pickups, the little churches that seem to stand guard over 
every crossroad are full on Sundays, and the end of harvest is celebrated with 
a potluck picnic at the community park. 
</P>
<P>
 In towns such as Skiatook, Okla., and Mountain View, Ark., and a score of 
places in between, the talk these days is not of Haiti or the November 
elections. It's of weather and corn and high school football teams and all the 
things that are small and personal. In a cafe in Pryor, Okla., I asked the 
meaning of the words written on a plastic jug: "Donations for the Alton O'Bar 
Family." The waitress replied, as though no further explanation were necessary, 
"Verna died. Didn't you hear?" 
</P>
<P>
 The intimacy with the people and the land that I have shared over the past 
weeks I attribute not to any great wisdom or sensitivity on my part, but merely 
to the fact that I am on a bicycle. There is time to think and listen. It is an 
entirely different way to travel, as part of, rather than isolated from, one's 
surroundings. It restores what the interstates have taken from us -- the 
serendipity of the open road. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose many true cyclists would scoff at the 53 miles a day or so I cover 
as rather wimpish. Indeed, that's the precise distance the stagecoach used to 
log daily on the 1,200-mile run from New York City to Savannah, Ga., way back 
in 1802. But I find it remarkable that my 54-year-old, out-of-shape body 
accepts such demands, and my friends agree. When I called one the other night 
to report that I had made it to Oklahoma, he said: "Amazing! I want licensing 
rights on your body. We're going to sell it to the Smithsonian." 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't mention to him, though, that way back in Virginia, during the first 
week of the crossing, I spent several days scheming to abort my harebrained 
adventure. My right knee had given out. My butt hurt. I was lonely. The endless 
miles seemed tedious and boring. Only the humiliation of limping home on the 
Greyhound and having to admit failure kept me pedaling toward the next town and 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 So now the Appalachians, the Smokies and the Ozarks are behind me. Ahead lies 
the Oklahoma Panhandle -- which on the maps of the 1870s was identified as "No 
Man's Land" -- and the Rockies and, one day, the Pacific. It's difficult to 
imagine a time when I didn't sleep with my bike next to the bed and start every 
day by heading down an unknown road. 
</P>
<P>
 The other night, in a speck of a sleeping Oklahoma town, sitting alone on a 
grassy stretch along Highway 64, I called my wife on the cellular phone I 
carry. Much to my amazement the call bounced off some faraway satellite and 
found its way, crystal clear, into my kitchen. Sandy greeted me, then asked 
what I have been asking myself often these past weeks: "Where are you?" Off and 
Pedaling

PROFILES; ISRAEL'S DUELING DUO PREPARE TO PUT THEIR TRUCE TO TEST; RABIN AND 
PERES ARE VYING FOR THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE AND SQUABBLING OVER WHO GETS CREDIT 
FOR PEACE TALKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, almost 50, they had fought, usually without mercy and often with 
soul-destroying bitterness. 
</P>
<P>
 Their peacemaking had been a pragmatic truce, a decision to halt a blood feud 
that neither could win, a decision to cooperate for shared goals. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the life-or-death struggle between Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, but rather that between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin and Shimon Peres, his foreign minister and longtime rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reconciliation after decades of knife-in-the-back politics astounded 
Israelis -- and made possible Israel's success in negotiations with the 
Palestinians, with Jordan and, as seems likely, soon with Syria and Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle that this combination exists," commented Matti Golan, an 
Israeli journalist who chronicled the Rabin-Peres conflict through the 1970s 
and 1980s, during the latest flare-up between the two. "But there is no doubt 
that without Rabin (the peace initiatives) couldn't be, and there is no doubt 
that without Peres it would be impossible too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peres does the visionary work, and the dirty work, and Rabin gives the 
political backing and takes the hard decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Rabin-Peres partnership remains fragile and tenuous, threatened by the 
egos of two men who want not only to bring peace to Israel and ensure its 
security but who want the credit for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow, they came to realize that they cannot make it separately, and each 
of them hates that he cannot do it separately, that he needs the other," said 
Nahum Barnea, the respected political commentator of Yediot Aharanot, Israel's 
biggest newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, they behaved as if they could tolerate each other, but no one 
believed it. Now, they hate each other quite openly, but insist that it doesn't 
interfere with what they have to do -- and mostly they are right." 
</P>
<P>
 During the secret negotiations with the PLO in Oslo last year, Peres would 
come to Rabin in his Jerusalem office, and the two men would sit together -- 
Rabin with a whiskey and soda, Peres with a cup of tea or a glass of Cognac -- 
and weigh their options. 
</P>
<P>
 "That Peres carried out those negotiations alone is complete nonsense," said a 
senior government official, who observed those late-night meetings. "Every move 
was plotted with Rabin's participation, and every clause in that agreement was 
negotiated, down to the punctuation, with his initials on the faxes back and 
forth. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "In all the peace initiatives so far, Peres has used his skills to open doors, 
but Rabin has had to decide whether to walk through -- or not." 
</P>
<P>
 A pro-Rabin minister recounts how Rabin and Peres usually meet privately 
before the regular Sunday Cabinet session, and that even then the full meeting 
is often largely a dialogue between Rabin and Peres. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rest of us feel like children at the dinner table -- allowed to venture 
an opinion every so often but expected to listen respectfully while our elders 
discuss things," the minister said. "And they speak in a language -- mutual 
experiences, a depth of understanding, a personal involvement in half a century 
of history -- that the rest of us don't have." 
</P>
<P>
 There are renewed fears, however, that this 2-year-old partnership could break 
down in the midst of crucial negotiations with the Palestinians or Syria, 
leading to their collapse, or that Rabin and Peres, one or the other hoping to 
outmaneuver his old rival, might revert to cutthroat politics. 
</P>
<P>
 After a return last summer to open conflict, political analyst Zeev Chafets 
warned: "From now on, their positions on sensitive issues -- Palestinian 
autonomy, concessions to Syria and especially the future of Jerusalem -- will 
be influenced, perhaps decisively, by two raw, decades-old questions: How does 
this help me? And how does it hurt him?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chafets, writing in the magazine Jerusalem Report, declared what many in the 
ruling Labor Party will say off the record and over lunch but dare not repeat 
publicly: "The two men are openly enemies again, old antagonists gearing up for 
one last bloody battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Substantial differences between Rabin and Peres, matters of principle rather 
than personality, do exist on how quickly to broaden Palestinian 
self-government. Peres wants to press ahead, hard and fast, holding elections 
and turning over administration of the West Bank to the PLO as soon as 
possible. Rabin, worried about the safety of Jewish settlers in the region, 
wants to defer elections until security measures are agreed upon and 
implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Negotiations are difficult because Rabin assumes control but, when things get 
stuck, asks Peres to solve it," a Palestinian minister said. "Then we deal with 
Peres, only to have Rabin and his generals raise objections. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "They complain about our muddled decision-making with some justice, but we see 
a similar problem on their side. They don't want to be caught up in our 
politics, but we don't want to be caught up in theirs as things get ugly." 
</P>
<P>
 Further signs of the renewed Rabin-Peres rivalry are surfacing in advance of 
the decision, to be announced in Oslo Friday, on the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize. 
Both men want it badly, preferably without the other, and both are lobbying 
hard for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, according to Western diplomats, has written scores of old friends 
around the world, especially in Europe, soliciting their support. Rabin called 
upon his old tutor in diplomacy, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, 
himself a Nobel laureate, and received a strong endorsement; his aides have 
been canvassing for further backing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In isolation, the Nobel committee would probably give the prize to Rabin and 
Arafat or to Peres and Arafat," a European ambassador commented. "In reality, 
however, Rabin has to be honored for his political courage, Peres for brilliant 
diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "But two Israelis and one Palestinian seems unbalanced, so the quandary is 
whether to bring in another Palestinian and make it an awkward foursome, or go 
back to one and one, and then the question will be which Israeli. The committee 
is very, very aware of the danger of breaking up the Rabin-Peres team by 
choosing one over the other." 
</P>
<P>
 The two men have clashed bitterly and publicly in recent weeks over who should 
receive credit for the breakthroughs in negotiations with the PLO and then with 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rabin -- at the request of President Clinton -- decided in September, 
1993, to head the Israeli delegation for the signing of the accord on 
Palestinian self-rule, he preempted what Peres believed was rightfully his 
moment of glory, according to political insiders, and the foreign minister 
considered not going to Washington or even resigning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabin is destroying my life," Peres complained to one confidant. "He ruins my 
work, he ruins my life, he tortures me. Why? I don't think it is worth 
continuing." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a secret trip by Rabin from his home in Tel Aviv in a small, 
non-governmental car for a conciliatory discussion with Peres in Jerusalem on 
Saturday afternoon, the Jewish Sabbath, prevented a full-blown crisis that 
could have jeopardized the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first stiff test of the new partnership, and both the prime 
minister and Peres recognized that they had to put aside their feelings if they 
were to continue it," a former Rabin adviser said. "They had settled things 
between them before the (June, 1992) elections and then again when the 
government was formed. . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "They share the view that this is the time for peace, a truly historic moment, 
and they feel that they, particularly with their experiences and perhaps even 
uniquely, are qualified to achieve that goal. Nothing else should matter." 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House ceremony in July to sign the Israeli-Jordanian declaration 
ending the state of war between them was a replay of that confrontation. Rabin, 
insisting that he deserved all credit, initially excluded Peres from the 
Israeli delegation and then ignored him throughout the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabin hates the idea that Peres shares the limelight when he as prime 
minister has to carry the burden of the decisions," a Labor Party insider 
explained. "And Peres leaves Rabin with the feeling that without him as foreign 
minister he would be nothing. They simply hate each other's guts." 
</P>
<P>
 In an aggressive mood in Washington, Rabin had savaged his foreign minister 
during a dinner at the home of Itamar Rabinovich, the Israeli ambassador and a 
Rabin adviser. Despite a long history of secret diplomacy with Jordan, Rabin 
declared that Peres had contributed nothing to the landmark agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, who heard of Rabin's comments, felt so humiliated that, as he boarded 
the plane back to Israel, he told correspondents: "I'm fed up with all this. I 
didn't ask to go to Washington. . . . I didn't push my way into this trip. 
That's what insults me the most. No one got in the way of (Rabin's) being the 
star." 
</P>
<P>
 A Peres resignation would not have put at risk the agreement with Jordan, but 
it would have thrown into question Israel's ability to conclude a comprehensive 
peace with its Arab neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Arabs would have read the worst into a Peres resignation," a Western 
ambassador said, "and Israeli support for the peace process would have been 
split into warring camps." 
</P>
<P>
 To make peace, Rabin and Peres turned to a trusted, if unlikely, mediator -- 
Giora Eini, then head of the legal department of the Histadrut, the Israeli 
trade union federation, a member of the Peres camp within the Labor Party but a 
man who has always kept his lines open to the Rabin faction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eini needed more than 40 hours of almost continuous meetings and telephone 
calls to bring the two leaders together and re-establish cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call in Eini more like a rabbi or a marriage counselor than a 
politician," a Labor Party insider said. "He hears all the complaints, all the 
cursing, all the dirt, and then he suggests a way out, who should do what, who 
should say what. Rabin usually feels remorse, Peres gets a measure of 
satisfaction, a deal is done and that's it -- for a week or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Matti Golan, a Peres biographer, predicted that the latest Rabin-Peres 
reconciliation will not, and cannot, last for long. 
</P>
<P>
 "This won't end -- it simply won't," Golan said of the feud. "It is much more 
than a political issue. It is a psychological matter, and it is very 
complicated. What Peres does to Rabin is very painful, and (Rabin's) responses 
are not under his control." 
</P>
<P>
 A political analyst who sees both men added: "Their feelings are far stronger 
than dislike but a bit short of true hatred. Peres sees Rabin as shallow, 
lacking in character, without vision, not a leader worthy of this country. 
Rabin believes Peres to be disingenuous and devious -- too ready to make 
concessions, too concerned with his image and place in history." 
</P>
<P>
 So deep is Rabin's mistrust of Peres that he has regularly assigned generals 
to Israeli negotiating teams with the PLO with orders to report back to Lt. 
Gen. Ehud Barak, the chief of staff and one of Rabin's most trusted advisers, 
on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the generals think Peres is compromising our position, they call Barak, 
who complains to Rabin, who then pulls off the table what Peres has just put 
on," a former Israeli negotiator said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rivalry goes back at least to the contest to succeed the late Golda Meir 
as prime minister in 1974, when Rabin, her choice, won out. When Rabin was 
forced to resign in a minor scandal three years later, Peres replaced him and 
led the Labor Party for 15 years, losing to Rabin in 1992 party elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men's personal styles accentuate their differences. Rabin is a gruff, 
short-spoken general who prefers military officers as his advisers and who 
works the details of a situation into hard-edged decisions. Peres has an Old 
World courtliness, writes poetry and speaks with a prophetic passion. 
</P>
<P>
 In his analysis of the feud, Chafets went back to conflicts in the early years 
of Israeli statehood when Peres worked for Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion 
running the Defense Ministry, often clashing with Rabin and trying to block his 
promotion to chief of staff. They remained on opposite sides in Labor Party 
battles through the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Labor Party, out of power since 1977 except for national unity 
governments, replaced Peres with Rabin as its leader in 1992, judging him to be 
more electable, Peres faced a choice of subordinating himself or retiring. He 
chose to remain in active politics, pledging Rabin his loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from forgiving, Rabin turned his victory speech after Labor won the 
parliamentary elections into a manifesto declaring that he, Yitzhak Rabin, 
would govern -- apparently alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabin was nervous, and he feared that his premiership would become a facade 
for party control of the government and Peres control of the party," Barnea 
said. "More than anyone else, Rabin respects Peres' political cunning and skill 
because he has been the victim so often in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 In the deal that they struck, Rabin would handle the bilateral peace 
negotiations with the Arabs, and Peres would pursue broader negotiations. In 
practice, Peres became deeply involved with the Palestinians and then the 
Jordanians and is now bidding for a role in the talks with Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabin will try very hard to keep Syria to himself," Barnea predicted. "He 
will cast the questions in terms of security, which is his specialty, and 
(Syrian President) Hafez Assad will see him as the interlocutor. But, once he 
gets into it, he will probably find that Peres has already been there, and he 
will make use of him. To their mutual discomfort, that seems to be a real 
element of their relationship." Biography

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sri Lanka's government and Tamil insurgents meet face to face this week for 
the first time in four years to see if they can negotiate an end to the island 
nation's murderous ethnic strife. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 34,000 people have perished in the 11-year-old struggle by armed 
militants from the Hindu Tamil minority to carve out an independent homeland in 
the north and east of the predominantly Buddhist island. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-member delegation from the Socialist-led coalition that came to power 
in August is scheduled to arrive Thursday in Jaffna, a rebel stronghold in the 
north, to prepare for formal talks. Earlier this month, die-hard rebels 
exploded a mine under a merchant vessel. Observers say the hard-liners want to 
prove that negotiations are impossible without a cease-fire. But Prime Minister 
Chandrika Kumaratunga, after discussions with her generals, has refused to 
order one.

THE WEEK AHEAD: BOURNEMOUTH; TIRED TORIES HUDDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Britain's ruling Conservative Party is holding its annual conference in the 
English Channel resort of Bournemouth this week, with the goal of pumping some 
enthusiasm into a tired political organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Glumly, Tories watched last week's upbeat Labor Party conference that 
enthusiastically embraced the party's new leader, Tony Blair, who promised to 
lead the long-out-of-power opposition to victory in the next national election. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister John Major has been doing poorly in public opinion polls and, 
after 15 years in power, the Conservatives seem to lack confidence. No 
elections are scheduled and none is required until the spring of 1997, so the 
Tories can wait for something to tip the scales in their favor again.

 Voters in Botswana, a country with a rare record of political stability in 
Africa, go to the polls Saturday.Analysts say they expect President Quett 
Masire's Botswana Democratic Party will retain office. 
</P>
<P>
 But a drop in diamond revenues, which are the mainstay of the economy, and a 
sharp increase in unemployment have created support for the opposition, the 
Botswana National Front. The Front held only three seats out of 34 in the 
national Parliament that was dissolved last month.

 Iraqi forces massing along the Kuwaiti border. The White House draws a line in 
the sand and orders American planes, ships and troops back to the Persian Gulf.

 The Persian Gulf crisis of 1990-91 was on replay, it seemed to the world's 
editorial cartoonists, who once again picked up their pens to savage Iraqi 
President Saddam Hussein and take a few shots at President Clinton too. 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, Baghdad's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoun declared to a nervous world 
that Hussein's legions were withdrawing northward. Clinton scheduled his news 
conference to brief America. But the Kuwaitis weren't fully buying Monday's 
developments. "This is a cat-and-mouse game, and we can't tolerate it," said 
Kuwaiti Information Minister Saud al Sabah. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it an invasion cut short by quick American response? Was it a show of 
force to intimidate the Big Powers into lifting international sanctions on 
Iraq, a question before the Security Council this week? The reasons were still 
unknown as the cartoonists' ink was drying.

CULTURE; PALESTINIANS STARTING TO UNEARTH THEIR HISTORY; WESTERNERS AND 
ISRAELIS USED TO CONTROL WEST BANK ARCHEOLOGY. NOW, THE PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY 
IS SPONSORING DIGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a scarred hillock of barren soil, shaded by a square of white canvas, a 
group of determined Palestinians has started to reclaim the ancient history of 
their people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamdan Mohammad Taha, the Palestinian Authority's director of archeological 
excavations in the Jericho area, explained the importance of the tiny oblong 
hole he and his assistants have dug under a blazing sun in this desert oasis. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 100 years, archeology was a foreign affair for most 
Palestinians," he said. "It was connected with people who come and dig in 
Palestinian soil, and then remove what they find. We are trying to change the 
view of the average people, to teach them that archeology is about history -- 
their history." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he conceded that funding is uncertain, Taha has big ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to guard sites under Palestinian control against looting, build a 
Palestinian archeological museum and initiate more digs. He also wants to 
persuade the still-struggling Palestinian Authority, the Yasser Arafat-led 
ruling body for Jericho and Gaza, that preserving archeological sites should be 
as important as developing Palestinian-controlled lands. The two goals 
sometimes come into conflict on the same piece of real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Taha wants a commitment from Israel that it will eventually 
return archeological treasures removed during 27 years of Israeli occupation of 
Palestinian territories. In 1992, more than a decade after their peace treaty, 
Israel finally agreed to return to Egypt the archeological finds that it 
removed during its occupation of the Sinai, Taha pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, Taha said, he wants to try to build a Palestinian archeology 
based on science, not on what he calls religious and political aims of 
archeology carried out in the Holy Land during Western Christian and Jewish 
Zionist digs in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 As Taha described his goals, Iman Saca, an archeology student, knelt nearby in 
the oblong hole, sifting the dirt carefully for bits of pottery or other clues 
that something substantial might lie farther down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an excellent thing," said Saca, 24, of Bethlehem, who earned her 
undergraduate degree in archeology from the University of Michigan. "We have 
the opportunity to participate in a dig, for the first time, directed and 
managed by Palestinians on their own land. This is a part of building a 
Palestinian future -- finding our past." 
</P>
<P>
 For as long as any Palestinian can remember, foreigners were always in control 
of revealing and interpreting the rich archeological record of Palestine. First 
Westerners and then Israelis came to what was biblical Palestine looking for 
physical confirmation of biblical history. Palestinian Arabs complained that 
their history, and Islamic history, was being pushed aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'archeological record' has been selectively used to document and 
sometimes defend the version of the past required by Christian and Jewish 
Zionists to justify the present occupation of Palestine," Albert Glock, an 
American archeologist who helped establish the department at Bir Zeit, a 
Palestinian University in the West Bank, alleged in a 1990 article in the 
Journal of Palestine Studies. "One result . . . has been the alienation of the 
native Muslim and Christian Palestinians from their own cultural past." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli archeologists dispute that view of their approach, and say they never 
attempted to hide or overlook the record of Muslim or Palestinian life. "All 
Israeli excavations have been made according to accepted ethical practices of 
archeology," said Efrat Ohrbach, spokeswoman for the Israeli Antiquities 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palestinians point to a last-minute sweep of the Jericho area, carried out 
in December by the Israeli Antiquities Authority, as evidence that Israeli 
archeologists are still reluctant to relinquish control of sites to 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed Operation Scroll, the search dispatched 16 teams of archeologists to 
the northern Dead Sea area, land that was due to be handed over to the 
Palestinians. The Antiquities Authority said it hoped to find scrolls such as 
those discovered just south of Jericho between 1947 and 1956 that became known 
as the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Dead Sea Scrolls proved invaluable in explaining 
early religious practices in the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No scrolls were discovered in the December sweep, but it left ill will among 
Palestinian and Israeli archeologists. Today, there is no cooperation between 
the Palestinian Antiquities Authority and its Israeli counterpart, according to 
Amir Drori, head of the Israeli Antiquities Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1967, people in the West Bank viewed archeology as part of the 
occupation system," said Mahmoud Hawari, a Hebrew University-trained 
archeologist who teaches at the Palestinian-run Institute of Islamic Archeology 
in Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Hawari said, some Palestinians began engaging in systematic looting of 
archeological sites -- seeing the robbery as an act of defiance against the 
occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to dozens of holes dug by looters around his site, Taha said the 
Palestinian Authority is determined to put an end to such practices. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other pressing concerns that may keep the authority from 
devoting the budget and attention needed to preserve and explore the 
Palestinian past, Palestinian archeologists concede. 
</P>
<P>
 Of necessity, Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization and 
head of the Palestinian Authority, is far more interested in creating jobs and 
jump-starting the moribund Palestinian economy than in reconstructing the 
heritage of ancient Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat is urging developers to come to the Palestinian-run lands. And as they 
move in to build homes and offices, archeologists are scrambling to ensure that 
they not destroy valuable sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do have a great fear that the Palestinian Authority will continue to view 
archeology as the bottom of its list of priorities," Hawari said. "People don't 
really understand that archeology is very important for us as Palestinians and 
for our heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 Taha said he already has started a modest education program in Jericho, 
lecturing at local elementary schools on the importance of seeking evidence of 
early Palestinian life. But he acknowledged that changing his people's 
perceptions of the role of archeology will be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Taha had to negotiate with Palestinian developers to persuade them that they 
should hold off on breaking ground for a vacation village where he had started 
his dig, on a tel -- a small hill -- that lies close to Hisham's Palace, a 
well-preserved structure from the Omayyad period of Islamic rule west of the 
Jordan River. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance between development and archeology, Taha acknowledged, will be 
hard to strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jericho is a very rich area, archeologically," Taha said. "In the area under 
our control, there are more than 35 identified sites and only four of those 
sites have been excavated. They stretch from the Stone Age to our time." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawari said he is forming a Palestinian archeological society that he hopes 
will be able to educate Palestinians and raise funds abroad for Palestinian 
digs and the building of a central archeological museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he said, he hopes Israeli and Palestinian archeologists will be 
able to overcome the bitterness of the past and work together to explore the 
history of Palestine and Israel. Digging Up the Past 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 archeological excavations have been carried out in the West Bank 
since Israel's occupation began in 1967. Most have been conducted by Israel. 
Some key discoveries: 
</P>
<P>
 HERODIAN -- A town and fortress on the eastern border of Judea used by Herod 
the Great (73-4 BC) during his conquest of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 HAR GERIZIM -- One of two mountains framing the entrance to the valley of 
Nablus. Traditional home of Samaritans, a tiny Jewish breakaway sect, and site 
of a Samaritan temple said to be a replica of Jerusalem's Jewish temple 
destroyed by Romans in AD 70. 
</P>
<P>
 NABLUS -- Under the streets of the West Bank's largest city lies an ancient 
Roman city known as Napolis that included a hippodrome, an amphitheater and a 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 NEBI SAMUEL -- A huge crusader fortress was uncovered on this hill, a site 
traditionally regarded as the tomb of the Prophet Samuel by Muslims and Jews, 
commanding the ancient approach to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 OPERATION SCROLL -- A sweep of the northern Dead Sea area last year was 
intended to uncover any remaining Dead Sea Scrolls. No scrolls were found, but 
several finds were made, including a Canaanite warrior's skeleton.

ENVIRONMENT; TINY RUSSIAN TOWN DROWNING IN SLUDGE; KRASNYY BOR IS CALLED A 
'TIME BOMB' AFTER 25 YEARS OF STORING ST. PETERSBURG'S TOXIC WASTE.

<P>
 Some evenings at this village are shattered by the terrified screams of pigs 
and foxes drowning in toxic sludge. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are quieter, and one can breathe in the sweet, chocolaty smell and 
contemplate the coming disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Krasnyy Bor is conducive to such gloomy thoughts. Every evening its reservoir 
comes a little closer to overflowing. If that happens, the muck will poison the 
cabbage farms that surround the reservoir as well as streams that flow into the 
Neva River near St. Petersburg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Krasnyy Bor is a time bomb," said the reservoir's chief caretaker, Vladimir 
Vovchanov. "It's set to go off in six months, or at the very latest within a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir was dug in 1969 as a temporary storage site for thousands of 
tons of hazardous waste -- battery acids, oil and gasoline, industrial cleaners 
and solvents, glues and paints produced by factories in St. Petersburg, then 
known as Leningrad, half an hour's drive away. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts chose the outskirts of this sleepy village for their dumping ground 
because they encompass a geologically rare vein of pale green Cambrian clay. 
It's like a dense mud, and it holds water six times more effectively than 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So a reservoir was scooped out of the clay around Krasnyy Bor, and the sludge 
of St. Petersburg was poured in. The experts warned that the site could be used 
for no more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 25 years later, the reservoir is still receiving hundreds of tons of 
dangerous substances. Room is made for the new waste by pumping old sludge into 
seven giant ovens, where it burns away at 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the oven chimney filters are primitive. Chemicals and poisons that survive 
the heat -- dioxin, for example -- roar up to mix with the clouds above. From 
the reservoir, whose scummy depths hide an array of chemicals, an even thicker 
brew evaporates into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that slop comes back down onto our farms and into our hair in the form of 
acid rain," Vovchanov said. "It's wild, unpardonably stupid, that this is still 
going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing that they built this reservoir without a cover of some sort. We 
have a fence around the grounds, and that keeps out people and children. No 
person has ever fallen in, but we have animals falling in all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in a country famous for raping its environment, Krasnyy Bor is, for the 
moment, a relatively model community. According to LenKomEkologia, the regional 
environmental agency, Krasnyy Bor's ovens throw up 387 tons of harmful gases 
and steams a year. But the neighboring Izhorsky Works, which turned out tanks 
that helped win World War II and now builds construction equipment, coughs out 
46,000 tons.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're actually quite good for the environment, for now," Vovchanov said. "But 
when we start to overflow, I will have to shut us down, and that will be a 
catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 With Krasnyy Bor shut down, St. Petersburg's industries would be forced to 
store their dangerous poisons and wastes in city warehouses, or dump them into 
neighboring forests or into the Neva River. This happened once, in 1989, when 
Krasnyy Bor was closed for a one-week protest. By the week's end, the St. 
Petersburg Sanitary-Epidemic Station was recording levels of heavy metals and 
salts in the Neva and the downtown Fontana Canal 400 times higher than the 
previous week's. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, cornered in August by ecologists and 
Krasnyy Bor workers during the Goodwill Games at St. Petersburg, has promised 
to include funds for building a new incinerator at Krasnyy Bor in the 1995 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's so far off," complained Vovchanov. "That means that until as late 
as September next year, we won't know whether the government intends to do 
anything. Besides, we had the same promise from (Soviet President Mikhail S.) 
Gorbachev." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the ovens roar 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to hold the toxic 
sludge back from the rim of the reservoir. But the level continues to climb. 
</P>
<P>
 With a modern incinerator, Vovchanov believes, he could quickly burn away the 
entire reservoir, and then -- over seven years, at a cost of about $5 million 
-- clean up and restore the area. But that's money he doesn't expect to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting for either a pragmatic leader to take power or a catastrophe," 
he said. "There's a Russian saying: 'The muzhik (peasant) doesn't cross himself 
until he hears the thunder.' We're waiting for the thunder."

POSTSCRIPT; JULES VERNE'S DARK VISION OF MODERN LIFE; HIS 'LOST' MANUSCRIPT 
SPEAKS OF AN ADVANCED BUT JOYLESS SOCIETY PROPELLED BY THE 'DEVIL OF MONEY.' 
</P>

 Horse-drawn carriages clattered on the streets outside Jules Verne's Paris 
apartment, but it was quiet inside. There was no telephone, no phonograph and 
no radio -- they had yet to be invented. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1863. Soldiers armed with muskets were fighting the Civil War 
across the Atlantic. Workers were digging London's first subway line. And, in 
Paris, the man who would become the best-selling French author of all time, 
taking readers on extraordinary voyages in "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the 
Sea" and "Around the World in Eighty Days," was imagining a bleak future. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing Verne could not have predicted was that a book he had written, 
rejected by his publisher, would wait 131 years, until 1994, to be published. 
</P>
<P>
 Verne was 35, with one highly acclaimed book to his credit, when he began 
writing "Paris in the Twentieth Century" by hand, in a small and delicate 
cursive. (The typewriter wouldn't be invented for another decade.) His pages 
were illuminated by a small gas lamp, electric lights being 15 years away. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's protagonist, Michel Dufrenoy, lived nearly a century in the future, 
in the year 1960. Technology and automation had supplanted the culture of the 
1800s. Elevators whisked people up and down buildings. Trains took them back 
and forth from the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Images -- he called them "fac-similes" -- could be sent thousands of miles 
away by "photographic telegraph," something we might today call a fax machine. 
Neon lights, unknown in 1863, illuminated Verne's avenues. Concerts were 
performed in 10,000-seat auditoriums by single artists using electric 
amplifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 And, "of the innumerable cars that passed on the paved roads, most moved 
without horses," he wrote, 25 years before the first prototype of an automobile 
was built. "They are propelled by an invisible force, the force of 20 or 30 
horses, by means of a motor run by gas combustion." 
</P>
<P>
 Verne's heroes, though, "no longer stood in admiration of these marvels," he 
wrote. "They just quietly took advantage of them, without being any happier, 
because of their speeded pace and their American passion. One could feel the 
devil of money pushing them forward nonstop and without mercy." 
</P>
<P>
 When Verne's editor, Pierre-Jules Hetzel, one of France's most renowned book 
editors, read Verne's manuscript, he was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dear Verne," Hetzel wrote, in the sort of soothing rebuff that authors 
dread, "I would give, I don't know what, to not have to write you today. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have undertaken an impossible task -- as do all those like you who can 
see in the future," Hetzel wrote. "But you haven't succeeded. I wasn't waiting 
for something perfect, but I was awaiting something better. I would consider it 
a disaster for your name to be associated with this work." 
</P>
<P>
 Hetzel didn't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is 100 steps below 'Five Weeks in a Balloon,' " he said, referring to 
Verne's first success, which had appeared the same year. "If you wait a year, 
you will agree with me. It is a little story and on a subject that isn't 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 With that rebuff, the respectful author locked the manuscript, and its dark 
vision of the future, in a safe. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to write "Journey to the Center of the Earth" and 60 more novels, 
tales of imaginary, futuristic expeditions more filled with wonderment than 
dread. 
</P>
<P>
 The safe remained in Verne's family after his death in 1905 at 77. Remarkably, 
no one tried to find the manuscript, though it was officially listed at his 
death as being among his unpublished works. 
</P>
<P>
 But the author's great-grandson, opera singer Jean Jules Verne, 31, remembered 
well that safe, which the family had lugged from place to place. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an obsession of my childhood," Jean Verne has said. "I spent many long 
afternoons trying to open it. I tried all the keys of the house and others that 
fell into my hand. It represented for me an unsolvable mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in 1989, using a blowtorch, Jean Verne opened the safe. Inside were a 
few Russian bonds, an unfinished play and the unedited manuscript titled "Paris 
in the Twentieth Century." 
</P>
<P>
 The manuscript's authenticity was verified by experts, and the 218-page book, 
with illustrations by a modern-day Belgian artist, Francois Schuiten, was 
published a few weeks ago in France, drawing admiring reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reads today like a prelude to all his fiction," wrote a reviewer in the 
Paris daily newspaper, Liberation. "Hetzel (Verne's editor) never understood 
that the most prestigious of his authors was in fact a writer . The book may 
lack some bounce, but it certainly doesn't, as insinuated by Hetzel, lack 
originality." 
</P>
<P>
 Hetzel discovered Verne in 1862 and, during their close 20-year relationship, 
used his skills to establish Verne's reputation. To the editor, whose other 
writers included Alexandre Dumas and Victor Hugo, "Paris in the Twentieth 
Century" was a downer, not very marketable. 
</P>
<P>
 But novelist Bertrand Poirot-Delpech, one of France's most-respected literary 
critics, says the book shows again Verne's "distinct genius to deduce the 
future, not from a dream with eyes closed but from an intense observation of 
the present." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, this sad and nightmarish vision of the 20th Century has come as 
a shock to many readers. For all the technical wonders Verne imagined, and 
largely because of them, Verne's Paris, circa 1960, is a forbidding place. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollution is as thick as the London fog, the countryside has disappeared, 
traffic jams clog the streets and tall buildings mar the Parisian sky. Offices 
are protected by security alarms, and, as one character puts it, "laughter is 
punished by the death penalty. In this century, we've got to astonish people. 
One can't charm them anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The hero, Michel, dreams of becoming a poet. But classical culture has been 
driven away by the overpowering need to make money, and the young man winds up 
broke and miserable. "Latin and Greek are not only dead languages, but also 
buried," Verne writes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Verne's vision, marriage has become "a useless, almost heroic act," and 
children born out of wedlock far outnumber those born to married couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Parisian woman has been transformed. "She is a butterfly who has 
returned to being a caterpillar," he writes. "Her caressing way of walking, her 
grace, her amiable smile, her slight plumpness have all been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has become an American," he continues. "She speaks gravely of serious 
business, dresses badly, without taste, and wears a strong iron corset." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Simone Vierne, a literature professor in Grenoble and author of "Jules Verne, 
Myth and Modernity," argues that the author's great gift was not in telling the 
future, but in following scientific advances to a logical conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lost novel shows clearly that Verne's genius was not to have anticipated 
technological progress, but to foresee its troubling consequences for human 
beings," Vierne wrote in the newspaper InfoMatin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we have walked on the moon and surpassed most of his inventions, 
it's time to take this into account," the professor added. "The world where 
money and technology rule is not, as we well know, the best of all worlds."

MARKET FOCUS; TAINTED PAPRIKA POISONS HUNGARY'S CULINARY PRIDE; FIFTY-NINE 
PEOPLE ARE ARRESTED IN THE SCANDAL, WHICH SENT 46 TO THE HOSPITAL. THE HEALTH 
OF THE INDUSTRY IS ALSO AT STAKE.

<P>
 Greed was the motive. Housewives were the unwitting perpetrators. So far, 
nearly four dozen diners have become victims, stricken ill by paprika laced 
with lead-based paint. 
</P>
<P>
 The consequences of Europe's latest food-tampering scandal are likely to 
afflict not just the body but the soul of Hungary, as a nation proud of its 
culinary culture finds its food under suspicion, and cooks from Sopron to 
Szeged ponder how they will manage without their signature Hungarian spice. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 46 people were poisoned by tainted paprika last month, police have 
rounded up 60 suspects. Sacks and tins of paprika have been swept from every 
store shelf, and the government has banned all domestic sales of the spice. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet panic has mounted. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Hungarian woman simply can't cook without paprika," insisted Anna Horvath, 
a pensioner who traveled 40 miles by train from an outlying village to get her 
cache of the capsicum-based, pungent red powder tested for traces of the 
poisonous paint. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paprika is the defining ingredient of Hungarian cuisine. It provides the 
distinctive flavor of the most popular dishes, from its namesake chicken 
paprika to every pot of goulash to the tangy tomato-pepper compote called lesco 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Paprika gives Hungarian sausage its rusty color, and a sprinkling of the stuff 
adds flair to dishes finished off with a dollop of sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
 It shares the pride of placement beside salt on most tables, edging out black 
pepper as the popular choice for a final flavor spike. 
</P>
<P>
 Paprika seeped into Hungarian cooking only about 200 years ago, but each of 
this country's 10.5 million citizens now consumes, on average, more than a 
pound of it each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a tiny part of the national total has been laced with a red paint 
compound, apparently to improve a sad-looking lot, and the country is up in 
arms. Worse than the culinary chaos disrupting millions of Hungarian 
households, for example, is the disastrous taint the incident has inflicted on 
Hungary's reputation as a safe place for travelers and a fun place to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants across Budapest report that some diners, especially foreign 
tourists, are specifically requesting that paprika be left out of the dishes 
they order. The Matthias Cellar, one of the capital's most popular eateries, 
has temporarily taken goulash off the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paprika symbolizes Hungary," explained a devastated Kalman Kalla, the master 
chef at Hungary's famed Gundel's restaurant. "It will take a long time to get 
over this." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a canary in a mine shaft, guarding against a lethal whiff, Kalla 
personally tastes a sample from each new sack of paprika, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have presidents and prime ministers and the world's great artists coming 
to dine here. I have to know what I'm feeding them is safe, otherwise I 
couldn't sleep at night," said the master chef. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungary produces about 8,000 tons of paprika each year, about 6% of the world 
market, which is evenly divided between domestic consumption and foreign 
export. 
</P>
<P>
 Government investigators are not sure how much paprika was tainted with the 
toxic paint compound, but they have seized nearly two tons of the doctored 
substance in the Kalocsa "Paprika Belt" along the Danube River, about 60 miles 
south of Budapest. The rest of the tainted paprika had been distributed to 
private traders who sold it to market vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police say they doubt those who did this knew how harmful the substance 
can be," Emi Koncse of the Ministry for Trade and Industry said of the paint 
compound.  
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe that the perpetrators tried to save time and money by 
artificially drying ripe peppers instead of allowing them to naturally 
desiccate, which can take up to a year. Peppers dried too quickly produce a 
less brilliant red color when ground into spice, food experts say, which likely 
prompted the tamperers to add the paint agent to improve the looks of their 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first cases of paprika-induced lead poisoning occurred in late August, but 
the source was not traced to the tainted spice until nearly a month later, by 
which time 46 people were hospitalized. Prime Minister Gyula Horn appointed his 
chief deputy, Gabor Kuncze, to oversee the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The government was confident that the two main paprika mills in Kalocsa and 
Szeged practiced quality controls adequate to ensure none of their product had 
been tainted. Hungary's paprika supply used to be produced exclusively by the 
two state-owned plants, but at least 70 small private mills have cropped up 
over the last five years under Hungary's post-Communist drive for 
entrepreneurship. The 59 people arrested so far are all associated with a 
handful of those fledgling private mills. 
</P>
<P>
 Free testing of domestic stocks of paprika has been offered to consumers, but 
as the number of samples showing traces of toxic lead residue increased, panic 
ensued. By early October, Budapest's Quality Protection Institute was being 
inundated with 5,000 requests a day for sample testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 12.5% of the samples we've tested have been tainted, but 99.5% of them 
are of the same origin," said Eva Simon, the testing department chief, alluding 
to the stocks police have traced to the tampering ring in Kalocsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, growing hysteria over the tainting incident prompted the 
government to intensify its actions. All domestic sales of paprika have been 
banned, and stores were ordered to take remaining quantities of the spice off 
shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There won't be any paprika for sale in Hungary for a couple of weeks, until 
we are satisfied that all of the poisoned substance has been destroyed and 
there's no possibility of any more being sold," Koncse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hungary has not yet taken any steps that would affect its exports, and 
officials such as Koncse insist that there is no way any of the tainted paprika 
could have gotten into what she described as a closely regulated food export 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But such assurances may not allay wary consumers, especially foreign tourists 
spooked by the tainting scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have already experienced groups coming here and saying they don't want 
anything with paprika in it," said Kalla, the chef at Gundel's. "I know my food 
is good. But people are being frightened by the stories. This will have very 
bad consequences for the whole country."

CEDRAS RESIGNS IN HAITI, ENDING BRUTAL REGIME; CARIBBEAN: MILITARY LEADER, 
CHIEF OF STAFF QUIT UNDER U.S. PRESSURE. MOVE CLEARS WAY FOR RETURN OF 
ARISTIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras quit as army commander Monday, ending three years of 
brutal and corrupt military dictatorship that left Haiti in an economic coma 
and occupied by foreign troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to intense U.S. pressure, Cedras submitted his resignation just two 
days short of the formal end of his three-year term as Haiti's military chief 
and five days before the expected return of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
the man the army drove from office Sept. 30, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The act heartened the U.S. government, which has had an off-and-on 
relationship with Cedras over the years, praising him for his role in 
guaranteeing the 1989 election that brought Aristide to office and then 
condemning him for overthrowing the nation's first democratically elected 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome the resignation of Gen. Cedras," said U.S. Embassy spokesman 
Stanley Shrager. "His anticipated departure represents the end of a sad chapter 
of Haitian history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past three years," Shrager said, "have brought unlimited suffering to the 
Haitian people, who have known more than their share of tragedy, witnessed more 
than their share of death and lost more than their share of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those days are over, and the return of President Aristide on Oct. 15 opens a 
new page and a brighter future for the people of this nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying the military commander in his loss of power was Brig. Gen. 
Philippe Biamby, the army chief of staff. Biamby, who had told friends he would 
die before quitting, submitted his resignation to Cedras on Saturday and 
disappeared from sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras also indicated he would leave Haiti, although he left open when he 
would go and where. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am officially giving up the responsibility of the military institution," he 
said in brief and almost inaudible departing remarks. "I have decided to leave 
our country." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials had pushed Cedras not only to surrender his title before the 
week's end but to go into exile, even offering to fly him to one of several 
countries offering him repose. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras was permitted a brief ceremony Monday morning to turn over his office 
to interim commander Maj. Gen. Jean-Claude Duperval. 
</P>
<P>
 But in what U.S. officials acknowledged was a clear effort at humiliating 
Cedras and displaying his dependence on U.S. troops, the ritual was held on a 
barricaded side street next to the military headquarters, with only a small 
honor guard, army band and about 50 American troops acting as guards inside the 
roped-off perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 The sound system was so poor that even people standing 20 feet away couldn't 
hear Cedras tell his forces that they will be judged by history as having done 
their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, commander of the 19,000 U.S. troops virtually 
occupying Haiti, sat off to the side, chewing gum and appearing to pay more 
attention to the crowd outside the barricades than to Cedras. Shelton stood 
only when Cedras turned over his flag to Duperval. 
</P>
<P>
 Duperval, a 47-year-old military academy classmate of both Cedras and Biamby, 
then spoke, and his remarks also were largely unheard by the crowd. But what he 
did say was significant, at least in terms of recognizing that the old days of 
arbitrary military behavior are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of the presence of the U.S. troops as "serene," the portly Duperval, 
who is unlikely to become Aristide's permanent army commander, said, "I hope 
for an army of the people, a united army that respects law, discipline, life 
and the personal rights of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 What could be heard clearly during the ritual were curses and derisive chants 
from the 3,000 jeering Haitians gathered on the fringes -- mostly obscenities 
directed at Cedras. They also shouted "Shelton! Shelton!" and waved American 
flags, some with Aristide's portrait superimposed on the stars and stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 And stronger things than curses were flung at Cedras as he left the 25-minute 
ceremony -- rocks broke his car window, resulting in at least two bursts of 
warning shots fired by the general's bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cedras and Biamby, along with former police chief Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph 
Francois, were required to leave office no later than Saturday under an 
agreement reached last month with former President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois, who most sources say organized the 1991 coup and dragged a reluctant 
and indecisive Cedras along at the last minute, left first, resigning last 
Tuesday and fleeing to the neighboring Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras formally submitted his resignation Sunday to Emile Jonassaint, the last 
of two puppet civilian presidents he installed during his rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras wanted to stay until Wednesday and exit in a formal ceremony on the 
wide lawns of the Presidential Palace that would project honor and dignity. 
Shelton originally agreed to that, U.S. military sources said, as a gesture to 
a fellow officer and in appreciation for the cooperation pledged by Cedras when 
the American forces arrived three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Cedras and Biamby began delaying and obstructing and even harassing 
the U.S. mission, Shelton decided a dose of humility would fit Cedras better 
than a ceremonial sword and white-gloved salutes, U.S. sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By making him leave only hours before he was to march out claiming 'mission 
accomplished,' " said a U.S. Army officer, "Shelton destroyed any residual 
attraction Cedras might have had with his own troops, and it allows Aristide to 
come back with no distractions." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cedras had denied publicly that he would either resign early or leave 
Haiti, family friends and diplomatic sources said he has opted for exile, 
ultimately in Spain, where he once attended a training course and now owns two 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The friends said Cedras decided to leave partly because of American insistence 
but also because he and his wife, Yannick, could not face a constant reminder 
from Aristide's presence that the general had destroyed his career for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever he ends up, Cedras can live comfortably on the millions of dollars 
that Haitian experts say he accumulated during his stay in power. 
</P>
<P>
 But money doesn't buy safety, at least not in Haiti. The United States pledged 
to protect Cedras in the short run but indicated that if he stayed, he would be 
on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Biamby's vow to stay in Haiti was taken more seriously. A 42-year-old bachelor 
who has lived primarily in his childhood room in his mother's house, Biamby has 
always pursued an intense privacy that has left him without much foreign 
experience or many friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Haitian sources said Biamby probably would also go. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras, Biamby and Francois were the target of American policy and U.N. 
resolutions, which demanded their removal and Aristide's restoration as the 
price of ending financial and trade sanctions that left the perpetually 
impoverished nation in economic death throes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the end of military power and Aristide's return, the sanctions will be 
formally removed by Sunday and a massive reconstruction program begun, U.N. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, praising the U.S. military's performance in Haiti, said 
Aristide will go back to Haiti this weekend as planned. "I am pleased to 
announce that President Aristide will return home to resume his rightful place 
this Saturday, Oct. 15," Clinton said in a televised speech to the nation 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "In just three weeks, the level of violence is down, the Parliament is back, 
refugees are returning from Guantanamo (the U.S. base in Cuba) and now the 
military leaders are leaving," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I also want to caution again, the job in Haiti remains difficult and 
dangerous," Clinton said. "We still have a lot of work ahead of us. But our 
troops are keeping America's commitment to restore democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Burt Wides, one of Aristide's American lawyers, said the outstanding issue on 
Aristide's mind is the future shape of the high command of the Haitian 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 Wides said Monday that U.S. officials in Haiti were pressuring Aristide's 
people there to permit some of the high-ranking officers directly under the 
coup leaders to remain in power, at least for the interim, and help cleanse the 
military of human rights abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide is pushing for the conditions agreed to in the Governors Island 
accord of July, 1993: that all members of the high command would retire or take 
assignments abroad.

NEWS ANALYSIS; PROMPT MOVE ON IRAQ GIVES CLINTON BADLY NEEDED BOOST; POLITICS: 
DEMOCRATS HOPE FOR REASSESSMENT OF HIS STRENGTH AS LEADER. QUESTIONS ABOUT BUSH 
POLICY REVIVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's decision to confront Iraq immediately over its dispatch of 
troops toward the Kuwaiti border provides him with a badly needed political 
boost in an area -- foreign policy -- where he has taken some of the toughest 
licks of his White House tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 And Democrats are hoping that the apparent bloodless success in the Persian 
Gulf coupled with the resignation of Haitian strongman Raoul Cedras can help 
launch a reassessment of what they contend has been Clinton's underappreciated 
strengths as a leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Making this outcome all the sweeter for Clinton and his partisans is that it 
serves to revive embarrassing questions for former President George Bush and 
his advisers -- who have been among the foremost critics of Clinton's foreign 
policy -- about their own handling of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, along with some independent analysts, pointed out that Clinton's 
decision to face down President Saddam Hussein stands in marked contrast to 
Bush's initial effort to placate the Iraqi ruler when he threatened Kuwait four 
years ago. And they also argued that Hussein would not have been able to flex 
his military muscles except for the Bush Administration's controversial 
decision to call a halt to Operation Desert Storm before obliterating the Iraqi 
army. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton responded to the situation quickly and in a firm and balanced way," 
said Bruce Jentleson, a Democratic foreign policy consultant and author of 
"With Friends Like These," a new book on U.S. policy toward Iraq under Bush and 
former President Ronald Reagan. Clinton "clearly had in mind the lessons of the 
Bush experience," Jentleson added, referring to efforts by Bush to dissuade 
Hussein from invading Kuwait in 1990 with offers of friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 No one pretends that developments in the Middle East can by themselves reverse 
the tide of the 1994 congressional campaign, which has been running strongly 
against the Democrats, or refurbish Clinton's leadership image, which has been 
particularly tarnished by what critics have derided as hollow rhetoric and 
false starts in dealing with conundrums abroad, from Haiti to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for caution is Hussein's notorious track record of often failing to 
match his deeds to his reassuring promises. Moreover, Clinton still faces 
significant political risks in Haiti as U.S. forces turn to the sensitive 
challenge of restoring democratic rule in that troubled nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reality is that foreign policy issues do not ordinarily greatly 
influence the voting decisions of American voters, who in this campaign are 
mostly preoccupied with such domestic concerns as crime and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever effect this has is likely to be marginal and not last long," said 
John Mueller, a University of Rochester specialist on the impact of foreign 
policy on presidential standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Clinton has a long way to go to modify the current unfavorable 
impressions of his performance at home and abroad. A Times Poll last month 
showed that only 36% of the 1,340 adults interviewed nationwide approved of his 
foreign policy record, compared with 42% who approved of his overall job 
performance. Only 17% said that they had a good idea of the President's goals 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, if he (Clinton) stopped a meteor from hitting Earth with his bare 
hands, I'm not sure he'd get any credit for it," said Ed Sarpolus, an 
independent pollster in Michigan, where Democratic candidates are trailing in 
races for governor and the U.S. Senate. But as a result of the Iraq events, 
Sarpolus said, "Clinton may be able to get people to pay attention to things 
that he's done." 
</P>
<P>
 And Democratic pollster Mark Mellman suggested that the effect of the 
successes abroad would reach beyond foreign policy, in part because these 
results contrast so sharply with the heavy dose of criticism he has endured. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President showed strength and resolve, which not only improves people's 
evaluation of his foreign policy but which also reveals something about his 
character which transcends the specific foreign policy accomplishments and 
comes at a time when the national mood is depressed and negative," Mellman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a doubleheader victory," he said. "Maybe it's not quite morning in 
America, but at least I think I can see the sun rising." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's show of resolve in the Persian Gulf brought him praise even from 
Bush, who only a few months ago was lambasting his Democratic successor for his 
"stop-and-start policy of hesitancy abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps just as gratifying from Clinton's point of view is that Hussein's 
massing of troops near the Kuwaiti border put Bush and other Republicans on the 
defensive as they sought to explain their actions taken at the end of the Gulf 
War in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In an address Monday to the American Gas Assn., Bush explained that if he had 
carried on the war to force Hussein from power he would have sundered the 
international coalition he had assembled to assault Iraq and could have plunged 
the United States into a Vietnam-like quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
 "How the heck are we going to get out without a huge loss of life?" he asked 
rhetorically. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to that same point, Dick Cheney, Bush's defense secretary and a 
1996 GOP presidential prospect, said in an interview on NBC-TV's "Today" show 
that "disposing of Saddam Hussein . . . would have taken a long time and it was 
something that nobody else in the coalition was signed on for." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the United States had not inflicted more damage on the Republican 
Guard, the shock troops of the Iraqi army, Cheney said the United States had in 
fact "significantly reduced" Hussein's military strength and pointed out that 
the Iraqi ruler had had three years to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you can say the war should have gone on longer," he said. "But we had, in 
fact, achieved our objectives, what Congress had approved and what the American 
people had signed up to do."

HUSSEIN MAY BE BIDDING TO CURB INTERNAL WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a cornered cat, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is making a desperate bid 
to survive growing internal pressures and prospects that the international 
sanctions strangling his economy will not be lifted soon, according to U.S. 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 In provoking a crisis -- massing his troops near the Kuwaiti border and then 
announcing a pullback -- he hopes to divert domestic attention from growing 
evidence of instability, marked by a spate of recent bombings of government 
targets, purges, the halving of rations and Draconian new punishments for 
crimes and defections. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he took over the premiership months ago, he promised things were going 
to get better. But instead the economy and the security situation only got 
worse," said Phebe Marr, an Iraq specialist at Washington's National Defense 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then as it became apparent that the debate on U.N. sanctions was not going to 
yield much, Saddam couldn't be seen to be sitting in Baghdad doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise move also marked an attempt to manipulate international opinion, 
perhaps in the naive belief that the United States might engage in negotiations 
to avoid a showdown while it is preoccupied with Haiti or as it has done with 
the regimes in North Korea and Cuba recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the regime's pledge Monday to back down does not necessarily mark the end 
of the latest crisis -- nor the final phase of Hussein's rule. It reminds the 
international community that Hussein can still cause severe problems in the 
region -- and he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is that Iraq remains the military power in the region 
and is still a threat to its (Persian) Gulf neighbors," said Anthony H. 
Cordesman, Georgetown University professor and author of the just published 
"Iran and Iraq: The Threat from the Northern Gulf." 
</P>
<P>
 Baghdad could dispatch troops to the southern frontier whenever it wants -- 
precipitating a series of costly crises and playing the United States and its 
allies like a yo-yo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem isn't just whether he's dancing at the border but whether his 
forces are in southern Iraq. It takes days to get U.S. ships from (the Indian 
Ocean island of) Diego Garcia. There's always the risk of being overrun," 
Cordesman noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also may think he can pin down the United States indefinitely if we don't 
deal with him. He may think over time he can force us to negotiate to avoid a 
permanent or enduring confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein's unpredictability thus leaves the Clinton Administration with a 
thorny and potentially continuing problem. And so far, Saudi Arabia and other 
allies have not offered to pick up the tab for this operation, as they did to 
the tune of more than $65 billion for Operations Desert Shield and Desert 
Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the cost, the coalition probably would have to redeploy for other 
reasons unrelated to Kuwait's security, experts contend. Any instability in the 
region that would cut off the free flow of oil, for instance, could force the 
coalition into action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wake-up call. Since the Gulf War, the United States has become 
more, not less, dependent on Gulf oil," said Geoffrey Kemp, senior associate at 
the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there's nothing on the horizon to indicate any change over the next 
decade. So we and our allies have to pay more attention to the Gulf, not less." 
</P>
<P>
 But in leading the anti-Hussein alliance, the Administration has limited 
options in terms of response. The current mandate, stipulated under a series of 
1990 and 1991 U.N. resolutions, is limited to issues related to the defense of 
Kuwait. It does not provide significant latitude for the alliance to move 
within Iraq or against Baghdad for internal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Allocations for U.S. intelligence operations against Hussein's regime have 
more than quadrupled since the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991. Yet none of the 
opposition groups from any of Iraq's three major ethnic or religious groups -- 
northern Kurds, the ruling Sunni Muslim minority or the majority southern 
Shiites -- is considered to be strong enough to oust Hussein, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet conditions inside Iraq appear to have crossed a threshold, they added. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation was estimated at a staggering 24,000%, and child mortality has 
quadrupled since the war, Iraqi officials said this summer. The economy 
generally has deteriorated so badly that the government recently was forced to 
halve rations originally intended to appease the public because of widespread 
shortages and soaring prices of basic foodstuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official said that the shifting circumstances have created "an 
aura of desperation." But Hussein is a master at using dramatic techniques to 
mobilize domestic opinion and to manipulate the international community, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the latest chapter in the Iraqi drama appears to have backfired on 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the crisis, Russia, France, China and Turkey -- three members of the 
U.N. Security Council and a critical Iraqi neighbor -- favored easing the 
sanctions after a six-month testing of Iraq's compliance with U.N. monitoring 
of its weapons of mass destruction, which went into effect Monday. But the 
United States opposed easing the sanctions, saying that Hussein had not 
complied with other conditions, such as recognizing Kuwait's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of Hussein's troop movements is that those who favored the easing 
are now more likely to support the call by the United States and Britain for 
continuing the sanctions, the analysts said. While the coalition recently 
looked like it might be fracturing over the sanctions issue, it now appears 
likely once again to unite.

BLACK-WHITE DIVIDE APPEARS TO BE WIDENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Melsha, a 33-year-old office manager for a heating and cooling company in 
Iowa, appears to be the voice of a new American majority. 
</P>
<P>
 And the sentiments he imparts clearly are getting the attention of legislators 
and politicians: Government efforts to improve the lot of minorities in the 
country have "gone too far." 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I'm not a racist and I'm not going to go out and shoot anybody, but I 
don't think (black Americans) deserve all the special programs that are offered 
to them," Melsha said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the special programs (the government has are) for everybody except the 
white male. I don't think it's right that they say you have to have so many 
blacks or so many women or so many Hispanics working in different factories." 
</P>
<P>
 While a minority of whites have long expressed opposition to affirmative 
action and special programs aimed at helping blacks, recent polls indicate that 
that view is now held by a majority of white Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when they view their own economic futures with uncertainty, experts 
say, the nation's "haves" -- especially the white middle class -- say they are 
increasingly less willing to help those farther down the socioeconomic ladder. 
The feelings are harbored not so much out of animus toward blacks as a concern 
that opportunities are lessening for everyone and only so many can succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, black and white Americans are glaring at each other across a 
racial divide that once promised to narrow but now appears to be widening. 
While whites have become more protective of their own status, blacks 
increasingly despair of ever achieving real equality. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, experts say, is that politicians -- sensitive to the moods of the 
largest blocs of voters -- may respond by rolling back government social 
programs. Specifically, they say, the fears are likely to fuel campaigns by 
politicians pledging to end welfare programs, eliminate health care benefits 
for the poor and repeal anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress will come back in January as a more conservative body, and that does 
not augur well for universal health care with protections for the poor and 
black segments of the population, nor does it speak well for the kind of 
meaningful civil rights protections that we feel are needed," said Wade 
Henderson, Washington director for the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same is likely to be true for welfare reform, as we expect Congress will 
be urged by their constituents to adopt a plan that is punitive against the 
most helpless segments of our society." 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of the problem, numerous recent surveys suggest, is a deep sense 
among whites that black Americans are getting breaks -- in employment 
opportunities, education benefits and government programs -- that are enabling 
them to surpass the living standards of whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of white people see that one in seven blacks have household income at 
$50,000 or above and conclude that too many black people are doing well," said 
Bill Boyd, a fellow at the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center of the Press, 
Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of 
Government. "That's when white people seem to make the illogical leap. They 
think everybody is equal and point to those black people doing well and say, 
therefore, we don't need to do any more to help any black people." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, who is studying the relationship between public opinion and the social 
gains of black Americans during the past 40 years, notes that the feelings are 
not unlike those that arose during the peak of the civil rights movement in the 
1960s, when whites felt threatened by black advancement, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd's studies also suggest that a white backlash against the Great Society 
programs of the Lyndon B. Johnson Administration ultimately helped lead to the 
election of Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts don't mean a thing in opinion polling, and that's what makes black 
people feel all the more uneasy about this current mood of the nation," said 
Boyd, who is black. "They know that polls drive policy." 
</P>
<P>
 But while responding to anti-black sentiments may get some politicians 
elected, the strategy could be shortsighted, says Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), 
who often speaks about the need for white Americans to embrace programs 
intended to assist black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic future of the children of white Americans will increasingly 
depend on the talents of nonwhite Americans," he said in an interview. "To the 
extent those talents are not developed, the prospects of all Americans, 
including whites, will be diminished. That's not ideology or polling. That is 
demographics." But that message appears unpersuasive to large numbers of 
whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Wicker, the retired New York Times columnist, said that in the course of 
writing a book on the fate of racial integration in American society he has 
noticed a sense of creeping frustration among whites toward blacks' social 
gains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Busing was a factor," Wicker said. "Affirmative action was a factor. Crime is 
an enormous factor. I think also the advent of the Reagan-Bush Administration, 
which was the first time in 20 years the government began to side against 
blacks in certain cases, tended to validate hardening white people's attitudes 
toward blacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Wicker says that although the trend has been developing for some time, 
pollsters failed to monitor it because respondents often did not express their 
true feelings. "I think probably for a long time (white) people either didn't 
want to admit how they felt or somehow thought their feelings were out of step 
with everybody else," he said. "But I think over the last few years . . . 
people have become more willing to tell poll-takers what they actually think." 
</P>
<P>
 That view is underscored by a nationwide survey recently released by the Times 
Mirror Center for the People & the Press. The telephone poll of 3,800 adults, 
18 years of age or older, revealed that white Americans' views toward black 
Americans have hardened so much that 51% of the whites surveyed agree with a 
statement that equal rights had been pushed too far in this country. That 
figure represents the first time in the seven-year history of the center's 
polling that a majority of white Americans said so; in 1992, 42% agreed that 
equal rights had gone too far, and in 1987, only 16% felt that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "These findings suggest that maybe the country is well on track toward a more 
polarized society than we are willing to admit," said Andrew Kohut, director of 
the Times Mirror polling center. "Clearly, there seems to be less concern on 
the part of whites toward blacks. They are feeling anxiety about their lives 
and less charitable toward those (blacks) less fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Other polls are discovering similar attitudes. For example, a 1991 Los Angeles 
Times Poll found that whites tend to minimize the role of racial prejudice in 
the problems afflicting blacks, while blacks generally see discrimination as a 
barrier to their advancement. That poll revealed that 60% of the whites and 30% 
of the blacks surveyed rejected the idea that discrimination was the principle 
reason blacks "on average . . . have worse jobs, income and housing than white 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, a poll conducted earlier this year by ICR Survey Research Group 
of Media, Pa., for the Associated Press found that 6 out of 10 whites think 
blacks and other minorities now have the same opportunities as whites, but that 
7 out of 10 blacks disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohut says the increased antagonism of white Americans toward African 
Americans is one manifestation of a pessimistic and despairing mood washing 
over the electorate. This mood is driven by economic fears and is most clearly 
evident among the demographic segment he labeled "new economy independents," 
which makes up 18% of the adult population and 19% of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 They are mostly white middle-age working women with children and have at least 
a high school diploma. They feel underemployed, question their job prospects 
and doubt government's ability to do anything to improve their lives. And they 
are characterized by their lack of sympathy for the problems of black 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not anchored in either major party, these are the most important swing voters 
in the new electorate," according to the poll. Although they voted for 
President Clinton in 1992, more than half consider themselves independents and 
express a willingness to vote for the GOP or a third party -- a fact that makes 
their views toward blacks and other social issues pertinent to candidates 
sensitive to political winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a very educated person," said Ora Sears, 54, who operates a day-care 
center from her home in Carlton, La., "but . . . if I could get up there and 
tell (President Clinton) what to do, I'd tell him to put the schools back like 
they were. Everybody got along fine when I was back in school. The blacks had 
their schools and we did better in our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, who is white, is quick to point out that she harbors no ill will toward 
black people, but she frets that blacks don't want to work to get ahead in 
America. "It's getting to the place now that the blacks are feeling we owe them 
something for their ancestors," she said. "I just don't think this is fair. We 
should try to live together in the time we were born, not back in history or 
some time like that." 
</P>
<P>
 That opinion was seconded by Melsha, who admitted that it was wrong of whites 
to discriminate against blacks "back in the Martin Luther King days," but that 
time had come and gone. "How long do they have to benefit from (social 
programs) before everybody is equal?" he asked.

 Christa, who offered only her first name, is a 28-year-old white student 
working toward a master's degree at Austin Peay State University in 
Clarksville, Tenn. She says black Americans appear not to have pride in 
themselves because too often they are the beneficiaries of government programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that sometimes if you're just given things, you'll resent it and 
you'll resent the person that gave it to you as if you owed them something," 
she said. "I feel as if I'm working very hard. I'm paying for my own education. 
But a lot of times I feel that African Americans don't see me as a hard worker. 
They see me as someone with a silver spoon in my mouth." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Olsen, 28, who runs a chain of bookstores in New York City, says he 
believes that a "backlash against political correctness" is emboldening white 
Americans to speak out about their perceptions of the unfair advantages they 
believe blacks are getting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so easy to overhear (white) people at the water cooler say things like 
'Is it Negro? Is it colored? Is it black? Is it African American? Aw, the hell 
with it. We've gone too far," said Olsen, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsen says the hardening racial views of whites are reinforced by the 
popularity of talk shows on radio and television, where controversial racial 
views are encouraged to boost audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got the guys on the radio, like Rush Limbaugh, and on television, like 
Geraldo (Rivera), who can play all this stuff up in these nice little sound 
bites and sway public opinion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So when and how does all this end? 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth," Olsen said ruefully, "I don't think there ever will 
be a point when (white and black) people will treat each other equally on a 
personal level."

2 AMERICANS WIN NOBEL FOR MEDICINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two American scientists who discovered a cellular "switch" that is crucial to 
vision, smell and the functioning of hundreds of other processes throughout the 
body, were named Monday to receive the 1994 Nobel Prize for medicine or 
physiology. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred G. Gilman, 53, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center 
in Dallas and Martin Rodbell, 68, of the National Institute of Environmental 
Health Sciences in North Carolina shared the prize for their discovery of "G 
proteins," which turn biological processes inside cells on and off in response 
to signals from other cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Defects in G proteins have been implicated in a variety of diseases, from 
cancer to alcoholism, and the Karolinska Institutet, which announced the award 
Monday, predicted that Gilman and Rodbell's discoveries could eventually lead 
to a cure for these and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilman has won a number of major awards for his work, and researchers have 
long expected at least one of the pair to receive the Nobel. "It would have 
been a major surprise if it were never awarded," said biologist Ray Deshaies of 
Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 Their discoveries, products of two decades of work, have been "paramount" in 
helping scientists understand diseases that affect tens of millions of people, 
said Bertil Fredholm of the Karolinska Institutet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodbell and Gilman's findings represent "a breakthrough so fundamental to 
medical science that G protein research has become one of today's hottest 
fields," said Dr. William Neaves, dean of the Southwestern Medical School. 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, the award was "a little bit surprising in that . . . Nobels are 
often given in a field where all the work is finished," said biologist Melvin 
Simon of Caltech. "This is a field that hasn't matured yet. We have a lot more 
to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Rodbell retired from the health sciences institute in May because 
he did not have enough funds to continue research for the entire year. His type 
of basic research, he said, is no longer widely welcomed in the 
mission-oriented world of federal science. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world ain't the same," he said at a news conference in suburban 
Washington, where he was visiting family. "Now everything is targeted, bottom 
line, how to make a buck. . . . The attention of the Congress and the executive 
branch always has been toward the end goal. They are not as willing to take a 
chance now on people like me in exploring the unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair will share an award estimated at $930,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilman, who became interested in science working in his father's laboratory at 
Albert Einstein University at age 10, said: "I'm awestruck. I'm more excited 
than I've ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that G proteins play a critical role in the adrenaline 
response, and noted that when he heard about the award early Monday morning, 
"this very pathway was being activated as my heart was going about 150 beats a 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Rodbell and Gilman made their initial discovery working with the 
adrenaline pathway. The question before scientists in the 1950s was how, when 
adrenaline is released into the bloodstream to produce the classic "fight or 
flight" response, does it produce its effect on individual cells in the body. 
</P>
<P>
 The adrenaline binds to receptors on the surface of cells in much the same way 
that the radio signal from a remote control is captured by the antenna of a 
garage door opener. The two scientists discovered that inside the cellular 
membrane, right next to that receptor, sits a protein, which they named the G 
protein because it binds to a molecule called guanosine triphosphate. 
</P>
<P>
 When adrenaline binds to the receptor, it switches on the G protein, which 
then triggers a cascade of reactions within the cell in the same manner that a 
simple switch in the garage door opener transmits the signal that starts the 
motor that opens the door. After a very short period, the G protein shuts 
itself off, and the cell returns to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scientists have subsequently found that G proteins work throughout the 
body. When light strikes a pigment in the eye, the pigment switches on the G 
protein, which triggers the visual pathway. When an odor molecule binds in the 
nose, it switches on a G protein that activates the process by which a smell is 
recognized. When an endorphin molecule binds to receptors on brain cells, it 
switches on a G protein that produces the "high" sensation when one is elated. 
</P>
<P>
 G proteins have assumed critical importance in recent years as researchers 
have discovered that several of them are produced by oncogenes, genes that 
cause cancer. G proteins produced from these genes trigger cell growth and 
replication in response to a hormone in their environment. But occasionally 
when the gene mutates, in response to a carcinogen perhaps, the G protein loses 
the ability to turn itself off. The affected cells thus continue to replicate, 
producing a tumor. 
</P>
<P>
 Many researchers believe that if they can find a way to mimic the normal 
activity of such G proteins, they can halt tumor growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a fairly safe bet that future G protein research will identify 
more problems that can be linked with malfunctioning of this mechanism," Gilman 
said. Such knowledge, he said, could lead to treatments for a variety of such 
problems. The Prize Winners 
</P>
<P>
 Two Americans won the Nobel Prize in medicine for shedding light on how cells 
communicate and how failures in that communication can cause disease. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE FINDINGS: The scientists determined how a certain group of proteins can 
help transmit and modulate signals in cells, much like a biological 
switchboard. They found that once a cell has received chemical signals by means 
of surface proteins called receptors, G proteins transmit and modify these 
signals within a cell to produce the cell's response. Too many or too few G 
proteins can lead to disease. 
</P>
<P>
 * SOME EXAMPLES: In cholera, toxin from cholera bacteria keeps G proteins 
switched on like a stuck green light. That prevents salt and water from being 
absorbed from the intestines, which can lead to dehydration and death. 
Disturbances in the G proteins also can explain symptoms in tumor diseases, 
alcoholism and even whooping cough. 
</P>
<P>
 * POSSIBLE RESULTS: Knowledge about the communication process inside cells 
should help in designing better drugs for treatment of certain diseases.

STATE SMOG PLAN OFFERED; WILSON ASKS COST STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has requested an economic analysis that could delay a 
sweeping new plan crafted by his air quality staff to clean up California's 
smog by reducing emissions from cars, diesel trucks, consumer products, 
pesticides and other pollution sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed clean air plan, which began arriving Monday on the desks of 
business leaders, environmentalists and local officials, is the vision of the 
state Air Resources Board's staff on how California would meet a federal 
mandate to reduce smog from San Diego to Sacramento over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate over the highly charged clean air issue was scheduled to climax in the 
final days before California voters cast their ballots for governor. The air 
board set its public hearing and vote on the plan for Nov. 9 and 10 -- 
immediately after the election -- in order to comply with a Nov. 15 deadline 
set by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson intervened after receiving a written copy of the plan by urging the 
board's chairwoman to order a full economic report on the proposals -- even if 
it means California will miss Congress' deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The clean air plan "absolutely must be subjected to an independent, outside 
economic analysis," the governor wrote in a letter to ARB Chairwoman Jacqueline 
Schafer dated Saturday. "The hard-working men and women of California -- whose 
jobs are on the line -- deserve nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize that undertaking a thorough economic review may cause a slight 
delay in delivering a complete (plan) to the federal government by Nov. 15," he 
wrote, adding: "It is essential that you take the time necessary to assure that 
our state air plan not only protects California's public health and air quality 
but also protects California jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's request came after more than 100 business organizations in 
California, including the state Chamber of Commerce and the Western States 
Petroleum Assn., called for his Administration to analyze the cost and job 
impact of the staff's proposals as well as alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the federal Clean Air Act passed by Congress in 1990, California must 
submit an approved smog plan by Nov. 15 or the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency is required to start the process of imposing economic sanctions, 
including a freeze on federal highway funds disbursed to the state. In reality, 
the EPA has until mid-January to reply and sanctions would take a year or 
longer to go into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentalists were concerned Monday when they learned of Wilson's 
request from The Times because the ARB staff has been working on the plan for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very disturbing when the executive of the state with the worst air 
quality in the nation is asking his air quality staff to delay compliance with 
federal air quality law," said Cliff Gladstein, president of the Coalition for 
Clean Air, based in Santa Monica. "It seems to reflect a pattern on his part. 
All this past year he has been willing to put off creating sound air quality 
policy in order to avoid deadlines. It is troubling." 
</P>
<P>
 Gladstein said requiring economic assessments is "part and parcel of the 
anti-environmental movement's strategy to undermine environmental laws." The 
vote, he said, was "conveniently placed" after the election, adding that 
improved air quality is being "held hostage by statewide politics." 
</P>
<P>
 California business leaders, however, expressed concern about what they called 
the "fast-track" schedule of the air board because details of the plan were not 
available to most businesses until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty days and one public hearing on a plan that will dictate how my company 
operates in California for the next 15 years is ridiculous," Walt Keeney, 
president of Flour Transport, based in Maywood, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The ARB staff estimates that the costs of state-imposed proposals would reach 
$1.1 billion a year statewide. That does not include additional costly rules 
that would be imposed by local air districts or the federal government. In the 
Los Angeles Basin alone, the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
estimated the cost of smog cleanup regulations at over $5 billion a year, much 
of that for modifying the Southland's transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
 All sides agree that a state-designed air plan is crucial since it would 
relieve California of even-stricter requirements proposed by the Clinton 
Administration's EPA. Wilson called the federal plan "irresponsible and 
devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ARB staff's proposed alternative drew criticism from 
environmentalists, who wanted quicker implementation and more stringent rules, 
and from business leaders, who called it unrealistically stringent. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the ARB staff proposals is a more aggressive mandate for 
California cars to run on alternative fuels, a reduction in fumes from aerosol 
paints and other consumer products such as deodorants and beauty supplies, and 
scrapping programs and financial incentives for removing old vehicles from the 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The ARB staff also proposes a controversial mandate to slash emissions from 
California-based diesel trucks in half by 2002, a standard that would probably 
force use of alternative fuels, and urges the federal government to impose the 
same limits nationwide by 2004. The staff says national standards "are 
essential" because such sources as out-of state trucks would be exempt and 
California-only rules could trigger unfair business competition between cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Titus of the California Trucking Assn. said Monday that truckers are 
opposed to the ARB staff's approach of imposing rules on California trucks two 
years earlier than nationwide. He said truckers also believe that the standard 
is too stringent to be workable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that does not have uniformity nationwide is going to be a concern to 
the trucking industry," Titus said. "We like the concept of a national standard 
that puts all California trucking industry on an equal footing with their 
counterparts in other parts of the nation. What is left to be worked out is 
what standard is workable." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists, however, say awaiting a national rule from the U.S. EPA 
could delay cleanup of pollutants from diesel engines for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 The ARB proposal also contains no plan for tackling the ubiquitous problem of 
solo commuters. Instead, the agency proposes to study basing vehicle 
registration fees on the amount of emissions from the car or miles driven, as 
well as ideas that would penalize drivers who use roads during rush hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan looks to the federal government for substantial help in some areas. 
For aircraft, trains, farm and construction equipment and recreational boats, 
the ARB staff recommends national regulations since those sources come under 
the jurisdiction of the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included in the state plan is a list of about 100 proposed measures 
approved last month by the Los Angeles region's AQMD that mostly tackle 
industrial sources of smog. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists called the state's proposal vague and weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is disappointing," Gladstein said Monday. "The emissions reductions they 
describe are not sufficient to achieve clean air. . . . This document is a 
little weak in what (ARB) can do itself and tries to push off some of that 
responsibility to the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, environmentalists called the diesel truck proposals 
disappointing, saying the state should go much further and move more quickly in 
mandating use of cleaner technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringent rules for trucks, trains and other interstate transportation sources 
have been one of the most controversial parts of California clean air plans 
since they are costly, and technology to replace traditional diesel fuel with 
alternative fuels is largely untested. 
</P>
<P>
 The state plan is designed to meet all of California's requirements for 
cleaning up ozone, the colorless, lung-scarring main ingredient of smog. Six 
areas of California fail to meet health standards for ozone, with the worst 
air, by far, in the basin composed of Los Angeles and Orange counties and parts 
of San Bernardino and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Basin under the federal Clean Air Act has until 2010 to clean 
up ozone. The deadline is 1999 for the San Joaquin Valley and 2005 for Ventura 
County, the southeast desert area, San Diego and the Sacramento metropolitan 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Key to the future of the state's clean air efforts is whether its plan would 
meet the approval of the U.S. EPA and eliminate the need for the federal 
version. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agency was forced to propose its own clean air plan in February 
for the Los Angeles Basin, Ventura County and Sacramento after losing a lawsuit 
with environmentalists, who sued to force the EPA to take over in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal plan has triggered vehement opposition from business groups and 
local and state elected officials, largely over unprecedented proposals to 
regulate airlines, ports, trains and diesel trucks. The EPA then challenged the 
state to come up with a better plan to replace it.

ROLE OF HUFFINGTON'S WIFE BECOMES HOT TOPIC IN RACE; POLITICS: SOME QUESTION 
ACTIVITY IN CONTROVERSIAL CHURCH. SHE SAYS LIBERAL CONSPIRACY TRIES TO 
DISCREDIT HER HUSBAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Those who have known Arianna Huffington would not be surprised at the latest 
tempest she has stirred up. After all, when she was 23, her first book was a 
slap at feminism that brought an international audience of admirers and 
adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as husband Mike Huffington campaigns for the U.S. Senate in California, 
the woman who has often sought the center of attention has found herself there 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 This time Arianna Huffington is the target of accusations that her husband's 
candidacy is more a product of her ideas and her quest for power than his. And 
if so, her critics say, they are suspicious about her background in a 
controversial religious group in which she once served as a minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has captivated the national press and raised questions about when a 
candidate's spouse should become a subject of public scrutiny. Time magazine's 
recent headline about the Republican couple asked, "Should the Huffingtons Be 
Stopped?" Vanity Fair's story in the November issue is titled, "Arianna's 
Virtual Candidate." And earlier this year, the Washington Post headline was 
"Her Brains, His Money." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Arianna Huffington and her role in John-Roger's Church of the 
Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness was lampooned in the "Doonesbury" comic 
strip. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last 10 days, we have had nothing but a barrage of the press piling 
on my wife," Mike Huffington fumed Thursday when the issue was raised by talk 
show host Larry King during his nationally televised debate with Democratic 
rival Sen. Dianne Feinstein. "I'm the candidate, my wife is not the candidate. 
My point is this, my wife's religious beliefs are personal. Why, Dianne, are 
you making my wife's religious beliefs part of this campaign, or are you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein -- whose husband, investor Richard Blum, has sparked controversy in 
past campaigns -- denied that she has encouraged the focus on Arianna 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 But several Democratic officials, notably state party Chairman Bill Press, 
have been calling attention to Arianna Huffington and her religious beliefs. 
Huffington critics and some political observers said the scrutiny is 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is legitimate," said political analyst Sherry Babitch Jeffe. "The fact is, 
she is an integral part of the campaign . . . (and) for a lot of the campaign, 
she was far more visible than the candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Huffington said she is "shocked" to be the target of such scrutiny 
and, particularly, the accusations. In a two-hour interview with The Times at 
the couple's apartment on Los Angeles' Westside last week, Huffington said the 
charges are vastly overblown by a liberal conspiracy aimed at discrediting her 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington downplayed her role in the campaign, saying she serves as a 
surrogate speaker like many other political spouses, but is not a major 
decision maker. 
</P>
<P>
 She also described her role in the John-Roger church, known by its acronym 
MSIA, as a casual one, involving seminars about practical life questions rather 
than religious dogma. She said the organization is certainly not a cult. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics who have worked closely with Arianna Huffington challenge her 
account about both the campaign and the church. They say she has been a major 
force in both. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Monday that five former staff members at the Huffington 
campaign said the candidate's wife was so active that she was essentially 
acting as the campaign manager. They said eight staff members quit their jobs 
because of disagreements with her decision making at the Orange County 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is the one calling the shots and he is nothing more than her puppet," 
said one former member of the Huffington campaign staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Former MSIA ministers told The Times that Arianna Huffington was a devoted 
John-Roger follower for many years. A new book by Peter McWilliams, a former 
MSIA follower now critical of the church, describes Huffington as an active 
organizer who sought new recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 "She embraced it like all of us," said Rick Edelstein, who served as 
administrator of MSIA for five years and participated in the movement for 20 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, 44, a prominent socialite and author before she met her husband, 
said she has not participated in the organization since 1987 when she became a 
born-again Christian after the trauma of a miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she had been on a spiritual search that included MSIA and a number of 
New Age adventures including est, walking on hot coals and a channeling 
experience with actress Shirley MacLaine. Her search is described in her latest 
book, released in May, called, "The Fourth Instinct, the Call of the Soul." 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1987, after we lost the baby, I had a deeply religious experience . . . 
which made my relationship with Jesus Christ the center of my faith," she said. 
"It was the end of my spiritual search. . . . I felt like I was home." 
</P>
<P>
 MSIA was founded in 1971 by Roger Delano Hinkins, a former schoolteacher, who 
awakened from a coma in 1963 after a kidney stone operation and claimed that 
his body had been possessed by the spirit of John the Beloved. Hinkins -- who 
now calls himself John-Roger -- later founded the church as well as a 
foundation that sponsors seminars and a variety of media, education and health 
enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 According to John-Roger's teachings, his body "anchors" a pair of metaphysical 
powers called the Mystical Traveler Consciousness and the Preceptor 
Consciousness, said to exist on Earth only once every 25,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 What has proven most controversial in the Senate campaign is the MSIA teaching 
that the Preceptor Consciousness is of much greater spiritual importance than 
Jesus Christ. Politically, it is a blasphemy that could undercut support for 
the GOP campaign by influential conservative Christian groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arianna Huffington said the whole issue has been distorted, especially 
regarding her beliefs. She said MSIA did not require a religious belief system. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of that stuff about the Mystical Traveler and the Preceptor 
Consciousness, I have no idea what it means," she said. "I'm sure it is in some 
literature. (But) it has never meant anything to me. . . . I never thought I 
had to buy anything lock, stock and barrel because, for me, there was never a 
system of beliefs. I always thought of myself as a Greek Orthodox Christian." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Huffington has told reporters that while he has met John-Roger, he has 
never participated in MSIA and knows little of his wife's involvement with the 
church. They married in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement to The Times, MSIA officials sought to clarify the image of 
their organization portrayed in recent articles about the Senate race. "MSIA is 
a church that provides an authentic spiritual teaching that focuses on Soul 
transcendence," the statement said. "We want to go on record that we strongly 
object to MSIA's being portrayed as a cult." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has convinced some of those most interested -- such as conservative 
Christian leader the Rev. Lou Sheldon -- that she had an authentic born-again 
Christian experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is not a New Ager," said Sheldon, head of Orange County's politically 
active Traditional Values Coalition. "I have sat down with her and spent plenty 
of time talking about her Christian beliefs in Jesus Christ. . . . And I will 
say, Lou Sheldon is very comfortable with his sister in the Lord, Arianna 
Huffington." 
</P>
<P>
 But 12 former MSIA ministers interviewed by The Times, several of whom held 
key positions in MSIA organizations, disputed Huffington's account. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the concept of the Mystical Traveler Consciousness is integral to 
MSIA teachings and is used at virtually every seminar. Former ministers who 
attended MSIA events with Huffington said it was "ridiculous" that the term 
Mystical Traveler would not be meaningful to someone as involved in the church 
as she had been. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said that she met John-Roger in 1974 when she was living in London 
and that in 1978 she became an MSIA minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "Minister sounds like something so different than certainly it was to me," she 
said. "I never preached, I never performed baptisms. I mean, for me it was just 
an inner commitment to ministering -- to making service and helping others. . . 
. It wasn't something I did externally." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at MSIA said in a statement that "a minister has no ranking above or 
below anyone else who is involved, and there is no ranking among ministers." An 
MSIA handbook provided by the organization said that years of study are 
required to become a minister and that many MSIA participants are ministers. It 
adds, "each minister determines for himself/herself what form his/her ministry 
takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the latest attention to Huffington's role in MSIA is due to a book 
about the organization released this month by McWilliams, who said he left MSIA 
earlier this year after being treated for depression. McWilliams is listed as 
co-author of seven books with John-Roger, two of which reached the New York 
Times bestseller list. He is the target of a lawsuit by MSIA in a dispute about 
royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams said that he has known Arianna Huffington since 1979 through MSIA 
and that she is the subject of a chapter in his book. The chapter includes a 
picture of Huffington that is described as her MSIA baptism in the River Jordan 
during a trip to the Middle East. Three other MSIA members who said they were 
along on the trip confirmed McWilliams' account of the baptism. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, however, denied that she was ever baptized in MSIA. And she said 
McWilliams' book is nothing more than sour grapes from a man who is broke and 
trying to make money by capitalizing on the attention given to the Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never baptized for anybody else but the Greek Orthodox Church," Arianna 
Huffington said. "That was another major lie of McWilliams'. . . . There's a 
photograph of me in the River Jordan with two other people, (but) there are 
many people who went in the River Jordan. That's much different than being 
baptized. . . . That doesn't mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
 MSIA officials said the organization's policy is not to comment on individual 
followers. Edelstein, the former MSIA administrator, said he participated in a 
baptism for Arianna in a Los Angeles swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams said he sees signs of MSIA teachings in the Huffington campaign 
themes, particularly the candidate's plan to replace government welfare with 
volunteerism and charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Arianna Huffington said philanthropy in American policy is a concept that 
dates to the Founding Fathers and she denied that it comes from her instruction 
at MSIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The connection between the campaign and MSIA . . . is totally laughable," she 
said. "The intellectual pedigree of (Mike Huffington's) ideas is long and very 
distinguished. . . . There is no religious teacher that does not talk about 
(charitable) service." 
</P>
<P>
 But McWilliams said the idea substantially overlaps a book he co-wrote with 
John-Roger. "It's not that either of the three pillars of their campaign is 
unique to John-Roger," he said. "Some people think the welfare state is 
appalling; some people think we are in the midst of a spiritual revival with 
the coming millennium; some people think that if our taxes are reduced, we will 
all be nicer and give more. . . . But to put them all together -- that's his 
combination." 
</P>
<P>
 McWilliams also challenges Huffington's claim that she has left MSIA, noting 
that she contributed about $35,000 to a John-Roger organization between 1990 
and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who said she regards John-Roger as a friend, said she supports the 
educational mission of the group, Institute for Individual and World Peace, but 
has never given money directly to the MSIA church. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way you get out of cults, the way you become unprogrammed, is that you 
snap," McWilliams said. "It's not a gradual weaning. . . . You have to believe, 
in order to be ordained (in MSIA), that this guy is a spiritual leader higher 
than Jesus Christ. She accepted this when she got ordained, there's no question 
about that. But the point is, you can't just leave that easily when you realize 
the guy behind the curtain is the wizard and the whole thing is done by 
manipulation. At that point, you turn on him because he has abused you."

IRAQ PLEDGES TO PULL BACK; U.S. IS SKEPTICAL, SENDS MORE PLANES; MIDEAST: 
CLINTON SAYS HUSSEIN HAS LIED REPEATEDLY AND THERE IS NO EVIDENCE YET OF TROOP 
WITHDRAWAL FROM KUWAITI BORDER. CALL-UP OF NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES WEIGHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Monday ordered an additional 350 U.S. combat aircraft to 
the Persian Gulf, despite a pledge from Saddam Hussein to pull back his troops 
from Iraq's border with Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that he is bolstering U.S. forces in the region because Hussein 
has repeatedly lied in the past about his intentions and because the United 
States does not yet have intelligence supporting the Iraqi leader's promise to 
withdraw his forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in facts, not promises -- in deeds, not words," Clinton said 
in a six-minute address to the nation Monday evening. "We have not yet seen 
evidence that Iraq's troops are, in fact, pulling back." 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq's U.N. ambassador announced earlier in the day that Baghdad will begin 
withdrawing its estimated 80,000 soldiers from the Kuwaiti border area rather 
than face a military confrontation with the United States over concerns about 
an attack on Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoun told reporters at the United Nations that he 
had notified the Security Council formally that "the instructions have already 
been issued and the troops are already on the move." But he declined to answer 
questions about specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said that the additional aircraft include six long-range 
B-52 bombers, 12 F-117A Stealth fighter-bombers and 36 F-15E ground-attack 
jets, which will be sent to air bases in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Clinton also 
dispatched 42 A-10 Warthog antitank aircraft, 66 F-16 fighters, 18 F-111F 
bombers, 54 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters as well as reconnaissance, 
electronic surveillance and tanker planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest additions will bring the number of U.S. aircraft in the region -- 
including Navy warplanes on the aircraft carrier George Washington in the Red 
Sea -- to 661, a powerful force by any measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Military experts said that the B-52s were sent to allow saturation bombing of 
troops and equipment, while the F-117As and F-15Es would provide added night 
vision and bad-weather capability. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that Clinton also is weighing the call-up of 
National Guard and reserve troops to support the armor and Marine units that 
are en route to the area. In all, the United States could have more than 38,000 
troops in the Persian Gulf by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials, though relieved by the Iraqi announcement of a 
pullback, said it was too early to tell whether Iraq actually had begun 
withdrawing its troops, particularly since it was night in Iraq. One senior 
official said that there were some indications early in the day that additional 
forces were moving toward the Kuwaiti border, rather than away from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of what happened in 1990," Clinton said, referring to Hussein's 
lightning attack on Kuwait in August of that year, "this provocation requires a 
strong response from the United States and the international community. . . . 
We will not allow Iraq to threaten its neighbors or intimidate the United 
Nations." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Administration probably would insist that Hussein move his 
forces back to a "non-threatening" position. But it was not clear whether the 
United States would set a deadline or provide specifics on what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are discussing the parameters of their future behavior" and probably will 
go to the United Nations to seek limits on aggressive Iraqi troop movements, a 
senior White House aide said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Administration official said that U.S. ground troops would stay in the 
region for some time even if Baghdad withdraws its forces. But he added, "I 
don't believe the President has any desire to keep American forces over there 
any longer than necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 The official said that the President is determined to deter an attack or 
defend Kuwait and had not yet focused on what new restraints to try to impose 
on Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton canceled a political trip to New Jersey to remain in Washington to 
discuss the Persian Gulf crisis with his senior national security advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that Clinton spoke by telephone 
with six foreign leaders Sunday and Monday about the Iraq situation, and that 
all were supportive of the U.S. response. 
</P>
<P>
 He also called former President George Bush, who led the 1991 war that drove 
Iraq from Kuwait, to thank him for supporting his actions in the current crisis 
and to say that Bush's pre-positioning of large numbers of U.S. tanks and 
artillery in Kuwait was critical to the swift American response. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spoke Sunday evening with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd. On Monday, Clinton 
spoke with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, French President Francois 
Mitterrand, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, British Prime Minister John Major 
and Turkish Prime Minister Tansu Ciller. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciller, who called Clinton, pledged cooperation but did not grant permission 
to use Turkish airfields to launch U.S. air raids. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials said that U.S. reconnaissance satellites have not picked up 
any signs that Iraqi forces actually had begun to withdraw but that no 
conclusions about this could yet be drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that Iraq's internal communications are more primitive than 
those of the United States and the Iraqi army may not be as responsive as 
Western military organizations. "We don't even know for sure yet that they're 
getting the orders," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Iraqi announcement effectively put on hold this sudden crisis, which began 
in midweek when signs of troops massing near the border alarmed Kuwait and U.S. 
officials. By the time it turned around Monday, Baghdad had massed about 80,000 
troops, many of them fully equipped. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new turn of events also leaves U.S. strategists with a knotty problem 
-- what to do if Hussein decides to taunt the United States by withdrawing his 
forces an inch at a time, forcing Washington to keep its troops in the region 
for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry already has warned that the United States 
will not permit Iraq to force U.S. troops to "linger" in the Persian Gulf area. 
But strategists said that the Pentagon still has not worked out specifics on 
how to enforce that warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Private defense analysts speculated that U.S. forces could prod the Iraqis, if 
necessary, by bombing a command-and-control center or barracks building or by 
taking other steps to punish inadequate response. 
</P>
<P>
 However, military experts said that the United States would have to maintain a 
credible strike force if it takes such action because Iraq could reverse course 
again and move on Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton spent the afternoon conferring with his top national 
security aides -- Perry, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and Gen. John 
M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- but no decisions 
were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, any remaining hope that the Security Council might ease its 
economic embargo against Iraq dimmed further as a U.N. commission prepared to 
recommend that Baghdad be required to meet additional tests on eliminating its 
weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, headed by Swedish diplomat Rolf Ekeus, said that its technicians 
have essentially completed setting up a monitoring system that will enable the 
United Nations to ensure that Iraq does not attempt to rebuild its arsenal and 
praised Baghdad for helping in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, it suggested that the Security Council withhold 
action on lifting the economic embargo until Iraq also has shown definitively 
that it will cooperate in monitoring and verification efforts. And it did not 
say how long the test period should be.

COLUMN ONE; ELEPHANTS POSE GIANT DANGERS; PACHYDERM ATTACKS ARE ON THE RISE, 
CREATING KING-SIZE PROBLEMS FOR ZOOS AND CIRCUSES. SOME BELIEVE THE INTELLIGENT 
MAMMALS ARE REBELLING AGAINST INHUMANE TREATMENT.

<P>
 Two months after an 8,000-pound elephant at the Louisville Zoo tried to do a 
headstand on his chest, Troy Ramsey is willing to forgive the creature that 
left him without a spleen, two-thirds of his pancreas and the ability to earn a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 28-year-old machinist is suing zoo authorities and the pachyderm's 
owner and handler for allegedly losing control of Kenya, the female African 
elephant that attacked him on June 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramsey was visiting the zoo when Kenya wandered away from her barn and, with a 
snap of her trunk, picked him up and smashed him to the ground, then tried to 
gore him with her tusks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't keep an elephant pent up in chains and expect it to be right in the 
head," said Ramsey, who has been studying up on the animals ever since his 
injury. "Elephants are intelligent animals and, knowing they are not in their 
natural environment, don't want to be there. It must be a private hell for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, most elephant owners and managers dismissed such arguments as 
ill-informed, even anthropomorphic. Not any more. Elephant attacks are on the 
rise -- prompting hand-wringing and soul-searching among officials at zoos and 
circuses across the nation over how to better manage these intelligent, 
powerful, moody and misunderstood land giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1976, 21 people -- most of them handlers and trainers in zoos and 
circuses -- have been stomped, crushed or gored to death by elephants in the 
United States, according to a study conducted by the National Zoo in 
Washington. Eight of those fatalities occurred during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 An average year will see at least one of the 600 people who work with 
elephants in the United States killed by one or more of the 600 elephants in 
captivity. Statistically, that makes elephant handling the most dangerous 
profession in the nation -- three times more hazardous than coal mining. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can say with certainty why elephants that have been docile for years 
can suddenly turn against their handlers. And elephant experts, who typically 
establish superiority over these creatures through discipline and a constant 
air of confidence, concede that they do not know what an elephant thinks or how 
to prevent them from hurting humans. 
</P>
<P>
 What they do know about elephants is that they are highly intelligent social 
animals that travel long distances in herds -- a situation that exists nowhere 
in the nation for captive elephants and that no zoo or circus can afford to 
provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing bad publicity, soaring liability costs and increasing calls for better 
safeguards, the latest trend for handlers is to stay behind iron bars and 
gates, with minimal contact with the animals. But this hands-off strategy may 
exacerbate other problems, such as what to do when a captive elephant gives 
birth and then tries to kill its offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are getting out of the high-maintenance, expensive elephant business 
altogether. No wonder. Federal laws banning importation of elephants have 
pushed the average cost of pachyderms, which are frequently traded among zoos, 
circuses and private owners, to $100,000. Liability insurance for an elephant 
runs about $25,000 a year -- double the annual insurance for a 1994 Rolls Royce 
Corniche in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 A zoo or circus without elephants? Some circus officials predict that only the 
largest five circuses will offer performing elephant acts in 10 years. Last 
month, the Mesker Park Zoo in Indiana dropped elephants from its $30-million 
renovation plan because the animals need more room and care than it can afford 
to provide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now asking ourselves: Can we continue to do this? Are we being fair to 
the species?" said Alan Roocroft, chief elephant handler at the San Diego Wild 
Animal Park, who dreams of one day establishing a mega-preserve where the 
climate would permit an unsheltered elephant habitat year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way that elephants are being kept in captivity in a lot of cases is 
contrary to how they should be kept for their well-being," Roocroft said. "If 
they are not allowed to move adequate distances during the day, for example, 
they are not fulfilling their requirements as an organism." 
</P>
<P>
 The results of confinement and deprivation, he added, can include "abnormal 
behavior, physical problems, aggression." 
</P>
<P>
 Some animal-welfare activists say they believe that the nation's aging 
population of elephants, who reproduce only rarely in captivity, are actively 
rebelling against a life of torment at the hands of their taskmasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some elephant handlers say they don't understand why elephants do these 
violent things, but I don't buy it," said Pat Derby, director of a California 
group called the Performing Animal Welfare Society. "Elephants are fighting 
back against the chains, restricted movement, harsh treatment and boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time, elephant owners know that people are watching them more 
closely these days, so they are reluctant to punish their elephants in public," 
she said. "That is opening windows of opportunity for elephants to lash out -- 
it's almost like they know that now is the time to fight back." 
</P>
<P>
 Most zoo curators and circus owners would not go that far. However, John 
Lehnhardt, assistant curator at the National Zoo, acknowledged that "it is 
possible that the aggression that comes to some elephants is motivated by the 
conditions they live in." 
</P>
<P>
 "Physical abuse and dominance-control remain a major method of training 
elephants, but the tide is turning," Lehnhardt said. "Public tolerance of these 
(violent) incidents is changing, and it is the threat of legislation and push 
of animal-welfare advocates that is motivating that change." 
</P>
<P>
 Elephant handlers want to do better too. Yet the most popular tools and 
methods used to discipline elephants in zoos and circuses remain leg chains, 
beatings and the ankus, a sharply pointed hook for prodding in sensitive areas 
of the skin. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1988, five handlers at the San Diego Wild Animal Park disciplined 
an unruly elephant named Dunda by chaining all four of her legs and pulling 
them apart, and then beating her with hickory ax handles above the trunk and 
between the eyes. Dunda, who was moved this year to the Oakland Zoo, now obeys. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation into that highly publicized beating prompted state Sen. Dan 
McCorquodale to sponsor a bill outlawing any method of training or management 
that scars an elephant's skin. The bill became law in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But that law is not enough to ensure that elephants are properly managed or to 
prevent them from developing aggressive tendencies that can escalate into human 
fatalities. As it stands, there is no enforceable standard anywhere for 
elephant management, identifying dangerous pachyderms or evaluating the 
effectiveness of the myriad "elephant programs" touted by zoos and circuses 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a high turnover rate of elephant handlers -- who typically earn a 
few dollars an hour more than minimum wage -- means that elephants in zoos and 
circuses face a constant stream of keepers without the experience or knowledge 
to establish potentially life-saving bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say these problems were brought into high relief on Aug. 20 when a 
panicked female African elephant named Tyke trampled her trainer to death 
during a Circus International performance in Honolulu and then escaped into 
city streets, where she was cut down in a hail of bullets fired by police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 That tragedy, which was recorded on a videotape that horrified television 
viewers around the world, was initially represented by the animal's owners, the 
Hawthorne Corp. of Hawthorne, Ill., as an example of a rogue elephant that 
mysteriously ran amok. 
</P>
<P>
 It was later learned, however, that Tyke had gone wild twice last year on the 
Mainland. One of those rampages left a groom with two broken ribs. An autopsy 
conducted on the trainer, Allen Campbell, 37, found the presence of cocaine and 
alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recent deaths include that of world-famous elephant trainer Axel 
Gautier, who was stomped to death in May, 1993, while visiting the Ringling 
Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus elephant breeding farm in Williston, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, an interpreter with the Moscow State Circus was attacked by an 
elephant and suffered a fractured skull, broken ribs and a punctured lung 
minutes before a planned appearance on the "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee" TV 
show in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1992, an 8,000-pound elephant named Janet charged out of the 
Great American Circus arena in Palm Bay, Fla., carrying two children and an 
adult on her back before she was shot dead by police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Tyke, Janet's carcass was hauled to a local dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these elephants are trying to tell us that zoos and circuses are not 
what God created them for," said Palm Bay Police Officer Blayne Doyle, who 
deeply regrets having had to fire 47 rounds into Janet's head to stop her 
rampage. "But we have not been listening." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no question that the tide is turning. Even circus lobbyist Steve 
Kendall, director of the Animal Husbandry Society and a man some animal-welfare 
activists consider the Darth Vader of the elephant debate, says he believes 
that the time has come for tougher safety restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a problem in the way elephants are being handled in the industry 
now," Kendall said. "We are going to have to come up with tougher standards for 
the care of elephants in captivity. And if that means putting irresponsible 
owners under, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides expect a showdown over the future of captive elephants in what are 
literally questions of life and death for the animals and their keepers. Should 
elephants and their handlers be regulated more closely? Should troublesome 
elephants be taken away from their owners? If so, where should these animals 
go? How much space does an elephant need? If, as some studies suggest, the 
answer is 4 to 10 elephants per square mile, where should such preserves be 
built? Who should pay for them? 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Luvus, owner of the elephant that attacked Ramsey at the Louisville Zoo, 
said: "Elephants learn bad habits from people. It's all in the training." 
</P>
<P>
 Luvus, who contracts with the zoo to operate an elephant ride concession, 
naturally excludes himself from that rule of thumb. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all an accident," Luvus said, standing beside the elephant that has 
been used to give rides at the Louisville Zoo for 10 years. "Kenya doesn't have 
a mean bone in her body. If she did, Troy Ramsey would be dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Luvus has placed Kenya in temporary retirement at the ride concession, where 
she stands in chains swaying back and forth in frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have faith that the elephant community will get through the confusion we 
find ourselves in today -- there is no alternative," said Thomas Otten, 
director of the Point Defiance Zoo in Tacoma, Wash. "We owe it to the people in 
our barns, and to the elephants in managed situations and those left in the 
wilds." 
</P>
<P>
 But the clock is ticking. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the estimated 450,000 elephants left in the wilds of Africa and Asia 
will be nearly extinct within 20 years, most of them victims of the world's 
craving for ivory. With only 10% of the elephants in captivity giving birth, 
the world's zoo and circus population could disappear within 50 years.

CLOSE UP / THE '94 CAMPAIGN; HOUSE PARTIES BRING POLITICS HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Strictly speaking, the party that Sharon and Dan Beauchamp threw in their 
sunny back yard in La Crescenta this weekend was a political event: a "house 
party" to rally support for Gov. Pete Wilson. But to hear some of the guests 
talk, you'd have thought politics was a dirty word. 
</P>
<P>
 One guest, a retired Glendale engineer, expressed his distaste for state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, Wilson's Democratic rival, by noting that "she comes 
from a political family." The engineer's wife made a point of saying she was 
not "a political person" herself -- she just felt strongly about making things 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 Between bites of guacamole, the 40 guests seemed to enjoy the chance to talk 
about their hopes and fears for California's future. ("It's good to hear other 
people's opinions," said one woman. "Sometimes you just think it's you.") And 
more than half the crowd signed up to volunteer for Wilson during the final 
four weeks before the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 But this wasn't politics, said a hairdresser from Tujunga. Or was it? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign house party is a staple of the political season, designed to 
personalize a candidate and make his or her message seem familiar. Not that 
most party-goers actually get to meet the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the primary election, when 500 house parties were held in Brown's 
honor, the candidate attended six. The rest saw a nine-minute videotaped 
biography of the Democrat. Beginning Sunday, when the California Democratic 
Party begins hosting 1,000 house parties to raise money to get out the 
Democratic vote, another videotape will be unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, of the 1,100 pro-Wilson parties that began last weekend throughout 
the state, the Republican incumbent was due to show up at only one -- at the 
Burbank home of a window treatment manufacturer. All the other parties -- which 
were not fund-raisers, Wilson campaign officials stressed -- made do with 
Wilson on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we're leading," Wilson says on his tape. "But there are still people who 
haven't heard our message. . . . Getting out the vote is the key to a winning 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 The tape, which includes testimonials from former Presidents Ronald Reagan and 
George Bush, ends with a clip from Arnold Schwarzenegger, who donned sunglasses 
and a leather jacket to deliver this line: "Gov. Wilson will be back!" 
</P>
<P>
 But viewing a video or shaking the candidate's hand isn't really the point, 
said Larry Berg, director of the Jesse Unruh Institute of Politics at USC. The 
house parties provide a rare opportunity to come together to talk, argue and 
feel something that fewer and fewer Americans feel these days: politically 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've so sanitized the campaigns to the point that they're mostly media ads 
and events that are staged for the purpose of media coverage . . . in which the 
participants are hand selected," said Berg. "There are very few opportunities 
for people to be involved in a meaningful way in a campaign. It's not 
surprising that they tend to tune out." 
</P>
<P>
 Politics, Berg laments, has gotten a bad name. "In point of fact, government 
is politics. Life is politics." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Beauchamp didn't know it, but she was proving Berg's point. Before the 
guests arrived Saturday, she explained how concern about her two sons' 
schooling prompted her to run for the Board of Education in 1979. Back then, 
she admits, "I didn't realize it was politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, four elections later, she is the Glendale school board president. And 
she believes she has learned something that is just as true for statewide 
candidates as for local ones: small, informal gatherings work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever I support, I always have some type of party," she said. "It's that 
personal contact. Even if the candidate doesn't walk door-to-door, people know 
that we have worked together and they can take my word." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only that, they can bounce their words off each other -- which seemed to 
be what Beauchamp's guests enjoyed most of all. Sure, Schwarzenegger's 
testimonial got a few laughs -- especially when Warren Boehm, who owns a La 
Crescenta insurance agency, noted that just last week, the tough-guy actor had 
endorsed a Democrat: Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there was a little arm-twisting there," Boehm said with a wink. 
(Schwarzenegger is married to Maria Shriver, Kennedy's niece). 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, though, they talked about issues within the context of their own 
lives. On the economy, the Tujunga hairdresser offered this: If you think 
beauticians are exempt from the recession, think again. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are stretching their haircuts out for a couple of extra weeks," she 
said, shaking her well-coiffed head. "We're down in the basement and it'll be a 
while before we're upstairs again." 
</P>
<P>
 On illegal immigration, the retired engineer said that while he supports 
Wilson, he opposes Proposition 187, a Wilson-backed ballot measure that seeks 
to deny state benefits such as public schooling and non-emergency health care 
to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's fair to put the onus on school districts to figure out 
who's legal and illegal," he said, referring to a provision that would require 
teachers to report suspected illegals. "The teachers have got to take care of 
the kids. I know what they're trying to do -- this is the most expeditious 
thing to cut funds. But that doesn't make it right." 
</P>
<P>
 On modern campaigning, many said the dollars that candidates spend on 
television advertising should be limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a disgrace," said a semi-retired secretary from Eagle Rock, who found 
the relentless on-air contest between Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike 
Huffington particularly disturbing. "They could be helping out the poor people 
(with that money)." Political Scorecard

SETBACKS SLOW CLEANUP OF HUGE OIL SPILL; ENVIRONMENT: UNOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES 
DENY CHARGES THAT THEY HAVE BUNGLED THE MASSIVE PROJECT NEAR A BEACH IN SAN 
LUIS OBISPO COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What was once a beautiful sandy beach is now a huge pit of tainted water, 
dubbed Lake Unocal by cleanup crews. Nearby, enough contaminated sand has been 
piled in giant mounds to fill a line of dump trucks 67 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the signs of progress in the massive effort to clean up California's 
biggest oil spill -- which Unocal Corp. has admitted was the result of leaking 
underground pipes and mismanagement at its Guadalupe oil field south of San 
Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the company's $12-million commitment to the emergency effort, the 
month-old cleanup has suffered a series of setbacks -- including the discovery 
of three times as much contaminated sand as originally expected. Now, the 
project has fallen so far behind schedule it is threatened by coming winter 
storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials, the Sierra Club and other environmental critics contend that 
the cleanup has been bungled by Unocal and the government agencies overseeing 
it: the U.S. Coast Guard and the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 They maintain that the cleanup method being used will not remove all the 
contamination from the beach and could cause greater problems by damaging 
nearby sand dunes. Some critics contend that it represents the worst blemish on 
Gov. Pete Wilson's environmental record during his four years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm convinced that the cure is worse than the disease, and I believe it is 
because of political motivations that this cure was chosen," said San Luis 
Obispo County Supervisor Bud Laurent, a former biologist with the state 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 But state and federal officials maintain that the emergency cleanup has been a 
success so far and deny that politics has played any part in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 They concede that there is no way that they can meet their original Oct. 15 
deadline for cooking the oil out of the sand, putting the clean sand back in 
the pit and installing a permanent underground barrier to stop pollution from 
reaching the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say their aggressive effort to dig up the plume of petroleum thinner 
that once flowed under the beach has succeeded in preventing the kind of leaks 
into the ocean that have plagued the site for at least eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to get this stuff out of the environment and keep it from entering 
marine waters," said Fish and Game lawyer Steve Sawyer. "We would think the 
rapid removal of the material would be the environmentalist position." 
</P>
<P>
 Added state Resources Agency spokesman Andy McLeod: "Nobody has proposed any 
other alternative to deal with the immediate threat. The idea that this (method 
of cleanup) could be done for political reasons is ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Central Coast, there is widespread anger at Unocal for polluting the 
ocean and ground water at a variety of locations and then not telling the 
public. In some quarters, any action that Unocal takes is greeted with 
skepticism, if not outright hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 At the aging oil field amid the Guadalupe dunes, Unocal has admitted leaking 
as much as 8.5 million gallons of diluent, a petroleum thinner used to help 
pump heavy crude out of the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "The diluent shouldn't be there, and we're justifiably criticized for the fact 
that it's there," said Unocal President John Imle in a telephone interview from 
Indonesia. "No matter how we try to fix it, there are going to be some people 
who are going to criticize it." 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials have been embarrassed by revelations that employees failed 
to report spills as required by law and actively sought to cover up the 
incidents as far back as 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Unocal pleaded no contest to three misdemeanor pollution 
charges and was fined $1.5 million. The company apologized for its actions and 
promised to clean up the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal's cover-up was disclosed after a lengthy investigation by the 
Department of Fish and Game. The state is suing Unocal for more than $500 
million for spilling diluent into the ocean and ground water and then failing 
to take proper action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stuck our neck out a long time ago to make people realize this is one of 
the biggest environmental cases of all time," said Sawyer, the Fish and Game 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 31 separate plumes of contamination have been found on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the spilled diluent is floating on ground water beneath the oil field. 
However, one plume that flows steadily to the ocean has been responsible for 
repeated marine spills dating back at least to 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 During winter storms, when the water table is high and waves wash away much of 
the beach sand, the plume of smelly petroleum fluid flows into the ocean, 
contaminating fish and posing a health hazard to people, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to stop the migrating diluent, including construction of an 
underground barrier and the installation of wells on the beach to pump out the 
fluid, were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of spills in January and April, the U.S. Coast Guard, state 
officials and Unocal agreed that it was time to take emergency action to 
prevent further pollution of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step was construction of an elliptical cofferdam 820 feet long and 
250 feet across on the beach just above the high tide line. The dam was 
designed to cut off the leading edge of the diluent plume under the beach and 
keep out the ocean on one side and hold back the rest of the contaminated plume 
on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the cofferdam, crews and heavy equipment, working around the clock, dug 
down four feet below sea level to remove the sand and as much of the 
contamination as possible, creating a lake of tainted ground water. Last week, 
cleanup crews continued to skim diluent from the surface in an effort to remove 
as much contamination as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step -- which is just beginning -- is to clean the sand using a 
process known as thermal desorption, in which the sand is heated in giant 
revolving kilns until the diluent is vaporized and burned. 
</P>
<P>
 A drawback to the process is that it can change the color of the sand, turning 
it pink, gray or black. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the sand is clean, it will be put back into the hole to hold in place a 
permanent 22-foot-deep underground wall made of plastic that is intended to 
block the flow of contaminated ground water. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to meet their deadline of Saturday, officials are racing against time 
and hope to have enough clean sand to install the plastic wall by Nov. 15 in 
advance of storms that could wash out the temporary metal cofferdam. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup has been slowed by a number of factors, including the discovery of 
220,000 tons of contaminated sand that had to be removed. Officials had 
expected just 75,000 tons. And the sand cookers, which were supposed to be in 
place Sept. 1, were still being assembled last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup officials encountered the wrath of environmentalists for their 
proposal to "borrow" sand from dunes near the site to install the underground 
wall. But they quickly backed off from that proposal and are now considering 
using dune sand only if it is needed in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club, the local group Eco-SLO and other environmental critics have 
accused the Coast Guard and the Wilson Administration of rushing into the 
excavation without conducting proper environmental reviews and considering 
other cleanup options. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Unocal officials) have given the regulatory agencies a menu choice of 
one: Dig it up or let us keep polluting," said Michael Fischer, executive 
director of the State Coastal Conservancy. "Neither of those choices in our 
view is acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say that the heavy equipment used in the emergency cleanup has the 
potential of damaging sand dunes and that the operation has spread diluent into 
new areas of the oil field. 
</P>
<P>
 They also contend that the cleanup will not be effective because some residual 
amounts of contamination will remain in the excavated site. Some go so far as 
to suggest that continued ocean pollution should have been tolerated for the 
sake of doing a proper environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they say, the Wilson Administration went ahead with the current plan 
to give the appearance that it was acting quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst showing of the Wilson Administration on any environmental 
matter," said Sierra Club attorney Mark Massara. "This is going to make the 
whole damage and spill worse than they originally were." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists find support for their point of view in a report done for 
San Luis Obispo County by the consulting firm Fugro West Inc., which concluded 
that some contaminated material would be left behind and eventually leak into 
the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unlikely that the emergency remedial action, even if successful, will 
prevent further releases to the environment," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Fugro chemist Rod Farrell said that the study was being misused by 
critics and that the amount of contaminated material that may be left on the 
beach is minute compared to what has been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing a very good job," Farrell said. "There is a possibility of 
releasing very minor amounts. It has been a very successful project." 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal, state and federal officials say the amount of environmental harm 
caused by the emergency cleanup is negligible compared to the damage that would 
have resulted from ocean pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of the oil field pollution, which does not pose such an 
immediate threat, will be the subject of detailed environmental review before 
cleanup begins there, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very unfortunate that gubernatorial politics is being brought 
into this," said Imle, Unocal's president. "I can't imagine how Gov. Wilson 
could be seen as manipulating this, how he could have any blame or kudos 
either. It was a longstanding situation and he just happened to be governor."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; WILSON SAYS HE WOULD SEEK BROADER DEATH 
PENALTY; HE WOULD INCLUDE FATAL DRIVE-BY SHOOTINGS AND CARJACKINGS AS CAPITAL 
OFFENSES. BROWN DISTRIBUTES COPIES OF ECONOMIC PLAN FOR THE STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson lashed out at his favorite targets Monday -- criminally 
violent "thugs" -- and vowed that a priority of a second Wilson term would be 
to expand the death penalty in California to drive-by shootings and 
carjackings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I believe that it is a penalty that fits the crime," Wilson said during 
an appearance in Chatsworth. "If you take a life, you should be prepared to pay 
for it with your own." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson never mentioned by name his Democratic foe, but he nevertheless gave 
state Treasurer Kathleen Brown both barrels of his top reelection assault 
weapon -- the crime issue -- with just four weeks to go to the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 In case there was any possible confusion, another speaker came bluntly to the 
point about Brown's pledge to enforce California's capital punishment law even 
though she personally opposes the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendell Phillips, on hand as vice president of the California Coalition of Law 
Enforcement Assns. to endorse Wilson, said that enforcement is "not the 
governor's job," but belongs to the police and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips added: "We can't have somebody in the governor's office who can fudge 
on the death penalty. The death penalty is not a fudgeable issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown campaigned in Northern California Monday, taking her printed 62-page 
economic plan to meetings with mayors and other local officials in Sacramento 
and to supporters at a campaign office in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The voters deserve to know how their next governor is going to lead this 
state," Brown said in a statement. "My written economic plan lays out in full 
detail exactly how I plan to turn California around. Pete Wilson's only plan is 
a political plan for reelection." 
</P>
<P>
 In Chatsworth, the setting for Wilson's event was a familiar trademark of his 
campaign: A stern, tight-lipped governor standing at a podium surrounded by law 
enforcement officers, prosecutors, victims of crime and members of their 
families. Wilson wore a green ribbon in his lapel to signify sympathy with 
crime victims. There were two American flags and a banner saying: "No more 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the venue was an area that has organized a spirited Neighborhood 
Watch program to combat gang crime in cooperation with the Devonshire division 
of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson walked down one long block chatting with residents and commending them 
for their volunteer spirit and cooperation. The podium, flags and banner were 
set up in front of the home at the end of the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he was "humbled" by their work, and their support of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he talked about how he was able to harness the power of people's 
discontent to win breakthrough anti-crime legislation this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year -- long, long overdue -- we were able to focus the outrage, the 
fear, the frustration of some 32 million Californians," Wilson said. "Whatever 
their differences, they had a common bond. They demanded to be heard in the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, we had a legislative session that gave meaning to the word 'justice' 
in the phrase 'criminal justice system,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson cited passage of the "three-strikes" bill to lengthen sentences for 
repeat offenders, the "one-strike" bill to do the same with convicted rapists 
and child molesters and bills to limit prisoners' rights, reduce time off for 
good behavior, and to keep criminals from profiting from their crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also sought, but failed to get, measures to extend the death penalty to 
drive-by shooters and carjackers when their actions take the lives of 
unintended victims. Brown had said she would personally vote against such 
measures, but would back them if they became law. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also said he would seek legislation to make the most violent 
criminals serve their full sentences, with no time off for good behavior, and 
tougher time for parole violators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to continue the reform . . . until every Californian enjoys the 
fundamental right to live free of the fear of crime," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the event was Mike Rice, the Brown campaign research 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 While Wilson talks tough, Rice said, his Administration has hurt law 
enforcement because of budget cuts -- 1,600 overall, including 400 California 
Highway Patrol officers. At the same time, there are 14,000 parolees at large, 
including 30 convicted murderers and 500 rapists and child molesters, Rice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see Gov. Wilson's plan for catching these thugs," Rice said. 
"Then I'll listen to his rhetoric."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION; CANDIDATES STAY IN 
MIDDLE OF ROAD ON ISSUES; MAUREEN DIMARCO AND DELAINE EASTIN ARE BOTH DEMOCRATS 
WHO SHARE VIEWS ON KEY ISSUES, SO THE CAMPAIGNS CENTER ON LEADERSHIP, 
EXPERIENCE AND INDEPENDENCE. A POLL FINDS 70% OF ELECTORATE UNDECIDED.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Early in the little-noticed fall campaign for the state's top education job, 
the moderator of a radio debate between the two candidates hit the nail on the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fair to say the voters don't know either of you very well," 
Warren Olney, host of KCRW's "Which Way, L.A.?" public affairs program, said in 
kicking off the mid-September segment. "Tell us what difference it would make 
if you were elected rather than your opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 With those two sentences, Olney summed up the challenges facing Assemblywoman 
Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, and 
Maureen DiMarco, the governor's education adviser and a former school board 
member in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are members of the education Establishment in California and emerged as 
the top vote-getters in the June primary for the nonpartisan post of 
superintendent of public instruction, albeit by slim margins. Eastin, who spent 
about $1 million on her primary campaign, received 22.5% of the vote; DiMarco, 
who spent less than $100,000, got 13.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls taken over the summer and as recently as last month showed that neither 
has sparked much enthusiasm among voters. According to Mervin Field's 
California Poll, DiMarco and Eastin were dead even at 21% in a July survey of 
likely voters, with more than half those polled undecided. By mid-September, 
Eastin may have narrowly led DiMarco (17% to 13%, but pollsters said those 
figures could be off by 4.5% in either direction) and those in the "undecided" 
column had risen to 70%. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign consultants on both sides attribute the dismal numbers to their 
candidates' relatively low visibility to date. Both women focused on fund 
raising over the summer and have only recently begun engaging in debates and 
other campaign stump activities. Neither has yet begun television advertising, 
but both plan to in a state where TV is considered crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kirst, a Stanford University education professor and co-director of 
Policy Analysis for California Education, a university-based think tank, said 
the campaigns also are hampered by the fact that it is hard for voters to 
discern clear ideological differences between the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a case of liberal versus conservative, not a case where one of 
the candidates wants to dismantle public education, not even like it was in the 
primary, where we had more of a range," Kirst said. "The voters chose 
candidates in the middle, not from the fringes." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also hard to say what role either candidate would carve for herself in a 
state where so many have a hand in making education policy, Kirst added. 
Although the superintendent runs the 2,200-employee Department of Education and 
disburses the $29 billion spent on California schools, there are many other 
players -- from the Legislature, the governor and his appointed State Board of 
Education and the powerful California Teachers Assn. to local school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much depends on what the rest of the constellation she is elected with 
looks like. . . . In California, there is no such thing as an education czar," 
Kirst said. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates agree on several key issues, including the need to overhaul 
schools, hold students to higher academic standards and give local voters 
broader taxing authority. Both also oppose Proposition 187, which would bar 
illegal immigrant children from the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin's campaign is pushing the assemblywoman's experience in the Legislature 
(she was first elected in 1986), her community college teaching stint and her 
work as a corporate planner for Pacific Telesis as qualifications for helping 
reshape the 5.2-million-student public education system. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really about who can provide the best leadership," Loretta Lynch, 
Eastin's campaign manager, said in outlining her candidate's four main themes 
-- school reform, increased parental and business involvement, modernized 
campuses and higher academic standards and achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Smith, the Republican consultant hired by Democrat DiMarco over the 
summer, has emphasized a "nonpartisan, nonpolitical" approach, trying to 
position his candidate as an independent thinker who has proved she can work 
with people on both sides of the political aisle. 
</P>
<P>
 Her campaign also touts DiMarco's long involvement in public schools, first as 
a volunteer in her two daughters' classrooms, followed by service on a local 
Orange County school board, as president of the California School Boards Assn. 
and consultant to then-state Supt. Bill Honig before Republican Gov. Pete 
Wilson appointed her secretary of child development and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election will be won by the candidate perceived as the most independent 
and the one best able to bring about change in the system," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the relative lack of activity, the contest has grown increasingly 
combative. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin has tried to pin on DiMarco the governor's tightfisted record on school 
spending during his recession-plagued term, saying the Administration "cares 
more about prisons than schools." She recently accused DiMarco of playing to 
the right wing by successfully urging the governor to veto continuation of the 
pioneering but trouble-plagued California Learning Assessment System testing 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco said the bickering Legislature, including Eastin, is a big part of the 
schools' problem and called for giving local districts more authority to run 
their affairs. "The Legislature has controlled schools far too long," DiMarco 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also accused Eastin of being beholden to some of her major contributors, 
the state's organized labor unions, including the California Teachers Assn. 
DiMarco said Eastin, at CTA's behest, tried to water down the state's charter 
school law, based on a popular reform movement that frees individual schools 
from most state and local regulations so they can better meet student needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin, however, said her objection to raising the limit on the number of 
charters granted was based solely on her belief that the 2-year-old charter 
system should be more thoroughly evaluated before allowing large numbers of 
schools to steer their own courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin continues to hold the edge in fund raising, according to financial 
reports filed last week. Her campaign has raised slightly more than $1.6 
million, including $644,000 between July 1 and Sept. 30. The campaign had about 
$274,000 on hand at the end of the latest reporting period. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the financial statements showed that DiMarco's campaign has 
received $232,312, including $126,260 between July 1 and Sept. 30. The campaign 
had less than $83,000 on hand at the end of last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor has recently begun helping raise money for DiMarco, who 
entered the race relatively late last year. Her campaign expects to be able to 
buy "significant" amounts of television advertising time in the final stretch 
before the Nov. 8 election.

HAITIANS' GLEE OVERFLOWS AT RESIGNATION; REACTION: TAUNTS AND EPITHETS GREET 
CEDRAS' SPEECH. BUT ONLOOKERS INSIST THEY NOW WANT PEACE, NOT VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All of the inhibitions created by three years of frightening military rule 
evaporated instantly in the searing sun Monday as thousands of Haitians 
watching the resignation of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras took delight in taunting the 
hated army, its commander and its network of killers. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Cedras delivered his farewell speech at military headquarters, the 
crowd simply drowned him out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thieves!" "Murderers!" "Put handcuffs on Cedras! Tie him up!" they shouted as 
American military police struggled to prevent the demonstrators from rushing 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is evil, and he has to go," cried Paul Emile Laurent, 68. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotionally charged crowd hurled epithets, sang curses and roared in 
disapproval when Cedras appeared under the watchful escort of U.S. commander 
Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could hear Cedras speak -- no one wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 A clearly demoralized Haitian military looked on, several officers seated at 
some distance on each side of the podium where Cedras spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 " Zenglendo !" the crowd jeered, using a Creole term for the most dreaded 
hoodlum in existence. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Cedras departed the scene of humiliation, Haitians hurled stones at 
his jeep. His bodyguards opened fire from the vehicle, sending two bursts of 
automatic gunfire into the humid air. Hundreds of Haitians and a few reporters 
dived for cover. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "How dare Cedras speak to the people after all he has done to us?" said 
mechanic Edy Thellenge, 26, who like many began gathering early on the grassy 
Champs de Mars mall, between the military headquarters and the Presidential 
Palace, to witness the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, something that had been promised for so long was actually happening, 
and it seemed to unleash a euphoria so long pent-up that some fear it could 
turn violent. But in this crowd, at least, people said they want peace, not 
violence. They want security and jobs in an impoverished country where prices 
and unemployment soared during three years of dictatorship and an international 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now Titid will return," said Jean Claude Israel, 39, using Aristide's 
nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 "We voted for Aristide, not Cedras. Cedras is not doing anything for us. He is 
only killing our people. . . . We still have no money and we are not eating, 
but we can be here today. Before we would not be here. Before we would not 
speak." 
</P>
<P>
 One boy climbed a nearby palm tree, hoisting a flag of red stripes and blue 
stars with an election-poster picture of Aristide stuck to it. A group of 
demonstrators ran around the military headquarters carrying a huge American 
flag and holding aloft a live rooster, the symbol of Aristide's party. 
</P>
<P>
 Others performed pantomime. In one skit, a man dressed in an army jacket was 
given a suitcase and shown the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras' powerful wife, Yannick, watched the crowd impassively from the 
second-floor balcony of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "They killed many people, but now that Aristide will come back, the military 
won't be allowed to show off anymore," said Jean Joseph Mital, a 46-year-old 
barber. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone shared that optimism. Mimose Isidor came to the Cedras ceremony 
to see the man she blames for the murder of her husband, a driver who worked 
for Aristide's Cabinet and was shot to death soon after the coup that ousted 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still afraid because nothing is clear yet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Magalie George, 35, a high school teacher, was also skeptical about the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is justice, there may be no more violence," she said. "If there is 
no justice, then they will use tires. That is their weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 She was referring to a practice in which burning tires are put around enemies' 
necks, a killing technique known to have been utilized by Aristide supporters 
in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. military, which escorted Cedras to and from Monday's ceremony, was on 
duty protecting the hated commander. Five Humvees were parked at the end of a 
road leading to his elegant hilltop house to prevent crowds from reaching it. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of how fast the authority of the Haitian military is collapsing came 
about an hour before the ceremony. Huge crowds of demonstrators and journalists 
had descended to within a few feet of the military headquarters' front door, 
and the Haitian army repeatedly ordered them back. The crowd ignored the 
orders. 
</P>
<P>
 A Haitian officer, G. R. Gabriel, took to the megaphone, imploring people to 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would not want people to think we aren't civilized, so please move back," 
he said. The crowd hooted at that. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a group of about 10 U.S. military police arrived and ordered the people 
to move back, and the people complied immediately.

LAW ENFORCEMENT; NEW YORK CITY THINS ITS RANKS OF PAUNCHY POLICE; DECLINING 
FITNESS STANDARDS HAVE LED TO MORE CORPULENT COPS. NYPD TRIES TO KEEP OFFICERS 
FROM REACHING FOR THEIR DOUGHNUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The sight was so painful that Police Commissioner William Bratton viewed the 
videotape for just a moment before ordering it turned off. A group of police 
academy trainees was trying to climb a five-foot-high wall. But they were so 
out of shape that none could make it over. 
</P>
<P>
 Some New York City police officers are so weak that they very well may be 
unable to pull the trigger of their service revolver, department personnel 
specialists say. The alternative in a shootout: Duck? Run for cover? Shout 
"Bang, bang?" 
</P>
<P>
 The enemy is not muggers or murderers but the munchies -- doughnuts, danish 
and other high-fat foods -- which, when combined with stress and a sedentary 
lifestyle, can produce paunchy police. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not limited to New York. In recent years, because of equal 
opportunity laws, emphasis on diversity and civil service regulations, fitness 
standards to enter many police academies have declined. Once an officer is 
appointed to the force, union contracts and civil service rules often preclude 
police chiefs from keeping cops in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you have been accepted in the civil service and in the strong unions 
that are in place, it's almost impossible to force officers to solve their 
weight problems," said Gerald Arenberg, executive director of the National 
Assn. of Police Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 How out of shape are some police? One study, Arenberg said, looked at who was 
in the best condition -- police officers, firefighters or a group of convicts. 
The prisoners finished first. The firefighters second. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitness entrance standards at New York's police academy eroded so badly during 
the late 1980s that they had become almost nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 If a recruit failed physical training, no problem. Punishment consisted of 
being banned from attending graduation ceremonies at Madison Square Garden and 
perhaps an additional month of working out in the academy's gym. 
</P>
<P>
 If the rookie still couldn't make the grade, no problem. The officer was sent 
to a precinct anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 One result of this policy shows up in statistics. Line-of-duty injuries are 
running about 14,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 And just why do so many police eat so much? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a feeling of loss of control in the job. It is reflected not only in 
eating but in alcohol abuse and the suicide rate and family disturbances," said 
Harvey Schlossberg, a clinical psychologist for the Port Authority of New York 
and New Jersey who has treated many police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "One feels helpless in controlling one's environment. The one thing I can 
control is I can eat what I want and no one can stop me. . . . Eating is 
comforting. It is secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of police work is sporadic, with periods of high physical activity 
interspersed with stretches of boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do between calls? You eat," Schlossberg said. "You go for the 
quick-to-go foods, which are high in fat content and sugar and super-duper 
calories. Because of the anxiety, you are in a state of readiness. You always 
anticipate something happening, and that makes you hungry, increases your need 
for blood sugar. You are always snacking something or chewing something." 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians say obesity can reduce respiratory capacity and cause 
cardiovascular complications. It can lead to a variety of orthopedic injuries, 
including lower back pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this background enters Bratton, who was appointed commissioner by New 
York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani when he took office this year. Bratton's 
predecessor, Raymond Kelly, began the process of firming up the force of 
28,000. But the effort has accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Bratton only a moment to register his disgust at the videotape of a 
group of rookies at the bottom of the academy class. Not only did it show the 
would-be cops unable to climb the wall, but it also revealed recruits unable to 
finish a 1 1/2-mile run and do simple exercises such as sit-ups. The 
commissioner ordered recruits who had excess body fat to report to a hospital 
for more precise screening. More than a dozen failed and were fired for being 
unable to meet academy standards. They have filed lawsuits, which are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrance requirements to the academy also have been toughened. The new test 
measures body fat vs. muscle tissue, aerobic stamina and trigger-pulling 
ability, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "All officers have to go through training every six months to fire a gun," 
said Sgt. John Enterno. "However, there are some officers who consistently have 
problems. Every year when they come back, they do not have the necessary 
strength, and they have to work their hand up to the ability to pull the 
trigger the requisite number of times." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in times of stress, hunger gnaws. One officer, during the overnight 
shift when most restaurants are closed, became so famished he chewed up a 
bouillon cube he found in his patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did it taste like?" other police officers asked. "Ten chickens," the 
cube-chomping cop said. Getting Fit 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the three main requirements that applicants must pass before 
admission into the police academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Body composition 
</P>
<P>
 The NYPD's minimum standard is: For men: 22.2% body fat For women: 29.2% body 
fat Cardiovascular endurance: Candidates must run 1 1/2 miles in 16 minutes and 
48 seconds. Trigger pull: Candidates must be able to pull the trigger of a 
revolver 16 times with arms fully extended and without support from the other 
hand.

POLICY; U.S. TO FIGHT WILDFIRES WITH FIRE AS PART OF NEW STRATEGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a deadly summer of wildfires, and with California's unpredictable fire 
season ahead, federal officials are planning a new strategy for battling blazes 
that includes one of the oldest tricks in the book: fighting fire with fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials last week told legislators that land managers must make greater use 
of controlled burns -- fires set deliberately to get rid of underbrush and 
dying vegetation -- if they are to restore the environmental health of forests 
and curtail the kinds of wildfires that consumed 2.2 million acres of the West 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 To do so, they must overcome such obstacles as poor funding, environmental 
statutes and public skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Smokey Bear message for 50 years has been very effective -- fire is bad," 
said Joseph Douglas, director of the Interior Department's office of hazard and 
fire programs coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have to add another dimension to it -- that fire can be good if it's 
used in the right place at the right time," Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, a state interagency fire strategy team is due to release a 
report this month recommending that tens of thousands of acres of forests and 
other wild lands should be treated annually with preventive burning. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the problem has been building up, literally, on forest floors 
for almost a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Before settlers pushed into the West, fires were a regular feature. They 
helped return nutrients to the soil, and their frequency ensured that forest 
fires did not have enough fuel to burn very hot. Although lightning caused many 
fires, Native Americans also set fires, helping create prime habitats for the 
kinds of plants and animals that they relied on for food and warmth. 
</P>
<P>
 A century of settlement, however, has made fire less frequent and left the 
West's forests more combustible, officials said. The buildup of flammable 
material is far more likely to fuel an out-of-control inferno so hot it can 
leave the soil sterile. 
</P>
<P>
 That factor has contributed to the loss of lives and the cost of fighting 
fires: 27 federal firefighters have died fighting 77,000 fires in the West this 
year. The cost of fighting fires on national forest lands this year is likely 
to top $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning forest conditions to those seen at the start of the century could 
take many years, said James Lyons, assistant secretary of agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 First, diseased and dying timber would have to be sold and harvested at a more 
aggressive rate. Only then could controlled burning take place. Lyons said such 
treatment, including preventive burns, in Angeles National Forest could 
significantly affect controlling fire in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the legions of people who have been drawn to the West's natural 
beauty may be the principal obstacle to using controlled burns to fight fires 
that could destroy large swaths of the region, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A large fear for residents is that preventive fires will burn out of control 
and claim their homes and investments. Although federal fire officials concede 
that is a risk, they warn that to rule out preventive fires could open 
homeowners to greater risks later. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, housing developments at the edges of the West's cities have 
pushed into overgrown forest areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Armstrong, assistant interior secretary, and others have said the federal 
government needs to encourage state and local officials to adopt building codes 
that include bans on wood shake and shingle roofs and stronger brush-clearing 
requirements -- as the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors have done. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal fire officials also face a shortage of funds to clear dead and dying 
trees from public lands and conduct preventive blazes. Prompted by this 
summer's fires, Congress has nudged out a $156.5-million budget for "fuel 
depletion," up by $3 million for fiscal 1995. But the Congressional Research 
Service estimates it would cost $3.5 billion to clear and burn flammable debris 
from 10% of federally owned forests in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, fire officials must consider the Clean Air Act, which allows little 
latitude for open burning. The Clinton Administration has opened discussions 
with the Environmental Protection Agency to try to negotiate waivers for 
controlled burns.

BUILDUP IN THE PERSIAN GULF; KUWAITIS SKEPTICAL OF IRAQI PULLBACK CLAIM; 
SECURITY: OFFICIALS SAY ONLY PROOF WILL SATISFY THEM. THEY ALSO WANT U.S. TO 
HELP ENSURE THEIR LONG-TERM SAFETY.

<P>
 Kuwait reacted with sharp skepticism Monday to Iraq's declaration that it was 
pulling its troops back from their tense border, and warned that such a move 
alone would not be enough to end the new Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they pulled back their forces a few kilometers to the north, they could 
come back in a couple of days," said Saud al Sabah, Kuwait's information 
minister. "This is a cat-and-mouse game with us, and we can't tolerate it. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot, and the international community cannot, take these statements 
seriously. We will believe them when we see them. . . . We want to see facts 
taking place on the ground and corroborated by satellites and intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmed Hamoud al Sabah, the defense minister, said neither his forces nor U.S. 
intelligence had any evidence that Iraqi troops, put at 80,000 men with 700 
tanks, had started to withdraw to positions deeper inside Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwait, however, wants more than just an Iraqi retreat, officials said as they 
evaluated Baghdad's latest statements, for that would do little to ensure the 
oil-rich emirate's long-term security. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saddam Hussein has shown that he can put a gun to our heads anytime he 
wants," a member of the Kuwaiti Parliament said after a lengthy closed-door 
discussion of security preparations. "It's really not enough that he didn't 
pull the trigger today. We want to know that he won't pull it tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheik Saad al Abdullah al Sabah, the crown prince and prime minister, had told 
the emergency session of Parliament that Kuwaitis need not fear a repetition of 
Iraq's 1990 brutal seizure and occupation of their country -- that the world 
would not permit another takeover. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military situation has changed a lot in Kuwait's favor, and it will 
continue doing so in coming hours," Saad said as the first 300 combat troops 
from the U.S. Army's 24th Mechanized Division arrived here by air from Ft. 
Stewart, Ga., and American and British warships took up positions in the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by the Clinton Administration's tough line, Kuwaiti officials said 
they will press Secretary of State Warren Christopher when he arrives here 
Wednesday for a strategy that will ensure Kuwait's long-term security without 
establishing a large and permanent U.S. presence in the Gulf, without 
subjecting Washington to the vagaries of Iraqi policies and without requiring 
costly troop deployments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later we have to get rid of this dictator," the prince said of 
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. "The whole international community would like 
to get rid of Saddam Hussein." 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials stressed the need for measures that would prevent Iraq from 
escalating tensions as it has this week -- or at least punish it for doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Iraq can cause an international crisis by such so-called maneuvering its 
forces within its borders, then there must be restraints on such actions," a 
senior Kuwaiti diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have said all this before, but perhaps now the dangers are clearer to 
everyone. This is what we will put before Christopher." 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state will meet here with the foreign ministers of Saudi 
Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as well as Kuwait on 
Wednesday as part of his visit to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his stop here was intended to show U.S. solidarity for Kuwait in the 
current crisis, the six Arab states would like to transform that support into a 
permanent deterrent to Iraq. Kuwait also hopes, diplomats said, that the United 
States will be able to reconstitute much of the broad coalition it led during 
the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 In his address to Parliament before the closed session, Saad said that "there 
is no reason for worry or fear," continuing the government's efforts to 
reassure a nation traumatized by the 1990-91 occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwait's allies will remain fully deployed, he said, until "everybody is sure 
that these Iraqi troops that have converged (on the border) from different 
places have gone back to where they were before." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuwait's own 18,000 troops are fully deployed along its northern frontier and 
are most immediately concerned about the 20,000 men staying in an Iraqi tent 
camp just over the border. Iraq says the men are Kuwaitis or stateless Arabs 
who used to live here and want to return; Kuwait says they are Iraqi soldiers 
in civilian clothes ready to push across in a "provocation." 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we are in a defensive mode," Maj. Gen. Ali al Muamin, the 
Kuwaiti chief of staff, told journalists visiting the border area. "We shall 
leave these people to be dealt with by the proper agencies such as the Red 
Cross, the United Nations and the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "But some of them are in very good physical shape. They do not look like 
civilians to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Muamin added: "We are ready for any invasion. I am very proud of my men. They 
now have the experience from the liberation of Kuwait (in the Gulf War). We are 
not going to run away from the Iraqis this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kuwaitis have remained calm, many have begun to take precautions, 
withdrawing cash from local banks, stocking up on food, water and other 
provisions, filling their cars with gasoline in case they need to make a quick 
getaway across the desert to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual 130-mile-long demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait was quiet 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vesselin Kostov, a spokesman for the United Nations' Iraq-Kuwait Observation 
Mission, said the Iraqi forces were still out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our position in the DMZ we could not witness the movements of the Iraqis 
to the south, so we could not, of course, witness any moves to the north," 
Kostov said when asked to confirm the Iraqi announcement of a troop pullback.

BUILDUP IN THE PERSIAN GULF; IRAQI MOVES PUT RUSSIA IN QUANDARY; DIPLOMACY:

 Iraq's massing of troops near the Kuwaiti border put Russia in a quandary: 
Moscow has sided with Washington against Baghdad for reasons of politics and 
regional stability, but at the same time Russia aims to avoid alienating a 
country it sees as an important business partner. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Russia has been moving closer to Iraq, eager to renew one of 
the Soviet Union's most profitable friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the two countries signed a $17-billion economic agreement that 
Russia hopes will allow it to collect at least part of a $7-billion debt and to 
exploit what it sees as a huge and hungry Iraqi market that will open up as 
soon as the United Nations lifts the sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the Russian Foreign Ministry urged Iraq on Monday to halt its 
bellicose troop movements and cooperate with the United Nations, Iraqi Oil 
Minister Safa Jawad Habubi arrived in Moscow to get a joint oil production deal 
ready for launch the moment sanctions against Iraq are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Persian Gulf crisis apparently had no impact on the previously scheduled 
visit. Habubi was reportedly to meet the Russian oil minister and four oil 
companies to discuss a $2.5-billion contract for Russian help in developing 
Iraqi oil fields, building a petroleum processing plant in northern Iraq and 
possibly constructing a new pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian and Iraqi officials "are hopeful for a peaceful settlement of the 
crisis and feel it possible to thrash out a number of key issues now," the 
Itar-Tass news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a week ago, Russian officials were still hopeful that the 
international trade embargo against Iraq might be lifted in as little as six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with France and China, Russia had been lobbying the U.N. Security 
Council to consider setting a timetable for a partial lifting of sanctions if 
Iraq continued to behave, recognized the legitimacy of Kuwait's borders and 
complied with other U.N. demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Iraqi leadership assures us that the debts will be paid as soon as Iraq 
gets a chance to resume its oil exports," said Alexander M. Kalugin, head of 
the Iraq section of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in an interview before the 
troop buildup began. 
</P>
<P>
 The same Russian firms that build Iraqi roads, airports, pipelines and oil 
facilities want a chance to get back into that lucrative market, Kalugin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our technology and equipment is not competitive abroad," he said. "In Iraq, 
we could still sell it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wails of frustration emanated from other Russian politicians and diplomats who 
saw those hopes evaporating Monday. Many blamed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein 
for destroying his own case. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Russian ambassador to the United States, lawmaker Vladimir Lukin, 
complained to the Russian news agency Interfax that if Hussein's military 
maneuvers were intended to persuade the Security Council to lift the sanctions, 
they had the opposite result. 
</P>
<P>
 "The provocative actions of Hussein have discouraged any desire by Russia to 
stand up in his defense," said an unnamed diplomat in today's editions of the 
newspaper Izvestia. 
</P>
<P>
 Izvestia said a second Persian Gulf war between Iraq and the Western allies 
would be "the worst possible development for Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia was quick to denounce the Iraqi action last week, and when President 
Clinton telephoned Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin on Monday, Yeltsin 
reportedly assured him that Moscow was urging Baghdad to stop the brinkmanship, 
according to Russian news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Iraq overran Kuwait in August, 1990, Saddam Hussein was one of the 
Soviet Union's best customers. He bought billions of dollars' worth of weapons, 
and unlike other Soviet client states that paid in sugar or bananas or not at 
all, Hussein paid his bills promptly in "black hard currency" -- oil. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the Gulf War began, about two-thirds of Iraq's aircraft were 
Soviet-built, as well as more than 4,000 tanks, roughly 4,000 other military 
vehicles, surface-to-air missiles, small ships and between 800 and 1,000 Scud 
missiles, according to Col. Andrew Duncan of the International Institute for 
Strategic Studies in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian nationalists and defense industry managers complain that Moscow's 
compliance with arms embargoes in the former Yugoslav federation, and Yeltsin's 
pledge last month to curtail arms sales to Iran, show that Russian interests 
are being sacrificed to appease the West. Arms sales to Iraq are out of the 
question, the Foreign Ministry's Kalugin said. But newly privatized civilian 
industries are lobbying the Russian government to get the sanctions lifted 
quickly so they can go back to waging non-military trade with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 And just as American executives staked out Ho Chi Minh City trying to secure 
chunks of the Vietnamese market long before the U.S. trade sanctions against 
Vietnam were lifted, these private Russian companies are already forging 
unofficial trade ties with Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, one newly privatized firm that produces agricultural equipment in 
the Altai region of Siberia has already agreed to supply about 1,000 harvesters 
to Iraq, according to Vitaly V. Naumkin, president of the Russian Center for 
Strategic Research and International Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Siberians are so desperate to sell their equipment before it rusts -- and 
domestic buyers are so scarce -- that the firm has agreed to deliver the 
harvesters to Baghdad now and accept payment once the trade sanctions are 
lifted, Naumkin said. The United Nations would have to approve the transaction, 
but since harvesters are unlikely to have a dual military use, the deal is 
expected to go through, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody here wants to turn Saddam Hussein into the leader of the Middle East, 
as he wants," Naumkin said. But neither can economically imperiled Russia 
afford an indefinite boycott of its neighbors' markets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia cannot afford to have new enemies," Naumkin said.

BHUTTO CRACKS DOWN BEFORE NATIONAL STRIKE; PAKISTAN: HUNDREDS OF PREMIER'S 
POLITICAL FOES ARE JAILED. OPPOSITION SAYS DETENTIONS ARE AIMED AT SILENCING 
CRITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With political passions in Pakistan now running white-hot, Prime Minister 
Benazir Bhutto's government detained and jailed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of 
political foes Monday on the eve of a nationwide strike. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an unprecedented crackdown by the populist prime minister, who was 
elected to office a year ago. Bhutto claimed those arrested were planning to 
destroy stores and other property during the work stoppage called for today by 
the opposition Pakistan Muslim League to force her resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, under the constitution, we have the responsibility to protect the life 
and property of the citizens, and that is why those people have been picked 
up," Bhutto told the Reuters news agency. "Now they have been preempted, we 
believe there will be no threat on Oct. 11." 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition accused Bhutto of resorting to tyrannical means to harass and 
muzzle her critics. The Muslim League's implacable leader, former Prime 
Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was defeated by Bhutto in the October, 1993, 
elections, called on supporters to avoid arrest by going underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Nabib Baksh Kozo, a government spokesman in the Arabian Sea port city of 
Karachi, said the government arrested 1,100 people nationwide. But deputy 
Muslim League leader Haji Mohammed Nawaz Khokhar claimed that 10,000 people had 
been hauled into jail or put under guard at home over the weekend and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't leave my house," Khokhar, a member of the National Assembly, said by 
telephone from Islamabad, the capital. "There is heavy police presence at the 
gate." 
</P>
<P>
 Majid Malik, vice president of the Muslim League, told a Sunday news 
conference that many PML leaders would emerge from hiding today to head marches 
and speak at rallies. Women party workers, he said, would lie down on railroad 
tracks to paralyze Pakistan's rail network. 
</P>
<P>
 Some admirers of Bhutto's were uneasy about the prime minister's action and 
fear it will only galvanize her adversaries. Bhutto also risked being hoist by 
her own petard, because she was elected to her first term as premier in 1988-90 
after waging her own countrywide campaign of strikes and protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do believe that this agitational politics is against the democratic 
order," she said of Sharif's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a slim defeat in elections a year ago, Sharif, who was prime minister 
for 30 months until July, 1993, has been trying to force Bhutto from office. On 
Sept. 11 in Karachi, he launched a train-borne "caravan for liberation" and 
since then has called two general strikes that even Bhutto loyalists admitted 
were partial successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most serious development is the changing attitude of the Muhajir 
Quami Movement, which represents Urdu-speaking refugees who fled to Pakistan 
from India in 1947 and their descendants. Some news reports on the arrests said 
the majority of detainees were not from Sharif's party but from the MQM, whose 
leader Altaf Hussain called recently for a separate province for the Muhajirs.

IT'S DEJA VU FOR SOME OF THE SOUTHLAND MARINES ON ALERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As 18,000 U.S. Marines in Southern California were put on alert for possible 
deployment to the Middle East, most troops Monday conducted business as usual 
while some began packing their desert combat equipment and prepared for war. 
</P>
<P>
 But wherever they were, whatever they were doing, the specter of another war 
still loomed large in the minds of the Marines, some of whom were asked to put 
their lives on the line under similar circumstances nearly four years ago in 
Operation Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some Marines are watching this on the edge of their seats," said Sgt. Dave 
Hiersekorn, a spokesman for the Tustin and El Toro Marine Corps Air stations. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Operation Desert Storm, many Southland Marines, especially those at El 
Toro and Camp Pendleton, will be among the first troops in the Persian Gulf, 
providing logistic support and the initial firepower in the event of a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 Marines from Camp Pendleton, the largest Marine base on the West 
Coast, were expected to be transported Monday night to March Air Force Base 
near Riverside for deployment to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the 18,000 on alert are part of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, 
which is made up of 45,000 to 50,000 troops from the six bases throughout 
Southern California and Arizona. Those on alert, however, are mostly coming 
from Twentynine Palms, El Toro and Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1st Marine Expeditionary Force's mission is to help coordinate the arrival 
of equipment, supplies and combat troops, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiersekorn said some Marines in Orange County, who would be part of the first 
strike force, wore electronic pagers Monday so they could be contacted 
immediately in the event of deployment orders. He added that Marine officials 
at El Toro and Tustin were drafting contingency plans involving thousands of 
local Marines for different combat scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 About 350 Marine pilots and support personnel from Tustin's Marine Medium 
Helicopter Squadron 166 were redeployed from the Indian Ocean to the Persian 
Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those placed on alert, many said they were eager to get to Kuwait and 
finish a job that was started in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go back there this time, we need to fix and take care of the situation 
for good," said Lance Cpl. Demarco Slaughter, 20, of East St. Louis Ill., as he 
waited in line for his gear at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing next to Slaughter, Lance Cpl. Anthony Gray, 22, of Houston, whose 
wife gave birth to a girl five days ago, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a waste of money going back to do something that could have been taken 
care of four years ago," he said. "My wife doesn't want me to go with our new 
baby and all that, but my job requires me to go. That's what I get paid for, 
and that's why I'm serving." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Tony Zinni, the commanding general of the 1st Marine Expeditionary 
Force at Camp Pendleton, said the troops will continue to gear up for combat, 
despite Iraq's professed military de-escalation near the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at this as a serious matter and are going to be prepared" for 
a long deployment, Zinni announced at a noon news conference at Camp Pendleton. 
"Having been through this experience once before, we have learned a lot. . . . 
Our experience level is better and we have equipment pre-positioned" in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Military supply ships are en route to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Zinni said. 
Those ships will arrive "in a few weeks," he said. It will be the task of the 
1st Expeditionary Force to unload the ships and set up camps and airfields, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changing developments in the Middle East, many Marines spent 
Monday enjoying the hot Santa Ana conditions on the last day of their three-day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are still pretty much routine at this point," said Hiersekorn, noting 
that Columbus Day is a federal holiday and that most Marines had the day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Brian Gobel said that he and his buddies at Camp Pendleton were prepared 
for whatever the Marine Corps asks of them. "Basically, we're just ready if 
need be," he said. "We'll be ready to go at a moment's notice. That's what we 
train for."

1 CULT LEADER IDENTIFIED AMONG 53 DEAD; FATE OF OTHER STILL UNKNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joseph di Mambro, one of the masterminds of the doomsday cult at the center of 
last week's grisly deaths of 53 people, died with his followers, Swiss police 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement from Valais state police said Di Mambro was among 25 people whose 
bodies were found among the rubble of fires that destroyed three chalets in the 
Alpine village of Granges-sur-Salvan. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the cult's other leader, Luc Jouret, remained a mystery. Swiss 
experts began autopsies Monday to determine if Jouret was among the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Police last week issued an arrest warrant on charges of premeditated murder 
and suspicion of arson against Di Mambro, a 70-year-old French-Canadian, and 
Jouret, a Belgian believed to be the charismatic force behind the cult. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification of Di Mambro's body followed the arrival of Canadian police 
investigators with his dental records. Many of the dead were burned beyond 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-three others died in a farmhouse in the Swiss village of Cheiry. 
Autopsies on those bodies indicated that many were murdered; some had multiple 
bullet wounds in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other bodies were found in a charred chalet the cult leaders owned north 
of Montreal. Canadian police said three were murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is continuing in Canada, Australia and Europe. There have 
been unconfirmed reports that cult leaders were involved in arms trafficking 
and money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Switzerland's biggest banks froze an undisclosed number of accounts and 
launched an internal inquiry. Newspapers have reported cult links to a manager 
at the Swiss Bank Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian Associated Press reported that Di Mambro and Jouret regularly 
visited Australia. The agency said Di Mambro lived at the Gold Coast, a beach 
resort in Queensland state, between last November and April. The agency said 
immigration records showed Jouret had visited Australia five times since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very calm and very cool. He had a charisma about him," said Peter 
Bruinhout, a Gold Coast businessman who said he rented several cars to Jouret.

SCIENTISTS REPORT NEW DIAGNOSTIC TEST FOR CANCER; MEDICINE: MARKERS OF THE 
DISEASE ARE MATCHED WITH CELLS IN TISSUE, BODY FLUIDS. RESEARCHERS HOPE THE 
BREAKTHROUGH WILL LEAD TO EARLIER DETECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A diagnostic test for cancer that could revolutionize screening for the deadly 
disease has been developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical 
Institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The new test, reported in today's issue of Proceedings of the National Academy 
of Science, identifies replication errors in DNA that occur frequently in 
cancer. The errors, known as clonal markers, are used as a fingerprint for 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers hope the breakthrough will bring a general cancer screening method 
to identify cases sooner than existing tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers compare markers from several types of cancer with cells found 
in tissue, body fluids or secretions from a suspected cancer site. If the 
markers match, there is a strong indication that the patient has cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clonal markers are a definitive indicator of cancer. If you see these 
markers, you know you've found disease," said Dr. David Sidransky of the Johns 
Hopkins Oncology Center and principal investigator of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of the test on people at high risk for bladder and cervical cancers could 
begin within a year, Sidransky said. He said the test could also be used to 
detect other cancers, including cancers of the lung, breast, colon and 
prostate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes this so easy is that it's just a very simple technology," 
Sidransky said. "It's a one-step thing. The whole thing can be done in one 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Sidransky said he believes the test, expected to cost about $50, may become 
part of routine medical care, providing an easy method of detecting cancer in 
its earliest and most treatable stages. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said the test is still in its experimental phase and must be 
validated through a series of larger trials, which could take years to 
complete. Further trials also are needed, he said, to verify that the test 
identifies cancer earlier than standard methods. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the reason we're so confident is that even if you only detected half of 
all cancers -- even if we fell short of expectations -- you'd be detecting a 
lot more cancers than you are now," Sidransky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers also plan to use the test on cancer patients whose tumors have 
been surgically removed in an effort to see if the patients have any residual 
cancer cells.

DENVER TEACHERS STRIKE AS COLORADO SEEKS COURT ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Risking jail and $100-a-day fines, Denver's public teachers went on strike 
Monday for the first time in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The state went to court later in the day to demand a judicial order forcing 
the teachers back to work. But the hearing was postponed until today to give 
teachers time to prepare their case. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials worked to keep classes running for the district's 63,000 students 
with substitute teachers, administrators and teachers who refused to join the 
strike against the city's 107 public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Students reported light attendance. At one high school, students were sent to 
an auditorium to watch the movie "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supt. Irv Moskowitz said operations were "very close to normal" in many 
schools and the screening of "Jurassic Park" was unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 of the district's 3,800 regular teachers stayed away from class, 
said Leonard Fox, spokesman for the teachers' union. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials didn't return telephone calls seeking figures on student 
attendance or the number of teachers who crossed picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
 State Labor Commissioner Joe Donlon contends the strike is illegal and 
strikers could face $100-per-day fines and up to 60 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers called the strike Sunday night after rejecting a one-year contract 
that would have given them a $1,001 annual raise. Denver teachers make an 
average of $35,004 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay package was worth $5.1 million. The teachers sought a package closer 
to $8 million. Teachers had also sought such things as a union voice on school 
governance committees and restrictions on how often teachers can be called back 
to school beyond normal classroom times. 
</P>
<P>
 The picket lines went up at daybreak. Later Monday, about 2,000 teachers and 
their supporters staged a noisy rally outside the school sytem's administration 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a hard decision to make, but we made it not only in the interest of 
ourselves but of our children," said Valdez Elementary School teacher Andree 
Hall. "Working conditions are intolerable in the Denver Public Schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwai Tabcum, 17, a North High student, was sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are teachers who have been here seven years and haven't gotten a 
raise," he said. "I'd be out here doing the same thing, but a little more 
rowdy." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time that Denver teachers walked off the job, in 1969, the strike 
lasted 14 days.

SLAVERY RE-ENACTMENT STIRS MIXED EMOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 3,000 spectators, mostly white, stood silent and uneasy as a weeping 
woman playing the role of a pregnant 18th-Century slave begged a white actor to 
buy her along with her husband so the couple would not be separated. 
</P>
<P>
 When the re-enactment of a day in the life of Colonial Williamsburg was over, 
some in the audience Monday were weeping too.Among them was a civil rights 
activist who had denounced the re-enactment as trivializing black history. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Gravely, an official of the state's National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People, said: "The presentation was passionate, moving and 
educational." 
</P>
<P>
 The auction was one of the most controversial re-enactments that Colonial 
Williamsburg had attempted, and it drew a smattering of sign-carrying 
protesters to the tourist community of restored 18th-Century houses and shops. 
</P>
<P>
 While organizers said the re-enactment dramatized the horrors of slavery, some 
complained that it cheapened history and dealt with an episode too painful to 
handle in a theater-like production.

 The Pentagon's crash effort to close unneeded military bases is being 
seriously undermined by an unexpected development -- the reopening of discarded 
bases as reserve training facilities or Defense Department finance centers -- a 
defense-monitoring group charged Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, known as Business Executives for National Security, estimated that 
keeping these installations operating instead of shutting them as planned could 
cost $15 billion over the next five years -- money that the Pentagon says it 
wants to use to offset declining budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The conclusions were contained in a 74-page study which contends that of the 
67 major military installations ostensibly ordered closed since 1988, 26 either 
never shut down or have quietly been reopened by the Pentagon with new names or 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Pentagon officials challenged the report, charging that it is riddled 
with inaccuracies, both on the number of bases partly reopened for other 
government uses and on the budgetary implications of such actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Gotbaum, assistant secretary of defense for economic security, said 
that the report is misleading because "it gives the impression that the 
department is not closing bases. . . . We are still expecting the vast majority 
of savings that have been estimated." 
</P>
<P>
 The study charges that failure to close the bases as announced not only saps 
badly needed federal budget dollars but also erodes public faith in the federal 
base-closing process and could hamper future efforts to shut down unneeded 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also asserts that the push to keep these installations open often 
hurts local communities, which it says usually can reap more economic benefits 
in the long run by using the land for business development than by maintaining 
remaining federal jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those listed are Moffett Field in Northern California, which currently 
continues as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research 
Center; the Presidio in San Francisco, slated to become a national park; and 
Carswell Air Force Base in North Texas, now a reserve center. 
</P>
<P>
 The study says that keeping Moffett Field intact is costing the federal 
government $3.2 billion to operate, while the Presidio is siphoning off $1.4 
billion a year and Carswell is taking $1.2 billion. In all, the study names 26 
such installations. 
</P>
<P>
 It says that the push to keep the bases open is ironic, since the number of 
base closings so far has been relatively small, considering the enormous amount 
of excess bases and military depots left over after the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is considered critical. Military leaders in all four armed services 
have said that they must close substantially more bases than have been 
shuttered so far if they are to be able to continue modernizing U.S. forces in 
the face of declining budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Pentagon has significantly slashed the number of troops, planes, 
tanks and ships, it still has not reduced the infrastructure -- such as bases 
and depots -- that services them. As a result, it has a high overhead that saps 
budget funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The current base-closing procedures were set up partly to insulate the 
shutdown effort from political manipulation, which had prevented such shutdowns 
in earlier years. Under the new process, closures are decided by an independent 
Base Closure and Realignment Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by Business Executives for National Security blames a variety of 
factors for the situation, from pressure by politicians and local communities 
to Congress' refusal to cut the strength of reserve units in line with the 
reductions that it has ordered in the size of active-duty forces. 
</P>
<P>
 It calls on authorities to tighten the definition for base closure, to slash 
the number of installations allocated to reserves and to make public more 
details on proposals to keep discarded bases open. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon has estimated that savings from base closings eventually will 
amount to $4.6 billion a year, which it hopes to reallocate to help modernize 
weapons. But the study says that the savings never will be realized and, 
instead, that the reopened bases will cost $15 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Defense Department's Gotbaum said that the figures in the report 
are inaccurate and that the Pentagon still is expected to reap the bulk of the 
$4.6 billion in savings that authorities had estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotbaum also took issue with the report's assertions that 26 of the 67 
military bases ordered closed have been "realigned" -- that is, quietly kept 
open for use by other military or government entities. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that of the 26 bases cited, seven were supposed to have been 
restructured from the start, another three were ordered realigned by the 
base-closure commission and 13 others contain small-scale Defense Department 
accounting centers on part of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that the study mistakenly confuses two other bases with nearby 
installations that never had been targeted for closing in the first place. "We 
still regard the need to close unneeded bases as critical," he said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Gotbaum also disputed the report's contentions that using parts of closed base 
for other federal activities necessarily wipes out the projected savings from 
the shutdown. He said that often the new activity needs only a small fraction 
of the employees that the base had. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carole Lessure, an analyst for the Defense Budget Project, another 
defense-monitoring group, said that while the study's figures sound high, 
widespread continuation of such installations to house new military activities 
"definitely would erode" the projected savings.

SHUTTLE CREW COMPLETES RADAR SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The space shuttle astronauts concluded an 11-day, round-the-clock radar survey 
of Earth on Monday and began stowing scientific gear for their planned return 
to the ground today. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainy, windy weather was expected in Florida, but the crew is scheduled to 
bring Endeavour down at 8:36 a.m. PDT at the Kennedy Space Center, where its 
journey began Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA could detour the shuttle to Edwards Air Force Base in California later in 
the day instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration said the six-man crew had 
achieved its goals of mapping terrain in remote regions and measuring 
environmental changes from April to October. It was the second flight test in 
six months of the $384-million Space Radar Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Two radar instruments, one from the United States and the other from Europe, 
and an air pollution monitor were ready to "take their place in the tool kit," 
said NASA's Steve Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. space agency has no firm plans to fly the laboratory again, but there 
is talk of putting similar radars in orbit aboard satellites in the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Space Radar Laboratory in the shuttle cargo bay scanned Earth for a final 
day Monday while the astronauts continued making weather observations and 
taking photographs over various ground targets, from the forests of Michigan to 
the sands of Africa and the jungles of the Amazon.

NYPD BRASS IS BLUE OVER COP WINNING CAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An undercover cop trying to blend in at a bar bought a beer, which qualified 
her for a drawing for a $14,000 Plymouth Neon. She won. 
</P>
<P>
 But some NYPD brass believe that she should hand over the keys. Their 
argument: Department money. Department time. Department car. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Board of Ethics has been asked to settle the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, whom police wouldn't identify, was at a beach club Sept. 7 in the 
Long Island town of East Quogue when she used department money to buy three 
beers for herself and two other investigators. That automatically entered her 
in the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Commissioner Walter Mack said in Monday's editions of the New York 
Daily News: "I'm hoping the Board of Ethics determines she can keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 Until there's a ruling, the bright red car will sit on a dealership lot.

DRUG IS FOUND TO CUT INCIDENCE OF MS RELAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new version of a genetically engineered drug called beta-interferon can 
reduce the incidence of relapses of multiple sclerosis and slow the progression 
of the disease, researchers said Monday at a meeting of the American 
Neurological Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug is aimed at a relapsing type of MS that affects about 75,000 to 
140,000 Americans. In all, about 250,000 to 350,000 Americans have MS. 
</P>
<P>
 People with this "relapsing-remitting" MS suffer periodic bouts of symptoms, 
including fatigue, impaired vision, loss of balance and coordination, slurred 
speech, tremors and partial or complete paralysis. Patients recover at least 
partially during the weeks or months after each episode but become 
progressively disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors now treat many people with relapsing MS with a slightly different form 
of beta-interferon whose trade name is Betaseron. That drug, approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration last year, reduces the frequency and severity of 
attacks. Until a few weeks ago, Betaseron was in such short supply that 
patients had to enter a lottery for a chance to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lawrence Jacobs of the State University of New York at Buffalo reported on 
the study, which looked at 301 patients with a relatively mild form of 
relapsing-remitting MS. They received weekly injections of either the 
beta-interferon or a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers measured the progression of the disability with a 10-step scale 
that looked at weakness or spasticity in the limbs, double vision, slurred 
speech and lack of coordination. They followed patients over two years to see 
how many avoided getting worse by a full step on the scale. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of two years, 80% of patients taking interferon had avoided this 
progression, versus 65% of patients taking the placebo, Jacobs said. Analysis 
also showed that about 15% of patients taking interferon had three or more MS 
attacks over the two years, compared with about 35% of patients taking a 
placebo, he said.

O.C SNEEZES, WHEEZES IN WINDS' WAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you had that itchy-eyed, raw-skinned, tight-chested, stuffy, sneezy, wheezy 
sort of feeling for the last few days, there's good news on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 The cursed Santa Ana winds, which each fall deliver misery to thousands of 
coastal residents, are just about through with their first assault of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, "this episode is pretty much over," said Kris Farnsworth, 
meteorologist for WeatherData Inc., which supplies forecasts to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, doctors say, the winds leave a trail of suffering in their 
wake, and some of their ill effects will linger for a few more days. And there 
are more Santa Anas expected -- there are usually three or four episodes per 
autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 The dry, hot winds from the Great Basin blow in all kinds of tiny irritants 
and particles -- mostly weed and grass pollen, mold spores and dust -- which 
stir up allergies and aggravate eye, skin and respiratory conditions such as 
asthma and emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has profound effects," said Dr. Stanley P. Galant, director of pediatric 
allergy and immunology at UC Irvine. "As the wind blows toward the ocean, it 
sweeps everything in its path into the eyes and nose and lungs of susceptible 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, some folks didn't wait to see a doctor on Monday -- they 
high-tailed it to the local emergency room during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were extremely busy because of respiratory problems of all kinds," said 
Dr. Bill Honigman, an emergency room physician at Kaiser Permanente Medical 
Center in Anaheim. "When people can't breathe, they have to see somebody 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 The breezes can trigger life-threatening breathing problems, sending people to 
intensive-care units and forcing them onto ventilators. But most often, 
immunologists and other physicians say, they simply make people feel lousy. 
</P>
<P>
 Allergists and immunologists all over Orange County dealt with the fallout on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in with itchy red, watery eyes; sneezy, itchy, runny noses; nasal 
congestion, flare-ups of eczema (an inflammation of the skin). . . . You can 
also see an increase in asthma, because of the pollen," said Dr. Rhonda Myers, 
an Irvine allergy, asthma and immunology specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot, dry air just makes things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It dries out the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract (and) exacerbates 
the allergies of the eyes, nose, lungs and skin," said Dr. Donald Levy of 
Orange, another busy allergist and immunologist. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20% of the population, Levy said, suffers some form of allergy, which is 
an exaggerated or inappropriate response of the immune system. During the Santa 
Anas, doctors generally treat reactions with medication -- inhaled 
bronchodilators for asthmatics, for example, or antihistamines such as Seldane. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors said allergic effects such as inflammation in the sinuses can make 
people more susceptible to viral infections -- compounding the effects of a bad 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 But the misery is not confined to those with allergies: Many others find that 
the breezes rob their bodies of moisture, causing skin rashes or eye 
irritations. The winds are especially hard on those who wear contact lenses and 
those who already suffer from chronically dry eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we live in the desert, where you get a lot of tear evaporation and 
retain less moisture," said Dr. Richard H. Keates, chairman of UC Irvine's 
ophthalmology department. "If you add this hot wind, it just exaggerates it. 
One of the most common things people have is dry eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Another danger is that floating particles stirred up by the incoming breezes 
can land smack in the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid the brunt of the Santa Ana breezes, doctors recommend that people 
stay inside as much as possible, with their windows and doors shut. Running an 
air conditioner can not only relieve the heat, but act as an air filter. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of children with allergies and respiratory problems should handle the 
Santa Ana episodes just as they would a serious smog alert, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recommendations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Taking allergy and other medications -- such as inhaled steroids -- 
preventively, before symptoms occur; 
</P>
<P>
 * Running humidifiers at night to replace lost moisture in the air; 
</P>
<P>
 * Applying sunscreen and other oils to moisten the skin; 
</P>
<P>
 * Wearing sunglasses; 
</P>
<P>
 * Applying artificial tear preparations and allergy drops to the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 * REMAINING VIGILANT: O.C. firefighters stay on alert as hot, dry Santa Anas 
abate. B2

O.C. MARINES PREPARE FOR RETURN TO THE GULF; DEPLOYMENT: AS IN DESERT STORM, 
SOUTHLAND TROOPS WILL PROVIDE EARLY LOGISTIC SUPPORT AND FIREPOWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As 18,000 Marines in Orange County and elsewhere in Southern California were 
put on alert for possible deployment to the Middle East, most troops conducted 
their business as usual Monday, while some began packing their desert combat 
equipment and prepared for war. 
</P>
<P>
 But wherever they were, whatever they were doing, the specter of another Gulf 
war still loomed large in the minds of the Marines, some of whom were asked to 
put their lives on the line nearly four years ago in Operation Desert Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some Marines are watching this on the edge of their seats," said Sgt. Dave 
Hiersekorn, a spokesman for the Tustin and El Toro Marine Corps air stations. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Operation Desert Storm, many Southland Marines, especially those at El 
Toro and Camp Pendleton, will be among the first troops in the Persian Gulf, 
providing logistic support and the initial firepower in the event of a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 Marines from Camp Pendleton, the largest Marine base on the West 
Coast, were expected to be transported either Monday night or today to March 
Air Force Base near Riverside for deployment to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the 18,000 Marines on alert are part of the 1st Marine Expeditionary 
Force, which is made up of 45,000 to 50,000 troops at the six bases throughout 
Southern California and Arizona. Those on alert, however, are mostly at the 
Twentynine Palms and El Toro bases and Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1st Marine Expeditionary Force's mission is to help coordinate the arrival 
of equipment, supplies and combat troops in Kuwait, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiersekorn said some Marines in Orange County, who would be among the first 
troops in the Persian Gulf, wore electronic pagers Monday so they could be 
contacted immediately in the event of deployment orders. He added that Marine 
officials at El Toro and Tustin were drafting contingency plans involving 
thousands of local Marines for different combat scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials do not have a breakdown of which bases the 18,000 troops 
will be coming from. However, about 350 Marine pilots and support personnel 
from Tustin's Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 166 already have been 
redeployed from the Indian Ocean to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, Marines from Orange County played 
strategic roles in the areas of military logistics and ground troop and air 
combat support. About 5,000 men and women in the El Toro-based 3rd Marine 
Aircraft Wing came from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 That wing included CH-46 Sea Knight and CH-53 Sea Stallion troop transport 
helicopters from the Tustin air station, which moved supplies and personnel 
near the Kuwaiti border in preparation for the ground attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Marines steam-rolled over the Iraqi army in that conflict, 
artillery units from Camp Pendleton unleashed their 155-millimeter howitzers on 
Iraqi ground positions, while F/A-18 Hornet jet fighters from El Toro pummeled 
Iraqi troops and military facilities from the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The aerial punishment helped minimize resistance during the ground assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Should another war occur, the Marines from Orange County would probably be 
called upon to provide the same military might. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those placed on alert Monday, many said they were eager to get to Kuwait 
and finish a job that was started in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go back there this time, we need to fix and take care of the situation 
for good," said Lance Cpl. Demarco Slaughter, 20, of East St. Louis, Ill., as 
he waited in line for his gear at Camp Pendleton. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing next to Slaughter, Lance Cpl. Anthony Gray, 22, of Houston, whose 
wife gave birth to a baby girl five days ago, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a waste of money going back to do something that could have been taken 
care of four years ago," he said. "My wife doesn't want me to go with our new 
baby and all that, but my job requires me to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Marines signed out for desert gear, which included fatigues, boots, 
head-gear, flak jackets and chemical protective suits in the event of gas 
warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Tony Zinni, commanding general of the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force 
at Camp Pendleton, said the troops will continue to gear up for combat, despite 
Iraq's apparent military de-escalation around the Kuwaiti border. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at this as a serious matter and are going to be prepared" for 
a long deployment, Zinni announced at a noon news conference at Camp Pendleton. 
"Having been through this experience once before, we have learned a lot. . . . 
Our experience level is better and we have equipment pre-positioned" in Saudi 
Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Military supply ships are en route to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Zinni said. 
Those ships will arrive "in a few weeks," he said. It will be the task of the 
1st Expeditionary Force to unload the ships and set up camps and airfields, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the changing developments in the Middle East, many Marines spent 
Monday enjoying the hot Santa Ana conditions on the last day of their three-day 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are still pretty much routine at this point," said Hiersekorn, noting 
that Columbus Day is a federal holiday and that most Marines had the day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Brian Gobel said he and his buddies at Camp Pendleton were prepared for 
whatever the Marine Corps asks of them. "Basically, we're just ready if need 
be," he said.

BOOKS & AUTHORS / ORANGE COUNTY; THE REAL DIRT DOWN SOUTH DUG UP IN 
'MISSISSIPPI MUD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were two of the most prominent citizens of Biloxi, Miss.: Vincent Sherry 
was a respected lawyer and circuit court judge. Margaret, his wife of nearly 40 
years, was a mayoral candidate with a reputation for stirring things up at city 
hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a sultry September evening in 1987, someone entered the Sherrys' 
ranch-style home and, using a .22-caliber Ruger automatic, shot them both to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 The double murder rocked Biloxi, the Gulf Coast resort city that Look magazine 
once compared to the French Riviera but which, as Seal Beach author Edward 
Humes shows in his new book on the Sherry murders, had a dual persona. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bastion of Old South virtue where corrupt mayors and police chiefs 
for decades allowed the so-called Dixie Mafia to openly operate gambling, 
prostitution and other illegal enterprises along a seamy beachfront strip. 
</P>
<P>
 It's into this shadowy world that Lynne Sposito, the Sherrys' eldest daughter, 
steps after a two-year police investigation of her parents' murders leads 
nowhere. Fearing a cover-up, the middle-aged mother of three hires her own 
investigator and sets off on a perilous crusade to find out who killed her 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mississippi Mud: A True Story From a Corner of the Deep South" (Simon & 
Schuster; $23), Humes chronicles how Sposito's investigation led her to the 
kingpin of Biloxi's decadent Strip, his protege -- a convicted Dixie Mafia 
killer making hundreds of thousands of dollars targeting gay men in a mail and 
telephone scam run from inside a Louisiana prison -- and their lawyer: Peter 
Halat, who was not only Vincent Sherry's law partner but his best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, which is already in its third printing, is being developed by Hearst 
Entertainment as a miniseries that will air on NBC next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Humes, 37, a Pulitzer Prize-winning former Orange County Register reporter, 
first read about the Sherry case two years after the murders. By then the most 
sensational murder case in the history of Mississippi was making national 
headlines after allegations were being made against Halat, who had become the 
new mayor of Biloxi. 
</P>
<P>
 For Humes, the Sherry murder story was irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is an incredible set of characters, a fascinating setting, and a rather 
haunting mystery. Plus, there was the historical landscape I had to work with. 
Who wouldn't want to write this story? 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you have the most important couple in Biloxi assassinated in their homes 
by professional hit men, and their daughter -- a nurse in Raleigh, N.C. -- gets 
frustrated by the botched police investigation and goes out on her own and does 
something extraordinary at great personal risk, sacrificing her family and her 
life and going after these killers. 
</P>
<P>
 "And here you have the killers: The Dixie Mafia that everyone thought was 
extinct, and here's one of their ringleaders living like a lord in prison and 
authorities know about the scam he's been perpetrating for years and they don't 
stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Humes paused, then chuckled: "I get revved up every time I talk about it. It's 
the kind of story you dream about as a journalist, and to spend the amount of 
time I spent putting it together was fascinating to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Humes, who quit his newspaper job in 1990 to write his first true-crime book 
-- "Buried Secrets," about cult murders on the U.S.-Mexican border -- says it 
took him 1 1/2 years to research and write "Mississippi Mud."  
</P>
<P>
 Although he did follow-up interviews by phone, "this was a face-to-face story. 
You have to meet people and persuade them it's a good idea to tell you things 
they didn't tell anyone else," says Humes, who made 10 trips to Mississippi, 
Louisiana and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Sposito was the first person Humes contacted and talked to at any 
length. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really felt that for the kind of story I wanted to tell I needed her 
cooperation," he says. "But equally important was to gain the trust and 
cooperation of investigators who were privy to the real inside story." 
</P>
<P>
 Humes, who gained access to confidential jury transcripts, FBI reports and 
police files, says he documented Sposito's contention that the Biloxi police 
investigation had been less than laudatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "My conclusion is there was a leadership problem with the investigation: the 
classic headless chicken," he says. "It was the rank-and-file officers who 
brought this to my attention. They wanted that known. To their credit they 
wanted to do as good a job as they could." 
</P>
<P>
 In writing a true-crime book, Humes says he tries to give it "the feel of a 
novel, to use some of the conventions of fiction to tell a true story."  
</P>
<P>
 To do so, he has learned to dig deeper into a reporter's traditional bag of 
questions and ask things as: What were you doing before the event occurred? 
What were you thinking ? What were you wearing?  
</P>
<P>
 "You spend hours going over this kind of detail," he says. "What you do is try 
everybody's patience." But the reward, he says, "is you can write richly 
detailed scenes." 
</P>
<P>
 In a story in which everything is in shades of gray, Humes says, "the only 
unambiguous element in my mind is Lynne, who sees everything in black and white 
terms. Lynne is very determined. I characterize her in the book as being 
obsessed with the case, and clearly she was. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible not to have great respect for the courage it took to turn her 
grief at her parents' deaths into something constructive. Not many people would 
have the fortitude to do what she did. I don't think I would." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors claimed that the Sherry murders were an act of revenge by 
conspirators in the prison-house scam. Witnesses testified that scam money 
sometimes made its way to the Halat-Sherry law office, where Halat allegedly 
deposited the money in a trust fund. And when $200,000 disappeared, the 
conspirators blamed Halat's partner Sherry.  
</P>
<P>
 Humes says no there is no indication that Sherry was involved in the scam.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was always one of Lynne's concerns, or fears, that that would prove to 
be the case -- that he was involved with something or had knowledge -- but no 
evidence of that ever surfaced." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, four people were convicted of a conspiracy that included attempting 
to hire a killer to murder Vincent Sherry. But although a federal judge ruled 
that the conspiracy directly led to the murders of both Vincent and Margaret 
Sherry, the questions of who actually did the killings, who else might be 
involved and why it happened remained unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 Halat, who was named by the U.S. attorney's office as an unindicted 
co-conspirator, has never been charged with a crime. He adamantly denies any 
wrongdoing, and his courtroom testimony was supported by the people who were 
charged with conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Humes says the federal investigation into the Sherry murders is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lynne Sposito, he says, "the trial provided some sense that a measure of 
justice had been achieved, but she still is very much involved in tracking the 
case and lobbying for more indictments." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the personal tragedy for the Sherry family, Humes says the murders of 
Vincent and Margaret Sherry have had a beneficial effect on Biloxi. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the course of the case you see Biloxi evolving," he says. "Here you 
have a town where people tolerated corruption for many, many years." That's not 
unique, Humes adds, but in Biloxi it was particularly blatant. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so bad in the 1950s that police officers' uniforms and patrol cars were 
paid for by profits skimmed from illegal gambling activities, he says. And 
things weren't much better in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since these murders occurred, I think it really forced the city and its 
populace to say, 'All right, enough already,' " says Humes. "For the first time 
since Reconstruction, there is a Republican mayor and council in Biloxi." 
</P>
<P>
 Dockside gambling also has been legalized, transforming the region's economy 
and making it unnecessary to have illegal gambling operations. And for the 
first time in years, Humes says, the Biloxi Police Department, long a pariah, 
has credibility with other law enforcement agencies in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Humes, who recently returned from a book tour through the South, says hundreds 
of people turned out for his signings in Biloxi. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people would say the same thing to me: They're delighted to see the 
whole story aired," he says. "But also the other thing is so many people said 
to me, 'We who live here are still scared to death to talk about this case 
because some of these people are still out there.' If that's the prevailing 
attitude, that community still has a way to go."

FIXATIONS / ORANGE COUNTY: AN UPHILL BATTLE; TODD HUSTON, WHOSE RIGHT LEG WAS 
AMPUTATED 12 YEARS AGO, HAS AN ARTIFICIAL LIMB FOR EVERYDAY USE, BUT ON SPECIAL 
OCCASIONS HE USES THE ONE THAT LETS HIM MOVE MOUNTAINS -- BY CLIMBING THEM.

<P>
 Todd Huston has three right legs. There's the phantom one, the leg he still 
senses as being there, though it was amputated 12 years ago. "I can still tell 
you exactly where each of my toes is," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 There is his everyday leg, with a flesh-toned exterior and cosmetic toes. And 
then there is his mountain-climbing leg, a bare graphite, metal and fiberglass 
Terminator-looking appendage with a boot's Vibrum sole glued right to the heel. 
That sole is worn and crumbling at the edges, as one might expect of one used 
in setting a world record.  
</P>
<P>
 We were talking at the Sports Club, Irvine, where Huston trains. Earlier this 
year Huston, 33, scaled the highest point in each of the 50 states in 66 days, 
beating the previous record of 101 days set by an able-bodied man in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those summits were downright comical, such as Britton Hill, which at 
345 feet above sea level is the highest spot in Florida. Then there's 
Delaware's dimple of a peak, Ebright Azimuth, "which happened to be in the 
middle of a street, right outside of Wilmington," Huston said. "But it took us 
several tries to get a picture there because there was so much traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 At the other extreme was Alaska's Mt. McKinley, the highest point in North 
America and 20,320 feet of mean. Huston was climbing in minus-35 degree weather 
there, while Texas' Guadalupe Peak was scaled in 118-degree heat. On other 
heights, he was beset by biting black flies or high winds. Just getting from 
climb to climb was an effort, often driving 500 miles a day, and sometimes 
rerouting to dodge tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a trek that few complete, only 37 including Huston to date. He is the 
first one-legged man to attempt it. Rather than dwell on the hardships his 
unique status imposed, he prefers to joke about the advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only had five toes to worry about getting frostbit. I only had to worry 
about one ankle twisting. My right calf muscle never got sore. So I had a leg 
up on other climbers. Did I ever feel de-feeted? No," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Huston, a Balboa Island resident, is a psychotherapist who is clinical 
director of the Amputee Resource Center at Brea's NovaCare Orthotics and 
Prosthetics, helping amputees to deal with the trauma of limb loss.  
</P>
<P>
 Huston's own trauma began at age 14 when he was water skiing with his family 
in Oklahoma. He had been in the water untangling the ski rope when the family's 
boat slipped into reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was yelling 'Stop the engine,' but no one could hear me, and I had one of 
these big heavy water skiing jackets on and couldn't swim, so the boat hit me, 
and it sucked both my legs into the propeller," he recalled. "When they pulled 
me out of the water there was blood squirting six to eight feet out of my body. 
My left leg was completely open and the whole backside was missing from my 
right leg." 
</P>
<P>
 A nerve had been severed in his right leg, paralyzing it. Doctors told his 
family he probably wouldn't walk again. A month and a half later he was barely 
able to walk out of the hospital "on legs like spaghetti noodles." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was in college the reduced circulation in his paralyzed leg 
caused it to become infected, resulting in lengthy hospitalizations that often 
kept him from attending classes or working. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a whole series of operations, that eventually led to the decision to 
just amputate the leg. So at age 21 I chose to have my leg amputated, because 
what I wanted was to have a life and a lifestyle over a leg.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very tough decision, because it's permanent. You can't do it and go, 
'Oops, wrong decision, let's go back.' I knew I'd have to live with it for the 
rest of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they did it I was wide-awake on the operating table, with not even an 
aspirin in me, for two reasons. One: I wanted to feel I had more control over 
the situation than my disease did, and two: If you're anesthetized, after 
surgery you can't eat pizza. And I love to eat pizza after surgery. So after I 
had my leg amputated I went back to my room and ate pizza." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huston wore a conventional prosthetic leg for a decade, which permitted him to 
live a productive life, though not a physically active one. "I could not take 
more than four or five running steps without tremendous pain and couldn't walk 
over half a mile at any one time. At night I'd have these vivid dreams about 
running in a field." 
</P>
<P>
 After breaking a couple of conventional legs with his exertions, two years ago 
he got his insurance company to spring for a new leg, called a Flex-Foot 
manufactured in Aliso Viejo. Its design, which includes a shock absorber and 
spring-like flexible graphite, responded more like a real limb.  
</P>
<P>
 "Initially I could only run about 100 feet with it, I was so out of shape. I 
called everybody I knew the day I was finally able to run all the way around 
Balboa Island. After three months I was able to run all the way to Laguna and 
beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 He had been working in computer software design when he got the leg. A 
difficult divorce and other problems at the time prompted him to do some 
soul-searching, he said. He determined he wanted to work helping other amputees 
and found the position with NovaCare. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he was approached by an organization to help find a leg amputee to be 
part of an expedition of disabled people intending to climb the 50 peaks. "And 
I thought, 'Hey, I'm interested in that,' and applied and was accepted," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He began training for the climb, spending weekends on the rocks at Joshua Tree 
or on local mountain trails. "I had to become acclimatized, since on Balboa I'm 
breathing the same air sharks do," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He did most of his training at the Sports Club, where they have a rotating 
rock wall that he could climb on without a break. "It's more like the real 
thing. When you're on a mountain you can't just step off it like you do a Stair 
Climber and say you're done for the day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A month shy of the start date the expedition fell through due to lack of 
funding, and Huston was determined to do the trek, now titled Summit America, 
himself, climbing with only the original expedition's guide, 27-year-old Whit 
Rambach of Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 He estimates his expenses for the trip at $60,000. Huston got help from both 
his employer (for which he now works on a contract basis) and Flex-Foot, as 
well as the North Face outfitters. His friend and publicist Lisa Manley was 
selling T-shirts to promote the climb one weekend on Balboa when a jogger, who 
turned out to be Hooked On Phonics CEO John Shanahan, took an interest and 
became the expedition's principal sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially this spring Huston and Rambach took on 33 eastern states, which 
generally were easier than the western climbs. The harsh winter, however, 
caused some of the northeast slopes to be closed, so they headed to Alaska's 
Mt. McKinley. They reached its summit June 1, and there Huston decided to start 
the clock all over again.  
</P>
<P>
 His toes were so battered by the climb he didn't think he could face the tough 
western mountains immediately. Also by starting over with McKinley as the first 
peak, the days they had spent in the ascent weren't counted (since the record 
is determined by the time between the first peak and the last). 
</P>
<P>
 So they headed east, did 33 states all over again (twice knocking off five 
states in a day), took on the Northeast and then headed west, concluding on top 
of Hawaii's Mauna Kea on Aug. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Huston speaks of his journey in a positive manner but does admit there were 
dark moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when I was hiking when it felt like there were 1,000 needles 
pushing in the bottom of my stump every time I took a step. Sometimes I walked 
in that condition for eight or 10 hours. Other times my left leg would be 
cramping up because it had to do so much of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were absolutely times when I felt like giving up. On Mt. Katahdin in 
Maine I was stung so bad by black flies my ears were just bleeding welts. The 
western mountains were so much more difficult than the eastern ones, more than 
I could have planned on. In Texas we were hiking in 118-degree heat, so we had 
to do some of the climbing by moonlight when it got down to a nice 92 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "On McKinley there is one point near the top where a lot of people turn 
around, because you're just physically and emotionally exhausted. But I always 
knew that I had to keep going because if I didn't make one mountain, I couldn't 
break the record.  
</P>
<P>
 "And as I climbed, I became more determined because it became really important 
to me to get a message out, that by having faith in God and in the abilities 
he's given you, you can overcome whatever challenges you have in life." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was so caught up in making his trek, literally one step at a time, 
that he hadn't considered where it might lead. At the prodding of others, he 
says, he now has co-written a book, titled "More Than Mountains," on his 
experience and is embarking on a career as a motivational speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's a profession some view with suspicion, Huston said, "If it can 
inspire others, why not?" He mentioned he had a part as an extra in "Forrest 
Gump" (Huston can be spotted in a wheelchair in an Army hospital) and said that 
if fiction can move people, why not real life?  
</P>
<P>
 He said, "To go from being told I might never walk again to breaking a world 
record in a very physical sport that was held by an able-bodied person, maybe 
there's something to be shared from what I've learned." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He says it took a long time to arrive at his present level of assurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in school I can remember one guy calling me 'the crip with the 
harelip.' So I picked him up and pinned him against the locker and had a little 
talk with him. But usually it wasn't the other kids. I think I beat myself up 
over my disability more than other people did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say you're going out with somebody and you break up. You might think it's 
because of the disability, which it wasn't: People in high school break up all 
the time. That's life. But some of the things that happen naturally in life you 
blame on your leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing a limb is like losing a spouse. I went through the stages of grief and 
loss just like anybody else should. You should feel some loss, some anger, some 
depression. It's healthy to go through the pain. But it's not healthy to stay 
in it too long and not work through it. You can't sit around blaming other 
people. Even if they are to blame, it's your responsibility to make the most of 
the situation. And through having faith in that you can get on top of your 
mountain."

CHRIS FOSTER: FLAB FIVE CAN REALLY AIR IT OUT

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a public service announcement for motorists in the Anaheim area. 
</P>
<P>
 Use extreme caution while driving near Anaheim High School on warm afternoons. 
Hazardous glare could impair your ability to operate a automobile. Please, 
avert your eyes!  
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, it's a frightening thought, more so because it's true. On those hot days 
out on the practice field, Anaheim offensive linemen are apt to let it all hang 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 A drill will be in progress. Hot, sweaty work. Then, the hint of a breeze. 
Suddenly snouts are up. One will bellow, "Breeze, coach."  
</P>
<P>
 Jerseys are hiked up. Bellies flop out. A snort of relief. Then back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. 
</P>
<P>
 James Navarrette, 6 feet, 300 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Armijo, 6-1, 300. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryn Leimbach, 5-11, 235. 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Barragan, 5-11, 210. 
</P>
<P>
 And the baby, Raul Zepeda, 5-10, 205. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly the cast of "Baywatch." Just one glance at those rolling 
midsections and you're a pillar of salt. Fabio they ain't. 
</P>
<P>
 They call themselves the hogs. Hardly original. But they certainly aren't wild 
bores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it's great blocking for . . . uh . . . uh . . . what's his name?" 
Leimbach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben Droughns? The best running back in Orange County? The guy who runs up 
your back side? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't buy it. "Droughns" is a name they've heard and heard and heard. It's to 
the point where even Droughns is tired of listening. 
</P>
<P>
 His own fault, really. He did gain 2,039 yards a year ago and has 805 through 
five games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 People are calling him the best in the county since . . . well, you name it: 
Derek Brown, Kerwin Bell, Willie Gittens, Myron White, Mickey Flynn -- all 
those fossils. Ray Pallares better gaze fondly on that career rushing record. 
It could be gone by December, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Yup, Droughns is going places. His Pips aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 The bacon bunch isn't exactly college linemen material. They don't fit that 
6-5, 275-pound mold. Although they do tend to break the mold when it's across 
from them. They get their pound of flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 The rewards are few. Well, they did get treated to pizza recently by 
quarterback Rudy Herrera's uncle. The bill: Two C-notes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the girth of the matter is, right now, they are the most important people 
in Droughns' life. And he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not an interview goes by that Droughns doesn't drone on about the flab five. 
They're the best. They're the greatest. Why, you can almost visualize him 
memorizing those 3x5 cards they wrote for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He better give us credit or mysterious things could happen," Navarrette said. 
"Why, I might look at the guy I'm suppose to block and say, 'How would you like 
to be player of the week?' " 
</P>
<P>
 What a ham. Of course, he's kidding, we think. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, this porcine posse knows what Droughns does for them as well. They 
know, for instance, it doesn't take much of a hole to spring the guy free. That 
makes their job a lot easier. 
</P>
<P>
 They also know that there's nothing wrong with being anonymous. After all, 
they are having a ton of fun. At 5-0 and ranked seventh in the county, who 
wouldn't be? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a pleasure watching Reuben run," Navarrette said. "Usually I'm on 
top of some guy. I'll look up and see him fly by." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is almost as satisfying as a gentle crosswind during practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Line coach Dave Torres, no Slim Fast junkie himself, is to blame. He's the one 
who turns a blind eye to this cellulite tradition. Torres, in fact, enjoys it 
and joins in. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hang those things out and, suddenly, I don't look too bad for 35 years 
old," Torres said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, fun is fun, guys. But we beg you. Holster those puppies, would ya? Some 
of us have weak stomachs.

GROWING STRONGER UP FRONT; OFFENSIVE LINEMEN STAND OUT THIS YEAR

 Brett Samperi won't rest until he assumes his stance, peers through his 
battered face mask and sees only "dejection and fear," as he puts it, staring 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 The moment often arrives during the fourth quarter of San Clemente High School 
football games. Usually by then, Samperi, the Tritons' left tackle and captain, 
has hit, pushed, shoved and growled his way into his opponents' space -- 
physical and mental. 
</P>
<P>
 Blank looks from his beleaguered counterparts provide the signal; Samperi's 
job is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel so powerful when they just give up," Samperi said. "You might have 
already been in (many) plays, but you can still go out there and knock (a 
defensive lineman) around because all the tiredness goes away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're on top of a guy and beating on him mentally, that's what every 
offensive lineman dreams of." 
</P>
<P>
 Some high school football talent evaluators rate Samperi as the top player at 
his position in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Samperi, Kris Farris of Santa Margarita and Matt Motherway of Mater Dei are 
three of the county's many talented seniors along the offensive line who are 
piquing college recruiters' interest, a stark departure from the days when 
county quarterbacks were the coveted recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 This season's elite linemen know they won't move to the next level with the 
fanfare the "skill position" standouts of the past experienced, but they 
believe their contributions are the most significant to team success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game is won up front," Motherway said. "If you can win the battle at the 
line, you can win the game -- easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Samperi: "Protecting the quarterback or blowing a hole open makes me feel 
like I've done something really good. I know that helps us." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark McElroy is a believer. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy, San Clemente's football coach, relies on Samperi to lead the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best offensive lineman I've seen around (Orange County) in a long 
time," McElroy said. "He's taken on a strong leadership role this year and we 
count on him. He's the whole package." 
</P>
<P>
 A less-partial observer offers similar praise. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk about Samperi, you're talking about great size," said Allen 
Wallace, editor of SuperPrep magazine. "He's poised and ready to enter the 
class of the national elite. He's got a chance, which is more than a lot of 
prospects can say." 
</P>
<P>
 A two-year varsity starter, Samperi, 17, is 6 feet 5 and 275 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 His style is straightforward, swift and, if successful, painful to defensive 
linemen. If his opponents seem exuberant at the start of the final quarter, 
Samperi said he's doing something wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like hitting guys," Samperi said. "I like to knock them down and drive them 
over. It's great when you wear them down and coaches have to rotate other guys 
in against you." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Samperi, Farris and Motherway, also among the county's major Division I 
prospects, play left tackle. They know each other casually from meeting at 
scouting combines and by their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Their position has rapidly increased in prestige at all levels of football 
because left tackles are charged with protecting the blind side of right-handed 
quarterbacks. Faster, stronger pass rushers and sophisticated defenses threaten 
quarterbacks' safety and, consequently, the success of offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real tough playing left tackle," Motherway said. "You're all alone and 
it's one-on-one every play. Teams put their fastest guys on that side, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let that shaky talk fool you. Motherway, 18, is a rock for Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 The anchor of a talented Monarch line, Motherway (6-4, 255) is a two-year 
starter. He was selected first-team All-South Coast League as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Motherway's three older brothers were offensive linemen at Mater Dei. His 
brother, Ryan, was highly recruited and received a scholarship to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Farris (6-8, 275) became a starter as a junior. He is the largest of the three 
and possibly the best at pass protection. Santa Margarita coaches have measured 
Farris' arm span at 80 inches, which enables him to keep defenders away from 
his body and the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kris is a little bit faster than Brett," SuperPrep's Wallace said. "But 
basically, they're in the same type of situation. They might wind up calling 
all their own shots (on where they attend college)." 
</P>
<P>
 The trio's lists of suitors are long and distinguished. Samperi, Farris and 
Motherway said they are being recruited by almost every team in the Pacific 10 
Conference as well as other perennial national powers. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't surprise Mark Tennis. Tennis, executive editor of Cal-Hi Sports, 
said the entire crop of Orange County senior offensive linemen is strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of good kids," Tennis said. "There are a lot of big kids who 
tested well (at combines) and who are having good seasons. I'd say this one 
area is the best in Orange County this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this group is the first with skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Several former county prep standouts have distinguished themselves in college 
and the professional ranks. The Cincinnati Bengals' Dave Cadigan began 
harassing defenders at Newport Harbor High. Longtime Ram and current Pittsburgh 
Steeler Duval Love played at Fountain Valley. They were college stars at USC 
and UCLA, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 USC assistant coach Mike Sanford recruits in the county. Sanford said teams 
find good linemen here because there are many high-quality programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of really good high school football programs in Orange County," 
he said. "They're well run and they put a great emphasis on weight training, so 
you get good athletes who are getting bigger and stronger each year." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal-Hi's Tennis goes a step further. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of programs in Orange County are pretty advanced in terms of 
philosophy," Tennis said. "A lot of schools like to pass and they run the 
pro-set offense, which is more in line with what colleges do, so a lot of the 
kids are more technically proficient when it comes to pass blocking." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike recent years, however, the county seems to lack highly regarded players 
at the glamour positions -- such as quarterback and running back -- who usually 
own the media spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember there were years in the '80s when the quarterbacks were just 
incredible," said McElroy, San Clemente's coach. "Not that the quarterbacks now 
aren't fine, but these things tend to run in cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year there is a different group of positions that shine. It just seems 
this year there are some real outstanding offensive linemen." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing is, though, the top guys this season wanted to be anything but 
offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Santa Margarita) coaches just put me there because of my size," said 
Farris, 17. "I didn't know anything about the offensive line, but I really 
didn't want to play it because you don't get any glory. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have self motivation because you're not going to get your name in 
the newspaper a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulfillment, Samperi said, is achieved by the success of the line unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody wants to be an offensive lineman because nobody hears 
about them," he said. "But we're a unit on the field and we're all really good 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quarterback, running backs and receivers are all spread out, but we're 
together doing the same thing each play." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they're content with their roles, the acclaim of other positions 
still irks them a little. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call them 'skill' guys because they're a lot faster and more agile than 
we are, but playing the line takes a lot more skill than people think," 
Motherway said. "Playing the line is one of the toughest positions mentally, 
next to quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Fame might not come, but free college educations might for many county 
linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Lascola, owner of the Fallbrook-based Scouting Evaluation Assn., said 
that much is certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If colleges are looking for linemen," Lascola said, "they'll be looking in 
Orange County."

COUNTY HAS PROUD TRADITION ALL DOWN THE LINE; MANY FORMER O.C. LINEMEN REACH 
DIVISION I LEVEL, NFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years ago, a little-known assistant coach named Dave Wannstedt strolled 
into the office of La Habra football Coach Bob Rau with a proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Coach, I'm recruiting only two defensive linemen in California and 
Dan Owens is one of them,' " said Rau, now the head coach at Buena Park. "I 
knew from when Dan was a sophomore that he had Division I potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Owens discovered his potential in the NFL, and so did Wannstedt. Wannstedt, an 
assistant at USC from 1983-'85, is now the head coach of the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 After Owens became the only USC defender to start every game of a four-year 
career, the Detroit Lions selected him in the second round of the 1990 draft. 
He has started for the Lions since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens is one of many former Orange County linemen who have made it to the NFL. 
Some have won Super Bowls, some lost them. Some were highly touted prospects. 
Others came out of nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A look at some of the county's best linemen: SUPER BOWLED 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Parker has started for the Buffalo Bills and has played in the last four 
Super Bowls. But Parker, 28, never played a down of high school football. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker attended Edison High, where Coach Bill Workman led the Chargers to 
three Southern Section Big-Five championships from 1979-85. But Parker wasn't 
interested in football until until he got to Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might have been a blessing that he didn't play until after high school," 
said Ray Shackleford, Golden West's coach. "He wasn't burned out and there was 
no wear and tear on his body. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the first day we had him in practice, we knew he would be good. He was 
intelligent and learned things very quickly, he had great work habits to go 
with his great size and speed; he had everything it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry (Moon) Mullins, who played at Anaheim High and USC, has everything 
Parker wants. Parker has been to four Super Bowls, but Mullins, won four rings 
while playing with the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1971 to 1980. LINEMEN COUNTRY 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza Coach Gary Meek has sent many linemen into the collegiate ranks, 
including the Werner brothers, Matt (UCLA) and Bryan (Stanford), Mike Linn 
(UCLA) and James Rae (UCLA). But one of Meek's best is now at the NFL's 
doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenden Stai graduated from Esperanza in 1990 and signed a letter of intent 
with Nebraska. Stai, a 6-foot-4, 300-pound guard, could be a first-round draft 
choice in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches at Nebraska are saying he could be a No. 1 draft pick and that 
he's the best offensive lineman they've ever had," Meek said. "He could be a 
millionaire. I just hope he doesn't forget where he came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Travis Kirschke, The Times Orange County's lineman of the year in 
1991 and '92, has seen significant action at defensive tackle and nose guard 
for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Travis would have played on the (Esperanza) varsity as a freshman, but he 
wasn't old enough," Meek said. "He led us to the CIF title as a sophomore and 
again as a senior. Obviously, Travis and Brenden are two of the best we've 
had." A LEGEND 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago College football Coach Dave Ogas remembers an early meeting 
with Blaine Nye . . . on the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was at La Habra, I was a little, skinny, 6-3, 190-pounder jumping 
center against him," Ogas said. "He played basketball at Servite, and he was 
only 6-4 . . . but he was already a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Nye, who is in the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame, went on to play at 
Stanford. The Dallas Cowboys drafted Nye, a guard, in the fifth round of the 
1968 draft. He played with the Cowboys until 1976. THE DYNAMIC DUO 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton High once boasted an offensive line tandem of Keith Van Horne and 
Hoby Brenner, who each had successful careers at USC before playing for more 
than a decade in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Rau remembers how the pair plowed over his Lowell High squads in the 
mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had good teams but that was a guard-tackle combination that was pretty 
tough to beat," Rau said. "They just ran over us. It didn't take a Phi Beta 
Kappa to figure out how to use those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Horne, a 6-6, 277-pound offensive tackle, was an All-American in 1980 and 
played for the Bears from 1981-93. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenner, who was 6-4 and 205 pounds in high school, added 35 pounds at USC and 
became an All-Pac 10 tight end in 1979. He played for the New Orleans Saints 
from 1981-93. NO GUARANTEES 
</P>
<P>
 Success in high school or college doesn't necessarily ensure a fruitful 
professional career. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo said in the mid-1980s that guard Joe Garten was 
the best lineman he had ever coached. Garten was a two-time consensus 
All-American at Colorado who finished second to Miami's Russell Maryland in 
balloting for the 1990 Outland Trophy, which honors the country's top lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 Garten, who was 6-3, 283-pounds, wasn't selected until the sixth round by the 
Green Bay Packers. He was cut by the Rams in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Wilson of Santa Ana was named The Times Orange County's lineman of the 
year in 1988 and '89 but didn't sign with a Division I college. 
</P>
<P>
 After two seasons at Rancho Santiago, Wilson, a defensive tackle, is playing 
at Cal State Northridge, a Division I-AA school. Wilson leads the American West 
Conference in sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garten didn't stay in the NFL and Wilson is a longshot to make the 
pros, plenty of others have enjoyed lengthy careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Brent Boyd played at a high school, Lowell, that used to belong to the 
Fullerton Union District but no longer exists. He earned a scholarship to UCLA 
and played with the Minnesota Vikings from 1980-'86. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Duval Love (Fountain Valley, UCLA, Rams and Pittsburgh Steelers) and 
offensive tackle Dave Cadigan (Newport Harbor, USC, New York Jets and 
Cincinnati Bengals) are in their 10th and seventh seasons in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 And the county has produced memorable linemen, for other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1992 we had a defensive lineman Kaio Amua," Ogas said. "He went to Mater 
Dei and Los Amigos where he had some personal and academic problems; he didn't 
play much in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now he is the starting fullback at Texas El Paso. He was a good athlete, 
but the biggest thing was that we helped turned his life around. Those are the 
ones you remember too."

FAITH IN THE SYSTEM; INMATES ACROSS THE NATION ARE TURNING TO RELIGION IN SOME 
FORM. BUT IS IT SINCERE OR SPIN CONTROL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY RIVENBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indiana state prisoner No. 922335, better known as boxing-champ-turned-rapist 
Mike Tyson, converts to Islam in the tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Deposed Panamanian president (and drug smuggler) Manuel Noriega encounters 
Jesus while doing time in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wall Street wizard Ivan Boesky grows a rabbinical beard and studies 
Judaism behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the nation, jailhouse solitude seems to have a way of stirring inmate 
introspection and spiritual interest. In Los Angeles, O.J. Simpson is said to 
be reading the Bible. In other cities, everyone from convicted cannibal Jeffrey 
Dahmer to Manson Family member Tex Watson has joined the cavalcade of converts. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it sincere remorse or cynical spin control? Prison religion presents a 
baffling juxtaposition of good and evil, one that has inspired wonder, 
skepticism -- and a sometimes strange array of ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to representatives of such established deities as Allah and 
Christ, inmates have followed maharishis, voodoo practitioners, Scientologists, 
medicine men and the infamous Church of the New Song, a prison-based faith 
whose sacraments were sherry and steak. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicts have also been known to profess an interest in studying Scripture -- 
occasionally because contraband has been hidden in hollowed-out Bibles, but 
more often because of genuine spiritual longing. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are too quick to assume that jailhouse converts (are faking)," says 
UCLA law professor John Shepard Wiley Jr., a former federal prosecutor. 
"Actually, prison is the kind of environment that might well prompt a 
conversion. It's a shattering . . . monkish existence . . . a complete change 
in your life. Sure, some turn to the worst instincts. But I don't think it's 
implausible that some turn to the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for many inmates, God offers the only real shot at secular as well as 
spiritual salvation, says Whitney T. Kuniholm, executive vice president for 
Prison Fellowship USA, the Christian ministry founded by Watergate ex-con 
Charles Colson: 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have job programs, literacy programs, drug programs and educational 
programs, but unless something changes on the inside (of a person), that stuff 
isn't going to make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soul-searching inmates turn to religion for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial factors usually have little to do with spirituality," says Don 
Smarto, a former probation officer and assistant warden who now directs the 
Institute for Prison Ministries at the Billy Graham Center in Wheaton, Ill. "On 
a psychological level, they're bargaining . . . praying for a miraculous 
intervention (to get them out of jail)." 
</P>
<P>
 They might also be enamored with the tranquillity of penitentiary chapels, the 
doughnuts and cookies offered by some prison ministries or the chance to mingle 
with women volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But God can use any motivation to reach someone," says Bill Moors, a 
Seventh-day Adventist chaplain at Vacaville. 
</P>
<P>
 That also is the philosophy behind Dallas-based Bill Glass Ministries, which 
travels to prisons with an entourage of magicians, comedians, karate 
demonstrators, yo-yo champions, musicians, NASCAR racing vehicles, Christian 
motorcyclists and a spate of celebrities (such as former quarterback Roger 
Staubach, boxer Ernie Shavers and jewel thief Jack (Murph the Surf) Murphy). 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that will draw them out to a meeting" is used, explains Glass 
spokeswoman Coleen Rohrer. Once there, the hope is that somehow the message 
will connect and inspire deeper introspection. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 Rutgers University study concluded that prisoners seek God to cope with 
"depression, guilt and self-contempt" and to gain "a sense of self-control, an 
ability to restrain anger." 
</P>
<P>
 They don't necessarily do it with Christianity, however. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West, Native American spiritual leaders conduct sweat lodge ceremonies 
for prisoners. Incarcerated converts to Judaism celebrate bar mitzvahs. And 
among black prisoners, recruits to Islam number about 30,000 a year, according 
to research by the American Muslim Council. 
</P>
<P>
 (Christian conversion experiences run as high as 150,000 a year among the 
nation's 1 million inmates, but most "commitments to Christ" don't last and 
some prisoners convert several times annually, says Rutgers criminal justice 
professor Todd Clear.)  
</P>
<P>
 Penitentiaries also have granted access to Rosicrucians, astrologers, gurus 
and witches. During the 1970s, California inmates dabbled in Zen Buddhism. 
"Prison is an ideal place to meditate," a Zen master told Newsweek at the time. 
"We teach you to look at a wall to start meditation -- (and) prisons have lots 
of walls." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Zen isn't even on the map. Also gone is Transcendental Meditation, 
whose leaders decided California should pay $1,500 per inmate for yoga 
training, an offer the state meditated upon and declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Another offbeat '70s ministry was the Church of the New Song. The 
Atlanta-based inmate religion won official recognition in 1973, says Newsweek, 
but a U.S. District Court judge labeled it a "colossal fraud." The tip-off: a 
requisition form for liturgical materials that included 98 bottles of Harvey's 
Bristol Cream and 700 steaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison voodoo rituals were viewed more favorably. In a court order allowing 
them, Smarto says, "The only proviso was that (inmates) couldn't put a curse on 
the warden." 
</P>
<P>
 Voodoo and steaks aside, the 1970s saw an upswing of missionary activity in 
U.S. prisons. From Sing Sing to San Quentin, hundreds of churches and other 
organizations blitzed inmates with Bible studies, seminars, Catholic Cursillo 
retreats and guest appearances by Pat Boone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the God Squad continues to grow. Protestants alone operate at least 
2,000 prison ministry groups nationwide, Smarto says. And in California, 80 
staff chaplains and 15,000 volunteers work with the state's 125,000 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The results, however, are unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1990 Prison Fellowship study of 360 ex-cons, for example, found that 40% of 
those who were heavily involved in Fellowship programs in jail committed new 
crimes after release (compared with 51% of the non-Christian group). 
</P>
<P>
 That's more impressive than it might sound, says Rutgers professor Clear, but 
the study is flawed and additional analyses are needed. If similar numbers can 
be produced, he says, it's encouraging news: "If a (prison job-skills) program 
had those results, I would be quite enthusiastic about it. Changing human 
behavior isn't an easy enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Converts to Islam also have a tough time. Black Muslims are actually somewhat 
more likely to return to prison than other ex-inmates, says researcher Fareed 
Nu'man of the American Muslim Council. In contrast, 20 years ago, Muslims 
hardly ever went back to jail, he says. But there were more extensive support 
programs then. 
</P>
<P>
 And outside, it's easy to forget about God. 
</P>
<P>
 Prisoners are just like anybody else, says the Rev. Nick Ristad, president of 
the 125-member Associated Chaplains in California State Service. "How many 
people go to church when they have a death in the family or a crisis?" he asks. 
"And how many stay there once the crisis is over?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason Mormons, for one, won't baptize inmates until they're out of 
jail and finished with probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The best test of faith, everyone seems to agree, is time.  
</P>
<P>
 Smarto recalls the college-educated drug dealer who left jail in 1990 and took 
up residence with his former chaplain's family in Florida. He became a youth 
leader at church and an assistant chaplain at the local jail. The turnabout was 
so impressive that Smarto videotaped the man's testimony and sponsored a 
fund-raiser when the ex-con announced he had throat cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cancer turned out to be a ruse and the chaplain soon discovered 
$84,000 in forged credit card charges. When the scam came to light, the former 
felon shot and killed himself in the chaplain's summer cottage, leaving behind 
a message in which he hoped for divine forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Understandably, judges and parole boards rarely put much faith in convict 
conversions, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such an incentive to fabricate that it's difficult to be convincing," 
UCLA's Wiley explains. "The problem is that the best evidence of a genuine 
conversion comes after a person leaves prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many penitentiary religious experiences do seem lasting and sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the Mafia hit man who was led to Christianity by letters from a 
teen-age girl, got paroled, married the girl's mother and now runs his own 
prison ministry in Kansas. And the Florida cocaine dealer who wrestled with his 
conscience in lockup, persuaded a skeptical sheriff to help him get a lighter 
sentence and recently was called a "one-man crime prevention team" by the 
Orlando Sentinel. The list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most famous, of course, was Malcolm X. He switched from pimp to 
Muslim in the 1950s, setting the stage for his role as a leader of the Nation 
of Islam and an indelible influence upon many African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, the percentage of inmates whose conversions stick is 
probably "closer to 5% than 50%," says Clear, although he notes that no precise 
figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavily publicized prison epiphanies seem to provoke the most skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 When Colson announced in the middle of the Watergate scandal that he had found 
God, Washington scoffed. And similar disbelief has arisen over the spiritual 
transformations of Dahmer (who reportedly was baptized in a medical ward 
whirlpool), David (Son of Sam) Berkowitz, and Noriega, who accepted Jesus in a 
jail cell that he described as "like unto a cave." 
</P>
<P>
 Another proselytized prisoner who has spurred debate is Manson follower 
Watson. Although victim Rosemary LaBianca's daughter has met with and forgiven 
him, prosecutors and other observers -- including Smarto -- harbor doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, speculation has focused on O.J. Simpson. Although the exact 
nature of his spiritual interest isn't clear, UCLA's Wiley isn't surprised by 
reports of Simpson studying Scriptures in "the hole" (prison parlance for 
solitary confinement). 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone who would casually go for a burger in a Rolls-Royce unquestionably 
finds (the lack of freedom) just terrible," Wiley says. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was serial killer Ted Bundy. The night before his execution, he 
reportedly professed belief in Christ. But earlier, he had converted to 
Hinduism (because it was the only way to get the prison's special vegetarian 
diet). And before that -- when he was out of prison -- he had been a Methodist, 
a Mormon and a Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Kuniholm says, it's impossible to tell when a jailhouse conversion 
is real: "Only God knows what's going on in a person's heart."

DOCTORS FIGHT HOMOPHOBIA WITH NAME CHANGE

 Benjamin Schatz hopes he will never again be asked to explain just what his 
organization stands for. 
</P>
<P>
 As of today, the American Assn. of Physicians for Human Rights will dump its 
ambiguous name in favor of a more descriptive one: the Gay and Lesbian Medical 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco-based group, which has more than 1,500 physician and medical 
student members, chose National Coming Out Day to make the announcement because 
"AAPHR finally comes out of the closet," says Dr. Robert Cabaj, president of 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our name has kept us hidden for the last 12 years or so," Cabaj says. "People 
in the know knew who we were. But I think we've learned that to fight the 
impact of homophobia on health care, we need to be much more open about who we 
really are. It should, hopefully, instill a new sense of pride in the members." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision did not come about easily, however. A preliminary ballot on 
changing the group's name taken last summer yielded a 178-125 vote in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the group's annual meeting last month, a vote at a members' 
symposium produced only three votes against and 97 in favor, says Schatz, 
executive director of the association. 
</P>
<P>
 Care will be taken to protect members' identities -- for example, mailings 
will still use the AAPHR title.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the group's leaders expect a few member resignations and some public 
backlash. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when the group tried to run an advertisement recruiting members in 
a major medical journal, the publication turned it down. And that was under the 
old name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mainstream medical organizations might feel uncomfortable about putting 
the words gay and lesbian in their advertisements," Cabaj acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also have concerns about their continued ability to raise funds to 
sponsor programs on HIV prevention, lesbian health issues and the prevention of 
gay teen suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process of coming out as a group will be the same as with an individual: 
Will people like you? Will this hurt you financially? Will this limit your 
options?" Schatz says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of other groups will be watching us to see how we weather the 
change," he says. "But it makes life easier to operate with self-respect."

YOUR BODY: TALK SHOWS, MOVIES, MUSIC . . . AT THE DENTIST?  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Dentophobics, as they're known in the trade, have fewer excuses for bad teeth 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Dentists are striving to make their milieu more tolerable for the estimated 35 
million Americans who become anxious just thinking about a routine visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology is one part of the stress-reduction scenario. In some dental 
offices, it's now possible to watch your favorite talk show or movie as you're 
drilled and filled. There's a new anesthetic-filled dental patch under study, 
meant to make the injection less painful. 
</P>
<P>
 Improved interpersonal skills are playing a role. Dentists are becoming more 
sensitive, inquiring about fears and trying to ease them. Channel Surfing: 
Before Sharron Walker settled in recently for a one-hour gum surgery, her 
dentist's assistant asked if she'd like to watch television. That sounded like 
a fine idea to the 47-year-old Santa Monica administrative assistant, who says 
she's "really sensitive to pain" in her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 She was handed what looked like a pair of oversized ski goggles with stereo 
earphones -- and was soon immersed in a talk show, all but forgetting about the 
oral activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker was wearing Virtual Vision Rx, introduced to dentists late last year. 
The system is connected to VCRs or video games. It has a built-in display 
monitor that projects the video image onto a lens inside the goggle and in 
front of the right eye, says Melissa Pearson, a spokeswoman for Virtual Vision, 
the Redmond, Wash.-based maker. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patient can adjust the focus," she says, "so that the image appears to 
float out in front of you." Patients can view movies, watch television or play 
video games. The dentist has access to a mute button in case he or she needs to 
talk with the patient. The Trend: About 10 dentists in the Los Angeles area and 
more than 1,000 nationwide now use the $800 system, says Pearson, who expects 
to target the podiatrist market next. The firm began marketing the system to 
dentists when some requested it after seeing the consumer version marketed by 
telephone. The Reviews: "It seems to be an exceptional stress reducer," says 
Dr. Victor Pineschi, the Brentwood periodontist who performed Walker's surgery 
and is one of the first dentists to offer the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is especially useful when patients undergo lengthy procedures such 
as multiple fillings or crown work, adds Dr. Christine Dumas, a Marina del Rey 
dentist. She invites her patients to choose from her video collection, which 
includes "The Sound of Music" and "Top Gun." 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing is not to sing along," Dumas says. Like many other 
dentists, Dumas and Pineschi say they also have no objection to patients 
listening to Walkmans during lengthy procedures. Some dentists even supply the 
headsets. Low-Tech Talk: All the high-tech gadgets won't help, Dumas 
emphasizes, if the dentist and patient don't communicate. "All these advances 
are helpful adjuncts," says Dumas, who is also a consumer adviser for the 
American Dental Assn. and a USC assistant professor of clinical dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
 An enlightened dentist, she says, will always ask a new patient, "Have you had 
any bad experiences in a dental office?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The dentist needs to find out what happened and when," Dumas says. Was the 
experience firsthand? Or did it happen to a friend? 
</P>
<P>
 Dental anxiety is often traceable to a traumatic dental experience in early 
childhood, some research suggests, while a lower-than-usual pain threshold is 
at the root of other discomfort. Numbed to the Max: For years, dentists have 
used an anesthetic spray or gel to numb the area where the local anesthetic 
will be injected. Now, there's a patch under study that developers hope will 
numb the area even better. 
</P>
<P>
 Developed by Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Miami, the patch is about an inch 
long and three-quarters of an inch wide, says Mitchell Goldberg, Noven's 
executive vice president. "It looks like a thick piece of Scotch tape," says 
Dr. Milton Houpt, chairman of the department of pediatric dentistry at the 
University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, Newark, and one of the 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The patch is filled with lidocaine, a common dental anesthetic. It's left in 
place for a few minutes and then removed before the injection. The patch might 
numb the area more effectively than gels or sprays, researchers speculate, 
because it keeps the medicine concentrated at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Noven plans to ask for Food and Drug Administration approval to market the 
patch soon.

BODY WATCH; SURVIVAL OF THE LEANEST; WOULD YOU RATHER BE PINCHED, DUNKED OR 
HAVE AN ELECTRIC CURRENT RUN ALONG YOUR BODY? EXPERTS SAY THOSE ARE THE MOST 
ACCURATE WAYS TO FIND OUT JUST WHAT PERCENTAGE OF YOU IS MADE UPOF -- YUCK -- 
FAT.

<P>
 I've never been fond of tests that you can't study for, or at least cheat on. 
Nevertheless, I recently submitted my body for three tests to determine just 
how much of me is fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Body-fat testing is considered to be a helpful measure of health and fitness. 
It's not the only measure -- you also have to consider cardiovascular fitness, 
strength and flexibility. But, as health indicators go, it's a lot more useful 
than body weight. When you step on a scale, you get the grand total of your 
fat, muscle, body fluid, bones and connective tissue. This, experts say, is 
useless information. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a huge number of people who are very low weight but who are very 
fatty," says Bonnie Modugno, a Santa Monica nutrition consultant. At the same 
time, athletes might be considered heavy by traditional standards, when in fact 
they're just packed with muscle, which weighs more than fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Body-fat tests distinguish between fat and "lean body mass." So what's a good 
score? For women, the optimal range is considered to be 18% to 25% fat; for 
men, it's about 12% to 18%. (Experts disagree on the precise numbers.) Studies 
suggest that women who exceed 30% to 32% fat and men who exceed 20% to 22% fat 
are at increased risk for such conditions as heart disease, high blood pressure 
and diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 But, experts emphasize, being too lean (not a problem here) is risky as well. 
"Once females start dropping below 17% body fat, we start seeing an increased 
incidence of menstrual period problems," says Sheila King, coordinator of the 
UCLA Extension Certificated Program in Fitness Instruction. Erratic or absent 
periods can lead to a host of serious medical problems such as permanent bone 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say you shouldn't put too much stock in body-fat results because every 
testing method has room for error and because body fat is only one measure of 
overall health. "It's just a tool," Modugno says. "People can get so neurotic 
about these numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, I set out to quantify my fat. Pinch an Inch 
</P>
<P>
 First I tried the cheapest and most convenient method of body-fat testing: the 
skin-fold caliper. A caliper looks, more or less, like a gun with salad tongs 
attached. When your tester fires, the tongs pinch your skin and a gauge 
measures the hunk of fat in millimeters. The tester pinches three, four or five 
points on your body and plugs the results into corresponding formulas that 
estimate your body fat. 
</P>
<P>
 Calipers have a margin of error of about 4%, but the results can be skewed 
more if the tester pinches too much skin, not enough skin or the wrong site. 
</P>
<P>
 I went to L.A. Fitness in Woodland Hills, where I was pinched by Kevin Lewis, 
president of State of the Art Fitness, the club's personal trainers. Lewis 
measured four points on my body: the biceps, the triceps, the subscapular 
(otherwise known as the hunk of blubber below your shoulder blade) and the 
suprailiac (the hunk of blubber above your hip). 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get the wrong idea: These pinches hurt -- almost as much as when my Aunt 
Rae would maul my cheek on the holidays. But Aunt Rae pinched me only once or 
twice a year. Lewis pinched each site three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "For accuracy," he said, at which point I decided Congress should have 
included skin-fold calipers in the recent ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 I waited anxiously as Lewis did the calculations. My score: 26.5%. I was less 
than elated, especially when he handed me a sheet of paper and circled 
"moderately unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 I once showed up for a job interview wearing jeans; that was moderately 
unacceptable. But my body? My 27-year-old body that bicycles 150 miles a week? 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis tested me again, this time pinching three sites on my body. The result: 
24.4%. I concluded that the three-site test was more accurate than the 
four-site test. Slam Dunk 
</P>
<P>
 My search for an even more accurate result led me to the Centinela Hospital 
Fitness Institute in Culver City for what experts consider the most precise 
body-fat testing method: underwater weighing. It's also expensive -- about $50 
-- and cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
 You sit on a scale in a tank of water, and your underwater weight is then 
plugged into a mathematical equation. It's all based on the premise that muscle 
sinks and fat floats. Fat is less dense than water, whereas muscle is more 
dense; the more fat you have, the more your body wants to float when dunked 
under water. The margin of error for underwater weighing is about 2% to 2 1/2% 
for young to middle-aged adults. The test is less accurate for children, older 
adults and extremely lean people. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for my physiologist to dunk me, I glanced at the TV, which was 
tuned to "Market Talk" on the Business Channel. "The cash/bond yield is at 
7.44% and utilities are up 2.17," the anchorman said. Then I thought I heard 
him say, "The Dow is up about 3 1/2% and Suzanne Schlosberg's body fat is up 8 
1/2% after a week of heavy eating." But I must have imagined that part. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes I was greeted by my cheery physiologist, Jim Erwin, 
director of the institute's Clinical Testing and Exercise Programs. I followed 
him to the 6-foot-high cylindrical testing tank -- basically a giant version of 
the pot I boil pasta in. 
</P>
<P>
 I slowly climbed the four steps up to the tank, imagining that I was headed 
for the gallows. Then I stumbled over the ledge and plopped myself onto the 
clear plastic scale in the center of the tank. The water was hotter than I'd 
expected -- 98.6 degrees. Floating in four feet of water, I felt like a giant 
piece of fusilli . 
</P>
<P>
 Erwin told me to blow the air out of my lungs and lean forward until I was 
completely submerged. "If there's any air trapped in your lungs, it'll look 
like you're fatter than you really are," he said. This I did not need. I blew 
hard. I remained underwater for about five unnerving seconds as my weight 
registered on the digital scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, however, I hadn't blown out all my air, and Erwin didn't get a 
good reading. He told me to relax for a few moments before trying again. "This 
is the most accurate method, except for killing someone and peeling off their 
fat," he offered while we passed the time. 
</P>
<P>
 I dunked a total of five times, weighing an average 1.74 kilograms. I like 
hearing my weight in kilograms because I have absolutely no idea what it means. 
</P>
<P>
 My body fat turned out to be 23.1%. I decided to celebrate with lunch at 
Gratis, the new fat-free restaurant in Brentwood. Zap 
</P>
<P>
 Since I seemed to be on a roll -- having dropped from 26.5% with calipers to 
23.1% with underwater weighing -- I decided to get my fat tested by another 
popular method: bioelectrical impedance. 
</P>
<P>
 You lie on your back while a signal travels from an electrode on your foot to 
an electrode on your hand. The faster the signal, the more muscle mass you 
have. This is because water conducts electricity, and muscle is 70% water. Fat, 
on the other hand, is just 5% to 13% water. It "impedes" the signal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bioelectrical impedance, which costs about $50, is considered to be less 
accurate than underwater weighing and perhaps more accurate than skin-fold 
calipers. But, as my tester, nutrition consultant Modugno, explained, the 
results are often skewed. If you're dehydrated, the machine overestimates. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, you're not supposed to exercise, drink alcohol, take 
laxatives or consume caffeine for 24 to 36 hours before the test, and you're 
not supposed to eat for at least three hours prior. 
</P>
<P>
 Modugno taped electrodes to my right foot and hand. I was hoping the signal 
would zoom through me like a Japanese bullet train. But it traveled more like 
my mom's old Chevy station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the estimate is high," Modugno said, not offering any number in 
particular. I didn't ask. "Let's do the calipers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Modugno pinched five sites on my body, yanking my fat again and again until 
she was satisfied with the measurement. She said this was more complete than 
the three- and four-site tests because people store fat differently. Some 
people carry most of their fat in their arms and legs, she said, whereas others 
carry more in their torso. Three-site tests generally favor one region or the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the five-site test, she calculated my body fat to be 23.6%. Only then 
did she show me the computer printout from the impedance machine, which came up 
with a score of 27.1. Modugno said I probably was dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, she said, my body fat is about average for a woman my age, and it 
does not necessarily correlate with my level of fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing wrong with average," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't going to argue. It sure was better than moderately unacceptable.

 The Scene: Sunday's seventh annual "Cool Comedy -- Hot Cuisine" fund-raiser 
for the Scleroderma Research Foundation at the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel. 
The concept of combining restaurant chefs and stand-up comics has been such a 
success, "We're thinking of taking it on the road with a chuck wagon," Lily 
Tomlin said. "If they're fed well, audiences are more forgiving of the comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Foundation founder Sharon Monsky and 500 guests, including 
Diane Keaton, Linda Gray, Marilu Henner and Robert Lieberman, Vincent 
Schiavelli, Kelly Lynch, Richard Benjamin and Paula Prentiss and Lesley Ann 
Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hot Cuisine: From Border Grill chefs Susan Feniger and Mary Sue Milliken 
came a fideo soup of roasted noodle and smoked chili broth; salad of quinoa, 
grilled cactus and smoked beans, and a main course of Chilean sea bass 
veracruzana . 
</P>
<P>
 The Cool Comedy: Beginning with Bob Saget (who received this year's Founder's 
Award), it proceeded with Tomlin as her pearl-drenched, Diana Vreeland-esque 
character Madame Lupe, "the world's oldest living beauty expert" (her advice to 
Somerset Maugham, "whose furrowed forehead fell in folds over his eyes like a 
theatrical curtain," was, "live by candlelight"); Garry Shandling on his 
Arizona childhood ("They say it's a dry heat. So's a welding torch, but you 
don't put your face in it"); George Wallace on his confusion over the O.J. 
Simpson case ("I don't know who to believe, 'Hard Copy' or 'Inside Edition' "), 
and Robin Williams on the irrationality of living in Southern California ("How 
many signs do you need? There's fire, floods, earthquakes -- all you need is 
toads. Maybe earthquakes are God's way of redecorating. 'Freeway!? Here!? I 
don't think so.' ").

 The Cause: Scleroderma is an often fatal, degenerative disease that causes 
hardening of the skin and internal organs and afflicts an estimated 500,000 
Americans. "This disease is vastly underfunded, tragically unknown to the 
public and deserves all the research money it can get," said Dr. Bruce Wintroub 
of UC San Francisco's School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: With tickets priced from $250 to $1,000, more than $300,000 was 
raised. A spirited live auction was led by John Moschitta Jr. (the fast talker 
of the famed Federal Express ads), who said his aim is "to suck the crowd as 
dry as I can and make them feel good about it." He disengaged $10,000 from 
Williams when the comic bought a "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" walk-on part 
for his daughter.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; A GLOBAL TRIP WITH A BIKER OF INDUSTRY; INVESTMENT 
BIKER BY JIM ROGERS ; RANDOM HOUSE $25, 416 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jim Rogers is filthy rich -- or, rather, road-dust rich, since this self-made 
multi-upon-multimillionaire recently celebrated what he calls his "freedom from 
capital" by going on a global odyssey with his companion, Tabitha Estabrook. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ironic ways, Rogers' saga is no different from that of any other 
menopausal male: 50 looms in front of him like a monolith, so he hooks up with 
a woman about half his age and hits the road. What separates him from others in 
the not-so-young and restless population is that he's made it, and then some.  
</P>
<P>
 Rogers -- like Willy Loman's brother, Ben, in "Death of a Salesman" -- walked 
into the jungle of the stock market as a young man, and when he walked out at 
37, by God, he was rich. As half of the insanely successful Quantum Fund in the 
1970s, he'd made money all over the world. So, in 1980, he retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later he was prepared to survey what was essentially his domain; the 
countries where he'd either made money already or thought he might make more in 
the future. He intended to circle the globe -- west to east across Eurasia and 
China, east to west across Siberia, back to Ireland, from the top of Africa to 
the Cape, through Australia's desert, and from Argentina to Alaska. If that 
wasn't challenge enough, he planned to do it on a motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 This book is the chronicle of that trip, which reads something like "The Wall 
Street Journal Goes Around the World in Eighty Days." Rogers certainly is 
interested in adventure; the man is rich enough to buy the countries he's 
attracted to and persuade them to relocate near his front yard, but instead he 
goes through countries that even poor people wouldn't normally pick as a 
vacation site. 
</P>
<P>
 He is at his bike's mercy, but he has an imperial manner, so Estabrook, the 
pragmatist and bike novice, trains as a mechanic; theoretically, she can solve 
any problem that comes up.  
</P>
<P>
 But theory is not practice, and understanding a bike is not the same as being 
experienced either as a driver or maintenance artist. In what seems to me some 
of the most revealing material in the book, the early days involve a lot of 
Rogers looking in his mirror and not being able to find his traveling 
companion.  
</P>
<P>
 She can't quite keep up with her road-seasoned pal -- and although he 
castigates himself when he's done dusting her off, a few days later he's 
showboating again and wondering if it was a bad idea to bring her along. 
</P>
<P>
 The travelogue is leavened with Rogers' observations on which foreign 
countries are worth investing in and why, as well as historical anecdotes. 
Rogers is the sort of cowboy who makes for fascinating reading, but I find 
myself wary of him at the same time. "If you want to change your life," he 
writes, "do it." Nice advice from a man who probably could squander money for 
the rest of his life and still come out ahead; not quite so functional, 
perhaps, for a regular Joe or Jane trying to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers has an emotional epiphany during his journey and decides he's ready for 
a committed relationship, but perhaps the right woman just hasn't come along. 
For now, he is a man without obligations, a man who never has to ask himself 
the question, "What if?" 
</P>
<P>
 And he seems vastly entertained by his life -- a happy enough situation for 
anyone to be in, but finally, more of a fantasy than a fact. Read him for fun, 
for the vicarious thrill of a wanderer's life from the comfort of your 
armchair, but don't go cashing in the kids' college fund to buy up real estate 
in Zambia.

FINDING AN INTIMACY AMONG STRANGERS

 Long live the bicycle! It is a friend to man, like the horse. -- Henry Miller 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Had I been more courageous or foolhardy, I might have proceeded on. But the 
rain and lightning spooked me, and I pulled off Route 412 to wait out the storm 
and recharge my spirits before heading into the desolate Oklahoma Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I declare, you look a mess," the motel clerk said as I wheeled my bicycle 
into the lobby. I explained that I had fixed a flat tire a few miles back and 
couldn't avoid getting lathered up with the chain's grease. "Soap'll fix you," 
she observed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since leaving Pawnee at dawn -- where a kindly merchant the previous night had 
found me a room of sorts in an abandoned five-unit motel -- I had covered 72 
miles, and Enid's grain silos looming on the horizon were a welcome sight. 
Enid, 1,575 miles from my home in Virginia, took me into the second half of my 
journey to California, and from my saddlebags I withdrew a new, untattered map, 
marked "The Western United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The America I glide through at 10 m.p.h. is an America I had forgotten 
existed. It is a place where kids wear caps with the visor facing forward and 
John Deere is a more popular logo than the Chicago Bulls. Keys are left in the 
ignition of parked pickups, the little churches that seem to stand guard over 
every crossroad are full on Sundays, and the end of harvest is celebrated with 
a potluck picnic at the community park. 
</P>
<P>
 In towns such as Skiatook, Okla., and Mountain View, Ark., and a score of 
places in between, the talk these days is not of Haiti or the November 
elections. It's of weather and corn and high school football teams and all the 
things that are small and personal. In a cafe in Pryor, Okla., I asked the 
meaning of the words written on a plastic jug: "Donations for the Alton O'Bar 
Family." The waitress replied, as though no further explanation were necessary, 
"Verna died. Didn't you hear?" 
</P>
<P>
 The intimacy with the people and the land that I have shared over the past 
weeks I attribute not to any great wisdom or sensitivity on my part, but merely 
to the fact that I am on a bicycle. There is time to think and listen. It is an 
entirely different way to travel, as part of, rather than isolated from, one's 
surroundings. It restores what the interstates have taken from us -- the 
serendipity of the open road. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose many true cyclists would scoff at the 53 miles a day or so I cover 
as rather wimpish. Indeed, that's the precise distance the stagecoach used to 
log daily on the 1,200-mile run from New York City to Savannah, Ga., way back 
in 1802. But I find it remarkable that my 54-year-old, out-of-shape body 
accepts such demands, and my friends agree. When I called one the other night 
to report that I had made it to Oklahoma, he said: "Amazing! I want licensing 
rights on your body. We're going to sell it to the Smithsonian." 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't mention to him, though, that way back in Virginia, during the first 
week of the crossing, I spent several days scheming to abort my harebrained 
adventure. My right knee had given out. My butt hurt. I was lonely. The endless 
miles seemed tedious and boring. Only the humiliation of limping home on the 
Greyhound and having to admit failure kept me pedaling toward the next town and 
beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 So now the Appalachians, the Smokies and the Ozarks are behind me. Ahead lies 
the Oklahoma Panhandle -- which on the maps of the 1870s was identified as "No 
Man's Land" -- and the Rockies and, one day, the Pacific. It's difficult to 
imagine a time when I didn't sleep with my bike next to the bed and start every 
day by heading down an unknown road. 
</P>
<P>
 The other night, in a speck of a sleeping Oklahoma town, sitting alone on a 
grassy stretch along Highway 64, I called my wife on the cellular phone I 
carry. Much to my amazement the call bounced off some faraway satellite and 
found its way, crystal clear, into my kitchen. Sandy greeted me, then asked 
what I have been asking myself often these past weeks: "Where are you?" Off and 
Pedaling
