MOVIE REVIEW; STREEP ADDS DEPTH TO 'RIVER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The River Wild" takes your breath away two times over. And if the excitement 
of its climactic scenes of white water rafting on roller coaster waterways is 
not a surprise, the thrill of seeing Meryl Streep give a rip-roaring 
performance sort of is. 
</P>
<P>
 Sort of because over the last five years, starting with "She-Devil" and ending 
with "Death Becomes Her" and "The House of the Spirits," the nine-time 
Oscar-nominated actress has made such curious acting choices it has been 
possible to forget just how potent a talent she possesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The River Wild," crisply directed by Curtis Hanson, wipes the slate clean. In 
her role as wife, mother and former white-water guide, Streep powerfully shows 
us what we've been missing, demonstrating such a radiant forcefulness, plus an 
easy facility with an impressive range of emotions, that she pretty much 
upstages even the on-rushing rapids. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Denis O'Neill (with uncredited additions from a number of sources), 
"River Wild" does have occasional plot problems, but it is one of the few 
thrillers as concerned with character as it is with action. And it shows anyone 
still laboring under the delusion that Jamie Lee Curtis' role in "True Lies" 
was some kind of lofty role model of exactly what a heroic woman's part looks 
like. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time we see Streep's character, Gail, both she and the water she is 
moving over are noticeably tranquil. In smooth, easy strokes, Gail rows a scull 
along Boston's Charles River, her mastery of the boat obvious and impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home, as the mother of a young son and daughter and the wife of a 
workaholic architect named Tom (David Strathairn) who habitually neglects his 
family, Gail is less in control and in fact worried that her marriage is in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 On tap for everyone is a visit to Gail's parents somewhere in the West, and, 
potentially a relationship enhancer, a chance for son Roarke (Joseph Mazzello) 
to travel with Gail and Tom down the very river his mother used to be a guide 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 Also rafting at the same time are a trio of tough-looking men, led by the 
handsome, muscular Wade (a buff Kevin Bacon). Wade acts awfully friendly, 
chatting with Roarke about Jane's Addiction and lightly flirting with Gail, but 
there is something vaguely disturbing about his demeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 This particular river turns out to have some unnerving characteristics. 
Bracketed by high cliffs on both sides, it is an almost impossible place to 
walk out of. And it ends in a horrific series of rapids, ominously known as the 
Gauntlet, that Gail ran when she was young and headstrong but are now illegal 
to cross because several people have died in the attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, circumstances lead the increasingly sinister Wade and 
company to attach themselves to Gail and her family, bringing on all manner of 
dramatic situations. Director Hanson, best known for "The Hand That Rocks the 
Cradle," does a skillful job of getting the most out of this material, helped 
by Bacon's striking ability to play both the attractive and the frightening 
aspects of his character. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not mean, however, that "River" is without its problematic aspects, 
starting with standard-issue touches like a loyal family dog named Maggie and 
an inability to find a satisfying, creditable role for Gail's superfluous 
husband, Tom. Similarly, though it is strong in basic outline, "River's" script 
has difficulty overall coming up with incidents that don't feel like filler 
intended to kill time until the climax. 
</P>
<P>
 Those scenes, set inevitably on that dread Gauntlet, are certainly rousing. 
Filmed by director of photography Robert Elswit on three different rivers (two 
in Montana and one in Oregon), the water shots are models of outdoor action 
footage, so vivid and realistic we just about feel the spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Streep apparently did almost all of her own work on the river, which was 
considerable, and she is as convincing in the heroic physical mode as she is in 
the film's more feeling scenes, where her face mirrors emotions from confused 
shyness to frightening rage. 
</P>
<P>
 Having abandoned for a while the portrayal of real people, Streep demonstrates 
here that what great actresses do is show us ordinary people in an 
extraordinary light. Though films like "The River Wild" are not usually the 
place to look for the best of female performances, Streep has taken this 
opportunity to once again rewrite the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13, for some violence and threatening moments. Times 
guidelines: The terrorizing of the family results in a high squirm factor.

 Taylor Film OKd: Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne on Thursday 
cleared the way for NBC to make a miniseries based on the life of Elizabeth 
Taylor, who had filed an invasion-of-privacy lawsuit against the network in an 
attempt to block the production. Wayne upheld her preliminary ruling, saying 
that blocking the miniseries or the book on which it will be based would 
violate the network's right to free speech. The miniseries is scheduled to air

Schwarzenegger battling an Arab extremist group, had caused unrest in the 
mainly Islamic country. The controversy has given the film huge publicity in

MOVIE REVIEW; BROOKS HITS FLY BALL IN 'SCOUT' BUT NOT OVER FENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those of us who fervently believe Albert Brooks is the funniest man in 
America and can do no wrong, "The Scout" offers up a dilemma. As New York 
Yankee baseball scout Al Percolo, Brooks is hilariously "right," but, boy, did 
he pick the wrong vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that you can blame him, exactly. There's a lot of talent in this baseball 
comedy, which was directed by Michael Ritchie and co-written by Brooks and 
Andrew Bergman and Monica Johnson, and co-stars Brendan Fraser and Dianne 
Wiest. That's exactly why its creeping mediocrity seems like a perverse joke. 
</P>
<P>
 The creep doesn't really start until the film enters its second half-hour or 
so. Until then, it's a knockabout showcase for Brooks, and it's a stitch -- 
pure Brooksian riff. Wearing a straw hat and a paunch, Al weasels his way into 
the good graces of a God-fearing pitching phenom (Michael Rapaport) only to 
have the boy throw up and punk out just before his Yankee Stadium debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Demoted by the Yankees general manager (Lane Smith) to scouting the Mexican 
backwaters, Al bounces from town to town until he accidentally happens upon a 
local sensation unknown to any previous scout -- Steve Nebraska (Fraser), a 
gangly, dippy American mysteriously ensconced without family in Mexico. Brought 
into the makeshift Mexican stadium on a cheap-jack throne, looking like a 
bargain-bin Cleopatra entering Rome, he proceeds to whiff batters with his 
100-plus-m.p.h. fastball and then, taking the plate, slams the ball out of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Al is flabbergasted at his fortune -- he feels like he's bringing King Kong to 
New York in glory. (Early on, we see Al watching "Kong," his favorite movie, on 
TV -- the "original" version! he exults.) But, when the Yankees drop him before 
his arrival, he cooks up a personal contract with Steve and negotiates a 
$55-million salary -- with the caveat that Steve wait out the rest of Yankees' 
dismal season unless they win the pennant. (Guess what happens.) The only 
hitch: The Yankees require a psychiatric bill of health before they sign. And 
Steve, who seems to be humming to his own off-key melody, is no shoo-in for 
sanity. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as "The Scout" is sending up baseball escapades, it's on sure footing. 
Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, playing himself, is unexpectedly hilarious: 
He has a great moment when he rolls his eyes at a reporter's crack that his 
team has no chance at a pennant. There's been so much folkloric blather about 
baseball lately -- including the 18-hour PBS "Baseball" series -- that the 
livid silliness of the best parts of "The Scout" are tonic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the filmmakers don't seem to know what's good about their subject and what 
should be ejected from the game. Once Steve makes it to New York and moves in 
with Al -- who takes a fatherly responsibility for his prize -- the film 
quickly devolves into a series of vaguely serious and unfunny set pieces backed 
by an infernally "Rocky"-esque Bill Conti score. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting shears seem to have excised vast swatches of continuity. Steve, for 
example, inexplicably loses his love for the sport. We never find out what he 
was doing in Mexico or anything about the whereabouts of his family. He's 
billed as a stud, but the film allows him no dalliances (unless one counts a 
cryptic suggestion of one with a Yankee assistant played by Anne Twomey in what 
must be the tiniest cameo ever recorded by a celebrated, Tony-nominated 
Broadway actress). 
</P>
<P>
 When he enters therapy with -- har-har -- Dr. H. Aaron (Wiest), we don't find 
out much more about their sessions than the obvious -- he's looking for a 
father-figure. We don't know just how nut-brained Steve really is. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraser is enjoyable in a bland, callow way that doesn't really give the film 
much of a center. He doesn't spark Brooks, who works best when he's acting 
one-on-one, and that's unfortunate since the entire cramped, skimpy production 
is practically a duet for two actors. (It might have been developed from a 
two-character play, although, in fact, the script, in various stages of 
development, has been around since 1982.) The film edges toward sappiness 
instead of nuttiness. It turns into just what you don't want it to become: a 
buddy-buddy bond-a-thon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritchie is sometimes a whiz at comedy. Couldn't he see the potential in 
pairing Brooks with Wiest? In their one real scene together, when Al is trying 
to cajole the doctor into signing a clean bill of health sight unseen, the air 
is frisky with comic possibilities. (It's reminiscent of that great scene in 
Vegas in Brooks' "Lost in America," where he tries to talk Garry Marshall into 
giving back the money.) These two work so well together that you expect some 
kind of romance to develop, or perhaps a group therapy situation. Instead, 
you're left with a hunk of heartfelt whimsy. 
</P>
<P>
 You can tolerate "The Scout" for Brooks' bull-necked exasperation and fixated 
double takes. Against all odds he creates a lived-in character beneath that 
straw hat. But, as you leave the theater, the heavy musk of wasted opportunity 
crowds the air. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; HURT SHINES IN INTIMATE 'SECOND BEST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Second Best" is such a splendid, intimate film you worry that it's going to 
get lost in the thicket of much bigger, far more highly publicized fall 
releases. The irony is that for all its modesty of scale it has the universal 
appeal of a richly realized father-and-son relationship, portrayed by William 
Hurt, in one of the finest performances of his career, and by a remarkable 
newcomer, neophyte actor Chris Cleary Miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of the matter is that Hurt and Miles are not in fact father and son. 
Hurt, accent-perfect, plays Graham Holt, a 42-year-old bachelor, the 
grocer/postmaster of a small picture-postcard Welsh town. He has lived his 
entire life in the drab but cozy house attached to the store, but his mother 
has now been dead for 18 months and his father is bedridden and speechless from 
a stroke. But as Graham later on tells Miles' troubled 10-year-old James: "To 
be nothing, to feel nothing, doesn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Chris Menges and writer David Cook, in adapting Cook's novel, 
crosscut between the past histories of Graham and James until they cross paths. 
James is haunted by a traumatic event he witnessed as a toddler; the meaning of 
his fragmented memories of it are fully revealed only at the film's climax. 
Motherless and his father imprisoned, James grows up in an orphanage. The 
devotion of Graham's parents, on the other hand, was so complete as to shut him 
out of their love. As a result, Graham has developed a diffidence so inhibiting 
that we can actually believe that, as physically attractive as he is, he could 
put off women. In his need for love and to ease his loneliness, however, he has 
no real idea of what he'll be getting into in trying to adopt a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Horrocks' tart social worker makes it clear to Graham that as a single, 
middle-aged male he's going to have to settle for an older, difficult child. 
The film's crucial underlying strength now emerges, which is in its 
determinedly unsentimental, unhurried (yet not slow-paced) depiction of the 
prickly development of a relationship between man and boy that is at all times 
fraught with uncertainty because of the boy's giving in swiftly to terrible 
rages. The question is whether Graham will be able to assert himself strongly 
and wisely enough to hold on to James. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the film proceeds flawlessly under the controlled yet 
unobtrusive direction of Menges, the gifted cameraman who turned equally gifted 
director with the memorable "A World Apart" with Barbara Hershey. There are 
other sterling performances from, among others, another notable Hurt -- John 
Hurt -- as Graham's raffish uncle and from Keith Allen as James' loving but 
feckless actual father. "Second Best" is so wrenchingly effective you hope 
fervently that Menges will freeze his final frame at precisely the perfect 
moment -- and he does. 
</P>
<P>

TAVERNIER'S GRITTY 'L.627' IS ONE OF HIS BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With "L.627," a classic police procedural, France's formidable Bertrand 
Tavernier puts his mastery of storytelling to a severe test, yet succeeds 
triumphantly in involving us completely in a story with virtually no exposition 
or plot and that takes 145 minutes to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 He straightaway plunges us into the grinding everyday existence of a veteran 
Parisian narcotics cop nicknamed Lulu (Didier Bezace), a quietly dedicated man 
who becomes part of a small, ill-equipped drug squad headquartered in a cramped 
prefab structure, a site that speaks volumes about the status of their 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface Lulu is like his colleagues, who are good-humored, 
ordinary-looking, conscientious blue-collar guys. There's also a feisty woman 
(Charlotte Kady). Their camaraderie is warm and solid in the face of their 
hotheaded, lazy and cynical boss (Jean-Paul Comart). As we follow them on the 
job, enduring stakeouts in a stuffy van, collaring suspects -- sometimes 
brutally -- interviewing countless citizens, we gradually learn that Lulu has a 
beautiful, devoted wife (Cecile Garcia-Fogel) and small daughter who see little 
of him -- and a tender, loving concern for a waif-like young prostitute/junkie 
(Lara Guirao). 
</P>
<P>
 Lulu, in short, is a wonderful guy, and his life unfolds rigorously with 
Tavernier's typically acute powers of observation and attention to nuances and 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.627" exudes the vitality and humor so characteristic of the director's work 
and glows with its ensemble portrayals. Tavernier's inspired cinematographer, 
Alain Choquart, takes us on a distinctly non-tourist trip through Paris' 
seamiest, most dangerous areas with their ancient narrow streets. In fact, 
"L.627," which takes its name from the French drug law, could be transferred 
intact to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Always one to speak his mind in his films, Tavernier is here modestly saluting 
a decent cop -- and thereby such men everywhere -- intent upon doing his job 
despite a demoralizing police bureaucracy and widespread public indifference to 
the war against drugs. Tavernier, reportedly inspired by a brief brush with 
drugs experienced by his son Nils (who plays one of the cops), has made one of 
his best films.

RESTAURANT NOTES: L'ESCOFFIER TO BOOK PRIVATE PARTIES ONLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 French restaurants have had a hard time of it lately. In the last year, 
Tulipe, Fennel, La Toque, Picnic, the Bistro, Champagne Bis, Fleur de Vin and 
Dale's Bistro have all closed. Now, two more have called it quits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hilton Hotel's L'Escoffier restaurant went through a face lift and 
some other nips and tucks two years ago. Along with an expensive refurbishing 
job, owner Merv Griffin hired a new maitre d' (Fernand Pointas, although he 
doesn't use his last name) and a new chef (Michel Blanchet). But the classic 
French restaurant never really made the move into the '90s. Now Griffin has 
closed the rooftop room that has long been known as the best place in town to 
take grandma for dinner and dancing. The space will now be booked for private 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The restaurant has been very slow during the week but extremely popular on 
the weekends," says the hotel spokeswoman, "so (management) decided it would be 
better off doing private parties and functions and then decide what to do with 
the restaurant after the Christmas season." 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Blanchet, who previously cooked at the venerable La Cienega restaurant 
L'Ermitage until it unexpectedly closed its doors three years ago, will stay on 
through December. "He's going to get the chance to be a lot more creative," 
says the spokeswoman. "And by then management will have an idea of what they 
want to do with the space." No word yet on the whereabouts of Fernand. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, 7-year-old Ma Maison at the Sofitel, the beautiful room where 
Patrick Terrail tried to re-create his famous Melrose Avenue restaurant, has 
also been turned into a banquet hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Olive Branches?: At least fans of Olive have reason to celebrate. The unmarked 
Fairfax Avenue hangout, due to close in early October, has had its life 
extended for another month or two. Meanwhile, says soon-to-be-unemployed chef 
Dale Payne, the owners continue to look for a new space to open another Olive. 
"Customers like it too much," says Payne, who took over the kitchen when chef 
Robert Gadsby decamped. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the latest Vanity Fair there's an interview with (director) Quentin 
Tarantino that described the Olive as 'practically the only perpetually cool 
restaurant in L.A. . . .' Yes, well, it's perpetually cool, but now we have 
decent food too. In fact, the crowd is actually eating the food instead of just 
coming for the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Remi Unruffled?: Josie Le Balch has left Remi in Santa Monica, where she has 
been cooking since the Venetian restaurant opened on Third Street Promenade in 
1990. According to owner Jivan Tabibian, the cigar-smoking chef (she was 
trained by the original chef-owner Francesco Antonucci, who left after two 
months to reopen the original New York Remi in a larger space) plans to take a 
long extended ski vacation in Utah. "She wanted to take a break," says 
Tabibian. "She's been working four and a half years nonstop." 
</P>
<P>
 Before she left, Le Balch helped prepare a team of chefs to take over the 
kitchen. Her replacement, Chris Bochino, flew to New York to work with 
Antonucci, and sous chef Chris Shaffer was sent to Italy to train at 
Dall'Amelia, near Venice. "It was a smooth, predictable transition," says 
Tabibian, "and I couldn't have done it without Josie's help." Le Balch was out 
of town and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Openings: A recent spate of openings include Asia Garden in the former Tse 
Yang space in Beverly Hills. Chinese businessman Michael Chu, who owns 52 
restaurants in various parts of the world, plans to offer Japanese, Thai and 
Chinese dishes. . . . Citation restaurant has opened in the casino at the 
Hollywood Park Racetrack in Inglewood. Named after the thoroughbred that won 
the Triple Crown, the eclectic menu features chicken, beef, pork, ostrich but 
no horse meat. . . . Patrick Gruest has finally opened Les Arts in the old 
Fleur de Vin space in Pasadena. The contemporary French menu is by chef Jean 
Marie Konnert, who comes from the famous old Brasserie Georges in Lyon, France. 
He also cooked at the not-quite-as-famous Rive Gauche in Washington. . . . 
Naples T.L.C. Corp. has opened Tavola Calda on Melrose. Located in the former 
Rosso e Nero and adjoining dress shop spaces, chef Vincenzo Nicoletti's menu 
features risotto di frutti di mare, grilled steak, fritto misto and other 
dishes, all under $10.

 One more time, a new restaurant is taking on the Fairfax venue where the 
Hollywood Diner and Tutto Bene couldn't make it. This time the concept is 
Provencal-California on a budget, featuring a three-course prix fixe dinner at 
$18.95, plus a small a la carte menu.Partner and manager Jon Safier, an old Ma 
Maison alum, runs the front, and a former Campanile cook, Steven Hermann, is in 
charge of the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The flower pot of crudites on the table is very cute. But is the cautious menu 
of potato and leek soup, steamed mussels, rotisserie chicken and grilled meats 
and fish appealing enough to turn the tables? 
</P>
<P>
 * Provencia, 945 N. Fairfax Ave., Los Angeles. (213) 654-4594. Open for dinner 
Monday through Saturday. Valet parking. Visa, MasterCard and American Express 
accepted. Appetizers $3.95 to $9.95; entrees $9.95 to $12.95.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; SUSHI IMAI A MORE MELLOW EXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sushi Imai used to be one of those terrific and terrifying sushi bars where 
you were only truly welcome if you knew your sushi and your sushi etiquette -- 
starting with sashimi, dunking only the fish side of your sushi in your soy- 
wasabi mix, never plunking half-eaten sushi back down on the plate, etc. 
Requesting a California or spicy tuna roll could get you a blank stare from the 
chef and/or an invitation to dine elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Sushi Imai closed for three years for quake-proofing, and who knows what 
happened? Perhaps it was the recession, which down-scaled many a menu and made 
many a restaurateur grateful for any and all business. When Sushi Imai reopened 
last year with the same skilled chef, prices were lower and there, on the menu, 
was California roll. I ordered it recently (for a friend, of course) and the 
chef made it with nary a twitch of disapproval. 
</P>
<P>
 His humor and tolerance are, in fact, now so entrenched that when a woman near 
us at the sushi bar produced her own bottle of soy sauce, he expressed only 
mild curiosity: "A special soy sauce?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's low sodium," she said, "But I use it because it contains no wheat. I'm 
very sensitive to wheat." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahhh. . . ." Nary a twitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Sushi Imai is small; a dozen or so seats at the sushi bar, a handful of pale 
wood tables. White walls display one smiling red mask and one small but 
ferocious stuffed and mounted salmon. Further flourish and color is found on 
the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The chef's cutting is adept, trim, often beautiful. His rice is nicely sticky, 
not too sweet, rather loosely packed for nigirizushi (sushi pressed and formed 
in the hand). The selection isn't as vast as in some of the larger sushi bars, 
but there's always some special and/or seasonal item; one day it's ama ebi , 
live shrimp, whose legs dance in the chef's hands one minute and whose tail 
arrives soon afterward on rice, the flesh translucent, exquisitely mild, still 
-- you swear it -- quivering: It's a mouthful of beauty and qualms. 
</P>
<P>
 Another visit, the special item is matsutake , or pine mushrooms, 
white-fleshed with caramel-colored caps, broiled in the toaster oven and 
lightly sauced before becoming an earthy, slippery sushi. 
</P>
<P>
 Sushi from house-cured fish is particularly good: sake , or salmon has a 
distantly sweet flavor, and a hint of smokiness. Pickled saba, or mackerel, 
with its two-tone flesh is deliciously pungent either as sushi or a small, 
juicy salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Maguro , or tuna, won't be at its peak of firmness and flavor until November; 
still, Imai's square-cut maguro sashimi is meaty and satisfying. Toro , or 
fatty tuna sushi, is milder than butter and just as rich. 
</P>
<P>
 An eel order produces one slice each of broiled unagi (the silky, rich 
freshwater eel), and anago (not quite so rich, but flavorful marine eel). 
Kohada , a Japanese shad, has a strong herring-like flavor, and metallic silver 
skin banded in black dots. Scored by the knife, it looks like the vented hood 
of a tiny, custom sports car. 
</P>
<P>
 Salad made from salmon nose resembles pewter-colored cucumbers. The dressing 
tastes something like lemon Popsicles, but the cartilaginous crunch is 
memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 When we came for dinner and ordered items from the menu, the kitchen, clearly 
disorganized, sent out food sporadically: We were served one at a time, which 
meant one person ate while the rest of us looked on hungrily. Our harried 
waitress, who dodged through the small, half-full dining room as if pursued by 
large playful dogs, could only apologize. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempura, with only the lightest filigree of batter, was just OK; plump chunks 
of chicken teriyaki, while certainly tender, had an odd, waterlogged quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon ochazuke , a small bowl of rice in excellent broth, is a lovely, subtle 
dish whose pleasures come from the faint smokiness of the salmon, the chicken 
soup comfort of rice-in-broth, the broad tone of that green horseradish. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing subtle, however, about the "Dynamite," an abalone shell stuffed with 
giant clam and scallops suspended in gobs of mayonnaise made bright orange with 
tobiko (flying fish roe) and broiled. The waitress warned us it was rich; she 
didn't say it's like eating Best Foods straight from the bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 So, sushi is the thing. And by the way, spicy tuna rolls are excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sushi Imai, 359 East 1st St., Los Angeles. (213) 680-4166. Open for lunch 
and dinner Tuesday through Saturday. Beer and sake served. Major cards 
accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $15 to $65.

JAZZ REVIEW; A PLAYFUL JAMES MOODY SWINGS INTO HIGH GEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How's this for a quick way to start a jazz set: Kick off a high- speed version 
of "Anthropology," then dig into the fast lane for, oh, say 14 or 15 nonstop 
choruses. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not the kind of risk that very many jazz players -- young or old -- 
care to take. But it didn't intimidate James Moody at all in his opening set at 
the Jazz Bakery on Wednesday night. The audience had barely gotten settled in 
their seats before the veteran saxophonist was unleashing a dazzling display of 
imaginative improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 At 69, Moody may be a jazz senior citizen, but his technique, his ideas and, 
above all, his irresistible sense of swing are as good as ever. And, in Moody's 
case, that is very good, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that the fact that he is very funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, some of his jokes were groaners (like the one about the ants who 
expressed regret for having bitten Charlie Parker, so he wrote a tune for them 
called -- ta-dum -- "Anthropology"). But combine Moody's whimsical, off-center 
humor with his captivating solos, and the result is that rarest of rare -- an 
entertaining jazz evening. 
</P>
<P>
 (Anyone who thinks we don't need a few more of those is advised to spend an 
evening with players who think it's an imposition on their creativity to have 
to announce the name of a tune.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moody's band was pretty much a hasty assemblage. But John Beasley on piano, 
Kenny Wild on bass and Tootie Heath on drums are not exactly chopped liver, and 
each seemed stimulated by the sheer vigor of Moody's playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Heath's masterful soloing was an object lesson in the subtle timbres that can 
be produced by a simple jazz drum kit. Beasley moved easily and comfortably 
into his be-bop mode, and Wild provided a solidly supportive low register 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The James Moody Quartet at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave . , Culver City. 
(310) 271-9039. $20. 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., through Saturday.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; JOHN WAYNE AMBLES IN FROM THE DESERT AS 'HONDO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The well of John Wayne movies not available on video is just about dry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne is one of the biggest attractions in the home video market. Of his 152 
movies -- from the late-1920s to the mid-1970s -- 114 are on tape. 
</P>
<P>
 But after "Hondo," the 1953 Western that just came out on MPI at $20, there's 
not much left -- mainly some of his pre-1940 B-movies. And it seemed like 
"Hondo," rumored to be on the verge of release for years, would never come out. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Wayne, son of the late star and president of Batjac Productions Inc. 
-- which has the rights to "Hondo" -- explained why it took so long to release 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were waiting for the right time -- and the time never seemed right," he 
said. "I was waiting for a time when Westerns were more popular, which has 
happened after 'Dances With Wolves' and 'Unforgiven,' and for a time when none 
of his other movies were being released by other companies like Fox or Warner 
or Republic. But last February I said, 'It's coming out this fall, no matter 
what.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Research showed that fans were eager for "Hondo." But that demand had been 
somewhat orchestrated. One of Batjac's tactics was to keep it off TV, so fans 
wouldn't take it for granted -- or tape it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never put it into syndication," Wayne said. "It's only been shown four or 
five times on TV. I wanted interest and demand to build up." 
</P>
<P>
 To make the film more attractive to finicky contemporary audiences, Wayne put 
"Hondo" through a meticulous restoration process, so it's one of the 
best-looking classic movies on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about another aspect of "Hondo" that might disturb many of today's 
fans -- the fact that this Western, like nearly all from those days, was not 
politically correct with respect to Native Americans? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much more sympathetic toward Indians than most movies of that era," 
Wayne insisted. "The Hondo character was half-Indian and was married to an 
Indian. He had great respect and admiration for the good Apache chief. But then 
another chief takes over, and that's where the problems of the political 
correctness sort start." 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Hondo" isn't exactly PC, retailers don't expect that to hamper sales. 
Wayne said that MPI has shipped 750,000 copies to stores, a whopping amount for 
a 41-year-old movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The next John Wayne movie to come out, "The High and the Mighty," will 
probably do even better. This exciting 1954 drama, featuring Wayne as the pilot 
of an airplane in jeopardy, has wider appeal than "Hondo," which will attract 
mostly male action fans. Michael Wayne said that this one, which has been on TV 
even less frequently than "Hondo," will be out sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
 After "The High and the Mighty," the most prominent Wayne movie not on video 
will be a routine drama from 1953, "Island in the Sky," one of his least 
interesting '50s movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Wayne is working on another project -- transferring "Hondo," which was 
originally in the old 3-D format, into what he says will be the first 
full-length color 3-D laser disc. The disc, due in March and priced somewhere 
between $75 and $100, will be made through a new digital process and will 
feature trailers, outtakes and a commentary track. The package will also 
include 3-D glasses as well as a second laser disc, the standard "flat" version 
for those who don't want to bother with 3-D. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Films 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a flurry of fine high-profile foreign-language movies released 
in the past month, which is unusual since sometimes there may be only one or 
two such movies every few months. 
</P>
<P>
 It started about a month ago with "Like Water for Chocolate," one of the most 
popular foreign films ever released in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Just out this week is FoxVideo's engaging, clever farce "The Wedding Banquet," 
about a gay male couple -- one is American, the other Taiwanese -- living in 
Manhattan. When the parents of the Taiwanese, who don't know their son is gay, 
come to visit, he stages a fake wedding with a female artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese director Chen Kaige's "Farewell My Concubine" (Miramax) is an 
entertaining epic, covering a period from the 1920s to the '70s, that recounts 
the volatile relationship between two male performers in the Peking Opera. 
Though the characterizations aren't as vivid as they might be, it's still a 
fascinating tale. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New On Video: 
</P>
<P>
 "Bad Girls" (FoxVideo). In this feminist Western, none of the bad girls seem 
very bad. Four prostitutes (Madeleine Stowe, Andie MacDowell, Mary Stuart 
Masterson and Drew Barrymore) want to open a respectable business in Oregon but 
have to shoot their way past a gang of vicious outlaws.  
</P>
<P>
 "Surviving the Game" (New Line). A homeless man (Ice-T) is the prey at a swank 
retreat were hunters pay big money to track and kill humans. This is a good, 
grisly action film, co-starring Rutger Hauer and Gary Busey, who proves once 
again that he plays coldblooded villains as well as any actor in the business. 
Same plot as the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie "Hard Target."  
</P>
<P>
 "Bitter Moon" (New Line). On a long ocean cruise, a wheelchair-bound writer 
(Peter Coyote) captivates a couple (Hugh Grant and Kristin Scott-Thomas) with 
lurid tales of his kinky past. The film, directed by Roman Polanski, may work 
for those with a taste for the totally offbeat.

THEATER BEAT: 'BRIDESMAID': FIRST-RATE FOR CHARM, WIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kay Cole and Barbara Sharma have made a career out of stealing stuff -- 
musical scenes, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the veteran sidekicks have come downstage and grabbed the spotlight in 
"Always a Bridesmaid," a sly, charming and hugely entertaining cabaret show of 
favorite -- and a few all-but-forgotten -- Broadway numbers originally sung by 
secondary characters. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tiny stage at Tonto & Dietz, a "coffee cabaret" in a Studio City strip 
mall, Cole and Sharma blaze through some terrific medleys of tunes by Harold 
Arlen, Richard Rodgers, Stephen Sondheim, Jerry Herman and others. 
</P>
<P>
 With Shelly Markham's sprightly piano accompaniment, the pair never lose their 
self-deprecating edge. "Second bananas, part of the bunch," they sing in the 
title song by Billy Barnes, the show's sole original number. "Why don't 
producers take us to lunch?" 
</P>
<P>
 Producers probably would if they saw this show. Leaning against a wall, Cole 
does sexy, languorous versions of the Arlen standards "A Sleepin' Bee" and 
"Come Rain or Come Shine." Sharma lends her Betty Boop voice and zesty comedic 
flair to Sondheim's "I'm Still Here," a paean to show-biz survivors, which 
contains what might be the definitive second-banana line: "First you're another 
sloe-eyed vamp, then someone's mother, then you're camp." 
</P>
<P>
 "Always a Bridesmaid" is first-rate. * "Always a Bridesmaid," Tonto & Dietz, 
12747 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. Fridays-Saturdays, 8:30 p.m. Ends Oct. 30. 
$15. (818) 763-4166. Running time: 1 hour, 10 minutes. 'SAVE-ME*': More for the 
Faithful 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart, the televangelist has become a kind 
of stock character -- a drawling confidence man preying on the global village. 
</P>
<P>
 "1-800-SAVE-ME" takes a slightly different tack. In Jack Betts' ambitiously 
overwritten new melodrama -- now at the Marilyn Monroe Theatre in West 
Hollywood -- a TV preacher's greed and lust are portrayed as near-tragic flaws 
instead of sleazy peccadilloes. 
</P>
<P>
 Betts stars as J. D. Willets, a onetime shoe salesman who fronts a struggling 
bus-and-truck ministry. With the help of trusted aide Walker (Brogan Roche), an 
embittered disabled man who once threatened his life, Willets becomes a 
celebrated faith healer. Yet that success sets in motion an elaborate revenge 
plot that brings the preacher's past back to haunt him. Lois Nettleton plays 
Willets' close confidante and ministry partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its ill-advised title, the play suffers from windy dialogue and a 
few dramaturgic lapses, including some clumsy flashbacks and symbolism 
involving Willets' ill-fated romance with a troubled woman (Susan Anspach). 
Betts' rather colorless portrayal forces the audience to accept on faith 
Willets' supposed charisma. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Betts' work makes a valiant effort to humanize a protagonist who could 
easily have collapsed into a tabloid cliche. For that alone, it deserves 
credit.

<P>
 Marc Antony as an honorable woman? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what else would you expect from a troupe that calls itself the 
Non-Traditional Shakespeare Company? 
</P>
<P>
 Director Joseph Marcell, best known as the butler on TV's "Fresh Prince of Bel 
Air," has taken a stab at Shakespeare's "Julius Caesar" with a color-blind, 
gender-bending production. Thus a black actress, Deborah Lacey, plays the 
Antony who comes to bury Caesar (John Wesley), not praise him. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Marcell's notions of non-traditional theater seem to begin and 
end with casting. The show resembles nothing so much as an excruciating 
read-through, with scarcely any thought given to dramatizing the text in a 
fresh, visually interesting way. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast members struggle mightily with the verse while the tragedy 
unintentionally veers into camp. On the battlefield, with the future of the 
Roman Empire at stake, noble Cassius (Austin Stoker) responds to an argument by 
literally throwing a temper tantrum in Brutus' tent. 
</P>
<P>
 A speedy burial would probably be best for this "Caesar."

THEATER BEAT: ANTI-SEMITISM IN SHAKESPEARE'S TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where other contemporary productions might tiptoe around the anti-Semitism in 
"The Merchant of Venice," Dancing Dog Theatre Company offers no apologies in 
staging the work under its alternate title, "The Jew of Venice." 
</P>
<P>
 Spotlighting the prejudice in Shakespeare's time -- and in the playwright 
himself -- is director Brian Van Dusen's overriding agenda as he assumes the 
role of Shylock and transforms the vengeful moneylender into a tragically 
abused innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 His first entrance wearing the yellow armband required for ghetto residents in 
1598 Venice establishes Shylock as an outcast, and the mockery of the 
Christians around him is particularly sharp-edged. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there's a basis for this tension, which the production extends even 
to the disdain of Portia (Kristine Kraus) for her princely but dark-skinned 
Moroccan suitor. The energy level in this otherwise undistinguished production 
rises noticeably at each prick of the social conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how high-minded the intent, Shakespeare's text is not a 
Rorschach inkblot open to any interpretation. In the crucial trial scene, Van 
Dusen violates the play's dramatic boundaries when his Shylock, poised to cut 
the pound of flesh from Antonio (Larry Eisenberg), actually drops the knife and 
begins laughing, suggesting that he never meant to exact his horrific bond. 
</P>
<P>
 The complete exoneration of Shylock in this "just kidding" spin kills the 
suspense and diminishes the subsequent legal arguments by the disguised Portia 
-- she's no longer rescuing Antonio, for his life clearly isn't in danger by 
the time she intervenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Shakespeare's attitude toward Jews may have been, he wasn't this bad 
a dramatist. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Jew of Venice," Gene Dynarski Theatre, 5600 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood. 
Wednesdays-Fridays, 8 p.m. Ends Oct. 15. $12 (two-for-one on Wednesdays). (213) 
739-3910. Running time: 2 hours, 45 minutes. The Real Horror Behind 'Irma Vep' 
</P>
<P>
 Lightning-fast role-switching by two performers is the raison d'etre for 
Charles Ludlam's campy sendup of '30s-style horror mysteries, "The Mystery of 
Irma Vep," yet in Right Side Productions/ Pacific West's toxic staging, even 
the costume changes are agonizingly prolonged. 
</P>
<P>
 But what happens between the changes is the real horror as director Joseph 
Mustacchi lures actors Sean Galezka and Ahmad Enani through a succession of 
irritating caricatures, each more shamelessly overplayed than the last. When 
they're tired of mugging at each other as a wooden-legged werewolf, a homicidal 
bug-eyed housekeeper, a menacing aristocrat and his ditzy new bride, the 
performers break character and mug directly at the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 As a bonus, the 15-minute second act is staged as a shadow play lit by strobe 
light to suggest an old-fashioned cinema. It may trigger a migraine or an 
epileptic seizure, but at least then you can go home early. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Mystery of Irma Vep," Complex, 6474 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood.

TV REVIEW; 'LONESOME DOVE' SERIES: MILKING THE NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't get confused, cowhands: There's yet another network miniseries sequel to 
"Lonesome Dove" in the works (this time based on Larry McMurtry's own novel 
sequel, "Streets of Laredo"), centering around Capt. Woodrow Call and company. 
But the syndicated show that premieres tonight under the "Lonesome Dove" name 
is an entirely distinct maxi -series sequel, featuring only one holdover 
character, Call's twentysomething son, Newt. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, "Lonesome Dove: The Series" is more or less the "Deep Space 
Nine" of this family tree. Not a second of this spinoff takes place within 500 
miles of Lonesome Dove, Tex., of course, but a brand name's a brand name. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary setting circa 1870 is Curtis Wells, Montana, into which rides 
sweet, strapping, quick-draw Newt Call (Scott Bairstow, taking the Rick 
Schroder role). His ramblin' plans change for good when he lays his trigger eye 
on Hannah (Christianne Hirt), who, like all beautiful young female leads in 
contemporary Westerns, is a headstrong feminist a century ahead of her time. 
Theirs is definitely a marriage made in Heaven's Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 But even a wedding a few episodes hence won't dim the enthusiasm held for 
Hannah by another shooter -- darkly handsome bad guy Mosby (Eric McCormack), a 
former Confederate officer who's taken up a life of crime to avenge the Union 
murder of his wife. Hannah just happens to resemble the Dixie-whistler's late 
missus. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there's a lot more hokum going on besides this tiresome triangle, 
at least in the guest-star-heavy opening trilogy of episodes. The barroom 
fisticuffs and cowboys-and-Indians gunplay are just enough to make the series a 
regular "Lonesome Hawk," if you catch our drift. (But before you get too 
attached, just remember, there's a reason why Billy Dee Williams is a "special 
guest star" and not a regular.) 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran helmer Sidney Furie has directed with little sense of pretension that 
the script (by Tom Towler and Stephen Zito) has any of the solemn 
sophistication of the first miniseries, rather aiming this round-up at kids and 
more indiscriminate Western loyalists. The performers -- including Diahann 
Carroll, Graham Greene and Paul Le Mat among the older hands -- largely founder 
amid the cliches, but the luscious Canadian Rocky Mountain scenery very much 
lives up to its star status. 
</P>
<P>

JAZZ REVIEW; CAN BLONDIE SING JAZZ? DEPENDS ON THE TEMPO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can Deborah Harry sing jazz? 
</P>
<P>
 The question had to be on the minds of some people at the Coach House 
Wednesday night when the former lead singer of the pop group Blondie appeared 
with a New York-based art-jazz group, the Jazz Passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, judging by the way her arrival on stage was greeted by rousing 
applause, whistles and shouts of "Blondie!," most people didn't really care how 
she sang. Just seeing her seemed to be enough -- and she looked darn good for a 
49-year-old. She wore skintight black-and-white capris (emblazoned with what 
looked to be the names of punk bands), a black shiny polo shirt and black 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who was there strictly to hear her probably gave her mixed marks for 
her decidedly game participation. She had some heavy ground to cover in 
rendering selections from the Passengers' new High Street album, "In Love." 
Many of the tunes, such as the fast-then-faster "Kidnapped" or the arduous 
"Handsome Man From Fiji," have difficult, angular melodies, and Harry 
negotiated their hard passages with aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the lyrics to these tunes -- written by Passengers Roy Nathanson, who 
plays saxes, Curtis Fowkles (trombone), Bill Ware (vibes) and others -- are 
complex, often resembling free verse, and Harry hadn't memorized them yet. When 
she read them from a music stand, it created a sense of her not being fully 
inside the songs, and therefore not quite believing them. 
</P>
<P>
 And that emotional distance was not fully bridged by her alto, which is not 
particularly strong; there is a sweet-then-cloying "little girl" quality to it. 
Often, she was unable to cut through the Passengers' playing, which ranged from 
sympathetic to bombastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Now and then she would use dramatics -- running her hand through her hair to 
express anguish, or waving her arms around or moving her hips in circles -- but 
such mannerisms did little to help her bring the songs across. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the tempo slowed, though, and she could really stand front and center and 
just sing (as during the languorous "Imitation of a Kiss" and the lyrical "I'll 
Pray For You"), she made the material hers and the songs had a deeper impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Passengers (other members include Brad Jones on bass, E.J. Rodriguez on 
drums and Margaret Parkins on cello) are an energetic bunch with a rhythm team 
(primarily Rodriguez and Jones but also Parkins and vibe player Ware) that 
underpinned numbers with the kind of dazzling and empathetic interplay that 
lets free-wheeling jazz really soar. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathanson, working out on tenor, alto and soprano saxes, offered solos that 
mixed histrionics, humor and nice round notes. Fowkles was more conservative, 
but his big fat sound had a serious bite, and his easy-swinging phrases had 
good, hard edges. Ware and Jones added solid improvisations. 
</P>
<P>
 Naked to the World, a folk group from Los Angeles, opened with selections from 
its eponymous debut CD. Ardent lead singer Kevin Fisher was abetted by 
violinist Daryl S., who added colorful touches by playing through a 
synthesizer.

THEATER REVIEW; NEW MISSION VIEJO TROUPE OFF TO A PROMISING START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every new theater has to open with something; why not open with a playwright's 
first play? And if you're calling your theater American Classic Repertory, why 
not open with Edward Albee's classic first, "The Zoo Story"? 
</P>
<P>
 The ACR people have billed it with another early one-act by an American 
playwright, Lanford Wilson's not-so-classic "Great Nebula in Orion."  
</P>
<P>
 When "Zoo Story" premiered 35 years ago, it was paired with Samuel Beckett's 
"Krapp's Last Tape," which pointed to the absurdist identity of the Albee play. 
This pairing points to something else: "Zoo Story" also is a New York play, a 
Central Park play; the action takes place smack in the middle of the very same 
park that the apartment dwellers in Wilson's play look down upon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zoo Story" is set at the beginning of the '60s, while "Orion" is set at the 
fiery decade's end. Albee's unbalanced, violent, self-obsessed Jerry was a 
precursor of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart programming, which suggests that this storefront space, tucked away in 
yet another faceless South County commercial strip, is run by some thinking 
theater people (Joann Urban, Kevin O'Loane and director Lee Clark). As the 
group's name indicates, the plan is to produce American classics, though the 
first season puts a modern spin on the term with "Brighton Beach Memoirs" 
slated for March and Wilson's "Fifth of July" in June). 
</P>
<P>
 The damper on this company is its space, which was designed for children's 
theater inside Mission Viejo's Masquerade Village Costume Shop (fairy-tale 
castles and forests line the walls). Any charm that might come from entering a 
costume shop for a play quickly dissolves in the space itself -- "a cold room," 
as jazz musicians put it. A hard, unraked floor with folding metal chairs faces 
a raised stage consumed by black walls slanting into a triangular corner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All that plus rudimentary lights and slapdash living room furniture 
immediately put this "Great Nebula" into a black hole. For a while, though, it 
sounds as if Cynthia Givens as hostess Louise and Susan Levinstein as her 
former Bryn Mawr mate, prim and proper Carrie, might prime the pump of Wilson's 
duologue, which is stuffed with sexual innuendo and between-the-lines petty 
jealousies. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinstein is decked out in a perfect, very Cardin-like, late '60s tailored 
affair, and fits it nicely. She's snappy but knows her manners. Givens doesn't 
pin down laid-back Louise's identity with as much accuracy, but she does 
suggest emotional business curdling beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 However, duologues require an energy and focus that just aren't present here, 
and as Wilson drives toward his conclusion, the actors go through the motions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Zoo Story" comes closer to the mark. Visually, in fact, it comes close to a 
dream production. There's glassy-eyed, bookish Peter (Randy Monte), minding his 
business on a park bench. Here comes loud, broad-shouldered, lumbering Jerry 
(O'Loane), gradually imposing his territorial claim on the bench. Monte, with 
his spindly physique, and O'Loane, with his body like a football player's, 
symbolize Albee's absurdist archetype of the two warring sides of maleness -- 
and of civilization, as Jerry makes a strong case for jungle dwellers while 
Peter argues reason and order. 
</P>
<P>
 Monte slants things too much toward caricature, and O'Loane resists the 
temptation to play this as a tour-de-force, even though that's how Albee wrote 
it. He also resists some of the comedy, as well as Jerry's monstrous 
implications. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a performance on the right track, and one hopes that's the case with 
a theater with such noble intentions as this. Now, it needs a nobler home to 
match.

CHILDREN'S THEATER REVIEW; DELIVERING A POLISHED 'PINOCCHIO,' SPLINTERS AND ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE A. FLOCKEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have you noticed that the heroes in Disney's recent animated films have more 
human foibles than the ones you grew up with? 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Lion King," Simba brags about his royal lineage but wimps out when 
it's time to assume the crown. And "The Little Mermaid" is a flighty thing -- 
one look at some studly biped and all her dad's sage advice floats clean out of 
her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Compare this to Disney's take on Carlo Collodi's "Pinocchio" in 1940: The 
title character, rascally and occasionally mean-spirited in the original story, 
was presented as a real pussycat -- sweet, naive and about as wily as an altar 
boy at High Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 If you prefer a "Pinocchio" with more sass, there's good news waiting at The 
City shopping center where Broadway on Tour is staging a version that 
re-creates some of the book's spice and humor by allowing the wooden boy's 
rough spots to shine through and adds some twists. Adapted by John Baldwin Jr. 
and directed by Rhesa Cassaday, "Pinocchio" continues Saturdays and Sundays at 
2:30 p.m. through Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 As played by Lisa Stier, this Pinocchio is what grandparents diplomatically 
call "a pistol." Opinionated and self-centered, he already has developed quite 
a 'tude by the time the audience meets up with him in Mastroni's traveling 
puppet show. Unfortunately, he is no great talent, and when Mastroni threatens 
to turn him into kindling for messing up the show, he gets some help from good 
fairy Glissandra, who finds a haven for him in Geppetto's toy shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinocchio is a bit of a snob, though, and he turns up his nose (which, as you 
may recall, can be a pretty big job) at old Geppetto's poverty. He also is a 
lousy judge of character -- an easy mark for Contessa the Cat and Dutchess the 
Fox, a pair of smooth-talking swindlers hired by Mastroni to bring him back. 
It's not until Geppetto is swallowed by a whale while searching for Pinocchio 
that the wayward lad vows to straighten up, and, after an unfortunate detour to 
Pleasure Island, he rescues the old man and earns his stripes as a real boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pinocchio's" dialogue is peppered with smart quips and contemporary humor, 
and, overall, Cassaday's 8- to 16-year-old cast members are quick and witty. 
Even the secondary roles are not short on laughs. Christina Davidson and Daina 
Baker are splendid playing the fox and cat as dainty, down-at-the-heels 
Southern belles. Mel Besaw as Glissandra and Garret Baker as Geppetto wisely 
play it straight, providing good foils for Pinocchio's humor (though it would 
be nice to see some of the peevishness Geppetto has in the original story. Who 
wouldn't be cranky dealing with this kid?) 
</P>
<P>
 Slender and light on her feet, Lisa Stier makes a fine puppet boy, tackling 
each setback in the story with the external cockiness of adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassaday did take a wrong turn in her attempts to beef up at least one minor 
role, when she allowed one of Glissandra's lieutenant fairies to add some Steve 
Urkel-style snorts and mannerisms. The bits are funny but distracting, and the 
character upstages Besaw's sweet-as-pie Glissandra at several points. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Gillespie's costumes are colorful and inventive, and the live piano 
music by Ann Geib is a nice touch, made better by some tongue-in-cheek musical 
jabs at the old Disney scores. 
</P>

CARLOS LLERAS RESTREPO; FORMER COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carlos Lleras Restrepo, 86, the former Colombian president who led the drive 
for economic union in Latin America in the 1960s. Lleras Restrepo, president 
from 1966 to 1970, designed the Andean Pact, a trade agreement that linked 
Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia and Chile.Chile later withdrew. 
During 60 years in politics, Lleras Restrepo held an array of posts, including 
minister, ambassador and congressman. But 1970 elections to choose his 
successor as president were marred by fraud, beginning a new cycle of 
turbulence in Colombia. One candidate, Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, alleged that 
he was cheated of victory and some of his supporters organized a guerrilla 
group that carried out dramatic attacks on the government. Lleras Restrepo ran 
for reelection in 1978, but the Liberal Party did not support him. In Bogota on

PRINCE LOUIS FERDINAND; GRANDSON OF KAISER WILHELM II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, 86, grandson of Germany's last emperor and 
an opponent of Adolf Hitler. Louis Ferdinand had ties to German resistance 
groups during the Nazi era, and to officers who carried out the failed 
assassination plot against Hitler in 1944.He was the second son of Germany's 
Crown Prince Wilhelm and worked as a mechanic for the Ford Motor Co. in Detroit 
during the 1930s. He later became first in the line of succession and head of 
the Hohenzollern family even though the German throne no longer existed. 
Germany's monarchy had been dissolved after World War I, when Louis Ferdinand's 
grandfather, Kaiser Wilhelm II, abdicated and went into exile and Germany 
became a republic. After World War II, the prince promised to return the 
remains of his 18th-Century ancestor, King Frederick the Great, to the palace 
Frederick built as his summer residence in Potsdam, outside Berlin. Hitler had 
ordered the coffins of Frederick and the emperor's father, Kaiser Wilhelm I, 
moved during the war for fear they might be destroyed in air raids. Potsdam was 
in Communist East Germany, which made it impossible to return the remains until 
after German reunification in 1990, and Louis Ferdinand was able to carry out 
his promise in 1991. In Bremen, Germany, on Sunday

 A tricky issue: The U.S. Postal Service wants to unveil a stamp honoring 
former President Richard Nixon, despite protests from Rep. William Clay 
(D-Mo.), the chairman of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee. If 
the Postal Service does go through with the project, we wonder if it will hold 
an Elvis-type survey to see if Americans prefer the old or the new Nixon. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Good golly, Mali: The African nation of Mali, meanwhile, is one of many other 
countries that are churning out stamps of great Americans. For instance, its 
latest releases pay tribute to Arnold Schwarzenegger (with Sharon Stone), not 
to mention Elizabeth Taylor and Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
 International stamp competition is evidently fierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Mali's mailer says "the only other stamp commemorating Eastwood was issued by 
the Maldives Islands a few years ago. . . . We believe this issue is far 
nicer." (We couldn't reach the Maldives Islands for a response.) 
</P>
<P>
 As for us, we're planning to buy several hundred stamps of La Liz in hopes of 
cashing in on its flaw -- her first name is spelled Elisabeth . Scooped you on 
that one, Liz Smith!

 One used urban folk tale, in good condition: Every once in a while, the story 
of the $50 Corvette makes the rounds. It was even the subject of a pop song a 
few years ago. We had no idea how old it was, though, until we came upon a 
slightly different version in Gene Sherman's Cityside column in The Times -- in 
1953. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sherman heard it, a classified ad offered a near-new (1952) Oldsmobile for 
$50. A couple answered the ad and were assured the figure was not a 
typographical error. The seller, a widow, wouldn't disclose the reason for the 
bargain. The couple, finding the car in tip-top shape, bought it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now I will tell you the story," the widow said afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 "It so happens my husband was in love with another woman," she continued. "And 
when he died recently he left instructions in his will that proceeds from the 
sale of this car should go to her."  
</P>
<P>
 The woman paused, then asked: "Now do you understand?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hakuna Matata? Get real: The magazine Running Times reports a squabble between 
Walt Disney Co. and a group of Kenyan runners over the rights to the phrase 
hakuna matata . The Swahili phrase, which means "no problem," is the name of a 
song in the Disney movie "The Lion King."  
</P>
<P>
 But it's also the motto of Team Stick, the group of Kenyan runners who have 
used it "to encourage each other in their austere training-oriented lifestyle" 
and also "as a suggested way of life in their presentations to schools, clinics 
and other groups," the magazine says. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Team Stick expressed anguish that the phrase is now associated 
with the singers of "Hakuna Matata" -- a wart hog and a meerkat.  
</P>
<P>
 We say it's time for the lawyers on both sides to sit down and sing a few bars 
of "Don't Worry, Be Happy." miscelLAny In 1929, a 188-pound marlin was caught 
off Catalina Island by a visiting Englishman. Not without some blood, toil, 
tears and sweat, we'll bet. He was Winston Churchill.

NEEDED: STABLE FUNDING FOR LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A library that buys no new books will before long cease to be a functioning 
library at all. The Los Angeles County public library system -- 87 branches 
serving 3.3 million users -- has been in imminent danger of just this kind of 
death for the last two years. The transfer of property tax revenue from the 
county to the state has taken a $30-million bite from the library's annual 
budget and brought book buying to a virtual halt. 
</P>
<P>
 When a community proposes specific funding for its own, local library, public 
support is often remarkably strong. But rallying support for a library system 
scattered over 3,000 square miles is more difficult. Still, a method seemed to 
have been found until Tuesday, when a snag developed. The method was the 
creation last August -- by a 3-2 vote of the county supervisors -- of a 
community facilities district for libraries. The library district would add 
$28.50 per year to the property tax bill for a single-family residence, $21.38 
for an apartment.  
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-eight libraries in unincorporated parts of the county were to be 
automatically included in the district. City councils in 16 cities voted to 
join the district, adding 21 additional libraries. Thirty-eight libraries in 
cities whose councils chose not to participate were left without relief. Still, 
for the 49 libraries, a new, stable source of library funding seemed to be in 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Tuesday, Supervisor Gloria Molina, the swing vote on this issue, chose 
to withhold her final approval. If a year-end budget surplus were to turn up 
and other pressing needs did not swallow it whole, Molina suggested, the 
library tax could be postponed or reduced. On Thursday, Chief Administrative 
Officer Sally Reed closed the county's 1993-94 books, and according to her 
there is no surplus. But Molina disagrees, and so does Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich. Balancing the $14-billion books is Reed's job, but she concedes 
that the numbers are subject to interpretation. Numbers always are. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the clock is ticking. By law, property tax bills must reach 
property owners by Nov. 1. According to Treasurer/Tax Collector Larry Monteilh, 
the logistics of meeting that deadline permit ratifying the library district as 
drafted or dropping it entirely but not tinkering with the amount of the 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 With the county facing the burden of increasing demands for stepped-up law 
enforcement and prosecution, the budget surplus, if there is one, cannot buy 
more than a small, one-time reduction in the library tax. This gain must be 
weighed against the loss of new, stable funding for half the libraries in the 
county system. If the new library district goes down in flames, the 16 cities 
that wanted to join it (four of those 16 even have placed it on the November 
ballot, at considerable cost) will feel misled. So will voters who attended 
about 190 community meetings on the measure. The hour is late, but we urge 
Molina to treat this good deal as a done deal and ratify her earlier vote.

OH, MY, WE DID MAKE A LITTLE BIT OF A MISTAKE; CIA CHOOSES TO FIRE NO ONE AND 
DEMOTE NO ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aldrich H. Ames got away with spying for the Soviet Union for nearly nine 
years because of what CIA Director R. James Woolsey describes as "a systemic 
failure of the CIA." That's a revealing choice of words. 
</P>
<P>
 By attributing to the entire "system" what he in elaboration called the 
"failure in management accountability, in judgment, in vigilance" that allowed 
the bumbling Aldrich to become a deadly betrayer, Woolsey effectively limits 
individual responsibility for the massive security breakdown that occurred. If 
the system as a whole failed, then individual nonfeasance was only incidental. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Woolsey chose to fire no one and demote no one. He did discipline five 
active and six retired senior officers. All that means, in the worst case, is 
that some of those still on the CIA's payroll will have to forgo promotions or 
awards for the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 That will strike most Americans as almost incomprehensibly generous. Woolsey 
says he was concerned that harsher punishments could have eroded morale in the 
CIA. Maybe. But surely there should be no less concern that Woolsey's forgiving 
attitude could be taken as validating the culture of permissive laxity that let 
Ames carry out what the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee calls 
"the worst disaster in CIA history." 
</P>
<P>
 If Ames had been a highly trained, brilliantly camouflaged, fiendishly clever 
master spy then his ability to escape exposure for so long might be 
understandable. But he was none of those things. He was a -- literally -- 
falling-down drunk who openly flouted the agency's rules and freely spent the 
$2 million he was paid by Moscow, a man who did everything but put up 
billboards and hire skywriters to call attention to his treachery. 
</P>
<P>
 It made no difference. "One could almost conclude," Woolsey said, "not only 
that no one was watching, but that no one cared." 
</P>
<P>
 For all his boozing, for all his incompetence -- Ames was ranked 197th out of 
200 officers at his level -- he was repeatedly promoted. With promotions came 
access, and with access came the means for Ames to send at least 10 agents to 
their deaths and compromise dozens of intelligence networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress is not in a forgiving mood toward the CIA. The intelligence 
committees, some of whose members find increasingly vexatious the agency's 
slowness in reorienting itself in the post-Cold War world, haven't at all liked 
what they heard from the CIA's inspector general about the Ames case. Some are 
publicly questioning whether Woolsey has what's needed to remedy the basic 
problems at the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 High among those problems, as the Ames case made so dramatically clear, is the 
chummy approach to personnel matters that let even someone as notably 
disreputable as Ames get away with flagrant misbehavior. That problem had 
better be eliminated once and for all, and now. 
</P>
<P>
 The old-boy protectiveness of the CIA, so visible when it for so long delayed 
cooperating with the FBI in going after the mole in its viscera, must end. If 
that requires, to borrow Woolsey's formulation, a full systemic shake-up, then 
so be it. However great a disaster Ames was for the CIA he was a greater one 
for the United States. In moving to make sure such a disaster can't recur, it 
is the interests of the nation and not the agency that must be held paramount.

JIMMY CARTER'S ROLE IN HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The criticism of former President Jimmy Carter's diplomacy is an implicit 
criticism of his effort to practice Christian teaching such as the precepts 
expressed in the Sermon on the Mount. Carter, as did Gandhi and the Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr., tried to break through the thuggish limits of Realpolitik by 
reaching out to the latent humanity of other human beings however demonized and 
to evoke some minimal honor and will to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a national government filled with those schooled in the political 
rationales of self-interest and an American public psychologically isolated 
from the cares, struggles, opportunities and amazing resilience of the rest of

themselves the brutality that the Haitian people have endured for decades.

 * I am appalled by the repeated denouncing of amnesty for the Haitian 
generals. If democracy is ever to be installed in Haiti, the cycle of revenge 
must be stopped sometime. At one time or another, someone must forgo the 
temptation to exact blood for blood. This point seems to have been missed by 
the American liberals slavering for the blood of those whom they despise.

 * In November of 1990, Jean-Bertrand Aristide won an overwhelming 67% of the 
Haitian votes. While the people rejoiced the victory, the U.S. State Department 
frowned at it in displeasure. When Aristide embarked on two bold projects, to 
improve the economy and to reform the balance between the military/police and 
civilian sectors, Washington promptly put in high gear its always "at ready" 
machinery to undermine the road to independence and prosperity planned for 
Haitians by Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Aristide's democratic reforms, "the Golden Fleece" -- the cheap labor in 
the impoverished island, about 25 cents per hour -- would slip away, along with 
profits of tourism services for U.S. markets. All the benefits the U.S. 
businesses reaped in Haiti for decades of Duvalier family dictatorship would 
have been history had Aristide remained in power. 
</P>
<P>
 So, an Aristide-reformist became a threat to the U.S. businesses and for 
national security reasons was earmarked for removal from the office. 
</P>
<P>
 After years in exile, probably a new and more compliant and "understanding" 
Aristide is on the way home. The military oppressors in Haiti, trained, armed 
and funded by the U.S., are cooperative now as they were in carrying out the 
coup that ousted the original Aristide. Let us pray for those wretched but 
proud people in Haiti to survive the second occupation in this century by "the 
only superpower in the world."

Kissinger finds the motivation Clinton may have had for sending troops to Haiti 
while still negotiating with its leaders shocking. Rushing troops to "land 
before Congress could pass a resolution of disapproval . . . marked an 
astonishing disintegration of the executive-congressional relationship," 
breathes Kissinger. This from the man who secretly bombed Cambodia without 
telling anyone but Nixon and the bombers. Talk about an astonishing

wealthy for free!); Sept. 26: "Wealthy Haitians See Chance for Profit in U.S.

those families to whom the Haitian army devotes its allegiance? The same 
procedure has taken place in Panama with little, if any, benefit to the 
progress of democracy.

<P>
 My suggestion is to make the wealthy families of Haiti pay for the rebuilding 
of the infrastructure and democracy in Haiti.

BLACK PANTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Column Right by David Horowitz ("A '60s Revival We Don't Need: Black 
Panthers," Sept. 22le) is a very distorted account of black militancy in the 
1960s. Horowitz recklessly labels the Black Panthers as "an organized street 
gang with political hustle" who allegedly committed crimes against ghetto 
residents. Many members of the Panther party, as shown in the works of 
historian Manning Marable and the recent autobiography of former Panther Elaine 
Brown, did not engage in criminal activity and fought tirelessly against severe 
deprivation and racial injustices. Such dedication produced a number of social 
programs which met certain needs of poor black families and restored some 
dignity and pride to their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent formation of Panther chapters in several large cities is of great 
concern to Horowitz. He chastises the leaders of two chapters for threatening 
public authorities with violent and revolutionary change. This militancy is 
largely the result of economic neglect and misery that extend back to the 
terrible conditions in the ghetto 30 years ago. Horowitz would serve the public 
far better by devoting more attention to the grievances of the '60s Panthers 
and discussing the connection between their defiance and current black anger. 
</P>

 Horowitz closed by claiming he has waged an uphill battle to bring the true 
story of the Panthers to light and to keep it in the public eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Without appearing to defend the Panthers, I believe in the interest of truth 
he should have pointed out that for many years the FBI literally ran the 
Panthers by extensively infiltrating the movement. The head of the Chicago 
Black Panthers, Fred Hampton, was shot to death in his bed by the Chicago 
police. His bodyguard, who was an undercover agent, had slipped Hampton a 
knockout pill. 
</P>
<P>
 For 13 years a court case ensued, which resulted in the exoneration of 
Hampton, but no criminal charges were filed against the Chicago police. 
However, there was a settlement of a $1.5 million award paid to Hampton's 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts of the FBI to discredit and destroy various movements in the 1960s 
is well-documented, the most notorious case being that of J. Edgar Hoover's 
vendetta against Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

 Re "Women at Risk Are Still in the Dark," Commentary, Sept. 9: 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Epstein's column on the dangers of breast implants is a shocking 
exercise in medical terrorism. Epstein cites animal experiments that support 
his contention and ignores all those that do not.More importantly, he ignores 
the strong and consistent evidence that breast implants do not cause cancer in 
humans. Statements such as "the Food and Drug Administration has consistently 
downplayed any cancer risk from silicone gel implants" and "at known higher 
risk of breast cancer are 350,000 women with foam-wrapped implants" are simply 
false and reckless. 
</P>
<P>
 For 17 years colleagues and I have studied the cancer patterns of breast 
implant recipients. The surprising truth is, breast implant patients develop 
significantly fewer breast cancers than expected. These results are published 
and no doubt well known to Epstein. Furthermore, no breast cancers have been 
reported among the tens of thousands of women who have received 
polyurethane-covered implants. The panel of experts assembled by the FDA in 
1992 determined that the risk is negligible and recommended that the devices 
remain available. 
</P>
<P>
 While Epstein demonstrates a deep concern for the health of rodents with 
breast implants, women should no longer be denied the truth: After 30 years of 
use in hundreds of thousands of patients, breast implants have not been shown 
to cause any disease. Careful research projects are continuing at many 
institutions.

PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO; OLD 'DARK FORCES' STALK NEW REFORMER; WITH THE MURDER OF 
HIS PARTY'S KEY MEDIATOR, THE INCOMING PRESIDENT MAY BE TEMPTED TO EASE UP -- 
AN OMINOUS POSSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE DRESSER, Denise Dresser, a professor of political science at the 
Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico, is a visiting fellow at the 
Inter-American Dialogue in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as Mexican politics were given a clean bill of health by a peaceful 
election, the assassination Wednesday of the secretary general of the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has revealed that political violence 
was only in temporary remission. The murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu 
throws a wrench into the calm placid transition that President-elect Ernesto 
Zedillo had envisioned for himself. Unresolved power struggles and political 
battles are still smoldering, and unless they are defused, Zedillo's presidency 
may begin stillborn. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding the crest of a triumphalist wave, Zedillo was making plans to keep his 
campaign promises: to unlink the PRI from the government, reform the party, 
promote judicial reform and crack down on drug traffickers and their allies in 
the Mexican bureaucracy. However, the murder of Ruiz Massieu, a former governor 
of Guerrero who was expected to become interior minister in Zedillo's cabinet, 
reveals that, despite his claims to the contrary, Zedillo does not have a 
mandate over the entirety of Mexico or even its political class. 
</P>
<P>
 The permanence of the modernizing technobureaucrats headed by incumbent 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari is not a done deal or a foregone 
conclusion. So-called dark forces within the PRI, and their aides in the 
country's burgeoning drug-trafficking business, may be sending a clear warning 
against any further tinkering.  
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to advance PRI reform have always encountered entrenched opposition 
because the PRI has never really been a political party; in Mexico the PRI is a 
way of life, a system for distributing spoils, assuring patronage and, in 
recent years, a political vehicle for private enrichment via the drug trade. In 
order to win the election, Zedillo sold his soul to the devil and allied 
himself with some of the more traditional powerbrokers within the PRI's many 
loosely knit coalitions. After his victory Aug. 21, Zedillo probably believed 
that his unexpectedly wide margin of the vote gave him leeway to distance 
himself from unattractive allies. Having propelled Zedillo into the 
presidential chair, however, it is unlikely that the "dinosaurs" of the old 
guard would approve plans for their extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu was known in political circles as a "baby dinosaur": a middleman 
between the traditional party stalwarts and the reformist techno-bureaucrats. A 
close Salinas ally, he had skillfully bridged the gap between the forces behind 
Zedillo's last-minute candidacy. In order to further ingratiate himself with 
Zedillo, Ruiz Massieu metamorphosed into a staunch advocate of the 
president-elect's modernization agenda. He had spent the past weeks applauding 
the virtues of the Zedillo program for party renewal; just before he was shot, 
he had outlined that program for incoming PRI legislators. He seemed willing 
and able to leave longtime partners in the bureaucracy and the PRI behind as he 
moved up into the new president's circle. Perceived betrayal may have 
translated into a bloody quest for revenge against Ruiz Massieu -- or against 
his brother, the deputy attorney general in charge of dismantling Mexico's drug 
cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder of Ruiz Massieu probably was intended to remind Zedillo of his 
Faustian bargain and compel him to put the PRI's reform and a promised 
anti-drug crusade on the back burner, and possibly off the stove for the next 
six years. Zedillo's commitment to a full-fledged modernization agenda against 
the PRI as a source of power, privilege and corruption is being tested. Whether 
he will have the political mettle to prevail is far from certain. What is 
certain is that Mexican politics cannot continue to evolve if the PRI-related 
corruption and influence-peddling remains a clear and present danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The assassination should prove to Zedillo that relatively clean elections and 
an implied mandate are not enough to assure political stability. In Mexico, 
most institutions -- the judiciary, legislatures, labor unions -- are not 
neutral frameworks for channeling political change but rather PRI-dominated 
fiefdoms, and many of them have fallen under the pernicious influence of the 
drug boom.  
</P>
<P>
 Unless Zedillo takes the initiative, hard-line and corrupt factions within the 
PRI could fall back into the complacency, the standard operating procedures and 
the arrogance of power that have characterized Mexican leadership in the past. 
If Zedillo does not seize this opportunity to rid himself of uncomfortable 
bedfellows, Mexico might transit from an incipientdemocracy back to an 
unstable, violent and increasingly crisis-prone dictatorship.

IS THERE NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE TO URBAN DESPAIR?; CRIME: ROSA PARKS TRIUMPHED IN 
ALABAMA ONLY TO BECOME ANOTHER VICTIM OF RANDOM ASSAULT IN DETROIT.

 The man accused of assaulting Rosa Parks in Detroit a few weeks ago could have 
passed you on the street that day, no matter where you live. You wouldn't have 
to be poor, be black, be somewhere you shouldn't be for his kind of trouble to 
be standing right over your shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 What do we know about him? That he's jobless and under 30, living in an 
abandoned house, apparently unmarried and a drinker, known on the streets as an 
opportunistic sometime-burglar. 
</P>
<P>
 You could have seen him in Times Square looking for action. You could have 
seen him at the Santa Monica Pier panhandling. The tragedy of America in the 
'90s is that the man accused of assaulting Rosa Parks lives in nearly every 
city and backwater in the nation, and he has nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 The man accused of assaulting Rosa Parks was apprehended outside a grocery 
store, tackled to the ground by a man his age who recognized him from a police 
composite. The store is a block from my family's house. I used to stop there 
for candy on my way home from school, just one store on a block that used to 
have a Chinese restaurant, a bakery, a dry cleaners and families living 
upstairs in apartments. All those things are gone now. 
</P>
<P>
 That was in the era, the 1950s, when Rosa Parks was coming into the full 
flower of her fame -- or to segregationists, her brazenness -- as the woman 
whose defiance of an order to move to the back of an Alabama bus avalanched 
into the modern civil-rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has come, more than ever, to ask ourselves why the life, the 
commerce, the vibrancy are gone now from so many neighborhoods in America and 
why, above all, we have become a society in which so many young men have 
nothing to lose.  
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit that I'm speaking of is not the withering hulk that, fairly or 
not, springs to most minds. It was a Detroit of flush and happy working people, 
fresh from the factory or department store, fat paycheck in hand. It was a 
Detroit where new cars flew past on the expressways, stacked three-deep on 
trailer-trucks headed for Syracuse, Boise and Oklahoma City. A Detroit that was 
a magnet for ex-GIs, laborers and professional people alike, because, as a 
friend whose father settled here as a young dentist told me, the word went out 
that folks were making money here and paid their bills on time. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents used to bring home the Michigan Chronicle, the Pittsburgh Courier, 
the Chicago Defender, proud black newspapers that were packed in those days 
with the details of the civil-rights struggle: the marches, the political 
defeats, the court victories, the photographs of "first" black telephone 
operators and utility company clerks, the murders of Southern black leaders 
like Medgar Evers. It's easy from a comfortable distance to romanticize the era 
and forget that, for too many, it was a life and death struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is still unknown. Rosa Parks was beaten by a young man who could, in 
fact, owe her his life. Yes, owe it to her, in the sense that 40 years of 
change have, at a minimum, reduced hunger, lessened police brutality, reduced 
the chances of an emergency hospital turning him away. But the work is only 
half done. Look at all the young people, especially men, who have nothing to 
lose. No job to lose if they land in jail. No family to jeopardize if the 
paychecks stop coming. 
</P>
<P>
 While we may have created a generation with nothing to lose, there is not one 
among us who was born to lose.

AMERICAN MINORITIES TRY TO HOLD THE LINE; IMMIGRATION: LATINOS, ASIANS AND 
BLACKS ARE THE FIRST TO FEEL THE SQUEEZE OF ILLEGAL RESIDENTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Ethnic political organizations campaigning against Proposition 187 are doing 
an injustice to the minority groups they claim to represent. Polls have shown 
repeatedly that most members of minority groups, including Latinos, wish to see 
reductions in immigration, both legal and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, has said that "migration, legal and undocumented . . . 
(greatly increases job) competition within the Latino community. . . . There is 
an issue of wage depression, as in the garment industry, which is predominantly 
immigrant." 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably motivated by similar concerns, United Farm Workers co-founder 
Dolores Huerta told a state Assembly committee: "With 1.5 million legalized 
immigrants living in California, and only approximately 250,000 agricultural 
jobs in the state, there is no need for additional farm workers." 
</P>
<P>
 Lora Jo Foo of the Asian Law Caucus has noted that longtime legal residents 
are seeing "their wages and working conditions eroded by undocumented workers 
and new (legal) immigrants." A Chinatown waitress said recently that she makes 
$300 a month, working 60 hours a week -- a salary of about $1 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Po Wong of the Chinese Newcomer Service Center in San Francisco protested that 
the community could not handle the influx of legal immigrants, much less absorb 
the illegal population.  
</P>
<P>
 A 1988 General Accounting Office study of the Los Angeles hotel industry found 
that jobs formerly held by African Americans were now done mainly by 
immigrants. Studies have shown a similar displacement of blacks in the 
restaurant industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Further light is shed on the matter by Proposition 186, the single-payer 
health plan on the November ballot. Dr. Floyd Huen has been campaigning for 
186, emphasizing its benefits to minority groups. It is thus significant that 
Huen recently stated that the measure excludes coverage for illegal residents 
because "otherwise, the cost would be tremendous, and we wouldn't be able to 
provide benefits for the legal residents." 
</P>
<P>
 The ethnic political organizations assert that 187's exclusion of undocumented 
children from public schools would result in the kids roaming the streets. This 
claim is an egregious insult to the parents. They would find ways to cope, such 
as putting the kids in Catholic schools, which the church, which opposes 187, 
would be obligated to expand; or the children could be sent back to their home 
countries to live with relatives and go to school there. 
</P>
<P>
 The ethnic activists also are weakening the precious bonds between teachers 
and minority students by saying that 187 would turn teachers into snitches, 
having to report to the Immigration and Naturalization Service any student 
suspected of being in the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 This is clearly false. The initiative requires school administrators, not 
teachers, to do the checking.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics of 187 note that the legislative analyst has stated that its INS 
reporting requirements might place at risk some federal funding. But the 
critics omit the Legislative Analyst's observation that in such a case, most 
likely the state and federal governments would work together to iron things 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost any piece of legislation has flaws that must be amended later. 
Proposition 187 would be no exception. Ethnic political activists are 
portraying Proposition 187 as a "white" issue. It most definitely is not. All 
legal residents, minorities in particular, are adversely affected by the flow 
of the undocumented into our state.

 News of the death of health reform is greatly exaggerated. By failing to enact 
legislation this term, Congress has certainly removed itself as a focal point 
in the debate. But to say that spells the end of reform is to ignore what has 
been happening in hospitals, doctors' offices, work-places and state 
legislatures while Capitol Hill held the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of Americans are already experiencing what President Clinton's health 
security plan would have imposed by government fiat -- managed care. 
Projections show that by the end of this year, as much as 60% of the privately 
insured work force will be in managed care programs, compared with about 33% in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a stunning turnaround, affecting just about every aspect of health 
care, from the doctor-patient relationship to economic incentives for research 
and new technology to the halls of academe. In a managed care world, there's no 
place for medical schools that continue to turn out specialists in the volume 
that so badly skewed the nation's physician supply. And, while questions remain 
about managed care's ability to deliver what it promises -- quality at a lower 
price -- there is no denying that the experiment is well under way without any 
assist from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider what states have done while eyes, ears and headlines were riveted on 
Washington's attempt to craft a single solution for the nation. Since President 
Clinton unveiled his plan a year ago, 40 states have passed 99 laws 
implementing elements of the Administration's proposal and competing 
alternatives. Arizona, for example, amended its tax code to permit individual 
medical savings accounts, 19 states reformed insurance laws and 20 paved the 
way for group purchasing cooperatives. In California, voters will weigh in this 
November on a proposed single-payer insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, health reform didn't begin with the 1992 presidential campaign, 
and it won't end because Congress failed to act this term.  
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to stay enthusiastic about Washington's version of reform when the 
issue that brought so many people together -- the suffering of 37 million 
Americans who can't afford insurance or medical care -- is buried in partisan 
bickering. But that doesn't mean people no longer care about the plight of the 
uninsured, or that middle-class Americans no longer worry that job loss or 
personal catastrophe might add them to the count. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some of the most interesting reform experiments are reaching out to 
precisely these outcasts. They are mostly community-based efforts, and none 
presume to have the answer for all 37 million. But in the modesty of their 
goals may lie wisdom that eluded the brilliant theorists of top-down reform. 
The sheer variety of approaches in these grass-roots efforts makes them 
excellent laboratories for testing reform theories before committing billions 
from the national Treasury. The variety also suggests that local communities 
may better grasp the subtleties of why certain people don't get health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento is one such proving ground. There, the county health department has 
teamed up with the medical school at UC Davis, the local medical society and 
several private hospitals to bring health services to poor people living 
downtown. Yet, even in this middle-sized city with two relatively small, 
underserved neighborhoods, the organizers found two distinct neighborhoods, 
each requiring a different approach. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighborhood contains an older, mostly homeless population in need of 
specialized care for heart disease, arthritis and other problems that beset 
people as they age. The other neighborhood is teeming with young immigrant 
families; prenatal, pediatric, immunization and family planning services top 
the list of needs, as well as clinic staff conversant in Hmong and Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 Can these projects reach their goals within the existing health care 
framework? Time will tell. They will certainly help inform the next round of 
debate in Congress. And it may yield a blueprint for national reform that rings 
truer to what Americans already are experiencing than the proposals killed on 
Capitol Hill.

GUBER LEAVES SONY PICTURES TO FORM OWN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Guber, the mercurial movie producer tapped five years ago by electronics 
giant Sony Corp. to build its movie business, quit Thursday as the company's 
top executive in Hollywood, finally dissolving one of the priciest and most 
tumultuous regimes in recent motion picture history. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber, who with fellow producer Jon Peters was lured by Sony's Japanese owners 
with an outlay of more than $700 million to lead the company to the top of the 
Hollywood heap, will leave his post as chairman and chief executive of Sony 
Pictures Entertainment immediately to form a Sony-backed entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber's departure -- the topic of speculation all year because of the poor 
performance of Sony's movie business -- comes at a critical time for Sony 
Pictures. The company has lagged behind other major studios in movie production 
and, critics say, lacks a clear strategy for taking advantage of today's rapid 
shifts in the entertainment business. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Sony's well-publicized problems, Guber and Michael P. Schulhof, Sony's 
top official in the United States, insisted in interviews that leaving was 
Guber's idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Guber's move was viewed by Hollywood executives as a graceful way to 
give Guber and an increasingly impatient Sony the fresh start both wanted. 
Guber leaves with a lucrative payout, including an unspecified share of a 
special $50-million bonus he is said to be splitting with a handful of Sony 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are my interests, my passions and concerns with this kind of job? Clearly, 
right now, they are no longer. That's what motivated the change," Guber said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber is the second major film studio chief to leave in two months. Jeffrey 
Katzenberg disclosed last month that he will leave as chairman of Walt Disney 
Studios effective this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber's departure is yet another chapter in Sony's five-year ordeal of trying 
to build a movie business, or "software," to complement the company's 
electronics "hardware," as its executives call it. The company by some 
estimates has sunk $6 billion to $7 billion into Hollywood, an investment that 
so far remains far from paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such early movie successes as "City Slickers," "A League of Their Own" 
and "Sleepless in Seattle" during his time at Sony, Guber's tenure the past 15 
months has brought the studio an unprecedented level of scrutiny and criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the summer of 1993, Sony has suffered through such public 
embarrassments as the debacle "Last Action Hero," said to have lost around $25 
million, and the media frenzy surrounding the scandal involving the alleged 
Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, which was linked to Sony when one of its Columbia 
executives publicly denied that he had no ties to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Sony's movie business has been plagued by a string of money-losing 
flops, including "North," "Little Big League" and "I'll Do Anything." Its 
combined market share of the movie business for its Columbia and TriStar units 
continues to trail all of its major competitors. One top financial analyst 
estimated its negative cash flow at $250 million in the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sony has suffered through turmoil in its executive ranks, 
complaints from producers about a logjam in getting projects approved, and the 
inability of Sony officials to attract a strategic partner to invest in the 
studio. Columbia's release schedule also slowed to a trickle early this year, 
with only two movies released in the first five months compared to seven during 
the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining his move, Guber said he wanted to take the "ee" out of his title 
and add an "er" to it -- becoming an employer instead of employee. He added 
that changes in his personal life -- including turning 50 in 1992, the recent 
adoption of two children by Guber and his wife, and his receiving a full 
professorship at UCLA -- caused him to re-evaluate his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the third act of my life," said Guber, who is expected to work the 
next few weeks raising money overseas for his venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof, who developed a close friendship with Guber to the point where their 
children once dated, said he supported Guber's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four months ago, Peter came to me and said, 'I think my time is up,' " 
Schulhof said. "When he told me what he had in mind, to create an entertainment 
company, I said, 'Not only will I support it, I'll invest in it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sony said it will not replace Guber, and that Sony Pictures will be run by 
Alan J. Levine, a low-profile lawyer who has been at the studio for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine retains his current title of president and chief operating officer, and 
has signed a new contract, believed to be for five years. The arrangement is 
similar to the structure Schulhof set up at Sony Music, where he oversees the 
operation but allows Tommy Mottola, also chief operating officer and president, 
to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said he did not expect to make many changes, and defended Guber's 
tenure, saying that critics have unfairly blamed Guber for movie operations and 
ignored more successful operations such as television and its movie theater 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always focus on just the movies. They say they had a good movie, so it 
must have been Peter. They had a bad movie, so it must have been Peter. He was 
chairman and CEO of the whole company," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine suggested that there would be little change, although others have 
suggested that Guber's departure might lead to further combining of the 
Columbia and TriStar operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine and Schulhof adamantly denied speculation that former CBS Entertainment 
chief Jeffrey Sagansky -- recently hired as a Sony executive vice president -- 
will play a bigger role in the studio's operations. Other sources said that 
Sagansky is not that interested in the movie operation. Sources also discounted 
talk that Katzenberg will be involved in Sony. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation also has increased that Mark Canton, who oversees Columbia and 
TriStar, has been given a set amount of time to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 Canton, who recently extended his contract, suggested that he has no plans to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Sony decided to extend my deal a month and a half ago, they made all the 
statement they need to make about my ability. I have no plans to leave. My sole 
interest is doing this job as well as I can. . . . I'm not nearly living up to 
my own standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "For six or eight months, things went awry," Canton said. "I'm not trying to 
sweep that under the rug. But the only paralysis these days is in my neck from 
reading so much material. Between Columbia and TriStar, we'll release eight 
movies before the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Guber's deal was worked out late Tuesday. A dozen or so department heads were 
called together for its announcement Thursday morning. One participant said no 
one expected the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber and Peters, his production partner on such 1980s hits as "Batman" and 
"Gorillas in the Mist," were an odd couple when Sony picked them in 1989. Guber 
cut his ponytail and shed his T-shirts for suits. The two attracted attention 
for spending lavishly to upgrade the Sony lot, and stories abounded about 
elaborate spending, such as the use of a corporate jet to deliver flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 One producer who has worked with Guber said that Guber's personality is more 
cut out for creative work than corporate jobs. "He's a way better maker of 
movies than 99% of the producers around town. He may have miscast himself as 
the mogul," the producer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber's office once housed legendary mogul Louis B. Mayer when Sony's lot was 
the old Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer facility. On Thursday, Guber said a picture of 
Mayer he keeps on his desk helps him keep the latest developments in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I get full of myself, I look at it and remind myself that I'm only 
renting," he said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; KILLINGS BRING PRESSURE ON MEXICO'S POLITICAL SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second major political assassination in six months raised questions 
Thursday about the continuing effectiveness of the system that has kept this 
nation stable for six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, the virtual one-party system -- which Peruvian writer Mario 
Vargas Llosa has called "a perfect dictatorship" -- seemed less so as federal 
police investigated the killing of yet another prominent figure. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon used to murder Francisco Ruiz Massieu -- the second-ranking 
official in the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has ruled this 
country for 65 years -- has been traced to a community in the Rio Grande Valley 
in Texas, law enforcement sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of U.S. authorities, investigators have determined that the 
Intratec 9-millimeter handgun, a model known as a "Tec 9," was purchased in the 
unnamed border city, sources said. But it not immediately clear who made the 
purchase and when. 
</P>
<P>
 As the investigation continued, Mexicans mourned and confronted doubts about 
their political system, public safety and the seeming impunity of drug dealers 
as they conducted funeral services for Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming just six months after the assassination of PRI presidential candidate 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, Ruiz Massieu's murder heightens worries that Mexico could 
be returning to the days of political violence that this nation endured in the 
1920s, which led to the formation of the PRI as a peaceful way to broker power 
struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu was fatally shot Wednesday morning in front of a downtown hotel 
as he left a breakfast for his party's recently elected federal deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 His body lay in state at party headquarters Wednesday evening, later being 
moved to a funeral home in the south of the capital, where a small group of 
mourners gathered Thursday morning, until he was taken to the Spanish Cemetery 
for cremation. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens paying tribute to the politician got into a shouting match as they 
reviewed the events that have shaken their country this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person who pulled the trigger did not do this on his own; there was 
somebody behind him," said Maria Concepcion Moguel, 60, a retired government 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Manuel Zavala Sanchez, 50, an engineer, answered sharply, "You do not 
know that." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my opinion," she snapped back. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what about Colosio?" shouted another voice from the crowd, weaving an 
elaborate conspiracy theory. "Do you know when this is going to be solved?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Never," responded Moguel. "It's the PRI, the system itself. They are killing 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to blame it on drug dealers," said one man, who would not 
give his name. "Who is going to believe that?" 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. law enforcement sources said they find plausible the scenario that 
drug traffickers had killed Ruiz Massieu to send a message to his brother, 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Mario Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good theory," a U.S. official said. "But that's all it is -- a theory. 
Mario Ruiz has been active in directing (anti-drug) operations and providing 
manpower to go after the cartels." 
</P>
<P>
 Any of Mexico's top drug cartels could have been involved in the murder, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Ruiz Massieu also had visibly stepped up efforts to capture Benjamin, 
Javier and Ramon Arellano, the drug lords believed to have masterminded a 
Guadalajara airport shootout last year. Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo was 
killed in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arellano brothers have recently been identified as suspects in the murder 
earlier this year of Tijuana Police Chief Jose Federico Benitez. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a special team of more than 150 federal police agents swooped into 
Baja California to press the hunt for the fugitive Arellanos, leaders of the 
Tijuana cartel. The raids resulted in 15 arrests, including a cartel lieutenant 
and a former chief homicide detective of the Baja state police; the detective 
is accused of helping Ramon Arellano escape a March shootout between corrupt 
state officers and federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arellanos are considered particularly violence-prone and are influential 
enough to have eluded capture with the help of a protective network of corrupt 
officials. The simultaneously brazen and bumbling style of the Ruiz Massieu 
assassination, in which the gunman's weapon -- capable of either fully 
automatic or semiautomatic fire -- jammed after firing a single bullet, 
resembles previous incidents involving Arellano hit men. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. law enforcement officials familiar with Mexican cartels were 
reluctant to speculate whether the Arellanos or other kingpins would choose to 
strike back at law enforcement by killing a political figure. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible involvement of drug dealers, though, gives renewed credence to 
concerns about an alliance between narcotics cartels and some political 
factions. Eduardo Valle, a former high-ranking official in the attorney 
general's office, has asserted that those groups have teamed up to turn Mexico 
into a "narco-democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's beleaguered police seem unable to prevent the violence or to solve 
high-profile crimes, such as the Colosio and Posadas Ocampo assassinations or a 
rash of kidnapings of wealthy businessmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about violence was an important issue in last month's presidential 
election, which Colosio's successor, Ernesto Zedillo, won on a campaign that 
emphasized peace and stability. Reform of the judicial system, from police to 
the courts, was an important plank in his platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of public confidence in law enforcement's ability to solve crimes was 
evidenced by the fact that once again questions are being raised, hours after 
his arrest at the scene, about the identity of the person accused of the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, two local newspaper reports cast doubt that the suspect held by 
police in Ruiz Massieu's murder is Hector or Joel Resendiz from the victim's 
hometown of Acapulco. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-owned El Nacional quoted Federal Judicial Police sources as 
identifying the man in custody as Daniel Aguilar Trevino from the northern 
state of Tamaulipas, where authorities on Wednesday conducted sweeps against 
the "Gulf" drug cartel. He allegedly told authorities that two men paid him the 
equivalent of $17,000 to commit the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In Acapulco, neighbors of the Resendiz Gutierrez family told the newspaper 
Reforma that the man photographed at the crime scene is not the man they know 
as Hector or Joel Resendiz. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the attorney general's office said they will not comment on the 
stories until late Thursday or release the suspect's second last name, which is 
often crucial to establishing identity. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion is reminiscent of the controversy that arose after Colosio's 
assassination in Tijuana on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seed of instability has been planted in the country," Moguel said. "Now 
besides the hunger we have in this country, there is also fear."  
</P>
<P>
 Darling reported from Mexico City and Rotella from San Diego. Susan Drommet of 
The Times' Mexico City Bureau also contributed to this report.

VENTURA COUNTY NEWSWATCH

 BIG SPENDERS: Enjoyment of the great outdoors can come with a big price tag. . 
. . The average camping party shells out about $180 just getting to and from 
campgrounds in Ventura County and elsewhere in California, a state study shows. 
Once there, they spend $73 a day on camping fees, food, souvenirs and side 
trips. . . . Those figures sound just fine to park officials in Ventura County 
battling government funding cuts. "Parks provide more to local and state 
economies than generally is recognized," parks spokesman Wes Chapin said. 
</P>
<P>
 SENIOR TECHIES: With lots of time, knowledge and life experience at their 
command, it seems only natural that senior citizens are among the 
fastest-growing groups of home-computer users (E3). . . . At Camarillo's 
Leisure Village, where computer use is on the rise, Anne Wolfson is fast 
becoming a whiz. She took a course four years ago, after she visited a library 
and couldn't figure out how to turn one of the contraptions on. "Kids came in 
and started using them -- bing, bing, bing," said Wolfson, 72. "I figured if 
they can do it, I can too." 
</P>
<P>
 STADIUM RACE: And the winner is -- Ventura. . . . Or, maybe not. A committee 
ranked Ventura first over Camarillo and Oxnard as the best place to build a 
Class A baseball stadium in the county (B1). But a Camarillo landowner has also 
offered a deal. Will a stadium ever get built? "We're on track, but the verdict 
is still out as to which site," said Bill Little, Camarillo's city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 SCOTTISH CHAMP: Melissa Webster of Oxnard has danced her way to a national 
championship for the second year in a row. . . . The 14-year-old won the U. S. 
title in Scottish highland dance in the under-15 age category in the Capital 
District 17th Scottish Games in Albany, N. Y., earlier this month. . . . Last 
year, she won in the 13-and-under division. And the La Reina High School 
student doesn't limit herself -- she also dances with the Channel Islands 
Ballet Company. Happy Camping 
</P>
<P>
 Californians spent nearly $1.9 billion while staying at the state's 
campgrounds in 1992. Here's a sample of spending in some counties, in millions:

PEROT PARTISAN COULD BE SPOILER, BOOST CUOMO'S REELECTION ODDS 
</P>

<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a development that could help Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, an independent candidate 
said Thursday he will launch a multimillion-dollar advertising campaign now 
that he has been granted a spot on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Golisano, chairman of the Rochester-area firm Paychex, acted after the 
state Board of Elections ruled Wednesday that he could be on the ballot as a 
candidate of the newly created Independence Fusion Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano, an admirer of Ross Perot, is running on a platform that calls for 
cutting corporate taxes and slashing spending. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will blanket the state with television, radio and newspaper ads and 
predicted he might spend between $8 million and $10 million of his own money on 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo, a Democrat seeking a fourth term, is in a very close race against 
Republican George Pataki. Golisano is potentially Pataki's worst nightmare, 
because Republicans fear that the businessman could steal anti-Cuomo votes and 
damage Pataki's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Cipolla, a Pataki supporter, had asked the elections board to keep 
Golisano off the ballot. Cipolla said he still wasn't sure Thursday whether 
Golisano's candidacy would be challenged in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Golisano said he didn't worry about being a spoiler. He said he saw little 
difference between Cuomo and Pataki. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think either one of them are in the position of being able to create 
much change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 52-year-old businessman runs a company that produces payroll checks for 
corporations. He estimates his net worth at $140 million. He said he first 
voted two years ago when he backed Perot's presidential campaign.

DANA PARSONS : BRAVELY STEPPING INTO BREACH BETWEEN A MOTHER AND SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Joan Irvine Smith, 
</P>
<P>
 We've never met, but let me begin by saying I'm one of your greatest admirers. 
In a world of shrubs, you're a redwood. You're a glacier to everyone else's ice 
cube, a constellation to their candle, a superhighway to their dusty road, a -- 
well, you get my point, don't you? 
</P>
<P>
 By way of introduction, I'm a writer, but as you can see, not a very good one. 
Plus, I'm a little nervous, given that you have no idea who I am and that 
you're worth several hundred million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm writing to you because I thought you might need some bolstering. I read in 
the paper this week that you might disinherit your son, Morton, because of his 
marriage two weeks ago to a woman of whom you disapprove. The article said his 
decision to marry might cost him up to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Your son was quoted as saying he'd rather marry for love than money. His 
bride, a nurse described as having "working class roots," agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 I want you to know I support your position 100%. Sweet Mother Mary, do I 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-serving statements of your son and daughter-in-law would be laughable 
were they not so contemptible. "I did the right thing as far as my heart told 
me," your son said. I'm sure those same people who slobbered over "Sleepless in 
Seattle" or "The Bridges of Madison County" might side with him -- and think 
poorly of you -- and that's why I'm rushing to your defense, even if it means 
taking an unpopular position. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardon my bluntness, Joan (may I call you Joan?), but I deplore what your son 
has done. He said he hoped the rift could be healed, but considering he went 
ahead with the marriage knowing how you felt, that sounded awfully hollow to 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me hastily add that I strongly disapprove of her too. True, I've never met 
nor spoken to her (nor your son), but I just feel strongly that I would dislike 
her -- assuming, that is, that you continue to feel that way. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you think I'm a nut, let me assure you that I'm not. Many small-minded 
people who read only about the wedding may not know how great a woman you are, 
but I do. 
</P>
<P>
 They may not know that you are the granddaughter of the founder of the Irvine 
Co. and one of the richest women in America. They may not realize that you 
practically forced the Irvine Co. to donate land so that UC Irvine could be 
built. They probably have no idea how many millions of dollars you've donated 
to charities and other causes. They may not know you're a connoisseur of art 
and an accomplished horsewoman. They don't know that you took on Donald Bren 
after you sold your Irvine Co. stock and that you refused to be bullied. I 
should have written to you then to tell you I was pulling for you all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan, I know how strong-willed you are. I know you were christened Athalie 
Anita but decided as a child to call yourself Joan after a nursery rhyme 
character. I know you've been married and divorced four times. I know you've 
fished for marlin off the Mexican coast and hunted big game in Argentina. I 
know you once nursed an ailing seal back to health in your back yard pool and 
then lassoed the animal on one occasion when it escaped down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 You've been described in articles as greedy, litigious and eccentric. Nothing 
could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 A close friend said years ago that you had tremendous native intelligence and 
artistic ability but had been given "very much, too much, too young." 
</P>
<P>
 You and I both know there are a lot of jealous people in the world, Joan. 
</P>
<P>
 I won't take any more of your time. I just didn't want you to lose sleep over 
your ingrate son. I'm sure it pains you to ponder cutting him out of his 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing you as I do, I sense a void in your life, Joan. You had some millions 
to give to a son, and he betrayed you. I hate him for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan, you may think I'm silly, but do you think I could in any way replace 
him? I mean, I know I'm too old to be your son, but what I lack in bloodlines I 
could make up for in empathy and eternal support of everything you do. 
</P>
<P>
 On my oath, I would never buck your wishes. Should you ever get to the point 
of considering me worthy of your inheritance, I would marry whomever you told 
me to. Or, if you didn't think I should marry at all, I wouldn't. If you want 
me to renounce any members of my family, just say so. 
</P>
<P>
 Please think about it. I think you'd like me if you got to know me. Let me 
just say again that I think you're brilliant and unique and misunderstood and 
such a cut above everyone else that I know you must get awfully bored with the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we could meet for a drink? 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, I'll buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Your new pal (I hope), 
</P>
<P>
 Dana

POLITICAL BRIEFING: SCHOOL KIDS KEEP THE DRUMBEAT GOING AGAINST PROPOSITION 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A DIFFERENT DRUM: What was the Pacoima Elementary School drum corps doing last 
weekend leading a march down Van Nuys Boulevard to protest Proposition 187, the 
initiative that would bar illegal immigrants from public education, 
non-emergency health care and other social services? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Larry Gonzales, the school's principal, and this is the response: "I felt 
it was a voter-registration drive. Whatever I can do to encourage people to 
register to vote, I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Franco Fernandez-Rua, an organizer of Saturday's event: "It was an 
anti-Prop. 187 march and rally." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Howard Friedman, a Los Angeles Unified School District lawyer: "It's 
inappropriate for a school to make an official appearance in something like 
that. Inappropriate but not a high crime or misdemeanor." 
</P>
<P>
 The rally, attended by about 1,000 opponents of Proposition 187, has raised 
the question of whether public schools should -- or can -- take a position on 
political issues. The Los Angeles Board of Education, which last month voted to 
oppose the measure, is entitled to take stands on political candidates and 
initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But schools are prohibited by law from spending public funds for political 
events. In the Pacoima case, the school spent no extra money for the event 
Saturday, Principal Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing the banner-waving students to march in the rally was probably "not a 
smart idea," said Susie Lange, spokeswoman for the California Department of 
Education. "But legally, they're probably OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales, who has spoken publicly against 187, said he believes the school 
banner "probably" should not have been waved, but he still believes the march 
was more a voter-registration event. "I felt it was educational and intended to 
register voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gonzales did not attend, his boss did. Maria Reza, who oversees San 
Fernando and Pacoima schools, said she participated in the rally -- but as a 
private citizen, not as a school district representative. "I think it was a 
slice of what America is all about," she said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 THE FINAL CHAPTER: Closure came this week to a drama of flip-flops that, last 
summer, had Gov. Pete Wilson's Administration first opposing and then 
supporting a bill to outlaw price gouging after disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley consumers will recall that the Northridge earthquake jolted prices into 
the stratosphere for such necessities as food, water and batteries. 
Contractors, too, were targeted by many of the 1,400 complaints on file with 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) put a 10% limit on price hikes 
in the wake of a declared disaster. Oddly enough, the governor's Department of 
Consumer Affairs -- which is supposed to look out for consumers -- tried to 
block the bill unless it was amended so businesses could raise prices by 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates caught wind of the department's position and skewered the 
Administration for trying to heap more hardship on the shoulders of already 
defeated disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
 And when that didn't look so good in the newspapers, the Administration 
reversed field. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Wilson signed into law Katz's bill and a similar one by 
Assemblywoman Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles). But since he's also 
campaigning for reelection, the governor went out of his way to mention that 
his thoughts were also with small business. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Wilson said: "California is no stranger to 
earthquakes, fires, floods and other disasters. These new laws will provide 
protection for the consumer and reasonable allowances for the store owner." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 COMING SOON TO A MAILBOX NEAR YOU: Starting this week, the California 
secretary of state's office will begin mailing out millions of the ballot 
pamphlets that voters will turn to before the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 This pamphlet will be far snazzier than those of years past, thanks to Roger 
Ramirez, an 11th-grader at Birmingham High School in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger beat 174 other students in a fierce statewide competition to get his 
design printed on the cover of the voter pamphlet. He was selected as winner of 
the 1994 Voter Participation Logo Contest by Acting Secretary of State Tony 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that entries were judged on inspiration, simplicity and artistic 
presentation, Miller said: "Although the ultimate decision was not an easy one, 
we concluded that Roger Ramirez's presentation was direct and simple, yet 
conveyed a sense of excitement and enthusiasm for the electoral process in a 
single word." 
</P>
<P>
 And the word? 
</P>
<P>
 "VOTE." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is hoping that all 12 million households in the state get the message. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SHOW AND TELL: Earlier this month, Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman, 
who doubles as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, announced 
that he would postpone until October a vote originally scheduled for this month 
on an alignment for the vexed east-west San Fernando Valley rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, a subway supporter, delayed the vote as a "courtesy" to key MTA board 
members who said they couldn't make the September meeting, including Mayor 
Richard Riordan and Edelman's arch-enemy on the issue, fellow supervisor Mike 
Antonovich, who backs a monorail-type system above the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich had previously scheduled engagements, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was he doing there last week when the board convened for business, 
with a full quorum of members? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Antonovich aide Habib Balian, the supervisor was expressly asked 
to attend the meeting by MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White. White 
had put a sweeping motion on the agenda to overhaul the agency's construction 
unit and wanted key board members present. 
</P>
<P>
 So Antonovich showed up, and White's proposal was presented. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome? The board delayed action on that motion until October, too -- so 
now, the overhaul proposal and the Valley rail line question will jockey for a 
place on the same agenda.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; COURTHOUSE PLAN: BACK TO LIFE, AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's federal courthouse, which appeared headed for even more delay 
after construction funds were cut from its budget last week, was put back on 
track Wednesday, thanks to General Services Administrator Roger W. Johnson and 
two U.S. senators. It is a project that was worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
 The courthouse plan has been buffeted in the Washington budget wars and 
survived even the Clinton Administration's "reinvent government" program, which 
advocated that all proposed courthouses be reassessed in terms of their 
necessity and cost. Late last year, the Administration gave the go-ahead for 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the project appeared doomed this week when Congress reversed what 
appeared to be a done deal, suddenly putting $25.2 million needed for 
construction in jeopardy. Fortunately, Johnson, the former chairman of Western 
Digital and an Orange County resident, wouldn't take no for an answer. His 
determination wasn't solely because of his Orange County roots. "I would 
protect any worthwhile project anywhere in the country," Johnson said. And 
finding the money to keep the courthouse on track was critical because the 
remaining $25 million had to be funded so that it could go out for bids and 
construction started in the coming fiscal year.  
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Johnson was able to find the $25 million in other projects on a 
slower track, and with help from Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), who chairs 
the Senate Treasury appropriations subcommittee and Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.), who delayed the Senate's final vote, the Senate approved the 
budget, which included Orange County's courthouse funding. The need for the 
facility was established long ago. Orange County's development in recent years, 
which has brought the population to 2.5 million, meant an increasing load of 
criminal and civil lawsuits. The county is now a sprawling metropolitan region 
that needs its own facility to spare lawyers and clients the commute to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it appears to be only a matter of time before the long-awaited federal 
courthouse is a reality.

 Stocks sank as bond yields rose on Thursday after a raft of upbeat economic 
reports incited new fears of inflation and higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors, nervous that the new data would prompt the Federal Reserve to 
tighten credit again in an effort to head off inflation, sold a wide swath of 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strong economic growth is bad news," said John H. Shaughnessy, research 
director at Advest Inc. "The reports showed the economy entering the third 
quarter at a pretty fast pace. This raises the odds that the Fed will move 
sooner, rather than later, to raise rates." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 23.55 points to 3,854.63 as declining 
issues outnumbered advancers by about 13 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Big Board volume totaled 305.38 million shares, down from Wednesday's 330.31 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the Treasury's main 30-year bond yield matched a 2 
1/4-year high of 7.84% reached on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the yield closed at 
7.81%. The long bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 
5/16 point, or $3.13 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders were particularly stunned by a government report of surprisingly 
strong home sales, with the August rate leaping 9.7% even though mortgage rates 
jumped sharply this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the government said that the nation's gross domestic product grew 
at a 4.1% annual rate in the spring. The upward revision of the second quarter 
estimate was greater than many had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds also reacted negatively to the Labor Department's report that the number 
of Americans filing first-time claims for unemployment benefits fell for the 
fourth straight week. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined signs of hefty growth gave the bond market another jolt of 
worries about inflation, which can whittle away the value of fixed-income 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, economically sensitive issues, such as manufacturing and basic 
industrial names, declined amid fears that higher interest rates could 
discourage consumer buying. 
</P>
<P>
 David Shulman, market strategist at Salomon Bros., said snags in reaching a 
world trade agreement are also troubling the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Alcoa Aluminum fell 1 3/4 to 85 3/4, General Motors was down 7/8 to 46 3/4, 
and Caterpillar declined 1/2 to 54 1/8. These are among the companies that 
could be expected to suffer if rising interest rates cut into consumer 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest-sensitive stocks were also falling in anticipation of a possible 
increase in short-term rates. Merrill Lynch fell 1 1/8 to 34 1/4, and Salomon 
Inc. was down 1 1/8 to 38 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * CBS Inc. tumbled 16 to 320 on further disappointment over its third-place 
showing among the four television networks for the first week of the new TV 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Church & Dwight Co., which makes the Arm & Hammer brand line of products, 
fell 1 1/2 to 22 5/8 after saying it expects third-quarter and year-end 
earnings to come in below Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * USAir Group dropped 1 to 4 after the airline said it was deferring a 
quarterly dividend payment. 
</P>

AROUND TOWN: A MAP TO THE REALM OF MOTHERHOOD

<P>
 Meet Susan Bernard, dedicated career woman and fierce defender of the doctrine 
of MWOC-DINK (Married Without Children-Double Income, No Kids). 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who once dismissed children as messy little intruders who "turn 
formerly interesting, well-read and highly educated adults into baby-talking 
blatherers." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, meet Susan Bernard, doting mother, cheerleader for the fraternity of 
PWOM-NBAHs (Parents Without Money, Never Been Any Happier) -- and author of 
"The Mommy Guide." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard had always thought of her life as rich and full. Then, one day, she 
knew she wanted a baby. "My father was dying of cancer. I suddenly realized my 
family wouldn't go on forever." She and her husband, Bernie Rotondo, a magazine 
art director, had been married for seven years; she was 39, He was 51. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 11, 1989, Alexander Bernard Rotondo was born and Bernard and her 
husband "instantly became the people we used to hate. . . . We told anecdotes 
about our Lamaze class. We discussed my labor in great detail . . . I leaked 
milk on my silk blouses." 
</P>
<P>
 She also discovered that, even though she'd always prided herself on being 
super-organized -- as a magazine editor, then a college fund-raiser -- this job 
of parenting couldn't be neatly tied up in a 9-to-5 package. 
</P>
<P>
 As a first-time mother, Bernard says, "You want somebody like you to tell you 
what it's like." Thus, "The Mommy Guide," the book she wishes she'd had when 
she was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 When Alex was 6 months old, she began her research. Late last year, she took a 
leave from her part-time job with Occidental College to finish the book, which 
combines her slightly irreverent essays with tips on everything from buying a 
baby-proof car to picking a pediatrician. 
</P>
<P>
 To compile tips on the A to Z of parenting -- from Amusement Parks to the Zen 
of Motherhood -- Bernard consulted 125 experts and the real experts -- 125 
mommies. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned from the mommies that -- wherever they live, whatever their 
socioeconomic status -- the big issues are: to work, or not to work, outside 
the home. And that feeling of "doing everything and not doing anything well 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Bookstores were her library. There, she found out who was writing what and 
picked the experts she'd ask to be in her guide. "Did you know there are 20 
books on housecleaning at Brentano's in Century City?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard sent questionnaires to, among others, doctors, psychologists, 
educators, a professional housekeeper and a diaper service rep. A sampler of 
their survival tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * On amusement parks: Eat before noon or after 2:30 p.m. Take your child to 
the bathroom before standing in line for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 * On obliterating home clutter: If something new comes in, something old goes 
out. Including Junior's lesser artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 * The top five feature films for kids? The Marx Brothers' "Duck Soup," "Born 
Free," "Yellow Submarine," "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "Lady and the Tramp." 
</P>
<P>
 * What to name the baby? Avoid the bizarre -- unless you live in Greenwich 
Village or Beverly Hills. Trendy is iffy. Yes, that includes Ashley, Brittany, 
Courtney, Amber, Tyler, Justin, Zachary and Brandon. 
</P>
<P>
 And from Bernard, who has overcome her loathing for Disneyland's It's a Small 
World ride and her resolve never to use disposable diapers, come these nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 * On childbirth: It "helped convince me -- once and for all -- that God is 
clearly not female." 
</P>
<P>
 * On bringing up baby in a mixed marriage (she is Jewish, Rotondo is 
Catholic): Their son was born in a Catholic hospital, "but I made Bernie 
promise he wouldn't sprinkle any water over Alex's head when I was asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 * On toilet-training: At one point "we thought of putting a plant in Alex's 
potty seat and using it as a vase." 
</P>
<P>
 Some tips from other mommies: 
</P>
<P>
 * On grocery shopping: Shop after dinner. Let your husband baby-sit. When you 
return home, he's there to help you put the groceries away. 
</P>
<P>
 * On coping with a newborn: "Leave your compulsiveness at the hospital. There 
isn't time to be perfect, look great, have a clean house and a sweet, adorable 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
 * On vacations: Your kids are going to do the same things on a trip that they 
do at home. If their idea of fun is digging in the mud, don't spend a bundle 
taking them to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex is now 5, and Bernard has resumed her part-time job at Occidental 
College, in an office not far from her Rancho Park home. She picks Alex up from 
school in mid-afternoon and they play or go to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 She's still in awe that someone so small could have stolen such a big piece of 
her heart. And she's thinking of a sequel to "The Mommy Guide." 
</P>
<P>
 She laughs. "I could base my whole career on my child's life -- and he'd hate 
me. I think when he starts reading, I'll have to stop writing about him." A 
Tale of Lost and Found 
</P>
<P>
 Kermit the tree frog is still AWOL, but Rocky the toad and Leonarda the turtle 
are safely back at home at the Shenandoah Street Children's Center in West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 And the center, invaded by petnapers earlier this month, is the richer by five 
chickens, two rabbits, another turtle -- and almost $16,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The saga of Kermit, Rocky and Leonarda began with a break-in Labor Day 
weekend. Vandals made off with the trio and smashed an aquarium, leaving three 
goldfish to die. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children were truly devastated," says Brenda Powell-Bolder, a parent who 
is also community liaison for the adjacent Shenandoah Street Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Kermit, Rocky and Leonarda were among pets bought with special grant money. 
The idea was to help children learn socialization skills and the animals 
regularly went home with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell-Bolder surveyed the scene -- a broken window, smashed bookcases, 
plundered earthquake supply bins -- and mobilized children and parents for 
cleanup. She also tried to convince the children -- and herself -- that the 
missing pets were in good homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she called a Westside newspaper, which told readers about the break-in 
and the center, where 175 kids from poor or working-class families get 
full-time or part-time day care. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers sent money, from $10 to several hundred dollars, and, to the delight 
of the youngsters, donated a turtle named Rocket and rabbits Bandit and Spots. 
</P>
<P>
 An anonymous donor gave $15,000 for repairs and an alarm system. Powell-Bolder 
is asking smaller donors if their money can be used toward the purchase of 
badly needed playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, an unidentified tipster told Powell-Bolder that she would find 
Rocky the toad in his terrarium on a certain street corner at a certain time. 
"I just drove by and picked him up. I didn't ask any questions." 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, three young men with Leonarda in tow approached a teacher. They 
said they'd found the turtle in an alley. 
</P>
<P>
 Kermit, alas, remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandals have not been caught. But Bolder-Powell's faith has been restored. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many wonderful things have happened as a result of this. There are people 
all over the city and county who really do care about public education and 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 * This weekly column chronicles the people and small moments that define life 
in Southern California. Reader suggestions are welcome.

BEHIND THE WHEEL: IS THIS VOLKSWAGEN'S SAVIOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Volkswagen of America -- amid rumors of its departure from these shores, with 
sales shrunk to a sprinkle and suffering job cuts amounting to a white-collar 
massacre -- is crawling back to the battle. 
</P>
<P>
 * The entire lineup is being shuffled and juggled with the wild but pricey 
Corrado sport coupe dropped; the saucy Cabrio ragtop returned from exile; the 
fiery Golf GTI reintroduced, and the Vanagon on again but as the EuroVan with a 
camper conversion by Winnebago instead of Westphalia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Showrooms are suddenly rich with 1994 Golf IIIs and Jetta IIIs after a year 
of hesitant, spotty deliveries of earlier models fringing on the obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 * Volkswagen has chopped an expensive, top-heavy executive structure and 
consolidated its U.S. and Canada operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sales have started breathing again. More than 57,000 VWs were sold in the 
first seven months of this year -- compared to a piddling 50,000 for all of 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the 1995 Passat comes to pass as a compact sedan and wagon and 
suddenly the Great Teutonic Hope of Volkswagen's full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Could be. For the new Passat GLX is a tautly assembled, able-driving, 
high-quality machine loaded with safety and convenience equipment for $20,890. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe not. For as perception lags reality, so anything by Volkswagen is 
still viewed as a slab-sided, unstylish, frequently unreliable eight ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Cognoscenti may choose to sleep with their Volkswagens. But most Americans 
lump them with Saabs and Volvos as symbols of knowing buyers, rather than fun 
machines for getting a body someplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Another barrier stands against Passat as it is delivered to showrooms this 
month: It is headed for Accord and Camry country. Ford Taurus, Volvo 850 and 
Saab 900 also inhabit this rich and profitable land of wonderful sales figures. 
So do Mazda's 626, Chrysler's very successful LH series and upcoming 
Cirrus/Stratus duet, and the incoming Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique twins. 
</P>
<P>
 God only knows how Passat will fare against this horde. And it is rumored he 
drives a Volvo 850 Turbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Volkswagen has made efforts to smooth and round Passat's exterior -- 
there's a slatted grille now, and stylists claim 90% of the sheet metal is new 
-- it all appears more of a tickle than a make-over. The styling shows little 
sensuality in this decade of aerodynamics and cabs forward. Even from the next 
county, Passat clearly is another Volkswagen, which means straight,lines and 
soft boxiness, a snub hood and bobbed trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Power is from a 2.8-liter V-6 producing 172 horsepower and a proven, 
hard-pulling little engine. But it is unchanged from last year and that could 
be another slip. Toyota's Camry is 10% more potent. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Passat earns more than passing grades is as a high-value package, quite 
the trend these days. The only options are automatic transmission, leather 
seats, a sunroof, CD player and heated seats adding a relatively scant $3,300 
to the base $20,890. Everything else is included in the sticker price -- driver 
and passenger air bags, anti-lock brakes, traction control, alarm system, air 
conditioning, trip computer, power windows, cruise control, BBS alloy wheels, 
et cetera, ad infinitum and quite splendidly. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even a minor miracle on-board -- three cup holders on a German car. 
Although as Volkswagen gives, so it taketh away. Thanks to the bulk of a 
passenger-side air bag and a decision to stick with chubby knee bolsters, there 
is no glove box. 
</P>
<P>
 Fault will also be found with the Passat's dashboard. The primary instruments 
are analog and large and an easy read for even the optically challenged. But 
Volkswagen has reverted to dippy black-on-gray digitals for clock, odometer and 
gear indicator that are a squint to read from behind Ray-Bans. Or in bright, 
following sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cabin is quite roomy -- best in its crowded class, in fact -- 
finding the right setting for the driver's seat is a couple of wriggles removed 
from being damned difficult. When notched and secure, one is still not too sure 
which control did what. And taller folk will find the back seats barely score a 
B minus in gluteal comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet all the right reasons for ever buying a Volkswagen remain. Passat is a 
tough sedan with that sense of one-piece solidity, weight and integration 
unique to German cars. And a chassis 30% stiffer than current models certainly 
enhances heft and balance. 
</P>
<P>
 The V-6 is sure, happy, and delights in feeling the whip in its mid to upper 
ranges. Even when mated to a four-speed automatic, the bleeding of power is 
minimal and acceleration remains a firm rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspension flexes on the choppy side of its geometry, leaving no doubt this is 
a car for souls who like to extract exhilaration from their driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Well-balanced steering allows perfect pitching into corners, 172-horsepower 
provides purposeful exits, and this car does nothing that can't be predicted 
several thoughts in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a car bred to be a chaser, ne'er a follower, offering motoring adventure 
identical to another quicksilver sedan, the Nissan Maxima. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, Volkswagen plans to expand its line with a punier Passat powered 
only by a 115-horsepower four-banger. 
</P>
<P>
 Deeply in love with the V-6 version, we can't think why.

 Bicycles built for two sure aren't what they used to be, which was heavy, hard 
to ride and difficult to store. Now there's the Montague TriFrame Tandem, an 
8-foot tandem bike that can be folded and carried in a 3-foot case. 
</P>
<P>
 This unusual two-person model is a full-size high-performance bicycle that 
folds easily in several minutes with quick release levers (no tools needed) and 
fits in the trunk or back seat of a car. Or it can be transported on trains or 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The TriFrame Tandem weighs 47.8 pounds and is constructed of steel tubes 
within tubes to form a sturdy frame. It has a 21-speed shifting system, which, 
when the rider turns the handlebar grip, automatically shifts into the next 
gear. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicycle is an excellent solution for urban couples who want to exercise 
together but have no place to store an ordinary tandem bike. 
</P>
<P>
 Montague Corp. President David Montague says tandem bikes have recently become 
popular because "they allow two people of different exercise levels to ride 
together. One person can compensate for the other." 
</P>
<P>
 The company also makes several models of mountain bikes and cross bikes that 
fold. 
</P>
<P>
 The TriFrame Tandem ($1,995) can be ordered from Montague Corp. at (800) 
736-5348. 
</P>
<P>
 An optional accessory is the Airliner Travel System ($599), which includes a 
hard-shell carrying case, special tube pads that wrap around the frame to 
protect it, Velcro-like tie-down straps and three nylon bags in which to store 
helmets, seats and other biking equipment. New Sanyo Fax Machine Is a Small 
Production 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Sanyo introduces its new facsimile machine, SFX-P50, a compact 
model ideal for home offices. The ink-jet fax uses plain paper and can send and 
receive faxes simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 SFX-P50 is 13 inches by 8 inches, so it takes up little space on a desk. It 
transmits a letter-size document in about nine seconds, and also has a timed 
transmission feature that makes it possible to automatically send up to 20 
pages to 50 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit has a 10-sheet automatic document feeder and a two-line, 32-digit LCD 
display so you can read both the name and phone number of the person or company 
being contacted. 
</P>
<P>
 SFX-P50 ($1,395) will be available nationwide next month at Circuit City and 
the Good Guys stores. Clean Tap Water, Courtesy of a Filtering Straw 
</P>
<P>
 The Clean Sip Water Filter Drinking Straw can provide clean, odor-free tap 
water wherever you are. Its two-part replaceable filter -- one is copper, zinc 
and alloy; the other, granulated charcoal -- removes bacteria, chlorine, 
sediment, lead and algae. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8 1/2-inch plastic straw comes with its own carrying case, handy for 
travelers, kids at school, bikers, boaters and campers. The filtering straw 
also fits in most sports bottles. It should last about a year before you need 
replacement filters.  
</P>
<P>
 Clean Sip ($14.95 including shipping and handling) can be ordered from the 
J.M. Glennon Co., 9124 N.E. 141st St., Bothell, Wash. 98011; (800) 796-6773, 
Ext. 512. A set of replacement filters costs $10. Allow two weeks for delivery.

 Next week is California Rideshare Week, the annual statewide push to reform 
drive-alone commuters.

 If you need a break-the-habit starter kit, try "The Joy of Carpooling," an 
informative pamphlet that answers questions and offers some unexpected benefits 
of ride-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance: "If you never thought you could get your work done in eight 
hours, you may be surprised. Knowing you have to leave at car-pool time instead 
of 'whenever' helps you organize your time more efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 The pamphlet's author is Susan Shankle, a San Mateo consultant who spent 
several years as an employee-transportation coordinator, the person responsible 
in any California corporation for getting the company work force to ride-share. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was responsible for trying to get 6,000 employees out of their personal 
cars," Shankle says. 
</P>
<P>
 And how did she do? "I figure I got a few hundred cars off the road," she 
says. "Our program won quite a few Bay Area awards." 
</P>
<P>
 One of her biggest hits was an on-line ride-share data base, which meant that 
an employee could decide at the last minute to car-pool.  
</P>
<P>
 But, Shankle adds, it was a hard job. "This booklet is something I could have 
used. People have so many questions, like, 'What happens if my kid gets sick 
and I don't have a car?' There was no little how-to manual." 
</P>
<P>
 So after she left her job to start her own business, she put together "The Joy 
of Carpooling," now in its second printing. 
</P>
<P>
 Shankle thinks car-pooling suffers from a negative image. "There are 
benefits," she says. "You save time, you save money, and you are making life on 
the planet better for your kids and grandkids." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Joy of Carpooling" is available by sending $5 and a self-addressed 
business-size envelope with two first-class stamps to Shankle at 3181 Campus 
Drive, No. 364, San Mateo, Calif. 94403. More Incentive 
</P>
<P>
 California commuters can celebrate Rideshare Week and qualify for prizes 
statewide (from bicycles to weekend getaways) by making the pledge to try 
alternative transportation at least one day a week. Pledge cards are available 
at workplaces or by calling (800) COMMUTE. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% of the L.A. Basin's 6.8 million commuters drive alone, says Commuter 
Transportation Services Inc., so there's lots of room for ride-share converts.

BOOK REVIEW / MEMOIRS; WHEN LIFE WAS KINDER, GENTLER; BARBARA BUSH BY BARBARA 
BUSH ; SCRIBNER'S $25, 575 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGIA JONES-DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard not to like Barbara Bush. She's a little old-fashioned, but she's 
got class. She's like your great aunt who makes you straighten your skirt, pull 
it down over your knees, asks you to fold your hands on your lap and cross your 
ankles -- then tells you a dirty joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Bush's language and references in her memoir will take you back to a 
kinder and gentler time and place, sort of like a finishing school in the late 
'40s and '50s. She uses expressions I haven't heard since I watched my last 
Andy Hardy movie: "Michael Jackson "wears the darndest clothes." "My dad . . . 
was the fairest man I knew until I met George Bush." (But I was stumped when 
she referred to Desert Storm as "the darndest war." What does that mean 
exactly?) 
</P>
<P>
 There's a certain quaintness, comfort in such language, I imagine, for her 
target audience -- the quiet, conservative, churchgoing American woman over 50 
who minds swearing but doesn't mind a few martinis after a round of golf at the 
country club. Much of the time she sounds like Lawrence Welk, everybody and 
everything being "wunnerful, wunnerful, wunnerful"; or if not wunnerful, then 
lovely, sweet and charming, the literary equivalent of a polka. Bush admits 
she's no writer, but she deserved a little more careful editing, or at least a 
thesaurus. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not the first reviewer to observe that the word nice appears more than 45 
times beyond page 196 to describe people as varied as Hosni Mubarak; George 
Wallace; Chief Justice Warren Burger; Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and 
his wife, Sally; Olivia Newton-John; former Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki 
Kaifu and his wife, Sachiyo; Deborah Norville; Sidney Poitier; Richard Gere and 
George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush's telling of her earliest years is the weakest part of the book. You can 
feel her grasping for memories, for colorful details to bring the narrative to 
life. There's just not much to draw on as she describes growing up in Rye, 
N.Y., in an upper-middle-class family during the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "My memories of that lovely little house are only good ones. . . . The best 
food in the world came out of our kitchen. I don't remember what Mother cooked, 
but she knew good food and trained the helpers." 
</P>
<P>
 Her world isn't perfect, though. She marries her prince charming, and the two 
young people head off to the oil boom in Texas, to miserable heat and lousy 
housing, far away from the manicured Northeast. Her mother is killed in a car 
accident in 1949, and she soon gives birth to a daughter, Robin, who will die 
of leukemia before her fourth birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush quotes a letter from her husband to his mother -- written not long after 
Robin's death -- that contains some of the most moving writing I've read 
anywhere about the death of a child. "There is about our house a need. . . . We 
need a doll house to stand firm against our forts and . . . baseball cards. . . 
. We need someone who's afraid of frogs. . . . We need a little one who can 
kiss without leaving egg or jam or gum. We need a girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Bush's descriptions of life once she and her husband hit Washington, starting 
in the late '60s, become much livelier, a tad less cloying. We get the distaff 
side of Washington political life as she and George Bush go house-hunting, join 
various clubs and make their way through the complex social network of the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 She devotes only one page to a serious depression she suffered: "Night after 
night George held me weeping in his arms. . . . Sometimes the pain was so 
great, I felt the urge to drive into a tree or an oncoming car." He tells her 
to get help, which she refuses to do. The depression lifts, and in the book she 
refers to it only one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 She has positive things to say about nearly everyone, even the occasional 
Democrat. Bush mentions how then-President Richard Nixon made no small talk and 
seemed difficult to like. She doesn't address the anti-war movement then 
sweeping the country or question whether U.S. policy was wise. Then it's on to 
George Bush's stints at the United Nations and the CIA, in China and the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fun reading her takes on Al Gore: He doesn't "do funerals," he's a 
"demagogue." She meets then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton at a literacy 
conference, where he proves to be "a star"; he has no chance at the presidency, 
she later thinks. "If it comes to politics and you want to know who is going to 
win, ask me. Then go the other way!" she warmly quips. 
</P>
<P>
 She clearly states her stand on abortion: Personally opposed to abortion, she 
believes it should be a woman's choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush reserves her wrath for the press. She takes the press's attacks on 
partisan political issues personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the press. I honestly believe that most of them wanted Bill Clinton to 
win (the presidency). He was one of them -- baby boomers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from her tart words about the press, there's so much sweetness and light 
in the memoir that it comes as a shock when George Bush says to his wife one 
day: "Every day is ugly in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait till we get his version of things.

R S V P / INTO THE NIGHT: THEY SCHMOOZED TO BEAT THE BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Scene: The Music and Entertainment Chapter of the City of Hope's "Spirit 
of Life" dinner Wednesday at Universal City. Honored was Ticketmaster CEO Fred 
Rosen, who said when first agreeing to be honoree, "I thought they could hold 
this in a phone booth. It's humbling that 1,200 people would come." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Rosen, who came with his wife, Rikki, and his mother, Hannah; 
chapter President Bruce Resnikoff; chairman Zach Horowitz; dinner co-chairs 
Doug Morris, Tom Ross and Claire Rothman; City of Hope President Sanford 
Shapero, plus what one guest called "the power base of the $6-billion music 
industry." Among the mighty were Polygram's Alain Levy; Warner Bros.' Bob 
Morgado; MCA's Al Teller; Virgin's Phil Quartararo; Capitol's Gary Gersh; 
Giant's Irving Azoff and A&M's Al Cafaro. Steve Tisch said he came because, 
"I'm trying to get tickets to the Rolling Stones in Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setting: A 22,000-square-foot free-span tent erected near Universal's 
CityWalk. The three-sided canopy featured a sumptuous decor in ivory tones, 16 
chandeliers and two 40-foot light-encrusted trees. It somehow managed to 
combine the best of Versailles and the hangar where the Goodyear blimp is 
parked. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment: Though there was a dazzling performance by Garry Shandling, the 
main attraction was the unrelenting socializing. As MCA's Teller commented: 
"Schmoozing is to the record industry what oxygen is to the average human 
being." 
</P>
<P>
 Triumphs: Acting as combination emcee/drill sergeant ("Hey, siddown! Be quiet! 
Let's get this thing going!"), Joe Smith propelled the proceedings along to a 
10:30 p.m. closing. One observer said he thought "the goal was to do this 
faster than the Grammys." 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: With tables priced from $5,000 to $35,000, more than $3 million 
was raised for the hospital's research and treatment facilities. Rosen said the 
secret of amassing this much money is to "be honest, say why it's important and 
tell them it's easier to give the money now than to keep getting these calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: Patina catered the impossible: an epicurean dinner for 1,200. It began 
with a layered cake with artichokes and Dungeness crab, a main course of 
roasted salmon with fried leeks and ended with a chocolate pecan tart topped 
with root beer ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: Just before dinner, Rosen and the record company presidents were 
brought together for a photo. "I love the forced camaraderie," said one label 
chief as he eyed his competitors. "It's like being trapped together on a 
nuclear submarine."

R S V P; MOCA HONORS A LONGTIME ART LOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Philosophy was much in evidence at a luncheon Wednesday at the Regent Beverly 
Wilshire Hotel as the Museum of Contemporary Art gave its first "Distinguished 
Women in the Arts" award to Beatrice Gersh. 
</P>
<P>
 On the award was inscribed: "It is in your own self-interest to find a way to 
be very tender." 
</P>
<P>
 Anjelica Huston, who presented the award, was introduced by MOCA director 
Richard Koshalek with a quote from the actress in a recent magazine: "One 
shouldn't be obliged by anything other than the calling of your heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Huston, on presenting the award to Gersh, referred to the philanthropist as 
someone "true to her own mind and her sense of what is right." 
</P>
<P>
 Gersh, a collector and patron of contemporary and modern art for more than 35 
years and a founder of MOCA, spoke of the "great joy and satisfaction" she has 
experienced in loving the arts. She was particularly delighted as she brought a 
third generation of "lovers of art" -- her four young grandchildren, Steven, 
Jessica, Laura and Billy -- up on the dais to share in her tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure they won't mind one bit missing school for this," she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 A patrons' reception preceded the luncheon and a runway show of Giorgio 
Armani's 1994 fall/winter collection followed, in which chocolate proved the 
hot color and velvet the "in" fabric, even for men. At least half of the 460 
people who attended seemed to be wearing their Armanis, so that the few in 
bright colors stood out in a sea of beige, gray, ecru, black and brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Armani's very first benefit event in Los Angeles, back in 1988, was for 
MOCA," said Armani's celebrity coordinator, Wanda McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose I'm very out of it -- this is just an old, double-breasted, navy 
Ralph Lauren jacket," producer Dan Melnick admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Jacobson, MOCA's Projects Council president, had rushed to get her 
cream Armani suit altered in time for the luncheon and she also had a 
last-minute rush to pick up her framed copy of the award to stand in for the 
bronze plaque, which has not yet been cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Her table guests included neighbors Leilah and David Shaffer. "They looked 
after my husband, Avram, so well while I was so involved with all this," she 
said, finally able to relax a moment as she realized the success of the event, 
which raised approximately $53,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the honorary committee included Judy Henning and Richard 
Rosenzweig, Wallis Annenberg, co-chairwomen Lois Rosen and Pam Smith, honorary 
chairwoman Lenore Greenberg, and Bea and Phil Gersh's daughters-in-law Linda 
Gersh and Susan Gersh.

STORIES FROM THE FRONT: HORRORS OF BABY-SITTING; CHILD CARE: SITTERS OFTEN GET 
MORE THAN THEY BARGAIN FOR. (JUST ASK THE PITTSBURGH TEEN-AGER WHO CARED FOR 
FOUR KIDS FOR 16 DAYS.) IT TAKES CLEAR THINKING AND ASSERTIVENESS TO MAKE IT 
WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 5-year-old boy thought he would fake out the new baby-sitter by hiding 
under the bed. And this kid could hide, 13-year-old Anna Harrison of La Canada 
Flintridge recalled. She searched every inch of the house, calling the boy's 
name, and even went to a neighbor's home to look for him before the child 
crawled out, laughing uproariously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yes, didn't I tell you about that?" his mother said later, way too 
casually. "He doesthat all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the annals of baby-sitters' horror stories, Anna's tale doesn't even come 
close to the widely publicized ordeal of 14-year-old Angela Morris of 
Pittsburgh. But situations in which young baby-sitters are exploited or even 
abused are far more common than most adults realize, according to experts and 
sitters themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In Angela's case, the eighth-grader agreed to watch four children for three 
days earlier this month while their parents worked out of state. Her pay was to 
be $75 -- just above $1 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 But three days came and went, and the parents failed to return. Concerned that 
if she contacted town authorities, the children would be shipped to separate 
foster homes, Angela called a meeting in a neighborhood pizza shop and 
organized an ad hoc baby-sitting consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the mom and dad finally showed up 16 days later -- to be charged 
with endangering the welfare of their children -- Angela had drafted three 
friends to help and had resorted to using her own money to feed her young 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Jane Neff Middle School in Pittsburgh, Assistant Principal George 
Shevchik complimented the student for compassion and ingenuity under duress, 
and said plaudits for Angela had even come from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 He described Angela as remarkably self-possessed. "She actually apologized to 
me for causing such a disturbance," Shevchik marveled. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindy Bingham, a Santa Barbara specialist in adolescent female development, 
also characterized the Pittsburgh teen-ager's resourcefulness as exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard about this story, I went, 'YES!' " said Bingham, whose newest 
book, "Things Will Be Different for My Daughter," will be published by Viking 
in February. She praised the young baby-sitter as "a problem-solver, a critical 
thinker who was capable of coming up with creative solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Bingham said she could have used a dose of that kind of 
clearheadedness in her own youthful days of baby-sitting. She was "all of 11 or 
12 years old" when a neighbor offered her the then-standard fee of 35 cents per 
hour to watch an infant for the afternoon. "She said the baby would be 
sleeping, and so, by the way, would I do the dishes?" Bingham recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 What greeted her was a week's worth of filthy dishes, "every dish in the 
house," Bingham said, still shuddering, "including pans crusted with boiled 
milk." 
</P>
<P>
 But most early adolescents have not yet learned the language of assertiveness. 
Setting boundaries, defining the terms of a job "are not skills that we teach 
young people," Bingham said. "Therefore the kids who are baby-sitting can 
easily get themselves into situations where they are taken advantage of." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran sitters say it is not uncommon to be kicked, hit, sworn at or even 
spat upon by the children they look after. Informed of their children's 
misbehavior, parents may respond by denial, by shrugging it off or by blaming 
the sitter for provoking such uncharacteristic actions in their perfect little 
angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody runs into terrible, terrible 2-year-olds, twins that are impossible 
and horribly spoiled children," said Craig Walker, who as editorial director of 
Scholastic Books in New York reviews much of the correspondence that comes to 
Ann Martin, author of the wildly successful "Babysitters Club" series of books 
for young readers. 
</P>
<P>
 Books from Martin's 77-title series about "hard-to-handle kids" ring 
especially true to her readers, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But sitters are often hesitant to mention misconduct. Most are too young and 
too inexperienced to seek employment elsewhere. And as Anna Harrison pointed 
out, "You don't want to complain because you might lose the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna's sister, Sabrina Harrison, now an 18-year-old college student in 
Oakland, recounts a baby-sitting nightmare of her own. As an example of "just a 
slight little something that they forgot to put on their list," as Harrison put 
it, the parents of an 8-year-old boy she was caring for neglected to tell her 
that the boy needed medication -- "Ritalin I think it was" -- to treat a 
behavioral disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 On her watch, the medication wore off. Abruptly, the child bolted out the 
front door and began racing "down the side of the Angeles Crest Highway," 
nearby. With the boy's older brother to help, Harrison chased after the 
8-year-old and subdued him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mother was like, 'Oh whoops,' when I told her," she said. Fortunately, 
she has repressed some of her other equally traumatic adventures in 
baby-sitting. "But I know I have come home crying after baby-sitting, many 
times," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, cases of abuse by baby-sitters tend to get more attention than 
incidents where the sitters themselves are mistreated. To Mark Lattman, whose 
family has owned the Babysitters Guild in Los Angeles for more than 20 years, 
the focus seems misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more common the other direction," where the baby-sitters are 
abused or exploited, not the children they are taking care of, Lattman said. On 
several occasions, customers have stayed out all night unexpectedly, Lattman 
said. "We actually had one situation where the sitter had to bring the baby 
into the office here because she had another job to go to." 
</P>
<P>
 That case, he said, ended up in the hands of county child welfare officials.

THE SPACED-AGED; 55 ISN'T THE LIMIT ON THIS HIGHWAY. SENIOR CITIZENS ARE GOING 
ON-LINE AND FINDING A BRAND-NEW WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Increasingly, as home computer use explodes, the person logging on is a 
retiree. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the senior computer-users as cutting edge," says Mary Furlong, 
president of SeniorNet, a San Francisco-based organization that teaches 
computer skills to senior citizens and operates a network available to people 
55 and older through America Online. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous reserve of talent in the older population and a computer 
is just the tool to utilize it," she says. "Unlike baby boomers, they have the 
time to study and learn and are extremely committed." 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging senior techies acknowledge trepidation. And they acknowledge it 
isn't a breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "People often have unreal expectations in learning the computer," says Connie 
Goldman, whose book, "Secrets of Becoming a Late Bloomer," is coming out next 
spring from Stillpoint Publishers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'Oh, this is easy -- it'll take you no time.' Well, it's taking me 
plenty of time." 
</P>
<P>
 SeniorNet's 13,000 members are only a fraction of the men and women over 55 
who sign on every day for everything from a quick look at the Dow Jones index 
to writing a book. "What they have found," Furlong says, "is a place where they 
can use their minds."  
</P>
<P>
 Here, six senior computer users discuss their relationship with cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Robin, 70, of Encino, bought his first home computer last year at the 
urging of his son, Michael, who publishes a computer magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been talking about writing a family history and he encouraged me to start 
on a computer," Robin says. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a larger agenda. Robin, a retired Lockheed Corp. manager, needed 
a challenge. "You do a lot of traveling, a lot of make-do jobs, you find 
organizations to become active in," he says. "But those activities don't have 
any stress or strain or challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that regardless of your age, you need a certain kind of stress." 
</P>
<P>
 His new Macintosh filled the bill. "I'd turn it on in the morning and I'd 
struggle with it. You learn how to do it by practice. Eventually it takes over 
and pushes you -- you get stuck, you keep trying and you find the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 As his son provided various software packages, Robin learned to write and then 
finished the family history. Then he moved on to personal files, financial 
records and check writing and, via modem, began signing on to America Online 
and sending E-mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than the telephone," says Robin, who not only talks to his son 
and daughter in the Bay Area and longtime friends in Georgia, but updates his 
stocks and has sent several political opinions to the White House. ("Yes, they 
answer," he says, by E-mail). 
</P>
<P>
 "You've just got to know it takes patience and tenacity and accept the idea 
that your ego will be deflated. I find it fantastic and stimulating." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had three or four careers and I always knew what computers could do, but 
never got involved with them," says Robert Kaplan, 76, of New York City, a 
former retail executive and city government consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 When New York's 1991 budgetary squeeze abolished his city job, Kaplan wasn't 
ready to retire. He enrolled in a 12-week computer class at Columbia 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 It was intimidating to sit down at an IBM PC, he says. "You'd think that 
somebody like me who worked with analytical stuff all his life wouldn't be 
snowed, but I was scared," he says. "I guess it was the fear of making 
mistakes. Even though some people in the class took to it like a duck to water, 
it seemed so complicated to me. And I had never learned to type -- I'd always 
had a secretary." 
</P>
<P>
 But he stuck to it, spending hours a day in the computer lab plugging through 
WordPerfect and learning spreadsheets on Lotus 1-2-3. 
</P>
<P>
 He immediately put his new expertise to work as a volunteer for the American 
Civil Liberties Union, researching United Nations policies on immigration 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the material and analyzed it and started to bang out drafts," he says. 
"It was so easy to create and change things on the computer. I finally 
conquered the keyboard and all the other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's writing a summary of the ACLU report and has other projects in mind. 
"I had always intended to write when I got to this stage in life. I have a lot 
to say and the computer gives me a means of getting it out in a well-organized 
way." 
</P>

 Her Apple Macintosh "opened up a whole new world for me," says Mary Jane Taft, 
64, of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 She had sworn never to have a computer. "My husband was a physicist at Yale 
University. We were married for 31 years and it seemed that he was always at 
the lab writing programs." 
</P>
<P>
 But after her husband's death, with three sons and seven grandchildren, she 
felt the computer age closing in on her. When her 2-year-old granddaughter drew 
a parrot on a computer screen, curiosity took over and Taft bought a PC and 
printer and started writing children's stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got quite a few pink rejection slips, but they would tell me not to give 
up," she says. "And I've taken a course in drawing with the mouse because I'd 
like to write a story and illustrate it."  
</P>
<P>
 Next came the modem and America Online, where Taft discovered SeniorNet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just freaked out," she says. "I do E-mail and I post messages in forums." 
</P>
<P>
 Her posting in a World War II nostalgia group asked if anyone had been 
interned in Switzerland in 1943-44. "My mother's second marriage was to a Swiss 
and we had been there when the borders closed," she says. "I have heard from 
several people who remember me and remember my mother, and even had photographs 
of us. It's so incredible to get those pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 She spends two or three hours a day on SeniorNet. "I wish more older people 
would try it," she says. "I think they should have America Online and SeniorNet 
in all retirement homes." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When Lee Case of Glendale retired four years ago as vice president of 
Occidental College, the school gave him a Macintosh, modem and printer. He was 
delighted, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have so many friends, especially executives, who wake up their first day of 
retirement and think, 'I have nothing to do.' You can't play golf your whole 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a natural-born hacker, Case was soon doing his taxes, developing 
word-processing programs for volunteer groups, and logging onto Prodigy and 
America Online. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, he was invited to fill an interim post at Cal State L.A., 
where he stumbled into the basic computer-world gap: The administration there 
operated on IBM PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 For Case, it was like landing in a foreign country: "I felt like a total 
alien. At 68, I had to learn computers all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks many executives of his generation have a problem with computers 
because they need to know how everything happens. "With computers, you just 
have to suspend disbelief." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jeanette Popkess, 67, of Bartlesville, Okla., has five grown children around 
the country and they get together regularly on America Online. "We can E-mail, 
which is just like writing a letter to someone, or we can all get on-line at 
the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Her son gave her a Macintosh last Christmas. Now she talks about her 
"cyberspace community" on SeniorNet. The community develops, she says, from 
sharing thoughts on many subjects. "If anyone is sick, or someone is having 
surgery, everyone rushes in, just like it was a neighbor." 
</P>
<P>
 For Popkess, who lives alone, life in cyberspace is super, although the launch 
took some courage. She spent several weeks just "lurking" on SeniorNet, reading 
postings without adding her voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she admits to addiction and consciously limits her on-line time. "It 
happens to everyone," she says. "I'm crazy about it." 
</P>

<P>
 Larry Marinell of West Hollywood says he can't imagine life without his 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, the only reason people left their homes -- whether in kayaks or 
ships across the ocean -- was in search of information," he says. "Now, with a 
screen and a mouse, you can get all the information you want on any subject 
without leaving home." 
</P>
<P>
 Marinell, 65, spends several hours a day in the nook where his IBM-compatible 
PC, laser and dot-matrix printers and telephone are within arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like a command post, he says, ticking off the computer's functions. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a reference library: "My sister in Chicago developed Lou Gehrig's 
disease. By posting a question in the Health and Wellness Forum of SeniorNet, I 
was instantly put in touch with the umbrella advocacy group for the disease, I 
got a list of books to read and the names of several people who are family 
people dealing with the disease." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shopping center: "A woman friend needed to buy a car but didn't want to 
go shopping. So I called AutoVantage on America Online and found current new 
and used car summaries, new and used car pricing, and nearby service centers 
for her."  
</P>
<P>
 Most important, he says, it is a community providing social life and emotional 
support. "No matter what's bothering you, you'll find a group talking about it 
on SeniorNet," Marinell says. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you don't find one, you can start your own: "Just post a message 
saying, 'My dog just died,' and you'll start hearing from people."

GETTING THE BIG PICTURE; THE NEW EXHIBIT AT BURBANK'S NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM 
WILL OFFER FACTS AND EXPLORE MYSTERIES ABOUT WHALES, DOLPHINS AND PORPOISES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We are moved by the plight of whales and their relatives, even to the point of 
identifying with them, and yet what do we really know about them? The problem, 
of course, is that they live in the oceans, and we rarely, if ever, get an 
unobstructed view of them in that vast, mysterious habitat. The conditions for 
observing whales, dolphins and porpoises in the wild are, in the words of 
expert John Heyning, "terrible, which is the reason we know relatively little 
about them." 
</P>
<P>
 What we do know about whales and their relatives, including discoveries made 
only recently, is the subject of a major new exhibit opening Saturday at the 
Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County/Burbank. The show, which will 
embark on a six-year international tour after its Burbank run, has taken three 
years to create. Called "Masters of the Ocean Realm: Whales, Dolphins & 
Porpoises," it will include life-size models of seven different species in 
their natural habitats and will address such persistent puzzles as the daily 
life of cetaceans (the creatures' family name) and why some individuals end up 
stranded each year on the world's beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 As the tremendous popularity of "Free Willy" made clear, cetaceans have an 
enormous mystic. "They're like dinosaurs," says James Mead, curator of marine 
mammals at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Why? "They're big, 
they're physically attractive," he notes, and, perhaps most important, they're 
no immediate threat to us. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Heyning, head of the Natural History Museum's Marine Mammal 
Program, the new show is especially timely because so much has been learned 
about whales and their relatives in recent years. There is still much to 
discover, he says, such as just how many species there are, exactly what they 
look like and how they behave. But, thanks to new techniques, including DNA 
analysis and electronic tagging, we are beginning to find out more and more 
about the charismatic sea creatures. Among the important recent discoveries: 
half a dozen newly identified species, including a second species of common 
dolphin. Scientists have also learned recently that female killer and pilot 
whales undergo something akin to menopause, once thought unique to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyning is the man people call when they find a stranded whale, dolphin or 
porpoise on a Southern California beach. As he explains, the museum has been 
collecting and studying stranded cetaceans since the 1960s. As a result, the 
Los Angeles museum has a collection of skeletons and other remains second only 
to that of the Smithsonian Institution -- a total of more than 3,000 specimens. 
</P>
<P>
 Heyning and his volunteers collect 25 to 30 stranded whales and other 
cetaceans a year, often using a truck equipped with a special whale-sized winch 
to haul the creature off the beach, especially important during the hot summer 
months, and deliver it to the Marine Mammal Program's research station in 
Vernon. There the cetacean corpses are flensed (stripped of their blubber) and 
scrutinized for clues about everything from the individual's age (which can 
often be determined like that of a tree, by studying ring-like markings within 
the teeth) to what it had for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 The study of stranded individuals has revised conventional wisdom about many 
marine mammals, Heyning says. In recent decades, scientists have learned that 
the humpback is not a rotund leviathan with an eggplant-colored hide, but a 
much more streamlined, dark blue-gray creature. Cetacean autopsies have also 
revealed how a species of beaked whale manages to eat prodigiously without 
teeth: It uses its tongue like a piston to suck in squid. 
</P>
<P>
 To strip his cetacean skeletons, Heyning employs a traditional helper: the 
larva of the dermestid beetle. Harsh chemicals can harm the bones, and enzyme 
cleansers are temperamental and expensive, he explains. "I'd rather do it the 
old-fashioned organic way," he says. Besides, he adds, "they work for cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 DNA testing -- the very stuff that is making headlines in the O.J. Simpson 
case -- is also revolutionizing the study of whales and their more diminutive 
relatives. Conservationists recently used DNA analysis to prove that some 
Japanese markets were illegally selling the flesh of protected whale species. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern science's ability to read a particular cetacean's genetic profile is 
also illuminating in other ways. Explains Heyning: "We've learned a lot 
recently about the social systems of whales using DNA. You can actually dart 
them with a small arrow and take a tiny skin sample." Analysis of the resulting 
DNA has shown that male pilot whales typically stay in their mothers' pods but 
do not father the young in those groups. A similar pattern of outbreeding seems 
to be typical of killer whales. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the seven main exhibits will show how killer whales, or orcas, hunt 
cooperatively. The show will also feature a model of a Tlingit Indian woman of 
the Northwest, telling the traditional tale of how the orca came into being. 
According to Tlingit lore, the orca was carved out of yellow cedar by 
Naatsilanei, who created the animals to take revenge on the jealous 
brothers-in-law who tried to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways the scientific story of the origins of the killer whale and other 
cetaceans is much harder to believe. As Heyning explains, the common ancestor 
of whales, dolphins and porpoises is the 55-million-year-old mesonychid, a 
meat-eating ungulate that lived on land and looked like an extremely unpleasant 
short-legged dog. Visitors to the show will be able to see how the cetaceans 
evolved from this ancient ancestor to live in the sea, how the nostrils 
migrated to the top of the head and became blow holes, how the tail widened 
into flukes. One of the exhibits in the show utilizes fiber optics so that 
visitors can compare the bones in the human arm with the bones in the flipper 
of their very, very distant cousin, the white-sided dolphin. 
</P>
<P>
 Whales have also found an unusual place on the information superhighway in 
recent years as a result of electronic tagging, Heyning says. "The new 
electronic tags are essentially small computers," he points out. A scientist 
can now sit before his or her computer screen and see data about the depth or 
duration of a dive being transmitted directly from a tagged whale -- a 
veritable cyber-cetacean. 
</P>
<P>
 But technology hasn't begun to answer all the questions scientists still have 
about these glorious sea mammals, Heyning says. One example: Milk has been 
found in the stomach of a 15-year-old sperm whale. Since a whale that age has 
long been able to feed on its own, observers wonder if the milk doesn't reflect 
some not yet known aspect of the social behavior of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers of the show have tried to make it as captivating as possible, 
reasoning that a spoonful of theatricality makes the hard science go down. 
Among the hands-on exhibits will be a jukebox that features the cetacean Top 
40, recordings of the songs and vocalizations of dozens of whales, dolphins and 
porpoises. Each of the dioramas has also been designed, according to Heyning, 
"to give you an idea of what it's like to be out there in the field, at least 
as much as you can if you're not Disney." For example, the exhibit on the 
narwhal, a whale with a single unicorn-like tusk, will allow visitors to 
imagine they are hunting the creature in a vinyl Zodiac, the contemporary craft 
of choice among the Arctic Inuit, who are allowed to hunt the otherwise 
protected mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservation is one of the themes of the show, and to illustrate it the 
organizers chose to focus on the Gulf of California harbor porpoise, described 
by Heyning as one of the most endangered cetaceans in the world. Threatened 
with extinction because of gill-net fishing, the animals have dwindled to 
perhaps 200 individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Devoted as he is to saving the whales and their cousins, Heyning hopes that 
visitors to the exhibit will come away with an understanding of how complex 
conservation issues are. Human and animal interests are sometimes difficult to 
balance, he points out. Some 10,000 dolphins and porpoises are killed each year 
off the coast of Peru, caught for food by people who are starved for protein. A 
similar number die off the coast of equally hungry Sri Lanka. It's easy for 
well-fed Americans to denounce the slaughter, Heyning says, but in fact there 
are no easy answers to such ecological dilemmas. Where and When

ART; POINTS OF VIEW; JOHN O'BRIEN SELECTS WORKS THAT EVOKE 'MULTIPLE MEANINGS' 
IN THE EXHIBIT OF 13 CONTEMPORARY ARTISTS AT THE BRAND GALLERIES. 
</P>

 Art can make you think, and still have a heart. 
</P>
<P>
 That concept is one of the central ideas of the exhibit, "Credo," organized by 
artist John O'Brien at the Brand Li brary Art Galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to deal with work with emotional cores," said O'Brien, 38. Born in 
Japan, the son of an American military man, he lived all over the United States 
until he was 15, and then in Italy until he was 28. He is spending most of this 
year in Rome on a Fulbright Research Grant studying contemporary art theory and 
trying to organize exchange shows. Contemporary Los Angeles artists' work would 
be exhibited in Italy and Italian artists' work would be shown here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the notion that artists can present their own community, that they 
don't need other people to do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Credo" he has brought together the work of 13 contemporary artists, 
including his own, and at least as many points of view. Each work "is meant to 
evoke multiple meanings," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew (the show) wasn't going to be one view based on John's own point of 
view," said gallery director Cindy Cleary. "There are things in the show to 
provoke people, and I always like to provoke people. Each individual work 
speaks for itself. What you respond to may be totally different than what the 
artist intended, but that's what it's all about." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien's sculpture, "The Crying Game," was made in response to his tears over 
experiences he had with gang members in his Los Angeles neighborhood. They had 
set up a drug distribution center in front of his home, and asked him to leave 
the neighborhood by pointing a gun at him. He was shot at several times. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Crying Game' may be disputable as a conceptual (work of art), but I 
don't care," O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 What he does care about is presenting art that suggests a belief system, that 
advances a heartfelt idea rather than a negative critique of someone else's 
notion. He was also interested in showing the work of artists who "exercise a 
large degree of work, of handiwork, who throw themselves into the making of the 
work," he said. "Most of the artists in this show are interested in beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 Mara Lonner weaves the high art material of French brocade through the 
everyday material of a door screen, creating an attractive, seemingly 
nature-based motif for her strong but delicate, untitled large wall piece. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien sees this work, this brocade weave through a piece of hardware as "the 
inversion of the bias against women's work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonner's "Repair Series," a group of much smaller screens, presents equally 
appealing decorative motifs without the use of brocade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cowhide is the main material of Barbara Benish's "Divestment." Cut in the 
shape of a map of the United States -- and that of a bull, depending on how one 
looks at it -- it presents a sweeping view of the development of the country. 
Using silk screen and oil, images on the cowhide recognize the country's 
earliest Indian inhabitants as well as indicate the effects of 20th-Century 
technology on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Wolf makes photocopies of his own photographs and then places an acrylic 
sheet and square-shaped acrylic gels of bright colors over portions of the 
photocopied images. This process creates several ethereal, sentimental views of 
"3 Generations" and "Roses, Sunday Morning, Los Angeles." Yet, the same 
treatment given to a nondescript building and a homeless person in front of it 
in "Sunday Morning, Downtown L.A." generates feelings of alienation despite the 
attractive color patterns of Wolf's process. 
</P>
<P>
 John Outterbridge calls his totemic pieces "Sun Ships." Colorful strips of 
rags hang from the monument-like painted wood figures, creating "festive, 
celebratory markers to thank the gods," O'Brien said. "They are intended as 
gifts of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists in the show: Wendy Adest, Jean Lee Habenicht, Marco Huerta, 
Robert Kingston, Willy Lenski, Pam Longobardi, Galidan Nauber, and Mark 
Niblock-Smith. Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Credo."

MUSIC; INTO OTHER REALMS; SINGER KATE MCGARRY APPRECIATES TRADITION. BUT WITH 
HER FLIGHTS OF IMPROVISATION, SHE ADDS SPIRIT AND IMAGINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kate McGarry offers the best of the past and present -- and maybe the future 
-- of jazz singing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old native of Hyannis, Mass., possesses a grounded awareness of 
the great jazz vocal tradition exemplified by such artists as Sarah Vaughan, 
Ella Fitzgerald and Betty Carter. She couples this fond knowledge with an 
unrestrained improvisational sense that leads to forward-thinking 
interpretations that are as provocative and listenable as they are unique. 
</P>
<P>
 Take McGarry's version of "Dearly Beloved," from her fine debut CD, "Easy to 
Love" on VTL Records. Working at a sprightly up-tempo with crackling support 
delivered by the first-rate drummer Paul Kreibich, she states the melody of the 
durable Jerome Kern evergreen in a swinging approach that honors the way Kern 
wrote the song. 
</P>
<P>
 But in her second chorus, McGarry cuts loose, singing the same words, only 
squeezing some of them into smaller spaces than the composer intended, or 
dropping some, offering phrases that have a hard-edged chop. Then come solos by 
McGarry's band, and a fairly straightforward take on the melody sends the tune 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 McGarry employs a similar style on other tunes on the recording, released in 
1992. She says this is the way she prefers to work, and she thinks it's what a 
lot of listeners want. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want music to expand them," she says, spreading her arms wide, her 
blues eyes flashing. "I think you should always give a good reading of the 
melody. But then, if you have something to say, come at the song from a 
different angle, get a little more personal with it, though don't go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The singer appears Saturday at the Room Upstairs at Le Cafe, where she'll lead 
her quartet, featuring Karen Hammick (piano), Bob Maize (bass) and Kreibich. 
She says that a good deal of the openness in her renditions comes from 
performing with such like-minded musicians as Hammick and Kreibich, with whom 
she's played for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "By finding musicians with whom you have a similar sensibility and then 
developing a relationship that spans time, you have access to different parts 
of yourself while you are performing the music," says McGarry, a resident of 
Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go into the zone where things are really happening, where the music 
becomes immediate, is less mundane," she says, rapidly snapping her left wrist 
as if playing a drumbeat. "That's what people go to music for, to enter other 
realms. Call it spirit, imagination. That's what improvisation is at its best, 
when you're accessing a part of yourself that's very deep, and of which you 
can't quite be sure, thank God." 
</P>
<P>
 McGarry's flavorful versions of classic standards and such jazz classics as 
"Parker's Mood" and "Yardbird Suite" are often outfitted with a delightful 
swinging feel. "Swinging is a high art," says McGarry. "It's something 
beautiful that is laid out, like a wonderful red carpet to walk on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The singer has attracted plenty of fans since she moved to Southern California 
in 1987 to focus on her singing. One is Stephanie Haynes, arguably the area's 
finest jazz singer. "I think Kate's great," says Haynes. "She has the kind of 
improvisational style I relate to. Her work is well-grounded in musical 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Born into a family where singing was seen as family entertainment, McGarry 
always wanted to be a professional. She first worked while in college at the 
University of Massachusetts, Amherst. In Southern California, she has performed 
at Le Cafe, Lunaria in Los Angeles, the Club Brasserie in West Hollywood and 
Bistro L'Ecluse (formerly Inn Arty's) in Pasadena. The vocalist says that 
singing, at its best, gives her a chance to touch others. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about collecting other people's hearts for a short span of 
time that I like to do," she says. "There's so much coming in from the people, 
their feelings, yearnings, emotions -- it's all really subtle. But if people 
are listening, then you give these emotions voice, along with your own stuff. 
It's very definitely a strong exchange between the so-called performer and the 
so-called listener." Where and When

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; QUAKE DAMAGE CLOSES PLAYHOUSE; THE COST TO REPAIR PLUMBING 
AT THE WEST END THEATER IN VAN NUYS WAS ESTIMATED AT $20,000.

 The West End Playhouse in Van Nuys, home to some of the longest-running hits 
in San Fernando Val ley theater history, closed its doors Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're closing permanently because of plumbing problems," Artistic Director 
Edmund Gaynes said. The building's plumbing was damaged in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. Although temporary repairs were made, the problem was only getting 
worse, Gaynes said. The estimated cost to repair the plumbing was $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We regret closing something that has had a wonderful history," Gaynes said. 
"We're not happy to see it go; we're looking for another facility in the 
Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening in 1983, the 83-seat theater has presented several long-running 
shows, including "Broadway Sings Out," "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes," "Bein' With 
Behan," "The Heirs" and "The Ladies of the Camellias." The final show, "The 
Cosmic Pull," closed Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaynes and his wife, Associate Artistic Director Pamela Hall, will remain 
active in the West End Artists Theatre Company, including producing a four-show 
Equity season at the Lobero Theatre in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The West End Playhouse will live on in another way. The theater's equipment 
and furniture were sold, and "now there's a little bit of the West End 
Playhouse in almost every theater in the Valley," Gaynes said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Valley loses one theater, it gains another. Theatre 6470 has resurfaced 
with a new name, a new house and a new show. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater company left its previous, smaller space in Hollywood last winter, 
and has reappeared in NoHo as the Eclectic Company. The company has converted a 
storefront at 5312 Laurel Canyon Blvd. into a new 50-seat theater. And opening 
Oct. 7 is "Six Quickies . . . for a really good time call . . . , " an evening 
of six one-act comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It features 20 actors playing 30 characters in six plays in two hours," said 
Janet Borrus, an Eclectic Company spokeswoman. "And it includes three West 
Coast premieres and one world premiere." 
</P>
<P>
 The six quickies are "Seven Menus" by David Ives, "Attack of the Moral 
Fuzzies" by Nancy Beverly, "Package Deal" and "A Chance Meeting" by Frederick 
Stroppel, and "Tandem" and "Power Video" by Fredric Sirasky. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eclectic Company is different from many other local theater groups, Borrus 
said. "We're a collective of actors, directors, producers and writers. There is 
no artistic director," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has about 30 members who are encouraged to bring their own 
projects to work on. The collective has mounted about 30 productions in six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another show, "Livin' Another Life," a one-woman show by company member Meegan 
King, is slated to open Oct. 18. And the Eclectic Company also is producing a 
touring Shakespeare program for Los Angeles high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six Quickies" opens 8 p.m. Oct. 7 at the Eclectic Company Theatre, 5312 
Laurel Canyon Blvd., North Hollywood, and will run Thursday through Saturday 
evenings. Ends Nov. 12. Tickets are $15, two for $20. Call (213) 882-4284.

 VARIETY SHOW: The West Valley Symphony Orchestra will perform the first 
concert of its 1994-95 season Saturday evening at Pierce College. Music 
Director James Domine says the program is an eclectic one. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no unifying theme," Domine says. "We're going for maximum variety." 
</P>
<P>
 The scheduled classical pieces will be the Castelnuovo-Tedesco Concerto in D 
Major featuring guitar soloist Frank Accardo, and "Scheherazade" by 
Rimsky-Korsakov. Additionally, guest conductor Eddie Koch will lead the 
orchestra in his arrangements of "Music From the Movies." 
</P>
<P>
 The concert marks the beginning of the ensemble's 14th season, its sixth at 
Pierce College. The orchestra consists of lawyers, real estate salespeople, 
teachers and others, as well as some professional musicians, Domine says. Most 
members of the orchestra have master's degrees in music. Domine describes it as 
a graduate-level orchestra, "a cut above" local college ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the talent pool here, an amateur group in Los Angeles is better than 
many professional groups in other areas of the country," Domine says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thirty years ago, these people would have probably been playing 
professionally," Domine says. "The level of talent is still out there, but the 
(musical) employment opportunities are not." 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley Symphony Orchestra will perform 8 p.m. Saturday in the Pierce 
College Performing Arts Theater, 6201 Winnetka Ave., Woodland Hills. Tickets 
are $10, $8 senior citizens and students, $5 children under 12. Call (818) 
717-0978.

COVER STORY; TICKET TO RIDE; THOSE WHO LIKE TO SADDLE UP WITHOUT THE BURDEN OF 
BIG EXPENSES CAN OFTEN ARRANGE TO DO STABLE CHORES IN EXCHANGE FOR TIME ON THE 
TRAILS OR TAKING LESSONS.

<P>
 As the cock crows at Carousel Farms in Chatsworth, Lisa Weinstein already is 
pampering horses. 
</P>
<P>
 She bathes and brushes their bodies, applies fly repellent and conditions 
their hoofs. She walks them, feeds them, strokes them. She bandages their legs 
and ensures they are comfortable at night in their stalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, 29, is not a hired groom but an equestrian student who spends about 
30 hours a week currying and caring for horses at the three-acre facility. Yet 
for all her labor, she does not receive a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein works to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a single mom, so, obviously, I don't have a lot of money," said 
Weinstein, who lives in Woodland Hills and works as a secretary. "If I didn't 
have this arrangement, there is no way I'd be able to pay for all of this." 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff for Weinstein is free riding lessons for herself and her 4-year-old 
daughter, Kasey. The deal also includes free board, regular shoeing and basic 
veterinary care for her horse, Rocky. The package is worth about $800 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, unable to afford pricey horse-related expenses, is among a throng 
of equestrian enthusiasts who hoof the bill by working at stables -- grooming, 
feeding, even shoveling you-know-what. It's a dirty job, but a herd of horse 
lovers are eager to do it. In fact, so-called work-ride arrangements are as old 
as the hitching post and -- at many stables -- as informal as a weekend ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the whole riding tradition," said Zsu Zsu Illes, a trainer at 
Stoney Point Riding Center in Chatsworth and a former working student at the 
stable. "I would imagine that as long as there have been riding lessons, there 
have been work-ride programs." 
</P>
<P>
 At Stoney Point, children in beginning classes earn credit toward riding 
lessons in exchange for doing minor chores. Just a short gallop away, Stephanie 
Haney, 19, earns her and her horse's keep as one of two working students at 
Chatsworth's Sleepy Stables. "Basically, I groom to ride," she said. "I don't 
have a lot of money, and I have to support my horse." 
</P>
<P>
 The philosophy has become a structured program at the Los Angeles Equestrian 
Center in Burbank, where 28 students log an average of 20 hours a week as part 
of the Traditional Equitation School's working student program. Another 22 
working students are enrolled in the school's sister program at Hansen Dam 
Equestrian Center in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Patricia Kinnaman, the school's owner, created the working student 
program in 1986. The idea was born largely from her own experience while 
growing up in the state of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised in an environment where I was very horse crazy, but my parents 
could not afford a horse," said Kinnaman, who now owns more than 70 horses. 
"So, I worked at a local barn and the couple that owned the facility took an 
interest in me and let me do whatever it took to ride a horse. When I moved to 
L.A., I decided I wanted to share that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kinnaman's students must work eight hours to participate in a one-hour group 
lesson that would cost $30. Students also receive discounts at Kinnaman's 
saddlery store at the center and admittance to equestrian seminars that 
typically cost $25. 
</P>
<P>
 The program does not offer boarding, and all horses used are owned by 
Kinnaman. The program is geared toward students who do not own a horse and 
cannot afford to buy one. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment isn't automatic. Students are given an entry evaluation and must 
serve a three-month apprenticeship before gaining benefits as a working 
student. Their weekly hours are recorded on time cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be sure they care for the animal as much as I do," Kinnaman said. 
"I want them to believe in true horsemanship and to be the satellites of what I 
believe in." 
</P>
<P>
 For equestrian students going solo, a monthly price tag of $1,000 is not 
uncommon, Kinnaman said. "When you buy a horse, the initial investment is 
nothing. It's the upkeep that costs," Kinnaman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet not everyone in Kinnaman's program fits the description of starving 
student. Her pupils include attorneys and accountants who simply love to spend 
their spare time around horses. Jan Kuebler, who recently was laid off from her 
job as an office manager in a Los Angeles publishing firm, joined the program 
five years ago because she always wanted to learn about horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do it all," Kuebler said. "But then, of course, it comes time to 
balance the checkbook at the end of the month." 
</P>
<P>
 For Carol Derry, the decision to join the program four years ago had as much 
to do with her dissatisfaction with the legal profession as it did with her 
desire to ride. Derry eventually quit her job as an attorney and now works as 
an instructor at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The working student program means you're working for your lessons," Derry 
said. "But I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who does it only for 
the lessons. They want to own their own horses someday and they want to know 
how to handle them and how to care for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as any horse lover will attest, equitation can be a costly affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you have occasional vet bills," said Barbara Vasilaros of Carousel 
Farms, who serves as Weinstein's trainer. "And if you want to go to a horse 
show, you've got (the cost of) trailers and moving. You've got to have a lot of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 So too, it would seem, do trainers who agree to the deal. Kinnaman concedes 
the working student program is not a moneymaker for the school. And she says 
she could hire grooms to perform chores for less money than she gives away in 
the form of lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "My accountant has told me I'm crazy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But she says her students provide added attention that the animals otherwise 
might not receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasilaros, who has employed working students for the past 20 years, said the 
trade-off usually translates into a win-win-win situation -- for trainers, 
students and horses. But she's not willing to take on just anyone as a working 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say to me, 'I will clean stalls to do this,' " Vasilaros said. 
"And when they say that, I know they want this really bad. I try to give 
everybody a fair chance."  
</P>
<P>
 Illes of Stoney Point spent months raking and shoveling before graduating to 
more important duties. The informal apprenticeship paid off, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt like I was doing things I shouldn't have to do," Illes said. "I 
had to pay my dues until the lady I was working for had the feeling that I was 
reliable. When you think about it, in the horse world, it's really the best way 
to learn. You can only learn so much from riding." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was riding that motivated Weinstein to approach Vasilaros about a 
working for lessons -- for her daughter's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon, Weinstein is finished with chores and ready to assist Kasey in a 
lesson.  
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, she has no fear of riding and that's what I wanted," Weinstein 
said. "The thing I wanted was for her to ride. In a lot of ways, this is the 
perfect job." Where and When

LEASING -- AN AFFORDABLE OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Horse sales had slowed to a trot -- much like the California economy. So 
Patricia Kinnaman, her stables filled with unowned geldings and mares, queried 
aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 They buy horses, don't they? Maybe they would lease them, too. 
</P>
<P>
 That was five years ago. Today, Kinnaman leases about 20 horses as part of her 
Traditional Equitation School, which has programs at the Los Angeles Equestrian 
Center in Burbank and Hansen Dam Equestrian Center in Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Leasing allows budget-minded equestrian students the opportunity to ride the 
same horse regularly as if it were their own without being saddled with the 
high cost of ownership or upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't selling horses like I used to," Kinnaman said. "And I noticed 
there were a lot of horses for sale. Financially, some people just can't afford 
to buy right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Leases run for one month and usually are shared by two people who each 
typically pay $550 a month and split time riding. Each partner also receives 
one half-hour private lesson and two one-hour group riding lessons per week. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest -- board, grooming, shoeing, veterinary care, everything but grasping 
the reins -- is handled by Kinnaman. 
</P>
<P>
 For Janet Klein, a former horse owner accustomed to spending close to $1,000 a 
month on equestrian expenses, that made good horse sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became too expensive," said Klein, who lives in Newhall. "And it took up 
too much of my time with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years ago, Klein sold her horse and quit her job as an art teacher after 
having the first of two children. But she still had a desire to ride.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you ride at a barn, you're constantly being switched on horses," Klein 
said. "You don't always get the horse you want. I liked the idea of leasing 
because I could form that partnership with a horse that is so important. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to buy a horse again, but for right now, this is the way to go for 
me."

THEATER; WORKING LIKE A DOG; 'JOE CARBONE'S JOB,' OPENING TONIGHT AT NOHO 
STUDIOS, HAS AT ITS CORE AUTHOR ART SHULMAN'S IMAGININGS THAT MOST PEOPLE CAN 
BE IDENTIFIED WITH A CORRESPONDING ANIMAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T. H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 During the heyday of the Group Theatre in the 1930s, noted actor / director 
Robert Lewis decided that a role he was playing in a Group project was very 
ratlike. He made his hands into little paws, wore flyaway whiskers and sniffed 
his scene partner as though she were a piece of cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Shulman, whose play "Joe Carbone's Job" opens tonight at NoHo Studios, has 
taken that conceit several steps further. Some time ago, he began to imagine 
that most people can be identified with a corresponding animal. 
</P>
<P>
 It started a few years ago when Shulman, who has a market research business -- 
he prefers "motivational investigation" -- was working for an ad agency. For a 
mock newspaper he created for them, he wrote a series of character studies 
about people and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 It eventually turned into a book-length collection that he called "People and 
Other Animals." One day someone suggested to Shulman that the studies should be 
put on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Easier said than done, Shulman found out. He began to gather together some 
actors who were interested in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had ended up," he says, "with this book of sketches, each person in a 
different occupation, talking about an animal that was relevant for them." 
</P>
<P>
 He developed a story with one of the characters, Joe Carbone. In the story, 
Carbone was thinking about changing careers, and talked to many other people 
about their careers to find out what he should do. "That's what we had," 
Shulman explains, "when we first started doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the actors recommended to Shulman was Joedy Colombo, who had begun his 
career with The Players Ring in West Hollywood. Colombo eventually moved into 
the business world and now, semi-retired, has returned to his first love, 
theater. The part that he was first contacted about was already cast, but 
Shulman still needed a director, and that was Colombo's particular niche. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've read many of the character sketches that are not involved in the play," 
Colombo says, "and they're interesting and funny. That's what intrigued me 
about converting it into a play and directing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Together, Shulman and Colombo began to shape the original script into a 
producible form. In the present version, Joe Carbone, the owner of a chicken 
slaughterhouse repelled by his livelihood, wants to change his path. He begins 
working part time for a coffeehouse run by a woman named Angie. (The plot now 
had a love interest.) Carbone begins talking to the customers about their 
careers, conversations and monologues based on Shulman's original sketches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shulman says: "The theme of the play is that lots of people today are changing 
jobs, or have lost their jobs because of downsizing or the economy. Even if 
they haven't lost their jobs, a lot of people just want to change their 
careers. People question what they should do with themselves. Joe asks, 'What 
should I do with myself? What's the meaning of my life?' At the end he finds 
out. Once you find out who you are, it becomes easier to know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Angie is a fervent vegetarian and animal activist, even more upset than Joe 
about the poor chickens. "To Angie," Colombo says, "it's a 'save-the-chickens' 
play. But to Joe, it's his midlife crisis. He's an easygoing, fun-loving guy, 
but this decision has become a burden to him. The play is about how he resolves 
the dilemma. Angie saves the chickens." 
</P>
<P>
 Colombo is insistent about making the production audience-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 He explains, "I do it from the perspective of the audience. What does an 
audience need to be entertained while they sit in a theater for two-plus hours? 
I put myself in their position. I grew up in theater-in-the-round. That taught 
me a lot about audiences. There's an audience psychology. You have to prime an 
audience. You have to give them that first laugh in the first scene to let them 
know they have permission to laugh. Let them go, and that audience will let 
loose and respond." 
</P>
<P>
 Shulman says that from 40 to 50 original character sketches he and Colombo 
have chosen nine for the present script. 
</P>
<P>
 With a laugh, Colombo says: "He's got a lot more. We could probably do three 
plays. 'Angie and Joe II' and 'Angie and Joe III.' Ad infinitum." Where and 
When

 What's "More Fun Than Bowling"? Well, for one thing death is, according to 
playwright Steven Dietz, whose comedy of that name is running at the Lionstar 
Theatre.

 His play, which looks a little dated in the '90s, is of a genre popular a 
decade or so ago, when logic was not a consideration, wild and crazy the norm, 
metaphor the form, and actors were asked only for characters, not 
characterizations. The pendulum has swung back to richer dramatic territory, 
and Dietz's simplism seems a bit thin in comparison. It has its share of very 
funny lines, but his metaphors have a tinny ring and none of the points he 
makes are anywhere near being resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Jake, whose first wife divorced him and then married money, owns a bowling 
alley in the Midwestern town of Turtle Rapids (get the pun?). He married Lois, 
who died, then two weeks later married her best friend Loretta, who passed on 
as quickly. We discover Jake rising from a grave between those of his last two 
wives, but he can't remember which one is buried where. He's giving the grave a 
trial run because of a Gypsy prophecy about his own demise. Originally planning 
a career as a concert pianist, a foul ball in a baseball game crushed his right 
hand and gave him the perfect bowling hand. But now life seems even more cruel 
and dangerous, particularly with a mysterious man named Mr. Dyson hot on his 
heels with an intriguing attache case and a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 That's only the beginning of the plethora of incidents leading nowhere. 
One-liners abound: "Love is like being too drunk to go bowling; it doesn't 
happen that often." They get their due laughs, but the obtuseness of most of 
the dialogue takes off some of their shine. Jake's referring to a bowling ball 
as Death out to murder the five-pin, and his fear that there's no bowling in 
the Great Beyond look like no more than the playwright's obsession with the 
game.  
</P>
<P>
 Director Richard Ryder and a good cast try their best to make it all work, but 
comedic gutter balls outnumber the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Farmer, like most of the company, is happy with a character instead of a 
characterization as Jake. Lorraine Morgan is bubbling and giddy as his 
wiser-than-her-age daughter, and Cheryl Cameron seems oddly restrained as his 
second wife (much of the play is in flashbacks). Michelle Chilton is the third 
wife and gets most of the laughs. Dwayne Ross is also very funny as the 
mysterious Dyson. Where and When

REALLY BIG SHOW; INTERRUPT YOUR SCHEDULED PROGRAMMING. A DRAMA IS ABOUT TO 
UNFOLD IN THE NIGHTTIME SKIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Jeff Schnaufer writes regularly for 
The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the new fall TV season lineup has you down, October is definitely the time 
to look up. 
</P>
<P>
 October's planets will surprise San Fernando Valley residents with more 
dramatic scenes than many weekly television series and, at the same time, help 
you learn how to identify these celestial bodies during one of the few times of 
the year when they can be seen together. 
</P>
<P>
 The best sky show is actually a miniseries airing just after sunset Thursday 
and next Friday, when the moon makes a guest appearance in an area of sky 
featuring three planets: Mercury, Venus and Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday night, the moon can be seen above Mercury, about level with Venus 
and below Jupiter. Next Friday, the moon is positioned above all three planets. 
</P>
<P>
 These two nights present a rare opportunity to spot the elusive planet 
Mercury. To find Mercury, use a pair of binoculars (7 x 50 power) or a 
six-inch-diameter or larger telescope, and find a viewing site with a clear, 
flat western horizon. Look for Mercury before it sets shortly after sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a telescope, Mercury will look like nothing more than a faint star. If 
you fail to spot it, try again Oct. 31, about 40 minutes before dawn, when it 
is easily visible near the bright star Spica. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Mercury and Venus are between the sun and Earth, we are able to see 
them only near sunrise and sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 As the closest planet to the sun, Mercury is also the swiftest, circling the 
sun every 88 days. Because of the gravitational tug of the sun, Mercury rotates 
on its axis only every 58 days. As a result, there are 1 1/2 Mercury days in 
every Mercury year. 
</P>
<P>
 But although it is the closest planet to the sun, Mercury is not the hottest. 
That honor belongs to Venus, easily spotted below the moon on Thursday as the 
brightest object in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 With a thick blanket of carbon dioxide making up its atmosphere, Venus lets in 
light but does not let it out, creating a greenhouse effect that has, over 
billions of years, raised its temperature to a blistering 878 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Mercury, Venus and the other planets shine not because they are 
generating heat, but because of the sunlight reflected off their surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 With a small telescope, you can see Venus' crescent phase as it begins its 
passage between the sun and Earth in mid-November. Follow Venus from the 
beginning of the month with a telescope to see how the crescent phase 
disappears as it descends into the glare of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The next brightest object in the sky Thursday is the planet Jupiter, still 
showing the effects of the collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 in July. The 
dark, Earth-sized impact zones on the planet's hydrogen cloud tops may still be 
visible with a small telescope, and may remain so for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it is the largest planet in the solar system, 11 times the 
diameter of the Earth, Jupiter will appear smaller in a telescope than Venus. 
Yet four of its 13 known moons, known as the Galilean satellites, should be 
visible with only a pair of binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
 If you prefer getting up early to see morning shows, check out Mars about 2 
a.m. Oct. 17 and 18, when the planet passes through the Beehive Cluster in the 
constellation Cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A collection of a few hundred stars 500 light years away, the Beehive will 
appear like a sparkling backdrop of jewels through a pair of binoculars or a 
small telescope. Mars will blaze a brilliant red. 
</P>
<P>
 Mars' color stems from the iron-rich dust on its surface that has, in essence, 
rusted. Mars is also home to Olympus Mons, the solar system's largest volcano. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a telescope in the coming months, observers may be lucky enough to 
observe Mars' north polar cap begin to "melt" during that planet's spring 
season. But don't look for any rivers or streams emanating from the cap -- the 
frozen surface there is carbon dioxide, or dry ice, which is actually 
evaporating into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 But the greatest guest star of all this month is the planet Saturn, whose own 
appearance will change more during the next year than a character actor's. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturn is high in the southeast after dusk, appearing in the faint stars of 
Aquarius. Visible all this month and the rest of autumn, Saturn's rings are 
tilting in respect to our plane of sight, a process that occurs every 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1995, Saturn's rings will appear edge-on, making them virtually disappear 
from our view on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, this fall is one of the last times this year that you will be 
able to catch Saturn's rings through a small telescope. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the planets constantly change position and appearance as they revolve 
around the sun during the year, the show never ends. 
</P>
<P>
 So when your favorite television show becomes a repeat in the spring, grab a 
star chart from Sky and Telescope or Astronomy magazines and look for the new 
season of planets on the celestial channel -- commercial free, of course.

CLUB SCENE; COME EARLY TO ROCK THIS HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHERIE SAUNDERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Beach House Restaurant and Bar, which took over the problem-plagued Red 
Onion in Woodland Hills, hopes to shake off old onion ghosts with its 
month-old, beach-themed club. Patrons can expect a long wait on weekends, 
leading to a loud, fun night where waitresses dance on countertops when the 
mood strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: You'll need a Thomas Guide to find your way around the two levels. 
When the club is filled to capacity, you are led inside and upstairs to a 
sports bar that turns into a waiting area for the main club on Fridays and 
Saturdays. This area is a miniature version of the main club, with its own bar, 
DJ and dance floor. You are given a number, then must wait until it is called 
to go downstairs to the main club. The bottom floor also has the restaurant, a 
labyrinth of large, airy rooms equipped with TV monitors that come in handy for 
Monday night football. The club area has a neon-lit dance floor bordered by 
booths, tables and chairs. Bucket seats from old cars sit in one area, and 
spray-painted palm trees decorate the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: Since its opening in early September, the club area downstairs has 
consistently reached its capacity of 360 by 10 p.m., according to general 
manager Craig Bonham. Get there early to avoid a long wait outside, or upstairs 
in the holding area. 
</P>
<P>
 THE LOOK: The dress code says no sandals, hats, flannel shirts or tanks. Men's 
shirts must be tucked in. Although none of these restrictions were heavily 
enforced last Saturday, Bonham said they intend to crack down in the coming 
weeks. As with most clubs, jeans dominated. The men either wore T-shirts and 
vests or shirts with button-down collars. Among the sea of women wearing 
baby-Ts under slip dresses, tight leather dresses and bustiers were also 
spotted. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: Tuesday nights are devoted to disco, while music from KROQ takes 
over Thursdays. On Mondays, Fridays and Saturdays, the DJ mixes it up with 
blocks of disco, hard rock, funk and alternative music. The dancers crowded on 
the floor looked like they were landing a plane while doing the hand motions to 
"YMCA" by the Village People. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: You can watch yourself dance as you dance, courtesy of a stationary 
video camera that scans the entire dance floor and is shown on monitors that 
hang on either end of the dance floor, as well as a lounge area. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: The wait. "I didn't like the fact that we had to be shuffled upstairs 
first," said Paula Ruiz, 23, of Agoura. Her friend, Jamie Martinez, 25, of 
Studio City, chimed in, "Yeah, we waited 20 minutes outside, then 50 more 
minutes upstairs."  
</P>
<P>
 THE SIGNS: "He who looketh upon a woman, loseth a fender" -- a message on one 
of the many signs hanging from the ceiling of the club.  
</P>
<P>
 The Beach House Restaurant and Bar, 6424 Canoga Ave., Woodland Hills. Club 
hours: 5 p.m. to midnight Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays; 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
Fridays; 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. Saturdays. The main club is closed Sundays and 
Tuesdays, but the sports bar is open from 11 a.m. to midnight. (818) 598-8075.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: IT'S T TIME IN PASADENA; STORE IS STOCKED WITH ALL-COTTON 
SHIRTS IN A RANGE OF SIZES AND DESIGNS. 
</P>

<P>
 Since the standard wear for anyone in California -- no matter what sex, age, 
economic or fashion status -- is the T-shirt, everyone needs to know where to 
get them at the lowest price. 
</P>
<P>
 The T-Shirt Factory Outlet certainly has one of the largest selections around. 
They advertise five for $10, but these are too flimsy to qualify as quality. 
But for groups, or special occasions with a limited-wear projection, they would 
be fine. These shirts are 100% cotton, U.S.-made and come in standard white in 
small, medium, large and extra large. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality is better in the colored Ts, available in at least 20 shades. They 
are 100% cotton and sell at three for $10. Matching leggings are the same 
price. So for $20 you could have three matching leisure outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 Often a special purchase brings in some great deals. The day I visited, some 
L.A. Gear T-shirts, which usually retail for $8 each, were three for $10. 
Others sold by K mart for $4.99 apiece were four for $10 here. These special 
purchases are sporadic and move fast, so keep an eye out for them when you 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes shirts will come pre-marked "irregular." These and those having 
flaws discovered by T-Shirt Factory Outlet personnel are tossed on a separate 
table to sell at four for $5. The flaws are tabbed with tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Pet fanciers and their friends can check out the selection of excellent dog 
and cat pictures that can be printed (while you wait) on a shirt for $7.99, 
including the shirt. About 20 breeds of dogs are featured, along with six 
different cat types and five different horses. 
</P>
<P>
 For sports fans, good quality 100% cotton, pre-printed team T-shirts for the 
NFL, the NHL and the baseball leagues sell for $9.99, compared to $12.99 to 
$15.99 elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to T-shirts, there were some good buys on 100% cotton denim shorts 
in several colors. Shorts for men, with the Rodin label, were $15.99, compared 
to a retail price of $30 or more. Women's shorts with the Wave label, which a 
major discounter sells for $22.99, were $12.99 here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lettering can be done on the premises while you wait. Figure 50 cents per 
letter for two-inch block letters and 35 cents for three-quarter-inch size. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventory, which is made up of close-outs, overstocks and liquidations, is 
constantly changing. Parking is a breeze, and the store is well-organized for 
effortless shopping. Sizes run from infant to extra-extra-extra-extra large on 
many items. 
</P>
<P>
 Geri Cook's Bargains column runs every Friday in Valley Life! Questions about 
shopping may be sent to her, in care of Valley Life!, Los Angeles Times, 20000 
Prairie St., Chatsworth, CA 91311. Letters will not be answered individually,

 Weby's Dely & Bakery, a San Fernando Valley fixture for nearly 30 years, is 
really two separate businesses under one roof. The deli, owned and operated by 
Frank and Lisa Ready, has been open continuously for three decades. The bakery, 
which had been under the same ownership for more than 20 years, closed 
temporarily from July 4 to Aug. 12 while the new owners completed a renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Norm Neiman, a third-generation baker who also runs the Plaza Bakery in North 
Hollywood, wants to assure Weby's longtime patrons that there will be no 
drop-off in quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're better than before," said Neiman, who owns the bakery with his wife, 
Irene. "You look at the bread, this is like a picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Ready describes her operation as an East Coast-style delicatessen dealing 
primarily with takeout and catering orders, with only a few tables on site. She 
and her husband have owned the business for about two years, although Frank had 
worked at Weby's Dely for more than 15 years before that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met here when I was a customer," Lisa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weby's Dely & Bakery, 12131 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. Call: deli (818) 
761-9391, bakery (818) 769-6062. BLUE PLATE SPECIALS 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily Grill in Studio City, which made Valley Life's Top 20 Restaurants 
list last year, is offering people new opportunities to sample its fare. All 
six locations of the Daily Grill chain, including Studio City and its second 
Valley eatery in Encino, will give customers a choice of two Blue Plate 
Specials every day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Plate program had been offered only Mondays through Thursdays, but 
due to its popularity management decided to make it a daily program. The Daily 
Grill's discounted Blue Plate Specials include the entree plus a choice of soup 
or salad. Entrees include pasta with sun-dried tomatoes and pesto sauce 
available Mondays for $7.95, chicken parmigiana with spaghetti for $9.95 on 
Thursdays, T-bone steak with French fries and broccoli for $17.95 on Fridays or 
baked sea-bass medallions with mustard sauce served with red roasted potatoes 
and broccoli for $14.95 on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the Daily Grill's Valley locations, 12050 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, 
(818) 769-6336 , and 16101 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 986-4111, have a 
no-reservations policy. ARRIVEDERCI LAUTREC 
</P>
<P>
 Lautrec, famous for its outdoor patio with a fountain, wildflowers and pepper 
trees, has changed its name and menu. Switching from a cuisine it described as 
nouveau California/French, the West Valley eatery now called Villa Piacere 
offers a new cuisine its owners describe as northern Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a larger variety of pastas and different types of gourmet pizzas," 
said Helen Hewes of Villa Piacere. The new menu's offerings are more 
nutritionally balanced, with lower fat and sodium levels, and more moderately 
priced, Hewes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some new entrees are a spicy shrimp pizza with basil and sun-dried tomatoes, a 
vegetarian pizza with grilled onions, caramelized garlic and goat cheese, and 
black linguine with chicken and shrimp. Most entrees range from $9.95 to 
$14.95, Hewes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Piacere, 22160 Ventura Blvd., Woodland Hills, (818) 704-1185, also 
offers brunch on weekends. Happy hour from 4:30 to 7 p.m. Mondays through 
Fridays.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; SWEET ON TASTES OF ITALY; DESPITE SOME MINOR LAPSES, UPSCALE 
ZUCCHERO IN CALABASAS SHOWS PROMISE WITH ITS MENU OF THIN-CRUSTED PIZZAS, 
UNUSUAL PASTAS AND SAVORY MEATS AND CHICKEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "I'm going to open 10 Zuccheros throughout the Southland," boasted our waiter, 
"if everything goes according to plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's wish him the best. Zucchero -- the Italian word for sugar -- is the name 
of an attractively appointed Italian dinner house in Calabasas, and though it's 
only 8 months old, I'm told business has been brisk. For now there is only one 
Zucchero, but who knows? Dreams of grandeur, at least, don't require a credit 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept does seem reasonably evolved. Decor is confidently attractive: an 
unfinished stone floor, an interestingly arched ceiling fashioned out of what 
appear to be laminated drop panels, a handsome hardwood bar, an elegant outdoor 
patio with trellised plants and white canvas umbrellas, even four majestic 
floor-to-ceiling columns dominating the main dining area. That's enough to turn 
a strip-mall space into a makeshift Roman temple. 
</P>
<P>
 And Zucchero's menu is pure and appealing, nearly perfect for the upscale 
Italophile West Valleyite. It's a small but sure-footed menu that will make you 
hungry when you read it, with its thin-crusted pizzas topped with duck sausage 
or tuna, its elegant salads based on arugula and radicchio, such oddment pastas 
as culignones (Sardinian ravioli), followed by simple, satisfying piatti 
secondi such as marinated lamb chops or lightly breaded chicken Milanese. 
</P>
<P>
 If only it were so simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Please don't infer that Zucchero slips up big-time. It's just that there are 
lapses, as in the friendly service, which could use a few obvious improvements. 
Expensive red wine imports, for instance, are served in standard-issue white 
wine glasses, which the waiter invariably fills to the brim as if this were jug 
wine that didn't need room to breathe.  
</P>
<P>
 And some dishes come out of the kitchen on the cold side, or even undercooked. 
Milanese alla contadina , a veal chop pounded thin and lightly coated with 
bread crumbs, is one that's apt to be room temperature by the time it reaches 
the table. Those culignones are thick pockets of dough with a tasty spinach and 
ricotta filling, and I concede that they must be tricky to prepare. But one 
loses sympathy fast when the dough tastes nearly raw despite having a piping 
hot filling. 
</P>
<P>
 I prefer sitting outside here, where the obvious inspiration is to order 
alfresco items like bruschetta. There might be a bit too much chopped tomato 
piled up on the oval cracker-crisp pizza bread used in this restaurant's 
bruschetta , but the tomatoes themselves are fresh and red-ripe. The kitchen 
mixes in a heady amount of chopped basil, and I like the fact that you get to 
douse it with olive oil yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pizzas are crisp, too, with intelligent toppings like prosciutto, bresaola 
(air-dried beef) and arugula (all three together on the model called la 
diabolica ), or a mix of duck sausage, mushroom and oregano (called oca e 
funghi , though oca literally means "goose"). You might overlook that the pizza 
chef is overly fond of cheese, but not that the duck sausage pizza gives you 
only one tiny chunk of sausage per slice. The cumin-spiked sausage is 
delicious, and you'll want to eat more of it. Besides, the portion is downright 
stingy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, stinginess doesn't characterize Zucchero's portions, but 
this is also not a restaurant where you get an obscene amount of food on the 
plate. The pastas are just big enough to share for appetizers, or to satisfy a 
single diner as an entree. 
</P>
<P>
 Rigatoni sorpresa is one not to miss, anyway, the chewy pasta tubes bathed in 
a subtle sauce of tomatoes, smoked bacon and a light touch of cream. Linguine 
saporite is another. With their flavorful topping of shrimp, arugula and 
chopped tomato, they're great on a sultry West Valley evening.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm less convinced by the risotto ortolano . Yes, it's made with arborio rice, 
and it looks beautiful with its medley of asparagus, peas and other vegetables, 
and the tasty vegetables snap when you bite in. Once the mushy rice grains are 
in your mouth, though, you can't help but think about that hot cereal you 
passed on at breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of secondi (meat or fish dishes) is probably polletto in crosta , a 
deftly grilled Cornish game hen marinated in rosemary, garlic and fruity olive 
oil. At $17, agnello alle erbe fini is the most expensive thing on the menu, 
but it's a fine dish of four tender chops from a lamb rack with a delicious 
accompaniment of carrots, spinach and roasted potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, try the delightful chocolate creme brulee , the frothy tiramisu

 IGNORED TOWN: Winnetka gets no respect. Most people think it's just a drive-in 
theater or a street. Even some who live there believe it's part of Canoga Park. 
In fact, it covers 18 city blocks (B1). . . . Another Winnetka, a Chicago 
suburb, attracts more attention, even from Hollywood. It has served as the 
setting for many films, including "Home Alone" and "Uncle Buck." 
</P>
<P>
 JAMES DEAN: The accident that killed James Dean and shattered a generation 
took place exactly 39 years ago today on a highway northwest of Bakersfield. 
Over the years, the site became a popular tourist attraction. But who remembers 
that Dean left on his ill-fated ride from right here? . . . According to "The 
Death of James Dean," by Warren Newton Beath, Dean left that day from a house 
he was renting on Sutton Street in Sherman Oaks.

 BOOKS: Pennsylvania is a long way away, but students in Erie were eager to 
help out earthquake victims. So they organized a book drive that resulted this 
month in the arrival of 600 pounds of books to Hamlin Street Elementary School 
in West Hills, hard hit by the quake. On Thursday, students (above) sorted the 
books (B2).

 NEW RINK: Torn by labor strife, pro hockey is skating on thin ice these days 
(C1). . . . The good news? A new rink complex opens next week in Simi Valley 
(C8). . . . Called the Easy Street Arena, it will accommodate figure skating as 
well. "It has everything that a first-class facility should have," says 
Michigan Tech hockey coach Bob Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD DEAL: Riding lessons can cost a bundle. So, many Valley horse lovers pay 
the bill by working at stables -- grooming, feeding, and, yes, even shoveling 
manure (Valley Life! Page 8). . . . Says Lisa Weinstein, who spends about 30 
hours a week at Carousel Farms in Chatsworth: "If I didn't have this 
arrangement, there is no way I'd be able to pay for all of this." Michael

PANEL PITCHES JOINT POWERS AUTHORITY TO RUN BALLPARK; STADIUM: COMMITTEE 
SUGGESTS OXNARD, CAMARILLO AND VENTURA FORM A TRI-CITIES SPORTS AUTHORITY TO 
OWN AND OPERATE THE MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A committee working to bring minor league baseball to Ventura County 
recommended Thursday the formation of a joint powers authority by Oxnard, 
Camarillo and Ventura to pay for a $15-million stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, endorsing a consultant's conclusions, also ranked Ventura as 
the best site for a minor league ballpark, even though a last-minute offer of 
free land by a Camarillo owner has thrown a curve into the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 Without private funding for the 5,500-seat ballpark, the committee said a 
joint powers authority is the most realistic alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Tri-Cities Sports Authority would own and operate the ballpark and 
share all costs and profits. To pay for the stadium, the authority would issue 
bonds guaranteed by the cities. Oxnard City Councilman Andres Herrera, a 
stadium backer, said he supports the authority idea only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not adverse to that, but the vehicle has to provide the least possible 
liability," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 As now conceived, the stadium could also be used for concerts, carnivals, 
boxing matches and other events. It could be built by April, 1996, according to 
the consultant, the Spectrum Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard, Ventura and Camarillo city councils are scheduled to meet Oct. 12 
in Camarillo to discuss stadium issues, including the joint powers authority. 
</P>
<P>
 A final decision on stadium construction is expected in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive to lure a minor league team to the county began in the spring when 
Joe Gagliardi, president of the California League, promised to deliver a Class 
A club if a stadium was built. 
</P>
<P>
 The three cities formed a committee in May and have spent $85,000 to study the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 After five months of considering a variety of locations for the new park, 
Spectrum selected the parcel near the Ventura Auto Center as the best among 
four sites in Ventura, Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The location's most important pluses are its proximity to the Ventura Freeway, 
and an offer by the Hofer family to donate about one-fifth of the 53 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Camarillo investment group whose land had not been considered as a site 
offered this week to donate 25 of the 35 acres needed for a stadium, and the 
committee has decided to evaluate that proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it stands right now, the best offer on the table is the Ventura site," 
Ventura City Councilman Jack Tingstrom said. "With the Camarillo site, there 
are still a lot of questions." 
</P>
<P>
 The newly proposed location, south of the Ventura Freeway near Camarillo 
Airport, is bound by too many zoning restrictions to be a serious candidate, 
Tingstrom said. He added that the owner is seeking significant concessions from 
Camarillo in exchange for its land. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little late," he said. "(And) they want to develop 143 acres for their 
25 acres." 
</P>
<P>
 But Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose said that the committee would be foolish not to 
seriously consider a donation of about $2 million in land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The land would be considerably cheaper," Gose said. "We're talking about a 
lot of money here." 
</P>
<P>
 Spectrum, an experienced Irvine-based sports consultant, selected the four 
locations from nine in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those four, a 30-acre tract near Camarillo Springs Golf Course in Camarillo 
ranked second after the Ventura Auto Center site. And a 49-acre site on Rice 
Avenue near Gonzales Road ranked third. 
</P>
<P>
 The other site, 72 acres near Del Norte Boulevard and Rice Avenue in Oxnard, 
was eliminated after its owner refused to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three sites compared very favorably, but it all came down to land 
donations," Gose said. "Some places offered some land and others didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the so-called "final" rankings, no city is out of contention as the 
possible home of the new park, committee members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Property owners will be asked to submit their final offers to the committee by 
Oct. 27. Haggling is expected between committee members and landowners over 
land donations and the breaks the cities would grant in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping someone donates all of the land," Tingstrom said. "What we have 
to give up to get that is the important part." 
</P>
<P>
 The consultant projected that attendance for 68 home games of a Class A 
baseball team each season would be about 340,000 -- a near sellout every game. 
Such a turnout would be comparable to two extremely successful minor league 
franchises in Rancho Cucamonga and Lake Elsinore. Tickets would cost about $5. 
NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard, Ventura and Camarillo city councils will discuss stadium issues at 
a public study session Oct. 12 in Camarillo. A final decision on building a 
$15-million ballpark is expected in November.

5 STUDENTS SUSPENDED IN VANDALISM OF RIVAL SCHOOL; EDUCATION: GIRLS FROM 
VENTURA HIGH SPLASHED PAINT AROUND BUENA CAMPUS IN ANNUAL FOOTBALL PRANK. 
ADMINISTRATORS SAY CLEANUP IS TOO COSTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Five Ventura High School honor students were suspended Thursday for their role 
in vandalizing the campus of rival Buena High, an annual pre-football-game 
prank that officials said is proving costly to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 The students -- all senior girls -- admitted to school officials that they 
splashed cans of bright yellow paint across the Buena High campus Wednesday 
night, then scampered through it barefoot, leaving prints on walkways and a 
pep-rally stand. 
</P>
<P>
 But the girls, including one varsity cheerleader who will not be allowed to 
attend tonight's football game, told school officials they never meant serious 
harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their understanding was that it was water-based paint. They thought you could 
just hose it off," said Assistant Principal Larry Koontz of Ventura High. "I 
agree their intentions were honorable and spirited, but the outcome was 
definitely different." 
</P>
<P>
 Koontz said some of the girls were identified by a Ventura High janitor who 
stopped by the Buena campus Wednesday night on the hunch there might be 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were questioned Thursday and will be suspended for three days, 
beginning today. They also will have to pay a portion of the cleanup costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen that many tears in a long time," Koontz said. "I think they're 
most upset about not being able to go to the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The footprints were only a small part of the mess created on both high school 
campuses Wednesday night, though school officials shrugged off the incident as 
a tradition tied to the Buena-Ventura football game. 
</P>
<P>
 "To an extent, it's normal kid behavior that just goes a little too far," said 
Ventura High Principal Hank Robertson. "I don't see that it's a big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 At Buena, the damage included black graffiti scrawled on the exterior of the 
gym, yellow paint on lockers and a pay phone, raw eggs tossed against buildings 
and whipping cream smeared on the handball courts. Dog food was dumped near the 
school sign, a reference to Buena's mascot, the bulldog. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandalism at Ventura was limited to streams of toilet paper, splattered 
eggs and the letters "BHS" burned into the grass of the football field. Last 
year, however, the midtown campus took the brunt of the damage when students 
scrawled graffiti across the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost about $1,100 to clean up both campuses and remove the paint and 
graffiti from Buena, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, maintenance workers sandblasted the water-based paint off the 
ground in the quad area and covered the black graffiti on the gym wall with oil 
enamel, which will be painted over later. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-man crew is expected to finish the job today. 
</P>
<P>
 After surveying the damage on his campus, Buena Principal Jaime Castellanos 
echoed Robertson's comments, saying the cost was what concerned him most. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a prank that went a little overboard," he said. "My only concern was 
the amount of the cost it was going to take to repair it." 
</P>
<P>
 The five suspended students said the only thing they did on the Buena campus 
was splash the yellow paint. School officials said they are still searching for 
other culprits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidently, there were maybe several hundred, maybe 100, kids on campus at 
both schools" on Wednesday night, Koontz said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a midday break at Buena High, students offered mixed reactions to the 
graffiti, most of which had already been covered with posters or blue paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they went too far with the paint," said Mike Wickham, 17, a varsity 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
 Jannine Bourbonnais, 15, a cheerleader, said the incident will intensify the 
long-running Buena-Ventura rivalry. "They're asking for a lot of it back," she 
said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's varsity football game between Ventura and Buena high schools begins 
at 7:30 p.m. in the Ventura High School stadium, 2155 E. Main St. Tickets can 
be purchased at the gate for $5.

RAINFALL HITS 72% OF NORMAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rainfall totals countywide are 72% of normal for the rain season that ends 
today , raising fears that Ventura County and the state may be headed toward 
another drought. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thursday's tropical storm dampened roads and lightly wetted crops, it 
did little to boost rainfall totals closer to the average 16.09 inches that the 
county receives each year, hydrologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trace amounts that fell in Thousand Oaks were enough to prompt 
officials to close the Thousand Oaks Library for a short time Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The library's roof, damaged in the January earthquake, is being rebuilt and 
the moisture leaked through plastic tarp placed atop the building, library 
Director Stephen R. Brogden said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the skies cleared Thursday and forecasters called for continuing blue 
skies this weekend, hydrologists were assessing the end of the 1993-94 rain 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Storage in reservoirs is sufficient to supply water demand in the coming year, 
hydrologists said. But a winter with little rain could force some county 
residents -- particularly those in the east county -- to renew efforts to save 
water, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether residents may be asked to step up conservation will hinge on the 
amount of rain over the next six months, said Don Kendall, manager of the 
Thousand Oaks-based Calleguas Municipal Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 "This winter will determine if the county is heading toward another drought, 
or if residents will continue to enjoy plentiful reserves." 
</P>
<P>
 That view was echoed by Jay Malinowski, spokesman for the giant Metropolitan 
Water District. MWD supplies about 75% of the water used in Ventura County 
through the Calleguas district, serving 500,000 customers in Thousand Oaks, 
Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are clearly at the whim of the weather," Malinowski said. "Ventura County 
is slightly more vulnerable to water shortages because we don't have as much 
flexibility in moving water there." 
</P>
<P>
 While meteorologists say it is too early to predict how wet this winter will 
be, one forecaster had encouraging news. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Brack, a meteorologist with Weather Data Inc., said the Southern 
California region should get above-average rainfall through the end of October. 
And Northern California, the origin of most MWD water shipped to Ventura 
County, should get normal rainfall in the coming month, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond October, however, the water outlook becomes less clear, hydrologists 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a semi-arid area," said Fred Royer, assistant general manager of 
the United Water Conservation District in Santa Paula. "We always have to be 
worried about our water supply." 
</P>
<P>
 The official rain year begins Oct. 1 and ends on Sept. 30. The state 
Department of Water Resources set those dates in 1967 because October is 
generally when the year's heaviest rains begin falling in California. 
</P>
<P>
 When averaged over the past 10 years, Ventura County has received 92% of 
normal rainfall. But year-to-year figures often whip wildly up and down. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rainy season that ended in 1990, for instance, the county received just 
35% of normal rainfall. Yet the next year, that figure leaped to 105% of 
normal, rising again in the 1991-92 year to 126% of normal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the wettest year was still to come, when the county recorded a whopping 
178% of normal rainfall in the 1992-93 season. Those recent wet winters 
positioned Ventura County and the state to ride out this year's dry spell 
relatively unscathed, water chiefs say. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Casitas, which supplies water for 60,000 customers in Ventura and Ojai, 
is at about 90% of capacity, said John Johnson, manager of the Casitas 
Municipal Water District. And the United Water Conservation District has so 
much supply in Lake Piru that the district is releasing 30,000 acre-feet into 
the Santa Clara River over a two-month period, Royer said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of that water is captured by the Freeman Diversion project in 
Oxnard, where it is funneled to spreading grounds that feed underground 
aquifers, Royer said. United serves Fillmore, Santa Paula, Oxnard, Port 
Hueneme, the two naval bases and part of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservoir levels are near capacity throughout the statewide water network as 
well, Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Malinowski and other water czars are skittish when talking about the 
coming winter. Water supply and demand in California changes rapidly, they 
warn, mainly because the state has limited storage space. 
</P>
<P>
 And memories of the six-year drought, which ended in 1991, are still fresh in 
the minds of many hydrologists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is still in the drought-watch mode," Kendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 While MWD has guaranteed water deliveries to meet east county customers' needs 
in the coming year, that position could change the following year if the state 
experiences a dry winter, Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas customers could be the first affected by water shortages because the 
east county is one of a few areas statewide that relies exclusively on water 
delivered through the State Water Project, Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other MWD regions also receive water from the Colorado River, which tends to 
be a more stable source, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to be OK in the coming year," Malinowski said. "But if 
the winter is dry, Ventura County customers could face more conservation." 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas, like many other water providers in Ventura County, advises 
customers to voluntarily reduce usage by 10%. Many residents have continued to 
follow that advice, even after two winters with drought-busting rains, Kendall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like people still have drought memory," he said. Annual Rainfall

OXNARD SCHOOL TRUSTEE APOLOGIZES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks after he lost his temper during an argument over whether the Oxnard 
School District should oppose Proposition 187, trustee Jack T. Fowler 
apologized to the board and residents, saying he behaved like a "jerk." 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to apologize . . . for my outburst at the last meeting, for I may have 
disturbed many of you and even angered some of you," Fowler said during a board 
meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am . . . shamefaced because I lost my temper," Fowler said. "I'm very 
sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler's apology came two weeks after he and three Latino residents exchanged 
heated remarks for nearly 45 minutes when the residents asked the board to 
oppose Proposition 187, which would deny most government services -- including 
education -- to undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler, who continues to support the measure, told residents and the board two 
weeks ago that he believes in the need for a "dominant culture" and that the 
recent flood of illegal immigrants entering the United States has caused 
serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
 When one resident compared his opinions to those of Adolf Hitler, Fowler 
berated her for five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Duarte, who made the comparison, said Wednesday she still believes the 
trustee is a racist and thinks his apology was made only for political reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he meant everything he said before," said Duarte, 40, who immigrated 
from Mexico to Oxnard with her parents when she was 9 years old. "He probably 
talked to school officials and friends and decided to improve his image." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lisa Marie Ruiz, another resident who argued with Fowler, said an apology 
was the least Fowler could do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am glad that he apologized because he verbally abused me during that 
meeting," Ruiz said. "But the right thing for him to do would have been to 
change his mind and oppose Proposition 187, because that is what he owes to the 
children in his district." 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Mary Barreto, a Latina, agreed with Duarte and Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has to be given credit for apologizing, but that was his way of 
manipulating things," Barreto said. "The real apology would have been for him 
to change his mind about Proposition 187 and oppose it." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler, who has been a trustee for 21 years in the Oxnard School District, 
said he has no intention of changing his mind. He has received three letters 
and several telephone calls from residents supporting him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those residents was 79-year-old Catherine Mervyn, a retired teacher and 
an immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a very courageous man to stand up for what he believes, particularly 
when a lot of people in the community oppose the measure," Mervyn said. "Jack 
Fowler is standing up for what is right for America." 
</P>
<P>
 The other board members -- Susan Alvarez, Dorothie Sterling and James Suter -- 
said their respect for Fowler increased after he apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that Jack showed tremendous courage in admitting publicly that he 
had behaved in an unacceptable manner," said Suter, the board president. "Jack 
is the type of person who says what he thinks, and that does not make him a bad 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Fowler's support for the measure, the other four board members voted 
to oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of illegal immigrants who attend classes in the Oxnard 
School District is unknown, about 80% of the district's 13,000-student 
enrollment is Latino. Of that group, 47% speak English as a second language or 
do not speak English, district figures show.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; 2 BUILDINGS, SIGN DESIGNATED AS LANDMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three pre-World War II structures in Fillmore have been designated as 
historical landmarks by the Fillmore City Council, the final approval that sets 
aside the monuments as noteworthy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fillmore sign at the corner of California 126 and Central Avenue, which 
steers motorists to the central business district, joined the art and science 
buildings at Fillmore High School as Ventura County's newest landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign, erected in 1940, is a streamlined, neon-lighted rectangle with 
curved edges that stands at the northeast corner of the intersection. The two 
buildings at Fillmore High, erected in 1939, were built in the 
Mediterranean-style of that era with looming, Moorish entrances. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's other things more than age" that lead to historical-status 
designations, said David Mason, chairman of the Ventura County Cultural 
Heritage Board, which recommended the structures as landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's style, architecture, and what they added to the community in the past," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two buildings and the sign were originally recommended as historical 
landmarks to the board by Fillmore residents, who told members they contributed 
to the personality of the city, Mason said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't too many signs hanging around that look like that," he said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CHILD SUPPORT POSTER TARGETS 12 PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A dozen parents who collectively owe nearly $800,000 in back payments for 
child support are pictured on a "most wanted" poster that has been released by 
the Ventura County district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the annual "deadbeat parents" posters were first released in 1988, they 
have helped authorities locate and arrest 22 parents, Special Assistant Dist. 
Atty.Donald D. Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The posters will be displayed in public buildings throughout the county and in 
businesses and recreational areas, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said the parents listed on the poster are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Larry R. Roberts, whose last known address was Camarillo and who owes 
$150,800 for the support of four children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frances Quintana, of Oxnard, who owes $107,265 for three children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pedro Flores Villarreal, of Santa Paula, $96,186 for four children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jose Luis Leon, of Oxnard, $94,079 for three children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Timothy Steven Lewis, of Costa Mesa, $90,490 for three Ventura County 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ray John Renteria, of Oxnard, $63,614 for four children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Joseph Hernandez, of Oxnard, $45,643 for two children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Miguel Angel Guevara, of Piru, $40,598 for four children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rodolfo Perez Garcia, of Oxnard, $38,454, for two children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gabriel L. Alarcon, of Oxnard, $24,505 for two children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kathleen Papuzza, of Ventura, $23,688 for two children. 
</P>
<P>
 * William Samuel Matuzak, of Simi Valley, $19,529 for one child. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury said the poster is intended to 
"make it clear that it is a crime for a parent to fail to support their 
children." IRA E. STOLL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CANDIDATE CALLS FOR 1-STRIKE SENTENCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to draw a sharp distinction between himself and his opponent on crime 
issues, state Assembly candidate Brooks Firestone on Thursday called for "one 
strike" sentencing for rapists, mandatory inmate labor and further restrictions 
of inmates' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become too permissive" when it comes to crime, said the Republican 
candidate."And if there is the certainty of sure and swift justice and 
penalties, the ultimate result will be less crime and less people in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanked by Ventura County Sheriff Larry Carpenter and other law enforcement 
officials, Firestone announced his plans for tougher penalties for criminals 
during a press conference at the County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone, a Santa Barbara County winery owner, is running against Democrat 
Mindy Lorenz in the 35th District Assembly, representing Ventura, Ojai, Santa 
Paula and most of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone, who has been endorsed by top law enforcement officials in both 
counties, also called Thursday for the death penalty to be used in cases 
involving rapists and child molesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz said some of Firestone's proposals, such as tougher sentencing for 
first-time rapists, truth in sentencing laws and the restriction of inmates' 
rights, have either been signed into law already or have been proposed by 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz, an art history professor, said she does not support the death penalty 
because she does not believe it deters crime, nor does she believe it is fairly 
and justly administered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in favor of life in prison without the possibility of parole," she said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; JANITORS SAY MOUNTAIN LION SPOOKED THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Something spooked the janitors at Arroyo Verde Park one night this week. 
</P>
<P>
 As they were cleaning the park's northernmost restroom late Tuesday, they 
heard an animal growl and knock about in the brush. On closer inspection, they 
discovered they were being watched -- by a cat. 
</P>
<P>
 A big cat. So big, in fact, that they believe it was a mountain lion. And they 
say the big cat stalked them as they moved from one bathroom to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw its shadow and you could tell it was a big animal," said Jose 
Contreras, one of the three janitors who saw the cat. "It didn't sound like a 
coyote. It was growling kind of deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras said he and his co-workers have changed their restroom cleaning 
strategy at Arroyo Verde. They don't go when it's dark. And they never clean 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't taking any chances," Contreras said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reported sighting was enough to prompt Parks Supervisor Jerry Revard to 
visit Arroyo Verde in Ventura on Thursday. He scoured the area where the cat 
was seen, looking for tracks and other traces of mountain lion life. 
</P>
<P>
 Revard, who was unable to verify the sighting, is unconvinced that Contreras 
and the others had a close encounter with a mountain lion. Still, he said, he 
intends to post warning signs at the park and make local schools and Ventura 
College aware of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The reported sighting was the second in Ventura County in as many weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Joe and Margaret Balint reported seeing a mountain lion roaming 
their Santa Rosa Valley neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The sighting alarmed them so much that they circulated flyers to warn their 
neighbors about the incident. They learned that others had also seen the 
animal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really scary looking," Margaret Balint said Thursday. "Fish and Game 
said they don't normally bother people and that they are really afraid of us. 
This one didn't seem to be that afraid." FRED ALVAREZ

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; RESIDENTS' PLEDGES FOR STUDENTS SOUGHT 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura High School officials are inviting residents to pledge money to 
students who will spend Saturday sanding bleachers, digging up the school lawn 
to install sprinklers and doing other odd jobs around the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a program called SERV (Students Earning Revenue for Ventura High 
School), about 400 students are expected to work at least part of Saturday at 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides improving the appearance of the school, the program raises money by 
allowing students to take pledges for each hour that they work and then to 
donate the funds to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past four years, students have raised $50,000 for school clubs, 
classroom materials and cleaning supplies for the school, Assistant Principal 
Larry Emrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as of the middle of this week, students were still working to bring in 
pledges for Saturday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To pledge, call the school at 641-5116. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; GUARD TO GET NEW FIREFIGHTING SYSTEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Air National Guard units will get new forest firefighting systems 
for their C-130 transport planes under a defense spending bill that was 
approved by both houses of Congress Thursday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air National Guard, which operates a base near the Point Mugu Naval Air 
Weapons Station, will see two of its aging airborne firefighting systems 
replaced by new, more powerful units thanks to the defense appropriations bill 
that will soon be placed on President Clinton's desk for signature. 
</P>
<P>
 The new firefighting systems, which disburse large amounts of fire retardant 
at high speed, slide into the cargo bays of the large four-engine military 
transports. The systems will cost an estimated $15 million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The appropriation was spurred by a bill introduced last year by Rep. Elton 
Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who promoted the idea of buying new equipment for the 
guard's aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, Air National Guard crews from the Channel Islands base flew 
nearly 600 firefighting missions over California, Arizona and Idaho, and 
dropped an estimated 1.6-million gallons of fire retardant. J.E. MITCHELL

RATE HIKE OKD FOR CASITAS WATER USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nearly 3,000 residential customers of the Casitas Municipal Water District 
will see a small rate increase beginning Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's board of directors approved the 1.3% rate hike for residential 
customers at a meeting Wednesday.Agricultural users were hit with a 13.6% 
increase, which the board said was part of its policy of bringing rates in line 
with the cost of providing services. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also approved a plan to order 1.63 billion gallons of state water, 
with hopes of selling the water to another agency or city. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in 1996, Casitas' customers in Ojai and western Ventura County will 
see an additional 3% rate hike, which, along with $5 million in bond revenue 
and another $5 million in federal Safe Drinking Water Loans, will pay for the 
construction of a new pressure filtration plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Casitas water, currently treated with chlorine, requires additional treatment 
or filtration to comply with the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, officials 
said. The pressure filtration plant was a lower-cost alternative to a more 
elaborate chemical treatment process, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casitas General Manager John Johnson said the sale of the state water would 
offset at least a portion of the $400,000 a year that Casitas pays to maintain 
its entitlement to the water, which flows through the state's central aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Casitas plans to lease its water along with the city of Ventura, which, like 
Casitas, owns rights to state water it can not acquire because it lacks a 
physical connection to the aqueduct. IRA E. STOLL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; JAILED LEADERS SEEK 'BAIL' IN CHARITY 
LOCKUP

<P>
 Simi Valley City Council candidate Ernie Federer frantically phoned his 
friends Thursday morning, looking for somebody to bail him out with a few 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 But he wasn't in too much trouble, because "jail" was a conference room at the 
Simi Valley Radisson Hotel with plenty of coffee and pastries. 
</P>
<P>
 Federer and a dozen other Simi Valley residents let themselves be locked up 
for charity on Thursday to raise money for the mid-coast chapter of the 
Muscular Dystrophy Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting around a table in the hotel, Federer, along with Fire Chief James 
Sewell and several local business people, helped raise about $5,000 for the 
organization. They volunteered after receiving a call from chapter director Liz 
Kelleher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called them and said, 'We have a warrant for your arrest for being 
criminally big-hearted,"' she said. "I think it's fun to be playful with the 
whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Capt. Ken Maffei, who heads the local firefighters' association, raised 
more than $600 in less than half an hour by calling fire stations. He said he 
was getting extra donations to help out Sewell, who is new to the area and was 
worried about raising enough money. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Tashima, a customer service representative for the Bank of A. Levy, was 
also raising money at a quick pace, but was short of the $500 mark as her hour 
was coming up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are avoiding my call," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Tashima's friends pledged $500 to keep her in jail for a little longer, 
Kelleher said. Tashima said she enjoyed the event, even taking home a mock 
mug-shot of herself complete with booking number under her chin. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great way to help out," she said, holding a phone and filling out 
another pledge card. SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; TEACHERS ENDORSE 2 BOARD CANDIDATES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Educators Assn., which represents about 700 teachers in Simi Valley, 
has endorsed school board candidates Sharon Hushka and Carla Kurachi, 
association officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hushka and Kurachi are among six candidates vying for two seats on the Simi 
Valley Unified School District Board of Education in the Nov. 8 
election.Kurachi, the current board president, is the only incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of teachers interviewed five candidates last week, asking 
questions about their educational philosophies, goals, priorities and personal 
strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Other candidates interviewed were the Rev. Norman Walker, Glenn Woodbury and 
Jacquie Richardson. Candidate Janice DiFatta declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Association President Ron Myren said Hushka and Kurachi were selected for 
their commitments to education and their leadership skills. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time that the association has endorsed Kurachi, having 
supported her for the school board race in 1990. A part-time counselor at Cal 
State Northridge, Kurachi said the endorsement is a significant boon to her 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really means a lot to me," she said. "I take it as a vote of faith." 
</P>
<P>
 A homemaker and community activist, Hushka said she was pleased by the 
teachers' show of support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that I am the candidate representative of the students and teachers, 
and that I have an understanding of the needs of the school community," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates cited school safety and budget constraints as key issues in 
the election. Whoever fills the school board seats will inherit about a 
$3-million district deficit. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: HUSBAND SETS HOUSE AFIRE AFTER QUARREL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A marital dispute shook a sleeping Oak Park neighborhood awake when a suicidal 
husband doused himself with gasoline and set his house afire before falling 
from a second-story window early Thursday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critically injured from smoke inhalation was Richard Rose, 37, a tile and 
stone salesman who, sheriff's deputies said, had threatened his wife and two 
neighbors on Pesto Way after they tried to pacify him just before midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They probably saved his life, and hers, too," said Sheriff's Detective Matt 
Findlay of the neighbors who had come to the aid of Rose's wife, Robin. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, who Findlay said was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, was 
under deputies' guard at Westlake Community Medical Center. Spokeswoman Kris 
Carraway said he was in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Findlay said Rose, while quarreling with his wife in the garage, waved a claw 
hammer at her and at Hamid Babaeian, 31, a neighbor with whom Rose had been 
drinking earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Rose then took a one-gallon gasoline can into the house and doused the 
furniture and other contents before lighting them. Findlay said Rose then 
tossed gas onto Fred Greenstein, 36, another neighbor who had joined Babaeian 
in trying to smother flames by the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Greenstein, whom Rose also threatened with a seven-inch kitchen knife, 
escaped without injury after he tried unsuccessfully to talk Rose into leaving 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, which county firefighters declared extinguished about 12:43 a.m., 
caused about $30,000 in damage to the stucco house, mostly on the second floor, 
county fire dispatcher Annie Ironside said. GREG RIPPEE

SIMI PLANNERS BACK PLAN FOR RECREATION COMPLEX; DEVELOPMENT: THE $20-MILLION 
ICEOPLEX PROJECT CALLS FOR AN ICE-SKATING RINK, BILLIARDS PARLOR, VIDEO ARCADE 
AND FOOD COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An exhausted Simi Valley Planning Commission endorsed a major new recreation 
and shopping complex early Thursday after discounting the threat of a 
catastrophic flood and embracing the idea that local teen-agers need more to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners heard from 50 speakers and spent until 2:45 a.m. before voicing 
their support for the 180,000-square-foot complex planned for Royal Avenue and 
Madera Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhaustion kept the commissioners from rewriting the proposal to their 
satisfaction, so their final vote on the project was delayed until early next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commissioners dealt with all the major issues that stood in the way of 
approval, including neighborhood concerns on noise, traffic, and a city 
ordinance that prevents construction in an area that would be deluged if Bard 
Dam broke. 
</P>
<P>
 During seven hours of public debate, residents who live near the project site 
said the complex would bring too much noise and traffic and argued that the 
complex should be scaled back or tossed out entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 But dozens of Simi Valley's teen-agers and other young residents told the 
commissioners that they had to leave the city to have fun. They 
enthusiastically endorsed the project, which calls for an ice rink, billiards 
parlor, video arcade and food court. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the major sticking points for the $20-million project was concern it 
would violate a city policy prohibiting construction in the flood path of the 
29-year-old Bard Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners told the commission that a breach in the earthen dam could send 
3 billion gallons of water rushing toward Madera Road, leaving nothing but a 
swath of dirt in its path. 
</P>
<P>
 "Development at the site would cease to exist," planner Laura Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners agreed that approval of the Iceoplex project would mean a shift 
in city policy, and they proposed rewriting guidelines to allow construction of 
commercial property in the flood path. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Calleguas Municipal Water District said there is virtually no 
risk that the dam would fail catastrophically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be more concerned about the ozone layer," General Manager Donald Kendall 
said. "We've got safety measures in place that ensure that kind of failure 
would never happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Michael Piper said he would be uncomfortable allowing residences 
to be built in the flood path, but commercial developments such as the proposed 
sports complex would be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 For the residents living in an area already plagued by traffic noise from 
Madera Road, fears of flooding were secondary to concerns over the clamor from 
a 24-hour shopping and skating center that's been proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Already we get a lot of noise from Madera, and now we're talking about a 
six-lane road and a complex open all night," said Theresa Berenger, chairwoman 
of the region's neighborhood council. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three commissioners hearing the proposal, Piper, Sherida Simmons and 
Dean Kunicki, said noise would increase in the area with or without the 
project. Commissioner Robert Swoish was absent and Commissioner Dave McCormick 
abstained from the hearing because he lives in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Simmons said, if the project goes through the developer would pay for 
improvements such as the road widening and traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers told the commission they could not control noise from passing cars, 
but they would employ security guards to limit noise from outside their 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sports center would not only be a good neighbor, they said, it would help 
keep teen-agers off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just talking about a skating rink," said Brad Berman, president of 
Iceoplex, a company that runs a similar center in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex would include an array of services and activities for children and 
adults, including restaurants, shops, medical offices, a gym, pool hall and a 
video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the growing popularity of ice-skating and hockey in Southern 
California, supporters said the rink should draw hundreds of local children. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first year, the Iceoplex in North Hills drew 150 youths for its hockey 
league, said Larry Bruyere, head of the hockey program in North Hills. By the 
third year they had 600 youths and a waiting list nearly as long, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just a fad for kids around here," Bruyere said. "It's a major 
addition to recreation, and we need to give them a place to play." 
</P>
<P>
 If the project is approved by the City Council next month, the head of 
Camarillo-based Ventura Pacific Capital Co. said the company hopes to open the 
center by November, 1995.

WASTE CONVERSION COMPANY AGREES TO RELOCATE; DISPUTE: FIRM SAYS IT WILL MOVE TO 
REMOTE SITE WITHIN 18 MONTHS. NEIGHBORS, WHO COMPLAIN OF ODOR, RODENTS AND 
DUST, REMAIN SKEPTICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Owners of an eastern Ventura County company that uses worms to convert yard 
waste into fertilizer said Thursday that neighbors' complaints about rats, 
noxious odors and clouds of dust have forced the company to look for a more 
remote location. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for the Worm Concern announced at a county hearing Wednesday evening 
that the company plans to move from its location on Tierra Rejada Road within 
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 But company President Richard Morhar said Thursday that he could not make any 
guarantees as to keeping to schedule. "We want to move," Morhar said. "We have 
a long-range plan for growth, and we'd like to find a site that would allow us 
to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if it costs too much, or we can't find the right site, it could take a 
couple of years," he said. "It's definitely a possibility, though. Everything 
here is mobile." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they are skeptical that the company will move with 18 months. 
And even if it relocates as planned, they want the problems of dust, smell and 
rodents resolved immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smell is just horrendous," said Mary Haus, who owns and operates a nearby 
Arabian horse breeding ranch. "It's too much to take for another year." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the waste company plans to relocate, it must still begin a 
thorough environmental analysis of its current operation by the end of the year 
or risk having the county shut it down, planning officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Worm Concern has operated for nearly three years without a permit, under a 
compliance agreement with the county that expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Morhar said he has balked so far at doing a detailed environmental impact 
report because its estimated $200,000 cost could put the company out of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 If the firm had to close, it would jeopardize the recycling efforts of 
Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Moorpark, he said, noting that all cities under 
state law must limit the amount of trash they send to landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The state requires that cities reduce the amount of trash they send to area 
landfills 25% by 1995 and 50% by 2000. Because "green waste," or trash from 
lawn and garden clippings, makes up as much as 30% of the trash that is sent to 
landfills, recycling that waste would go a long way in helping cities meet the 
state mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Worm Concern accepts about 100 tons of green waste a day, much of it 
coming from a curbside recycling program in Simi Valley. They plan to bring in 
as much as 350 tons a day when similar programs in Thousand Oaks and Moorpark 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County planning director will rule within 30 days if the company 
must complete a full environmental impact report, said Lynne Kada, a county 
planner. Kada said county officials are reviewing the company's plan to reduce 
the odor and rebuttal to health concerns raised by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Racicot, an environmental consultant working for the company, said using 
worms to turn green waste into fertilizer is an evolving science. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's new," he said. "We need new kinds of regulation to deal with the 
operation. It's like recycling glass and aluminum. Now we're recycling green 
waste, and the county is still figuring out how to deal with that." 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors contend that the Worm Concern is simply a money-making dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've gotten all this positive press because they say they're doing 
something good for the environment," said James Hagman, who runs Elvenstar 
Farms, a riding school next to the Worm Concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the big joke," he said. "They're operating an unregulated, 
un-permitted dump." Hagman estimates that he has spent about $10,000 on a 
lawyer and political consultant to put pressure on the county to force the Worm 
Concern to conduct a full environmental review of its operation.  
</P>
<P>
 Hagman said he plans to organize the neighbors and file a class-action lawsuit 
to shut down the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 He stressed he has nothing against the concept of recycling yard waste. "It's 
a good idea if it was in the right location and with the right safeguards," he 
said. "But it's not acceptable here."

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL CANDIDATES TARGET LOCAL ISSUES AT FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The issues were growth, traffic, crime and the neighborhood's relations with 
the rest of Thousand Oaks. And the City Council candidates on hand were 
stepping up their efforts to woo the vote in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 They tested their stump speeches Wednesday night during a 2 1/2-hour forum 
before two dozen Newbury Park residents. While the voters scribbled notes, each 
candidate addressed issues of local concern, mindful that Newbury Park could 
carry considerable clout in the upcoming election. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park's voter turnout has traditionally been lower than other regions 
of Thousand Oaks, such as the central city and Westlake. But some candidates 
expect more people to hit the ballot booths this year, because of high interest 
in issues such as the Broome Ranch parkland, Dos Vientos residential tract and 
the Seventh-day Adventist shopping mall development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a very large group of people out here who are feeling very 
disenfranchised, very bitter, very vocal," local activist Diane Doria said. 
"It's going to be a very tight race." 
</P>
<P>
 And with more than 26,000 residents -- nearly one-quarter of the city's 
population -- no would-be politician can afford to ignore Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every vote, of course, is important," dentist Greg Cole said. In winning past 
elections to the Republican Central Committee and the Ventura Community College 
District Board, Cole said he has always tried to draw support from Newbury 
Park. And he plans to continue that effort. 
</P>
<P>
 But he will have plenty of competition, as Wednesday night's forum made clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The first question put to the candidates was bluntly parochial: "What is the 
biggest issue facing Newbury Park, and what would you do about it if elected?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In response, nearly every candidate mentioned the huge Dos Vientos 
development, which will bring 2,350 residences to a rolling ranch just a few 
hundred yards from state and federal parkland. They then went on to describe 
their pet projects for Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole spoke of the region's notoriously gridlocked intersections and said he 
would like to rethink the local traffic flows and strengthen infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar vein, incumbent Judy Lazar and former councilman Lee Laxdal both 
argued that the city must continue to expand its economic base to keep the 
money flowing for public works fix-it projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounding his key campaign theme, firefighter Andy Fox talked about fighting 
crime through stronger Neighborhood Watch programs and more police patrols. 
Meanwhile, homicide detective Michael Markey and real estate broker Chuck Morsa 
promised to fight for more sports facilities and after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired businessman Marshall Dixon emphasized the need to link Newbury Park 
with the rest of Thousand Oaks, and put an end to the "us-against-them state of 
mind, (which is) probably the biggest problem to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the opposite tack, incumbent Elois Zeanah urged residents to secede and 
form an independent city if they remain dissatisfied with their elected 
officials. "You have the financial base, with the Rancho Conejo Industrial 
Park," she said, shaking her fist as if rallying her troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah has already won an endorsement from the local slow-growth group 
Residents to Preserve Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In flyers circulating through the neighborhood, the group has also backed 
retired filmmaker M. Ali Issari and city Operations Manager David Hare, who 
sent his mother, Barbara, to represent him at the forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of Residents to Preserve Newbury Park will not identify the group's 
members or estimate its size. But one spokeswoman, Michelle Koetke, said she is 
convinced her group will be able to marshal votes for the slow-growth slate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newbury Park has turned the tide a number of times," Koetke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating the positions that won them the endorsement, Zeanah and Issari 
Wednesday swore to defend Newbury Park from more malls, more housing and more 
bulldozers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laxdal, who co-authored Thousand Oaks' growth-control ordinance, took a 
similar approach, telling the gathering: "It's time again for the homeowners to 
take over the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Such tough-on-development stances win praise from the dozens of residents who 
routinely pack council hearings on projects such as the Dos Vientos housing 
tract and the Seventh-day Adventist shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilwoman Lazar, angling for support from more moderate voters, 
insisted that the city needs steady growth to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we have a strong economic base, we're not going to have any 
(development projects) to worry about in Newbury Park because the unemployment 
lines are going to get longer and property values will fall," Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could tell you that I will vote for everything that anyone in Newbury Park 
wants, but that would be wrong," Lazar added. "Council members represent the 
entire city." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one candidate -- salesman Ekbal Quidwai -- suggested changing that system 
of broad representation by carving the city into districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be parochial about Newbury Park," said Quidwai, who lives in the 
neighborhood. "We have gotten the shaft from the very beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 The other council candidates are financial services manager Michael Friedman, 
public access television producer Jeannette Scovill, Planning Commissioner 
Irving Wasserman, mobile carwash owner Lance Winslow, and mortgage broker Bill 
Williams, who did not attend the forum.

MATER DEI DOMINATES IRVINE, 28-8; FOOTBALL: MONARCHS ROLL UP 409 YARDS, LIMIT 
VAQUEROS TO ONE FIRST DOWN IN SECOND HALF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine Coach Terry Henigan was livid after Mater Dei, ranked second in the 
county, administered a 28-8 beating to the eighth-ranked Vaqueros in a 
nonleague football game Thursday at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Henigan angry at his defense?  
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (4-0) rolled up 409 total yards of offense with running back Steve 
Bodnar rushing for 152 yards in 21 carries, scoring two touchdowns, and 
quarterback John Flynn completing nine of 17 passes for 185 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Or was the Irvine coach upset at his offense? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, a stingy Mater Dei defense limited the Vaqueros to one first down in the 
second half and 31 yards rushing in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Irvine (2-2) played Mater Dei tough for a half, Henigan will likely 
only remember the Monarchs' final touchdown scored by Bodnar, one minute into 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ball at the Irvine 43, Bodnar took a pitch from Flynn and headed 
around the right end. After stiff-arming one Irvine defender, a great block 
from wide receiver David Castleton sprung Bodnar up the right sideline, 
untouched, for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 What Henigan didn't like was Bodnar's alleged antics before he reached the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He taunted us," Henigan said. "If one of my players does something like that, 
he's on the bench. (Bodnar) stayed in the game, but I guess that's just a 
difference in philosophies." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said he didn't see the end of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what (Henigan) is so upset about," Rollinson said. "Well, look 
at the scoreboard." 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the Monarchs were in complete control. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei took a 10-0 lead in the first half on Bodnar's first touchdown run 
and a field goal by Patrick Shinnefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar's 40-yard run set up his two-yard touchdown run with 1 minute 21 
seconds remaining in the first quarter. On the Monarchs' next possession, they 
moved 58 yards in eight plays and Shinnefield connected on a 50-yard field 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine made it close on its next series, scoring on a perfectly executed 
shovel pass from Scott Larsen to Jeff Walker, who caught six passes for 109 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker caught the pass at the line of scrimmage, broke Kevin Donahue's 
attempted tackle, and raced 51 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-point conversion pass from Ryan Phelps to Jamie Bertolli cut Mater Dei's 
lead to 10-8, but that was Irvine's last highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's offense sputtered although Larsen completed 11 of 19 passes for 146 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mater Dei offense continued to roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Joey Trampush, who rushed for 68 yards in 10 carries, had a one-yard 
touchdown run with 39 seconds remaining in the third quarter, and Flynn's 
scramble around right end for a two-point conversion made it 21-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Rod Perry caught four passes from Flynn for 100 yards, balancing 
the Monarch attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, our kicker and the defense gave us great field position," Flynn said. 
"They did a great job too."

 The 16-0 victory over Kansas City, the verbal sparring between Anthony Newman 
and Andre Rison and the chance for the Rams to top the .500 mark at this point 
in the season for the first time since 1989 have not been enough to move fans 
to report to Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The team announced Thursday that 39,194 tickets remain for Sunday's game 
against the Falcons, which means fewer than 30,000 tickets have been 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams drew 56,479 two weeks ago for the game against San Francisco and 
32,969 for the regular-season opener against Arizona.

<P>
 Joe Kelly, former Raider linebacker, knows something about rivalries and trash 
talk. The Falcons vs. the Rams is not a rivalry, Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you lose 31-13 it's not a rivalry," Kelly said. "Denver and the Raiders, 
now that's a rivalry. We're talking wars, winning on the final kick year in and 
year out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just exchanging words through the media isn't a rivalry. It's a joke to 
Atlanta -- we lose, 31-13. We have to do something on the field before it's a 
rivalry."

 Starting right guard Leo Goeas was unable to practice because of a sore ankle, 
and his replacement, Chuck Belin, had to take a break for a second consecutive 
day because of an asthma attack. Brad Fichtel, who is on the practice squad and 
ineligible to play Sunday, got the bulk of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said he is counting on Goeas' return.

 Defensive lineman Jay Williams, who failed to make it with Miami and who had 
been on Green Bay's practice squad, joined the Rams' practice squad.

Williams. T.J. SIMERS

 Jerry Van Dyke, Craig T. Nelson's co-star on the television series, "Coach," 
isn't too keen on Nelson's avocation as a race car driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said Van Dyke told him, "Why, after 50 years and I've finally made it, 
did you decide to take up racing? Because if you go, I go."  
</P>
<P>
 Nelson will drive in a sports car race Saturday in Phoenix and Van Dyke will 
keep his fingers crossed. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who kicked the winning field goal for UCLA in its 25-22 upset of 
Washington at Seattle in 1990? 
</P>
<P>
 Not now: Craig Ludwig, a defenseman for the Dallas Stars who has scored six 
goals in his last five NHL seasons, on scoring in Dallas' opening exhibition 
game:  
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of timing is that? When you score once a year, you hate to see it 
happen during the exhibition season." 
</P>
<P>
 Tougher opponent: Marvis Frazier, who retired from the ring in 1988 with a 
record of 21-2, has been ordained a Pentecostal minister in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little bit nervous beforehand, but I figured preaching couldn't be as 
hard as facing Larry Holmes or Mike Tyson," Frazier said of the only two men 
who beat him in the ring as a professional. "Then again, now I'm fighting the 
devil and those two can't be badder than the devil, can they?" 
</P>
<P>
 New math?Mark Kriegel in the New York Daily News: "Tony Casillas passed up a 
$6-million, four-year deal with a legitimate Super Bowl contender, the Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives back his $1.2-million signing bonus. Then he cuts a 13-game deal 
worth $535,000 with the Jets. They say he passed the physical. But what about 
the mental?" 
</P>
<P>
 Touch 'em all: Dodger outfielder Billy Ashley, who batted .345 with 37 home 
runs and 105 runs batted in last season for Albuquerque, on his relationship 
with batting coach Reggie Smith:  
</P>
<P>
 "He once told me he was going to get me to the major leagues or get me into an 
insane asylum. I think I've been to both already." 
</P>
<P>
 Status quo: Kevin Paul Dupont of the Boston Globe assessing NHL Commissioner 
Gary Bettman: "Personally, I don't care about his style. He can be dictatorial, 
curt and somewhat condescending. So what? Again, the workplace is full of those 
guys.  
</P>
<P>
 "Try to find a commissioner with all the right stuff and you get what baseball 
has: Bud Selig, a .161 hitter, hoping to foul enough off, praying that he can 
get hit by a pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1927, Babe Ruth hit his 60th home run of the 
season in the eighth inning against Tom Zachary, leading the New York Yankees 
to a 4-2 victory over the Washington Senators. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Brad Daluiso.

two years have been Mike Piazza and Billy Ashley. I think I'm going to have a

 Looking at different schemes and lineups has been a priority for the Raiders 
during their bye week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been accomplishing what we wanted," Coach Art Shell said. "We've taken 
a look at what our tendencies are, along with different things we may have 
gotten away from. We've gone back to some things we did in training camp and 
other things," 
</P>
<P>
 With defensive tackle Willie Broughton returning from an injury and the 
emergence of rookie linebacker Rob Fredrickson, the Raiders worked with 
different lineups this week. Rookie linebacker James Folston and running backs 
Calvin Jones and Jarrod Bunch, who have been inactive so far this season, have 
received more practice time this week. LONNIE WHITE

 Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Assn., visited the Raiders' 
El Segundo training headquarters Wednesday to answer player questions about the 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first year of the system," he said, "and there are so many 
misconceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 Criticized for accepting a cap system, Upshaw feels vindicated somewhat by the 
similar demands being made by baseball and hockey owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can paint stripes on a donkey and call it a zebra," Upshaw said, "but 
it's still a donkey. You can call it revenue enhancement, but it's still (a 
cap). Our guys are playing. We didn't cancel our season." STEVE SPRINGER

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: HOW FOX CORNERED THE MARKET BY GIVING NFL TIME AND 
SCORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most talked-about aspects of Fox's first season of NFL football has 
been that little graphic in the upper left corner with the score, quarter and 
time remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a story behind it, involving a production executive named Marc Yobs, 
who was killed in the Northridge earthquake Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Graphics was one of the first orders of business for David Hill when he became 
the president of Fox sports last December. The self-assured Hill knew what he 
wanted, which besides the all-the-time score was an overall look that would 
take Fox sports into television's future, with its 500 channels, interactive 
capabilities and on-line computer services. 
</P>
<P>
 He met with dozens of companies that design graphics and selected Autographics 
of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Autographics is associated with the Post Group, a major Hollywood production 
company. Fred Rheinstein owns the Post Group, along with 14 other companies, as 
well as the studio where Roy Firestone and Jim Rome do their shows for ESPN and 
ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
 Rheinstein's daughter, Linda, owns Autographics. She has worked for and with 
the three major network sports divisions for more than 20 years, so she knows 
Fox's new executive sports producer, Ed Goren, who came over from CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Yobs, Fred Rheinstein's assistant, suggested to Linda Rheinstein that her 
company and the Post Group go after the Fox account. 
</P>
<P>
 She called Goren and asked to meet with him and Hill. A meeting, which was 
also to include Yobs, was scheduled for Super Bowl week in Atlanta, and she and 
Yobs began working on a presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 But tragedy struck on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The showplace hillside home in Sherman Oaks that Yobs, 32, shared with his 
girlfriend, Karen Osterhold, 30, slid down the hill during the quake. Both were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Rheinstein went to Atlanta anyway and asked that the meeting be 
postponed. She needed more time and, of course, they gave it to her. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the Super Bowl, she met with Hill and Goren in Los Angeles. They 
were impressed with the presentation, and her company got the account. 
</P>
<P>
 Rheinstein's people now work closely with Fox's in-house graphics specialist, 
Jane Pryor, whom Hill hired. Pryor had previously worked for Hill in England 
and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the whole look of Fox sports might be different had it not been for Marc 
Yobs and his urging that Rheinstein try for the account. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add graphics: What did Rheinstein and her creative director, Chris Liberty, 
who would be the one to design the graphics, think when they first heard that 
Hill wanted to put the score and time remaining on the screen and leave them 
there? 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction was, 'This man is brilliant,' " Rheinstein said. "Has a 
little graphic ever gotten so much attention? Also, the graphic serves as a 
logo for Fox. Whenever you watch NFL highlights and you see that graphic, you 
know it's Fox." 
</P>
<P>
 That was Hill's thinking exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we do is with the future in mind," Hill said. "When there are 500 
channels, it will be very important to brand your product so it is immediately 
recognizable." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it seems viewers are becoming more accustomed to the graphic. One thing 
for sure, it beats not having the score put up enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Try watching "Monday Night Football" in a noisy bar and see how long it takes 
before you see the score. It seems like forever.

 Raider radio commentator Bob Chandler, who has also been doing sports for

 End of an era: Firestone's "Up Close" show, formerly "SportsLook," has been a 
fixture for nearly 14 years, first at the USA network, and at ESPN for the last 
11. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Firestone is about to move on. Although nothing is final, Firestone said 
the plan is for him to cease doing the daily show at the end of the year but 
continue with ESPN and do prime-time specials every six weeks, and other 
projects as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of doing 250 interviews a year, I'll be interviewing 40 of the 
biggest names in sports," Firestone said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had to leave the daily show because he is developing a late-night 
show for another network. 
</P>
<P>
 In line to replace Firestone on "Up Close" is ESPN's Chris Myers. 
</P>

<P>
 A feature on ESPN's "GameDay" takes a look at the Darryl Henley situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ram cornerback, facing charges of cocaine possession and conspiracy to 
sell, tells ESPN free-lancer Greg Garber, who is also a reporter for the 
Hartford Courant, "Eventually everything that is said has to be accounted for, 
and I don't think I've blinked in this whole thing and I'm not blinking now." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he is saying he is not guilty, Henley says, "I'm saying I'm not 
blinking." 
</P>
<P>
 The feature focuses on the question of whether Henley is getting preferential 
treatment by being allowed to play. Says Times writer T.J. Simers, who covers 
the Rams and was interviewed for the piece, "If Charles Manson was available 
and could get the weekends off and could catch the ball deep, I think there 
would be spot for him here." 
</P>

 Belle gems: Jim Rome recently went to Cleveland to do an interview with the 
Indians' Albert Belle, and it will run this weekend as the "Sunday night 
conversation" segment on ESPN's "SportsCenter." 
</P>
<P>
 Belle, asked if he used a corked bat, says, "I don't need to use a corked 
bat." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he was worried that if he wins the American League MVP award people 
would say he won it because he used a corked bat, Belle says, "No, because how 
do we know Babe Ruth didn't use a corked bat? He hit in bigger ballparks than I 
did." TV-Radio Notes

 If the NHL season does not start on schedule because of a lockout this 
weekend, ESPN2 will fill the air time with karate, minor league hockey and 
rodeo. . . . NBC announced that it drew higher ratings for its coverage of the 
AFC in September than Fox did for the NFC and also that it won the season's 
first month for the first time in 15 years. NBC claimed an average rating of 
11.8 after four weeks and said Fox's rating after three weeks was an 11.1. But 
Fox's David Hill pointed out that the second half-hour of its one-hour pregame 
show beat NBC's half-hour show, 5.0 to 3.9. Also, Fox's show is getting higher 
ratings than CBS' "NFL Today" did. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is apparently a first, Fox will use an active player as a commentator 
Sunday. With the Kansas City Chiefs in a bye week, Marcus Allen will work the 
Detroit-Tampa Bay regional telecast with New York play-by-play announcer Tim 
Breen. Does this mean Allen might retire to join Fox next year? "No, I haven't 
given retirement any consideration at this point," Allen said. If he does end 
up with Fox someday, it might be fun to hear him work a Raider game, although 
he said, "I've put all that stuff with the Raiders behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fox game here Sunday is Philadelphia at San Francisco, with Pat Summerall 
and John Madden. The NBC game is the New York Jets at Cleveland, with Marv 
Albert and Paul Maguire. . . . The road team has won every week in the first 
four weeks of Sunday night NFL football on TNT. That figures to continue with 
Miami at Cincinnati this Sunday. . . . Versatile Chris Marlowe, best known for 
his work on beach volleyball, did a nice job on football play-by-play for Prime 
Ticket last Saturday on the San Diego State-Colorado State game. It was his 
first try at football play-by-play. . . . Ann Liguori has an interesting 
interview with new Philadelphia 76er Coach John Lucas on her "Sports Innerview" 
program on Prime Ticket Tuesday at 6:30 p.m.

 Tapes of the Jim Healy tribute that KMPC ran on Aug. 24 are being sold for 
$12, with proceeds going to the American Cancer Society's programs for kids

Golden and Doug Krikorian will be reunited on KABC Saturday, 7-9 p.m. They will

GOLF ROUNDUP; OBSCURE ROOKIE TAKES SOUTHERN OPEN LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Barranger, an obscure winless rookie, matched his low round of the year 
with a seven-under-par 65 Thursday to take a one-shot lead in the opening round 
of the Buick Southern Open in Pine Mountain, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Barranger, a graduate of the 1993 tour qualifying school, held his lead over 
Australian Steve Elkington, Steve Lamontagne and Jim McGovern, who had two 
eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 Barranger birdied two of the first three holes when his approach shots hit the 
pin, stopping two feet shy on No. 1 and one foot on No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great way to start the day and it just kind of continued throughout 
the day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging his obscurity, Barranger said, "I don't really expect people to 
know who I am, but hopefully by Sunday they'll know who I am quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 Tied at 67 were New England Classic winner Kenny Perry, Mike Donald, Stan 
Utley, Mike Brisky and Canadian Richard Zokol. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Azinger, who missed most of the season because of lymphoma in his right 
shoulder, shot a 71 in his first competitive round since the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending Southern Open champion John Inman shot a 73. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pearl Sinn, a non-winner in four years on the LPGA tour, birdied seven holes 
in putting together a five-under-par 67 for a two-stroke lead in the first 
round of the Heartland Classic in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinn, from UCLA, led a parade of little-known golfers at the top of the leader 
board. Nancy Harvey, 113th in earnings, and Lenore Rittenhouse (145th) were at 
69 along with Meg Mallon. 
</P>
<P>
 Liselotte Neumann, Jane Geddes, Susan Thielbar and Janet Anderson were at 70. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A course-record 68 by U.S. Amateur champion Wendy Ward powered the United 
States into a two-stroke lead at the Women's World Amateur Championships in 
Saint-Quentin-En-Yvelines, France. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Ingram of Nashville, Tenn., shot a 73 as the Americans finished the 36 
holes at six-under-par 282. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie Webb, a 19-year-old Australian, matched Ward's record 68 and led her 
team into second place.

<P>
 Duke forward Grant Hill, the third pick in the NBA draft, signed a 
$45-million, eight-year contract Thursday with the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty weird," he said. "But it's the way things are going. I guess a 
couple years from now a rookie will be coming in here making more than I am."

 Hill helped Duke win two NCAA championships and led the Blue Devils to a 
runner-up finish to Arkansas last spring.

 Michigan guard Jalen Rose, the 13th player picked in the draft, signed a

 The Chicago Bulls signed free-agent forwards Greg Foster and Jud Buechler to 
one-year contracts.

Greece last season. Buechler, a four-year NBA veteran, spent the last two 
seasons with Golden State.

 Free-agent center Charles Shackleford, who played in Italy last season, has

<P>
 A major hurdle was cleared for Glen Taylor's proposal to buy the Timberwolves 
when the Metropolitan Sports Facilities Commission approved a lease for the 
Target Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for a $54-million public buyout of the Target Center, to be 
paid off over the 30-year term of the lease by a ticket tax.

 The team was set to move to New Orleans until Taylor offered $88.5 million to 
keep the Timberwolves in Minneapolis.

The Mavericks have said they hope to have Tarpley signed by the start of 
training camp. Tarpley drew what was termed a lifetime suspension on Oct. 16, 
1991, when he became a third-time offender of the league's drug program.

THERE FOR ALL TO SEE: AUBURN STILL PERFECT; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: TIGERS EXTEND 
WINNING STREAK TO 16 GAMES WITH 41-14 ROUT OF KENTUCKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Bowden still hasn't lost as Auburn's coach. Bill Curry still hasn't 
figured out how to beat the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninth-ranked Auburn made a successful return to national television, extending 
the nation's longest Division I-A winning streak to 16 games with a 41-14 rout 
of struggling Kentucky on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the victories have come under Bowden, who has yet to lose as a 
major-college coach. This one may have taken on more importance because it came 
with the rest of the country watching and the Tigers hoping to make a big 
impression for the poll voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn (5-0, 3-0 in the Southeastern Conference) was barred from TV last year 
by NCAA probation, but the blackout was lifted this season. Two of the Tigers' 
first four games were shown regionally, but Thursday's telecast was their first 
national exposure since 1992 -- the last time they lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the game was all that impressive in the second half," said 
Bowden, asked what kind of impact the Tigers made on the rest of the country. 
"We played a lot of people. Whether it was impressive or not, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Curry, meanwhile, has the Kentucky program headed in the opposite direction. 
The Wildcats (1-4, 0-3) lost their fourth in a row and Curry's record against 
Auburn, as a coach with Georgia Tech, Alabama and Kentucky, fell to 0-11. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a very frustrated team," said Curry, whose team is heading toward its 
fifth consecutive season without a winning record under his guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden's father, Florida State Coach Bobby Bowden, also was at the game, but 
his advice wasn't needed. Auburn, in fact, barely needed need to bring its 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Alvis returned an interception 37 yards for a touchdown, his second score 
of the season and fourth for the Auburn secondary, and Mike Pelton fell on two 
Kentucky fumbles, one in the end zone for a touchdown, the other at the Wildcat 
two to set up a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our defense would just give us the ball, we might score a little bit," 
quarterback Patrick Nix joked. "But I'm not complaining. I hope they keep doing 
it the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn attempted two passes on its first series and failed to gain a first 
down, then seemed to remember that Kentucky was surrendering an average of 321 
yards per game on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers ran nine straight times on their next possession, with Stephen 
Davis gaining 53 yards in five carries and Joe Frazier getting 27 in three 
before Patrick Nix scored on a one-yard quarterback sneak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a game where we took control early and never let go," Bowden said. "By 
halftime, the way we were running the football and playing defense, I felt like 
we had the game under control."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; ROBINSON DECRIES TEAM'S SLOW STARTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Robinson, sounding disgusted with the early-game softness of his defense, 
put a new twist on it the other day.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, at his weekly media luncheon, the USC coach looked around the room 
and said, "I could take eleven people from this room . . . and with two days' 
practice, this team could go right down the field and score on our defense." 
</P>
<P>
 In three games, Penn State and Baylor have scored on their first possessions 
against USC, Washington on its second.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither wide receiver Ed Hervey nor tailback Leonard Green will play Saturday 
against Oregon, Robinson said Thursday. Hervey has a knee injury and although 
Green's pulled hamstring has apparently healed, Robinson said he isn't yet in 
playing condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be happy if they're both ready for the Stanford game (Oct. 15)," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson also said that Kyle Ramsay would start in place of freshman guard 
Phalen Pounds, who had arthroscopic surgery Tuesday night to remove torn 
cartilage in his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Oregon Coach Rich Brooks announced that quarterback Danny O'Neil would 
sit out this week's game because of finger surgery, it reminded Robinson of a 
play O'Neil made in last season's 24-13 Trojan victory at Oregon.  
</P>
<P>
 "O'Neil threw an interception, one of our kids was returning it, and O'Neil 
was in a rage," Robinson said. "He tackled our guy right in front of me, turned 
him upside down and tried to steal the ball back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't talking to anyone in particular, but I said, 'That's the damnedest 
thing I ever saw -- I don't think I ever saw a quarterback do that.'  
</P>
<P>
 "O'Neil jumped up and said: 'Thanks, Coach,' and ran off." EARL GUSTKEY

FAIRPLEX; BRADSHAW CONTINUES HIS SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The smart bettors are beginning to take notice whenever trainer Randy Bradshaw 
enters a horse at Fairplex Park. 
</P>
<P>
 When Oncefortheroad won a stretch duel for a head victory over Fandarel Dancer 
in the $50,000 Gateway To Glory Stakes in the 12th race Thursday, it was 
Bradshaw's fourth victory in six races. 
</P>
<P>
 His other starters have finished second and fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fourth place was this horse," Bradshaw said of Oncefortheroad, who ran 
fourth in the Beau Brummel. "He stumbled at the start of that race and it cost 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no such bad luck Thursday in the 1 1/16-mile race for 2-year-olds. 
Only five horses went to the post after Ichor was a late scratch, and there was 
plenty of speed in the race to set it up for the late-running Oncefortheroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse is bred to run long and also to run on the turf," Brummel said. 
"It helped that this race was around two turns." 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, David Flores sent Mr. Progressive to the lead and Fandarel 
Dancer, ridden by Fernando Valenzuela, went out with him. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they reached the half-mile pole, California Chill, under Martin 
Pedroza, had moved into second. 
</P>
<P>
 Oncefortheroad made his move from last to third going around the far turn, 
moved into second at the top of the stretch and engaged Fandarel Dancer in a 
stirring stretch drive before getting up in the final strides. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Sorenson, who had the winning ride, said the horse responded just the 
way Bradshaw told him he would. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him not to worry about switching leads, he would do it himself," 
Sorenson said. "There was plenty of speed up front and Danny couldn't have rode 
him any better." 
</P>
<P>
 Oncefortheroad's next start may come in the California Cup Juvenile at Oak 
Tree on Oct. 29. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Flying Sensation, whose last workout was 1:02 breezing, is the 6-5 morning 
line favorite for Saturday's $100,000 Pomona Derby. The son of Flying Paster, 
with David Flores aboard, will carry 114 pounds and spot eight pounds to 
Warning Label, the second choice at 5-2. The field in order: 
Marinatedartichoke, no rider, 113, 30-1; Bird County, Paul Atkinson, 114, 12-1; 
Attleboro, Fernando Valenzuela, 117, 5-1; Warning Label, Antonio Castanon, 112, 
5-2; Flying Sensation, Flores, 114, 6-5; Silcannier, G.F. Almeida, 114, 12-1; 
Down D Islands, Danny Sorenson, 114, 20-1; Set On Cruise, Martin Pedroza, 114, 
8-1. 
</P>
<P>
 John Atherton was flipped off his mount, Undilay, before the sixth race and 
was treated for pain in his left foot. He sat out the rest of the day. . . . 
Flores, on the way to his sixth consecutive Fairplex riding title, had mounts 
on all 11 thoroughbred races Thursday but took off on the last because his 
right hip was bothering him. Seven of his mounts were the morning-line 
favorite. He had two winners to give him 36 for the meeting and needs 12 more 
in the last four days to equal his meet record of 48 victories. . . . The 
$750,000 Super Derby from Louisiana Downs, which includes trainer Dick 
Mandella's Soul Of The Matter, will be simulcast at Fairplex Park Saturday. The 
scheduled post time is 1:12 p.m. and the first live race will be run at 1:40 
p.m. . . . The first victory dead heat of the meeting happened in the fourth 
race Wednesday when Ursa's Illusion, ridden by Almeida, caught Gordy's Dancer 
and Flores at the wire. Each horse paid $2.40 to win.

<P>
 Tonight's featured race at Los Alamitos, the $20,000 Vandy's Flash Handicap, 
has drawn a tougher field than the $20,000 purse would indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Heza Fast Man, a talented 3-year-old colt trained by John Bassett, will be 
making his 1994 Los Alamitos debut in the race. The colt won last year's Texas 
Classic Futurity, ran a close second in the All-American Futurity behind A 
Classic Dash and finished second in the All-American Derby this year.

PREP FOOTBALL; WILSON LEADS EL TORO PAST LAGUNA HILLS

<TEXT>

 Laguna Hills tailback Brendan McGraw entered Thursday night's nonleague game 
leading Orange County in rushing yardage and scoring. But El Toro quarterback 
Brian Wilson stole the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson completed 16 of 22 passes for 235 yards and three touchdowns and ran 
seven times for 107 yards and scored one touchdown, leading the Chargers to a 
31-13 victory before an estimated crowd of 1,500 at Trabuco Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro has won three of its first four games for the first time in four 
seasons under Coach Mike Milner. But Wilson said this game was key. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a big measuring-stick game for us," said Wilson, a 6-foot-1 senior. 
"We knew Laguna Hills was a good team and Brendan McGraw is a great player. Our 
offense had to play good and it did. If I have to run, I will." 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw did his part for Laguna Hills (2-2). He carried 20 times for 159 yards, 
slightly off his average of 183 per game, and caught five passes for 81 yards, 
including a 34-yard swing pass from sophomore quarterback Cory Pardoe that gave 
the Hawks a 7-3 lead in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was their only lead as El Toro came back to drive 80 yards in eight 
plays, culminated by Wilson's 24-yard touchdown run. Chad Johnson's second 
field goal and Wilson's nine-yard scoring pass to Josh Tiplady with 32 seconds 
left in the half gave the Chargers a 19-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw, who had an 81-yard touchdown catch-and-run nullified in the second 
quarter because of a holding penalty, faked and sprinted 62 yards for a 
touchdown on the third play of the second half to cut the deficit to six. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chargers scored twice more on touchdown receptions by Brian Koupal 
(eight yards) and Tiplady (31) and the defense forced the Hawks to go three and 
out on their final four possessions. Jeff Bibler led El Toro with eight 
tackles. MICHAEL CASEY

PREP FOOTBALL; HAYNES HELPS VILLA PARK SHUT OUT LOARA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophomore Franklin Haynes intercepted three passes and scored two touchdowns 
to help lead No. 9 Villa Park to a 35-0 victory over Loara Thursday night at El 
Modena High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Sean McMahon led the Spartans on offense, completing six of nine 
passes for 173 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park held Loara (0-4) to 132 yards in total offense, including 39 on the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Two quick touchdown passes in the first quarter opened the scoring for the 
Spartans (3-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon hit Kris Fisher on an 18-yard scoring pass and, on his next attempt, 
McMahon found Sam Stremick for a 67-yard score to help Villa Park to a 14-0 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans controlled the momentum throughout the second half, starting with 
the kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes returned the kick 83 yards for his first score. On the Spartans' next 
possession, McMahon connected on his third touchdown, a 23-yard pass to Fisher, 
giving Villa Park a 28-0 lead midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes capped the scoring when he intercepted his third pass of the night and 
returned it 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony D'Amato had 59 yards in six carries for the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara quarterback Jim Kirkland completed eight of 22 for 65 yards and three 
interceptions. JON CLIFFORD

PREP FOOTBALL; KENNEDY NEEDS A LITTLE LUCK TO SQUEAK PAST VALENCIA, 6-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fighting Irish were the lucky Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, limited to a handful of yards and plagued by five turnovers, won its 
third consecutive game Thursday, scoring a 6-3 victory over Valencia at Western 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Six points. It's not much, but it's more than a 31-yard field goal by Joe 
Secoda. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to win," Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo said, "we're going to 
have to get to the point where we make those plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Those would be the plays that teams have to make, like getting the ball at the 
opponent's nine-yard line after an interception and not scoring a touchdown. Or 
keeping the other team from completing four consecutive passes on the winning 
drive when they had previously completed only five of 16 passes the whole game. 
Or three of your four penalties aren't: 
</P>
<P>
 * Offensive holding, wiping out an eight-yard gain from the nine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defensive pass interference, without which it would have been fourth and 
eight from the Kennedy 34 in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Facemask, at the end of a five-yard catch that adds 15 yards and puts the 
ball at the 16. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that last penalty that set up Darin Martineau's 16-yard touchdown run, 
which culminated a 78-yard drive that began with 3 minutes 48 seconds left. 
After four consecutive completions by Jason Myles, Martineau stepped out of a 
leg tackle by Steve Flores five yards behind the line of scrimmage, cut up 
field and scored with 1:50 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy got me by the legs," Martineau said, "and I gave it everything I had 
to get past him." 
</P>
<P>
 Martineau finished with 105 yards in 19 carries. Kennedy (3-1) outgained 
Valencia (2-1-1), 150-127. Kennedy's leading rusher, Charlie Marino, played one 
play -- the failed point-after kick -- because of a deep triceps bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not turned it on and played as a unit," said Kennedy Coach Mitch 
Olson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The final drive meant nothing -- the defense was unbelievable. The defense 
allowed us the opportunity to make something happen on a fluke, and that's what 
happened. The defense won the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Randy Ellison, who missed last week's 14-8 victory over Corona del 
Mar, was one of the reasons. And the play of defensive linemen Kai Chuang, Jeff 
Tow, Brian Stewart and Mike Robertson were some of the others.

PREP FOOTBALL; ORANGE ROUTS SAINTS; HILL REACHES 199 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange Coach Dick Hill is a step closer to another milestone. 
</P>
<P>
 With tailback Marcus Garza scoring three touchdowns and quarterback Andy 
Lauridsen passing for two, Orange coasted to a 34-0 nonleague victory over 
Santa Ana Thursday night at Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gives Hill 199 victories as a coach in Orange County, adding to 
his county record. And it came at the expense of his former team. Hill, who has 
211 victories overall, coached Santa Ana for eight years before being forced 
out in 1991. Hill will have an opportunity to win his 200th in the county next 
Friday against Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers (3-1), who won their third in a row and second by shutout, used 
two third-quarter touchdowns to turn a 14-0 halftime lead into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
 Garza, who also had a 32-yard touchdown run in the first quarter, scored both 
times. The first came after a Santa Ana fumble as Garza and Lauridsen connected 
on an eight-yard touchdown pass with 8 minutes 1 second remaining in the 
quarter for a 21-0 advantage. Garza, who rushed for 71 yards in 11 carries, 
added an 11-yard scoring run with 3:31 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ease of the victory, Hill said his team didn't play well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got off to a slow start and made some mistakes," he said. "You never knock 
having a good win, but we've got to work on some of our leaks. All in all 
though it was a good win." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana fell to 0-4. FORREST LEE

PREP FOOTBALL; GRAGNANO STEPS INTO SPOTLIGHT, HELPS LOS ALAMITOS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ryan Gragnano, the newest gear in Los Alamitos' spare-part offense, was cool 
on the outside, bone tired inside. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just helped the Griffins to a 39-12 victory over Pasadena Muir Thursday 
at Cerritos Gahr High School. He had scored four touchdowns and accounted for 
138 yards, rushing and receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he was going to handle this like a professional. No giddiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "My line blocked good," Gragnano said. "I just wanted to do what I could when 
I got the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, right, kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been excited all week," Griffin wide receiver Tony Hartley said. "I have 
a class with him, I know. He couldn't wait to get out there." 
</P>
<P>
 So for Gragnano, a better runner than actor, it was all he could have hoped 
for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, he was a faceless defensive back. Two injuries later, he was 
center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Phil Cruz went down in Los Alamitos' 23-16 victory over Carson last 
week. Backup Jared Rollins followed late in that game. 
</P>
<P>
 Gragnano was next in line and his stumpy legs were ready. 
</P>
<P>
 He gained 55 yards rushing and scored on runs of 25, six, one and one yards. 
He also caught four passes for 83 yards, including a 22-yard reception that set 
up another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that a full night in secondary and you had one whipped junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would be more excited, but I'm too tired," said Gragnano, who is generously 
listed at 5 feet 9 and 175 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach John Barnes: "Actually, I expected him to play that well. We tell 
all our players that they are one play from being a starter." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a night of understudies for the Griffins (4-0), ranked No. 1 in Orange 
County.  
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore quarterback Sean Stein, who stepped in when Kevin Feterik was 
injured in the opener, completed 15 of 21 passes for 286 yards and a touchdown. 
He has thrown for 624 yards and five touchdowns in 3 1/2 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he'll sit down because Feterik is expected to be ready to play next week 
against Long Beach Millikan. But Barnes will sleep better knowing he has a 
safety net in Stein. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret to this interchangeable offense is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our practices are tougher than the games," Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it helps to have some original equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley caught five passes for 84 yards and set up one touchdown with a 
leaping 29-yard reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Melsby caught four passes for 92 yards, including a 25-yard touchdown 
reception. He also saved the Griffins on defense, tackling Sean Haslip (14 
carries, 87 yards) twice in the open field during the same first-quarter drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs (2-2), who trailed 6-0 at the time, ended up missing a field 
goal. Gragnano took it from there.

PREP FOOTBALL; OCEAN VIEW GETS CLOSE BEFORE LOSING

<P>
 Estancia's winning streak continued, as did Ocean View's losing streak, as the 
Eagles won, 14-3, in a nonleague football game Thursday at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third consecutive victory for Estancia (3-1), after a nine-game 
losing streak.Ocean View (0-4) has lost 33 in a row, the longest streak in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View still had a chance in the fourth quarter but failed on a fourth 
down at the Estancia 20. The drive had already been helped by three 15-yard 
penalties against Estancia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View faced a fourth and one when quarterback Ted Norman faked a handoff 
inside and started a bootleg to the left. But Estancia defensive back Karlo 
Amaya read the play and tackled Norman for a three-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia then went on a 14-play drive but faced a key fourth-down play of its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles were on the Ocean View one with 1 minute 49 seconds left, leading, 
7-3. Instead of going for the field goal, Estancia Coach John Liebengood 
elected to try for the touchdown. Oscar Lomeli, behind a strong surge of the 
offensive line, scored with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Lomeli finished with 70 yards in 13 carries and teammate Bachy Gonzalez had a 
game-high 106 yards in 19 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is the win," Liebengood said. "We've just got to keep 
building because our toughest games are ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View appeared headed to the locker room at halftime with a 3-0 lead only 
to have disaster strike. Jon Dempsey kicked a 21-yard field goal with 11 
seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Estancia's Chris Felix took the following kickoff and cut to the left 
sideline and finished with a 76-yard return for a touchdown. STEVE KRESAL

PREP FOOTBALL; EDISON FINDS ITS STRIDE, OVERPOWERS MILLIKAN, 38-0 
</P>

<P>
 Edison got a rare opportunity to measure its talent against an inferior 
opponent Thursday night, and the result was a 38-0 victory over Long Beach 
Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers' nerves and bodies needed the rest after opening the season with 
three close games that were not decided until the final moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had three cardiac games in row," Coach Dave White said. "It's making me 
feel old." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-point victories over San Clemente and Corona del Mar, plus a four-point 
squeaker against Capistrano Valley can raise blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 And the bruising Sunset League schedule awaits Edison (4-0). 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked a lot this week about playing to our level," White said. "Our 
defense has really stepped it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-ranked Chargers have gone from a team that gave up 28 points in its 
season opener against Corona del Mar, to a team that allowed only 72 total 
yards against Millikan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams (1-3), whose only victory this season came against winless Santa Ana, 
only had two gains over 10 yards and ventured inside the Charger 20 only once. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Edison's balanced offense of run and pass plays built a 24-0 lead 
after one half. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Linnen's 20-yard touchdown reception with 7:05 left in the half made it 
17-0. The Chargers added to their lead on an eight-yard strike from Patrick 
Markovsky to Mike Ogas. 
</P>
<P>
 Millikan didn't do anything to help itself in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 A roughing-the-kicker penalty by the Rams set up Markovsky's third touchdown 
pass, which covered 29 yards to Damien Moos. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second Charger touchdown that was set up by a Millikan penalty 
after a punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley Lisotto rushed for 130 yards in 15 carries, giving him a 7.7 yards per 
carry average. DAN ARRITT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel quarterback Scott Nemeth ran two yards on a keeper to score the 
winning touchdown with 42 seconds left in an 18-17 victory over Santiago on 
Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Nemeth completed a 30-yard pass to Joe Valenti, and two 17-yarders to Justin 
Martin on the winning drive that began at Aliso Niguel's seven-yard line with 3 
minutes 15 seconds left.Santiago had taken a 15-10 lead with just over six and 
a half minutes left in the fourth quarter on a two-yard pass from Christian 
Cortez to Octavio Villa. 
</P>
<P>
 Five plays earlier, Santiago's Tom Sokanthong had a 13-yard scoring run called 
back because of a clipping penalty. Cortez had teamed with Oscar Pulido on a 
36-yarder to bring the ball to the 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel took only two and a half minutes to score its first touchdown on 
their first drive of the second half. Martin caught a 21-yard pass from Nemeth. 
Nemeth ran 50 yards on a busted pass attempt, narrowly avoiding a sack, to set 
up the Wolverines at the Santiago 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams traded field goals in the first half, and Santiago scored on a 
30-yard pass from Cortez to Villa. The drive was aided by a 40-yard run by 
Sokanthong. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemeth completed 11 passes for 188 yards and was Aliso Niguel's leading 
rusher, with 77 yards in six carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Sokanthong led Santiago with 61 yards in nine carries. CATHY LALKO

BOXING IN IRVINE; ZAVALA CONTINUES COMEBACK BY KNOCKING OUT ROBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rosemead featherweight Rudy Zavala continued his climb back up the rankings 
with a fourth-round knockout of John Roby in the main event Thursday night at 
the Irvine Marriott before 1,104. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first fight on the six-bout card, bantamweight Pablito Barrios of 
Acapulco, Mexico, was knocked unconscious from a flurry of blows by Johnny 
Vasquez with 2:24 gone in the first round. Barrios' head hit the canvas hard 
and he lay motionless for almost 10 minutes while most of crowd stood silently. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrios (3-2-1), who trains at the Santa Ana Boxing Club, was eventually 
helped to his feet and walked out of the ring on his own. The knockout was 
Vasquez's first in four fights and his second victory. He hit Barrios with 
several clean shots earlier in the round, then came off the ropes to hit 
Barrios with about 10 consecutive punches that landed flush on the jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrios was taken to Irvine Medical Center for tests. Dr. Robert Karns, the 
state athletic commission's physician, said Barrios will be kept overnight for 
observation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime there's a history of unconsciousness, we keep them overnight," Karns 
said. "I think he'll be fine though." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Andrew Kim of the state athletic commission said he did not fault referee 
Burt Gilliam's actions in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to stop it at that point," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zavala (23-4-2), the world's top-ranked junior featherweight two years ago, 
was sluggish early and he had a hard time finding the taller Roby's head. But 
he landed three right hooks to Roby's jaw in the third round, then landed a 
left hook below his ribs that sent Roby (14-13) to his knees. Roby tried to get 
up, but he didn't make the 10 count.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a left hook to the liver," Zavala said. "I thought he'd get up."

HEDRICK RUNS FOR 213 YARDS IN WIN; FOOTBALL: CRESCENTA VALLEY STAYS UNBEATEN 
WITH 28-6 NONLEAGUE VICTORY OVER SOUTH PASADENA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRYAN RODGERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't expect Crescenta Valley High football Coach Alan Eberhart to receive 
much sympathy from his counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-year coach is undefeated this season and had a running back rush 
for over 200 yards, but he claims to be frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Hedrick gained 213 yards in 19 carries and scored three touchdowns in 
Crescenta Valley's 28-6 nonleague victory over South Pasadena at Glendale High 
on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm frustrated because we have no one else to give the ball to," Eberhart 
said. "It didn't take long for them to realize we were going to give the ball 
to the tailback." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if South Pasadena had known the plays, the Tigers still would have had 
trouble stopping Hedrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedrick, who is playing his first varsity season, scored second-quarter 
touchdowns on runs of five and two yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-yard run came after an apparent 25-yard score was called back because 
of a holding penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedrick added a 90-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter for Crescenta 
Valley's final score. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons (4-0) held South Pasadena (0-4) in check, limiting the Tigers to 
92 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory came as a relief for Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Falcons escaped with a 15-14 victory over Burbank when the 
Bulldogs missed a field-goal try in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our line blocked much better tonight than last week," said Hedrick, who has 
scored 11 touchdowns. "I even had guys that were throwing blocks downfield." 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley also had success passing. Quarterback John Watts completed 
only four of seven, but they accounted for 122 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Barbaro scored on a 79-yard pass play early in the third quarter to give 
Crescenta Valley a 21-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena attempted to rally in the fourth quarter when Johnny Chen 
intercepted a pass by Watts and returned it 45 yards for a touchdown. The 
conversion kick was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena recovered an onside kick and drove to Crescenta Valley's 
four-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley sacked Tiger quarterback Mahan Riahi four times for 54 yards 
in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Dion Higuera had 40 yards in 10 carries for Crescenta Valley, 
which amassed 377 yards.

THOUSAND OAKS FIRES A VOLLEY FOR ITS COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Haar of Thousand Oaks High said he was afraid he might start coaching 
the wrong team during a girls' volleyball match against Newbury Park Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Haar was the coach at Newbury Park for two years before switching schools last 
spring for a better teaching position. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night was the first matchup between the Marmonte League rivals, and 
facing Haar for the first time as an opponent kept Panther seniors Kari Norberg 
and Kara McKeown pacing frantically around the gym as the start of the match 
approached. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real nervous for this one," Norberg said. "I knew this was going to be 
intense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers started slowly before mounting a furious rally, but Thousand Oaks 
held on for a 15-9, 15-6, 14-16, 11-15, 15-5 victory to hand Newbury Park its 
first setback of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers (4-2, 3-1 in league play) gained a share of first place in the 
Marmonte League along with Newbury Park (5-1, 3-1), Agoura and Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore middle blocker Jenn Detmer had nine kills and seven blocks and 
freshman outside hitter Courtney Miller had 15 kills for Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew this was going to be tough for him but we wanted to show he was our 
coach now," Detmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detmer and Miller helped the Lancers offset 18 kills by Newbury Park outside 
hitter Christine Arguijo. McKeown added 12 kills and 12 blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park was in danger of being swept, trailing, 12-9, in the third game. 
Thousand Oaks got to match point, but two consecutive blocks by McKeown and a 
hitting error by Miller gave the Panthers the third game. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park jumped to a 10-5 lead in the fourth game and held on to even the 
match behind Arguijo's six kills. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks raced to a 5-1 lead in the final game and wasn't threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we underestimated their defensive ability," Norberg said.

SIDELINES; THERE ISN'T ANYTHING SOFT ABOUT THE WAY THEY PLAY THE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They aren't the Silver Bullets and they don't play in A League of Their Own, 
but a team called America's Elite is turning heads in a Tuesday night 
fast-pitch softball league at Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the America's Elite lineup are eight women who were softball All-Americans 
in college and two men. 
</P>
<P>
 Former UCLA standouts Lisa Fernandez, Dot Richardson and Karen Walker are 
among several players training in hopes of making the first U.S. Olympic 
softball team, which is scheduled to participate in the 1996 Olympic Games in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 In its opener last week, America's Elite dropped a 2-1 decision to Mr. Pete's, 
an all-men's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a little bit unsure of what to expect," said Manager Kirk Walker, a 
former UCLA assistant and Woodland Hills resident who was recently hired as 
softball coach at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they know what it's like (to play against men) and they'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth and forever: You might say Jonathan Beauregard went ballistic. Or at 
least his helmet did. 
</P>
<P>
 When officials flagged the Cal State Northridge senior offensive lineman for a 
personal foul in a game against Southwest Texas State last week, Beauregard 
took it personally. Accused of attempting to intentionally injure an opponent 
with a cut block, he protested so vehemently that he drew two more penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, that's 15 yards for the penalty itself; 15 more for arguing; 
another 15 for reacting to the second penalty by removing his helmet and 
spiking it. 
</P>
<P>
 His last act finally drew an ejection -- but not soon enough to save 
Northridge. The Matadors had driven to the Southwest Texas State 41, but after 
three downs -- and Beauregard's antics -- Northridge was backed to its own 16, 
fourth down and 53 yards to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Bob Burt: "It was a fiasco." 
</P>
<P>
 Fit to be tied: Sometimes ignorance is bliss. Roger McCamy, the football coach 
at Simi Valley High, tried to call a timeout last week after his team's only 
touchdown against Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
 His players didn't hear him. And it's probably a good thing. Instead of 
kicking for one point, McCamy wanted to go for two. Later, McCamy admitted, "We 
probably would have screwed that up and lost the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Pioneers left with a 7-7 tie. Stats 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers can be deceiving. For instance, don't be misled because Ignacio 
Brache, kicker for the Village Christian High football team, has made only one 
of six field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 The kick he made was from 38 yards. His misses were from 54, 57, 58, 59 and 65 
yards. Last season Brache, a senior, set a Southern Section Division X record 
by making a 54-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Crash 'n burn: The Cal Lutheran football team has blown leads in both its 
games, and is it any wonder? The Kingsmen (1-1) are allowing an average of 
240.5 yards passing -- in the second half. Not surprisingly, Cal Lutheran is 
last in the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in pass 
defense, allowing an average of 296.5 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Record watch: The Cal State Northridge women's volleyball team had a 
school-record 84 assists in Wednesday night's five-game victory over Cal State 
Bakersfield, the top-ranked team in NCAA Division II. The Matadors established 
the previous mark of 81 in a five-game loss to Idaho on Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Net gains: Valley Alternative High's Lilibeth Cardano and Jasmine Davis will 
spend the rest of the volleyball season battling for possession of the school's 
kill record. Both seniors have surpassed the previous mark of 168, set by 
Valerie Carter, who graduated in 1992. Honors 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark College receiver Isaiah Mustafa, a sophomore, was selected Western 
State Conference offensive player of the week. He had 10 receptions for 183 
yards and a touchdown last week in a 39-0 victory over West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Manu Langi, a freshman from Valley College, was defensive player of the week. 
He made six solo tackles, including a sack, in a 20-0 victory over Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 League leader: Former Westlake High standout Ryan Seidel was selected most 
valuable player of the Saskatchewan Major Baseball League, an amateur summer 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 Seidel, a senior at Southern California College, led the league with 48 hits 
and a .471 batting average for the Swift Current Indians. He also played all 
nine positions. Things to Do  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, 7, at North Campus Stadium: Cal State Northridge plays host to the 
University of San Diego in a nonconference men's soccer match. Northridge 
(5-2), ranked ninth among Division I teams from the Far West, is fresh off a 
tournament victory in Las Vegas last weekend. San Diego (4-3) has advanced to 
the NCAA Division I title game twice in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, 11 a.m., at the Cal Lutheran soccer field: First place in the 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference will be on the line 
when Cal Lutheran and Occidental square off in a women's soccer match. Both 
teams are undefeated in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, 1 p.m., at the Glendale High football field: A football 
doubleheader, starting with Glendale College (1-1) playing host to Bakersfield 
(3-0), the second-ranked JC team in the nation. At 7:30 p.m. Loyola (3-0), the

 Watch these spaces. Until Election Day, in-your-face billboards will try to 
get out your vote. Artists from guerrilla-poster boy Robbie Conal to the 
students of Griffin Avenue Elementary School are putting their messages on 
Gannett Outdoor's medium--eight or nine donated billboards: 
</P>
<P>
 From performance artist Skip Arnold, an aimed gun with the words, "You don't 
vote . . . I WIN." 
</P>
<P>
 From Liz Young, another performance artist, a chain of words burned into a 
faux plywood background: "Trust just join rule roots reap guts wits grit vow 
virtue vote." 
</P>
<P>
 From Joe Bergman, creative director at Gannett, the donor of the billboards, a 
lot of white space and the warning: "What millions of Americans achieve by not 
voting." 
</P>
<P>
 Conal's panel of five faces--deteriorating from a smiling L.A. to a shriveled 
death's-head--is "what happens if we don't vote. . . . The threat of regular 
people voting is the only thing we have left to hold them in line. . . . We're 
really gonna die if you don't vote: The politicians are gonna kill us."

and provenance. 
</P>
<P>
 The photo spread, "Second Time Around," features men who got two shots at life

 In the strictest reading, it could outlaw campaigning altogether. (Please,

 The new law adds to existing law to make it illegal to pay or spend money to 
"induce any voter" to, among other things, "vote or refrain from voting at an

 Wait. All those mailers . . . all those expensive TV spots trying to "induce"

ITO RELEASES HARDSHIP CASES FROM JURY POOL; SIMPSON CASE: REMAINDER ARE ORDERED 
TO COMPLETE 75-PAGE QUESTIONNAIRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a brief, perfunctory session with the final group of prospective jurors in 
the O.J. Simpson murder case, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito on Thursday 
dismissed all those who gave any indication that they might have difficulty 
serving for a long trial and directed the rest to fill out detailed 
questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the 53 potential jurors who were screened Thursday had previously 
indicated their willingness to serve, but did not show up as scheduled. In 
addition, one woman who had said she could endure the hardship of a trial that 
might last six months told the judge she had gotten a new job and no longer 
could take that much time off. She was excused. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the court has now identified 304 Los Angeles County residents who say 
they have no impediments to serving in the Simpson case. The prospective 
panelists have completed questionnaires attempting to discern which of them 
have biases that would make it impossible to impartially weigh the evidence in 
the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, a football hero and nationally known actor and commercial spokesman, 
is charged with the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her 
friend Ronald Lyle Goldman, whose bodies were found slashed and stabbed to 
death June 13. He has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-page questionnaires that prospective jurors have completed are being 
turned over to the lawyers in batches, and they already have received nearly 
100. On Thursday, Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro said he had reviewed about 
70. He and prosecutors said that both sides are likely to agree that some 
panelists should be dismissed immediately, but the remainder of the group will 
be subjected to questioning by Ito and the attorneys beginning Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has other volatile questions to resolve in the coming weeks. Among them is 
the issue of whether to sequester the jury, a move that would take jurors away 
from their families and friends for the duration of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have asked for sequestration, arguing that publicity surrounding 
the case is so intense that to allow jurors to return home at night during the 
trial would inevitably cause them to be exposed to influences outside the 
courtroom. Instead, prosecutors propose putting up the panel in a nearby hotel 
during the trial -- the same technique used in a few other high-profile trials 
such as that of the four Los Angeles police officers accused of violating 
Rodney G. King's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simpson's lawyers, in a motion filed Sept. 14 and unsealed Thursday, 
argued that sequestering a jury would increase the chances of a conviction and 
impose an unfair burden on the 12 jurors and eight alternates in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a serious danger that the prosecutorial request for a sequestered 
jury is a tactical choice, to secure a jury the prosecutors believe will be 
more favorably disposed toward conviction," Simpson's attorneys said in their 
motion. "Indeed, the folklore that a sequestered jury is a convicting jury 
finds ample historical support." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers argue that sequestration will limit the jurors who may be 
able to serve, create potential conflicts among the jurors and place members of 
the panel so firmly under the control of the government that they are more 
inclined to convict. They cite a 1968 case in which jurors described being 
pampered by federal marshals -- "We had entertainment, always the best, food 
always the best, martinis before dinner," one juror from that case later 
recalled, according to the defense motion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Simpson's attorneys worry that a prolonged sequestration may 
turn jurors against one another and make them angry and restless. "The defense 
may be facing a jury who are like the proverbial 'scorpions in a bottle,' " 
according to the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers also objected to keeping the identities of jurors secret -- 
an approach that some experts say makes jurors more willing to convict and can 
imply that a defendant is a threatening figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has not said when he will rule on sequestration but has indicated that he 
first wants to begin the process of questioning prospective jurors. He has said 
he is inclined to sequester the jury at least for its deliberations, but has 
expressed reluctance to extend the period of sequestration. 
</P>
<P>
 With the first phase of jury selection moving more smoothly than either side 
had anticipated, Ito has cleared most of next week to allow the lawyers and 
their jury consultants to focus on the task of reading and evaluating 
questionnaires. Only one hearing is scheduled, for Wednesday, at which Ito will 
attempt to conclude arguments over police searches of Simpson's home and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of even a brief respite in the Simpson case prompted some of the 
scores of reporters who have descended on the Criminal Courts Building to begin 
trickling home Thursday afternoon -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm leaving tomorrow morning first thing," said Charles Thomas, a television 
reporter from Chicago, adding that Thursday's brief hearing left him with 
little to report. "O.J. didn't say anything, and a chill ran through me. I 
thought: 'What am I going to do?' "

DOWN TO EARTH; JPL RADAR PROJECT ON SHUTTLE SETS ITS SIGHTS HOMEWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outer space is the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's usual playground, where its 
planetary probes rendezvous with asteroids, piggyback on the solar wind and zip 
to the fringes of the solar system. But these days, the NASA agency's high-tech 
wizardry is rediscovering an old world -- planet Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unlikely twist for a space agency, JPL's new Spaceborne Imaging Radar, 
or SIR-C, is turning its focus homeward as part of NASA's Mission to Planet 
Earth, a $1-billion project created to study the global environment on what 
scientists say is an unprecedented scale. Starting today, the $360-million 
radar system embarks aboard the space shuttle Endeavour on the second of three 
trips to send back striking images from our own back yard: a tropical rain 
forest in Mexico, volcanoes in the western Galapagos Islands, and the habitat 
of endangered mountain gorillas in war-torn Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just cannot wait until most of the tropical forests are gone before we do 
something about it," said Charles Elachi, assistant lab director of JPL in 
Pasadena. "We cannot wait until the ozone layer is mostly destroyed before we 
do something about it. . . . If we are to be a good custodian of our planet for 
the next generation, or the generation after that, we must really understand 
what we're doing to our planet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SIR-C is unique in its ability to work on three frequencies, allowing 
scientists to probe an area with three different looks at the same image. SIR-C 
is the world's most advanced civilian radar, capable of penetrating clouds, 
vegetation, ice, dry sand, soil and darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, other radars work only on a single frequency. The difference, 
experts say, is like looking at an X-ray instead of a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the first time, SIR-C will produce high-resolution images of the world 
as a single ecosystem, showing how land, water, carbon and heat interact.  
</P>
<P>
 SIR-C's projects include a look at the Sierra Nevada snowpacks to determine 
how much water is inside. Eventually, researchers hope to be able to tell how 
much runoff water is available, how fast the snow melts and how quickly the 
soil absorbs the water. With that information, farmers could decide which crops 
are best to plant and when. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, scientists play Indiana Jones, aiming the radar at the 
once-lost Arabian city of Ubar, probing under the shifting desert sands for 
clues on what life was like nearly 5,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The fortress city, celebrated in the Koran and "A Thousand and One Arabian 
Nights" as a shipping center for frankincense, was discovered in December, 
1991. A Los Angeles-based team of amateur and professional archeologists made 
the find with the help of another JPL radar system -- a precursor to the one 
flying on Endeavour. 
</P>
<P>
 And from Rwanda, the radar will produce images of the endangered mountain 
gorilla's mist-shrouded forest, where the shy animals rummage for berries, wild 
celery and stinging thistles. Until now, researchers in the remote region have 
been armed only with outdated maps from the 1950s and handwritten notes from 
naturalist Dian Fossey, whose story was told in the movie "Gorillas in the 
Mist." Fossey, who was murdered in 1985, used enlarged copies of crude forest 
maps -- ones that lacked contours -- and marked the gorilla's movements with a 
pen. For the first time, the radar images, along with satellite data, will help 
researchers make a comprehensive analysis of the gorillas' movements and 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible difference in terms of the kinds of research questions 
that can be asked. . . (instead of) an individual researcher sitting in the 
bamboo forest with a Xerox map and a felt-tip pen," said Scott Madry, a Rutgers 
University researcher who works with the executive director of the Dian Fossey 
Gorilla Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In such cases, the radar casts JPL in an unexpected role as global eco-warrior 
-- a shift that some say is overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many of us, even those of us who have a great interest in space, we've 
been regularly astounded on the amount of time (is spent) looking beyond our 
own planet for planetary exploration when there's still a lot to learn about 
our own planet," said Cynthia Rust, a spokeswoman for Greenpeace in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Other projects have focused only on parts of the ecosystem. In 1993, NASA's 
Nimbus-7 satellite found that global ozone levels were 2% to 3% lower than any 
previous year. In another NASA project, satellite observations confirmed last 
year that Mt. Pinatubo's eruption in June, 1991, resulted in a temporary 
cooling of the Earth by about 1 degree. 
</P>
<P>
 JPL worked on the radar project with the German and Italian space agencies, 
which together put up half the cost; NASA funded the other half, or $180 
million. SIR-C's 23,100-pound antenna is the biggest piece of flight hardware 
ever built at JPL. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, SIR-C can peer deep into the Earth -- beneath thick vegetation 
canopies, through cloud cover, under desert floors -- and reveal previously 
inaccessible regions. 
</P>
<P>
 A 52-member international science team is still studying data from April's 
mission, which probed 5% of the world's land surface, said JPL scientist Diane 
Evans, the U.S. project leader. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the radar flew aboard Endeavour (results have not yet been released) 
and was scheduled to fly again in August over most of the same 400 sites to 
measure seasonal differences. But a last-minute glitch forced NASA to abort the 
flight from Cape Canaveral, Fla., and reschedule the 10-day mission. A third 
flight is proposed for January, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar's targets include last fall's Los Angeles burn areas, for a global 
study on how fires affect vegetation, and the Missouri River flood areas from 
1993, for research on how the environment recovers from floods. Among the 19 
"super sites," or high-priority targets during the 10-day mission, are four 
U.S. locations, including Death Valley's Andes Mountains for a study on climate 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Space exploration is still a NASA priority, but at the same time, NASA 
Administrator Daniel S. Goldin has named Mission to Planet Earth as one of the 
agency's top five projects. In fact, since the agency began work on the project 
in 1991, 25% of JPL's work has been devoted to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the radar project, Mission to Planet Earth includes 27 projects 
through 2000. Other projects include the use of shuttle-based lasers to study 
the atmosphere and a radar satellite that will study icebergs and oceanography 
in the Arctic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Earth science is the fastest growing part of NASA, said Charles Kennel, 
associate administrator for Mission to Planet Earth, on leave as a UCLA physics 
professor. The mission started with a $668-million budget; its 1995 budget is 
expected to be $1.2 billion. 
</P>

 NASA is getting more involved in Earth projects as the planet's problems 
worsen, Kennel said.

<P>
 Still, Greenpeace's Rust said, NASA is only taking a first step.

 "Perhaps," she said, "the money might be better spent on cleaning up some of 
the messes and developing some of the ecological alternatives to maintaining 
the ecosystem rather than documenting its decline."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: PUTTING HIS BEST FACE FORWARD 
</P>

 When O.J. Simpson first appeared in court early this summer, he was a 
dazed-looking murder suspect, not even permitted to wear a tie because his 
jailers feared he'd commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, as Simpson's trial got under way with jury selection, he became 
the old O.J., the confident-looking former football hero who sold America on 
Hertz rental cars and was a favorite of wealthy friends and business associates 
at country clubs across the nation. He smiled at potential jurors, softly sang 
a show tune from his seat at the defense table and later actually chatted with 
reporters for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a stunning transformation in a defendant's courtroom demeanor is not 
unusual and is often part of a carefully considered strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys work hard on the persona of their clients to elicit some 
degree of sympathy, or at least understanding, from the jurors. A street 
killer, for example, may appear in court in corduroy sport coats and charcoal 
slacks, looking a bit like a college teaching assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 When attorney Karen Ackerson represented Henry Keith Watson, one of the men 
convicted of beating a motorist at the intersection of Florence and Normandie 
avenues during the riots,she undertook a major makeover of her client. 
</P>
<P>
 His appearance changed from that of a sullen-looking thug to a friendly, 
approachable person. She got him to shave his beard and wear conventional sport 
clothes. "I told him, 'You have to work with us. We are asking you to change 
your appearance a little bit and be more presentable,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerson credits the strategy with helping Watson obtain a jury deadlock, 
leading prosecutors to offer him a lighter sentence than was widely expected 
after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Such image changes are "enormously important," agrees Terri Waller, managing 
partner of the National Jury Project, a jury consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she said, a defendant's image is so important that "the trend in 
California is that most defendants don't appear in shackles. The courts have 
acknowledged that it creates an unfavorable image that the defendants are 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "When talking about serious crimes," she said, "there is no doubt the jurors 
are trying to figure out the defendant, trying to figure out what kind of a 
person he is. Is he the kind of person who would have committed this crime?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers faced a different task. He's well-known and had always been 
well-liked. The challenge facing the Simpson team, said Waller, was not to 
invent a new O.J. but to remind us of the O.J. we loved. "There is a certain 
amount of humanizing there to do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The humanized O.J. emerged this week when Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito 
and prosecution and defense lawyers began screening prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 By chance, I got an inside account of what it felt like to be on the receiving 
end of the more buoyant Simpson. A family friend happened to be one of the 
juror candidates and volunteered her story to me. It turned out she couldn't 
serve, but her brief brush with the case left an impression -- the kind the 
defense hopes will be shared by those who make the final cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the second one to be questioned," she said. "When it was my turn they 
took me to a partitioned area. I was nervous. I was tense. The atmosphere in 
the room was overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Simpson was at the opposite end of the table from her. At first, her 
attention was occupied by the judge, who was asking her questions about whether 
she could serve on the panel. When Ito finished, she said, "I turned forward. 
He (Simpson) was looking at me. We made eye contact a couple of times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was gorgeous," she said, adding that she felt, in some way, connected to 
him. "Here he was, a real, tangible person." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's courtroom metamorphosis began soon after the suicide watch was 
lifted. He began appearing in court in a tie that went perfectly with his 
expensive dress shirt and nicely tailored, conservative suit. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of his Superior Court arraignment, his unsteadiness had been 
replaced by high energy. Instead of routinely entering a "not guilty" plea, he 
announced in an assertive voice that he was "absolutely, 100% not guilty" -- 
not coincidentally providing the media with a perfect sound bite. He started 
taking notes in court, looking like he was on top of everything. He also 
started to occasionally smile and talk to his lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not until this week that the transformation seemed complete, when 
he began quietly singing to himself the song "Memory" from the Broadway hit 
"Cats." 
</P>
<P>
 He sang just a few words, but enough to send a message to the many who tear up 
when they hear the music from the sentimental, wildly popular production. The 
song ends like this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Touch me, it's so easy to leave me. All alone with the memory of my days in 
the sun. If you touch me, you'll understand what happiness is. Look, a new day 
has begun." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Simpson told reporters covering the jury selection: "That song 
really gets to me because it says 'touch me' and I can't touch my kids." 
</P>
<P>
 With that simple explanation, Simpson reminded people that he was a father and 
simultaneously re-established his contact with the press, which he had always 
cultivated. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Simpson talked to the press again, this time sounding like the 
friendly jock who was always good for a post-game interview. "I've got to watch 
what I say to you guys," he said. "If I say it, I know I'll read it tomorrow 
morning." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution has a job, too. They must establish the image of two people 
who are not in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 With the incessant media concentration on Simpson, the prosecutors must make 
the presence of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman felt. Through 
testimony, pictures and their own oratory, Marcia Clark and William Hodgman 
will recall the victims' young lives and their bloody deaths. They will burn 
the image of Nicole Simpson, the mother, into the minds of the jurors, 
countering the constant presence of Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 This battle of images will be a powerful force in determining the outcome of 
O.J. Simpson's murder trial.

TAXI DRIVING IS NO PIECE OF CAKE -- EXCEPT NEAR LAX; PARTY: FREE LUNCHES AND 
WINDSHIELD WASHES FOR CABBIES BUILD GOODWILL FOR AIRPORT-AREA HOTEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 His meter was running, but his stomach was growling. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's a good thing that the passenger in Gary Melkonyn's cab let him take a 
detour Thursday so he could get a free lunch and a complimentary window-wash at 
a "taxi appreciation party" near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Long lines of cabbies clogged the front of the Los Angeles Renaissance Hotel 
to get turkey croissant sandwiches, pasta salads and dessert. Hotel executives 
wearing suits and dresses used buckets and squeegees to wash windshields. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," said Melkonyn, who lives in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Said passenger Lena McRae, a Los Angeles businesswoman returning from a San 
Francisco meeting: "Who says L.A. isn't a friendly place?" 
</P>
<P>
 Taxi drivers say it isn't always all that friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the usual traffic jams that every motorist suffers through, the city's 
5,500 registered cabbies often encounter hostile passengers, rival unlicensed 
"bandit" taxis that steal riders and, occasionally, armed robbers. 
</P>
<P>
 They also face municipal regulations that prohibit them from refusing short 
trips or leaving their cabs to solicit business. And at the airport, the city's 
nine cab companies have set up their own dispatching procedure that sometimes 
requires drivers to sit two hours between trips. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where cabbie Igor Chermyavsky of West Hollywood was at noontime 
Thursday -- parked in the taxi holding lot near 96th Street and Sepulveda 
Boulevard. "I missed the lunch because of that," he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 Chermyavsky crossed his fingers that his wait wouldn't end with a passenger 
asking to go just a few blocks -- say to the Renaissance Hotel. "Sometimes you 
wait an hour and a half or so and then get a $5 fare to a close-by hotel," he 
grumbled.  
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance manager Greg Lehman acknowledged that the goal of the taxi 
appreciation party was to make drivers appreciate the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are our life bread, you know what I'm saying?" Lehman said as he 
watched two lines of taxis snake past banquet tables covered with box lunches 
in the center of the hotel driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 He jumped as one cab lurched to a stop in front of a huge sheet cake decorated 
to look like a Yellow cab. "Whoa, fella. I think you're ready for a brake job," 
he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 The cabbies beamed as hotel executives thanked them for coming, handed them 
commuter coffee mugs with the hotel's name on them and tended to windshields. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I should have worn jeans," said catering manager Alane Millar, whose 
long skirt and black, long-sleeved blouse were smudged by dust when she reached 
over cabbie Arkady Fayngold's hood to reach his windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel sales director Eric Dahlerbruch stood in Airport Boulevard with a 
bullhorn, urging passing cabbies to pull in. Several made tire-screeching 
U-turns on the spot. Driver David Johnson had five passengers in his cab when 
he stopped, jumped out and grabbed a box lunch; a passenger in the back seat 
took a picture of the taxi cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel guests were surprised by the spectacle. Victor Celso from Brazil was 
laughing as he aimed his camcorder at the scene and narrated in Portuguese. 
Sean Lange of Philadelphia was scratching his head. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because hotel doorman Adrian Montes picked up a telephone and called a 
taxi company when Lange told him he needed a cab. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess these cabs are all off duty or at lunch or something," Lange said as 
he studied the line of taxis moving slowly past the tables. "This is a unique 
place. You don't see this sort of thing in Philly." 
</P>
<P>
 You don't see it most places, according to Alan Willis, the senior 
transportation engineer who is in charge of taxi regulation in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boston hotels have almost weekly deals and freebies for drivers. And in Las 
Vegas they're always invited when a new show or buffet opens. The hotels want 
drivers there to remember them," Willis said. "You don't see it here." 
</P>
<P>
 After two hours, the 250 box lunches prepared by the hotel kitchen had run out 
and the executives were handing slices of the taxi cake to cabbies still 
flocking into the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Driver Filipp Morozov was pleased nonetheless. The 20-year-old, Russian-born 
cabbie lives in Hollywood and attends Santa Monica College. He hopes to become 
a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times this is a degrading job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is wonderful."

MISTAKEN IDENTITY; OLD-TIMERS BLAME THE POST OFFICE FOR CONFUSION ABOUT 
WINNETKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Winnetka, stupid. And if you're mailing a letter to Ruth Richter, either 
you get it right or you get it back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get mail addressed 'Canoga Park' and I write, 'Unknown at this address, 
return to sender,' " she says. "I've done that for 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is just about the same amount of time she's been trying to explain to 
folks -- both around the San Fernando Valley and over the back fence -- that 
Winnetka is not just a long straight street. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a drive-in theater, either -- the Winnetka 6 is in Chatsworth. It's 
not a section of Reseda or Northridge or Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's Canoga Park, is what it really is," explained a directory assistance 
operator helpfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Lies. All lies, Richter says. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering just 18 city blocks and surrounded -- squashed, some would say -- by 
five other West Valley communities, Winnetka is one of the smallest townships 
in Los Angeles. And despite its lively beginnings as a Utopian chicken farm, it 
is one of the most forgotten -- by the history books, by census takers and even 
by some who live there. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Domine, now president of the Winnetka Chamber of Commerce, grew up smack 
in the middle of the community. But he was thirtysomething before he learned 
just which community that was. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day one of my customers told me this was Winnetka and not Canoga Park," 
the business owner says. "All those years I thought it was Canoga Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say the reasons for the community's relative anonymity and often 
mistaken identity are many: its simple, agrarian roots (they are not given to 
bragging), the lack of newsworthy events (Northridge has its earthquake, Reseda 
was home to "The Karate Kid"), and its diminutive size. 
</P>
<P>
 But the old-timers all point in the same direction when explaining the primary 
cause of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The post office done it," blurts Winnetka Honorary Mayor Art Hieber. 
</P>
<P>
 As Hieber, who says he's "five years older than dirt," and others tell it, the 
lines and loyalties began to grow fuzzy during the Eisenhower era, when the 
increasingly modern Canoga Park post office offered the first "mounted 
delivery" in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Door-to-door service, they promised the Winnetkans. No more daily trips to the 
local post office. But on one Faustian condition: Keep your 91306 ZIP code. And 
keep your street address, just tell people to address your mail "Canoga Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who insisted on living in "Winnetka," however, would still have to pick 
up their mail in person. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents jumped ship in droves. Who lives where -- and what is what -- has 
been in question ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 But the community -- bordered by Nordhoff Street on the north, Victory 
Boulevard on the south, Corbin Avenue on the east and De Soto Avenue on the 
west -- was an anomaly from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 The brainchild of a philosopher-cum-chicken farmer who had also helped develop 
Winnetka, Ill., the town was first deemed "Weeks' Colony," in honor of its 
founder, Charles Weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A back-to-the-land proponent in the style of Henry David Thoreau, Weeks began 
developing the community in 1920. He envisioned a settlement of educated, 
artistic naturalists in a town to be part commune, part farm, part business 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Each one-acre lot would have 2,500 laying hens, a house set back 100 feet from 
the road, a straight line of well-groomed fruit trees and a clover lawn to draw 
bees for pollination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here in these sequestered garden homes man may attain that serenity conducive 
to the gentlest arts and thus be able to reveal new worlds of joy and emotion," 
Weeks wrote in his typical style, melding flowery prose and huckster-like 
salesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1924, nearly 500 families had signed on, and the town blossomed. They 
established schools, a community center and the Weeks Colony Orchestra, 
in-between gathering the eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 In his desire to see the community flourish, however, Weeks himself helped 
underwrite many of the colonists' loans. And when the Great Depression hit, the 
bill collectors came calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks left the state in 1934, and as his colony lost focus, members gave up 
the name Weeks. The area became known as Winnetka, and fairly well-known at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the big-time Canoga Park post office showed up with its newfangled 
delivery trucks, spreading a confusion that would only grow murkier as families 
came and went and forgot just where exactly was Winnetka. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have people talking about Canoga Park ending on one street, and others 
talking about Winnetka starting on another," said Juan Rodriguez, field deputy 
from City Councilwoman Laura Chick's office, which oversees much of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In all fairness, it should be made clear that current Canoga Park Postmaster 
Mike Madrigal had no hand in any alleged postal name trading. He'd never even 
heard such a story and says that, as far as he's concerned, it's quite 
irrelevant. He'll get your mail to you regardless, as long as the ZIP code is 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnetka, Canoga, "It doesn't matter to us," Madrigal says. 
</P>
<P>
 When many Valley neighborhoods began breaking away from their communities in 
the 1980s -- to distance themselves from community names that they believed 
connoted high crime or low rent -- Winnetkans began once again to assert their 
identity. After all, part of Canoga Park was re-christened West Hills, and 
Sepulveda ceased to exist altogether. The Winnetkans, meanwhile, already had 
their own name and figured it was time people knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 At their urging, the city hung shiny blue Welcome-to-Winnetka signs along the 
"border." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce in mailings prompts businesses to "Add a touch of 
class, use the name in your address." 
</P>
<P>
 And Honorary Mayor Hieber -- who still raises chickens and hands out business 
cards that read "Winnetka -- the of the Valley" -- published 12,500 booklets a 
couple years back detailing Winnetka's eclectic beginnings and proper 
boundaries. He delivered them door-to-door, postal-style, to every house in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me a whole year," Hieber says. "Wore out four pairs of shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 His devotion is understandable, especially when you consider the etymology of 
the word itself. Winnetka comes from the Potawatomi Indian language. It means 
beautiful place. Winnetka facts: Population: 35,000 to 40,000. Zip Code: 91306 
covers all of Winnetka and parts of Canoga Park. Size: 18 city blocks. Founder: 
Charles Weeks, a chicken farmer who also developed communities in Winnetka, 
Ill. and Palo Alto.

SUSPECTS IN '93 FIRE FILE CLAIMS; LAW: FIREFIGHTERS NAMED IN MALIBU BLAZE LIST 
DEFAMATION ACTION AGAINST COUNTY AND SHERIFF AS PRELUDE TO A SUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two firefighters who were publicly implicated as arson suspects in last year's 
deadly Malibu blaze -- but never prosecuted -- have filed legal claims against 
Los Angeles County and Sheriff Sherman Block, saying Block ruined their careers 
through politically motivated grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Nicholas A. Durepo and Steven R. Shelp pursue their defamation 
case, a federal arson investigator said Thursday that they remain suspects in a 
continuing probe into the Nov. 2 brush fire, which killed three people and 
destroyed more than 300 homes, causing an estimated $325 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not eliminated them as suspects," said Larry Cornelison, who 
supervises the arson-explosives task force of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not elaborate, declining to say whether there were other suspects or 
give other details, but said the bureau was investigating the fire "on the 
premise that it was arson." If enough evidence is collected, it will be 
presented to a federal grand jury, Cornelison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry R. Feldman, a lawyer for Durepo and Shelp, contended they were innocent 
victims of Block, who Feldman characterized as a powerful public figure who was 
seeking reelection when he prematurely disclosed on national TV that the two 
were under suspicion.  
</P>
<P>
 Even after the district attorney's office decided not to prosecute Shelp and 
Durepo last July, citing a lack of evidence, Block continued to harm the men's 
reputations by refusing to admit he was wrong, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheriff is stubborn and he gets away with this and most people are just 
happy to be out of the criminal system and let it go," said Feldman, who filed 
the claims against Block and the county on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real test case to determine whether we're going to hold public 
officials with all this power responsible for ruining people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the decision by the district attorney's office, a county grand 
jury also declined to indict the firefighters last summer after weeks of 
testimony -- including that of a contractor who corroborated their alibi when 
he said he provided a special adapter needed to connect their water hose to a 
hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The two young firefighters -- Durepo is 24 and Shelp is 29 -- have steadfastly 
maintained their innocence, saying they were driving along Old Topanga Canyon 
Road in Calabasas, off-duty, when the fire began and they tried to put it out 
with equipment they had at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 News crews arriving at the site of the rapidly spreading flames photographed 
them hosing down a burn victim as they labored to extinguish the beginning of 
the blaze that went on to consume thousands of acres of brush between Topanga 
Canyon and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 But Block, when he identified the two men as prime suspects in the case, said 
arson investigators had strong circumstantial evidence against them and 
believed they had set the fire so they could put it out, look like heroes and 
enhance their fledgling careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he did not name the two during a nationally televised interview May 
4, Block described them and their actions in sufficient detail to enable news 
reporters to deduce who they were and publicize their identities, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that Block's interview on NBC took place a month before he was 
up for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't name them by name but he named them by description, so within 
minutes, every news station and print media knew exactly who it was," Feldman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said he did not blame news organizations for his clients' ordeal 
because "their job is to print what the sheriff said." 
</P>
<P>
 He also credited news reporters and photographers with tracking down a picture 
of the long-anonymous contractor, who authorities earlier dismissed as 
nonexistent. It was the publication of the photo -- not the Sheriff's 
Department's investigation -- that brought forward the contractor and his 
crucial testimony supporting the two men's version of events, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then afterwards, instead of being a gentleman and saying 'I was wrong,' 
he just stonewalls it," Feldman said of Block. "He won't admit his error." 
</P>
<P>
 Block still stood fast this week, saying through a spokesman that his 
department's investigation had been "complete, thorough and professional." 
</P>
<P>
 "He never named them, the media did," said Deputy George Ducoulombier. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrative claims filed against Block and the county this week -- for 
defamation, invasion of privacy and denial of due process -- are a necessary 
step before Shelp and Durepo can sue them. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county does not respond to the claims within 45 days, the firefighters 
can file suit in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Durepo, who lives in the South Bay area, was working as a part-time reservist 
for the Manhattan Beach and Culver City fire departments when news of the arson 
investigation against him led to his termination at both departments, Feldman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now performing a variety of odd jobs -- "from cleaning pools to working 
in retail stores" -- to earn a living, according to Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shelp of Northridge was a recently hired Los Angeles City firefighter who was 
confined to desk duty as a result of Block's disclosures, although he had been 
valedictorian of his fire academy class, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he still has a job and a salary, Feldman said, Shelp has no chance 
to earn overtime pay, his career is indefinitely stalled and he is "overall 
frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men tried unsuccessfully to get back their old duties after the district 
attorney declined to prosecute, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they want," he said, "are their reputations restored and their careers 
back."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUDGE SAYS 
HE DOUBTS GUILT OF OFFICERS IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge in the trial of two off-duty Los Angeles policemen accused of firing 
at a Highway Patrol officer during a drunken shooting spree said Thursday that 
he is unconvinced of their guilt and added that unless more compelling evidence 
comes out, he will overturn any conviction by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarks by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge George Trammell III came as 
prosecutors rested their case against Ted Teyechea and Michael Herrera, 
nine-year veterans of the Los Angeles Police Department who are charged with 
assault with a deadly weapon, shooting at an occupied vehicle and negligent 
discharge of a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Trammell, who spoke outside the presence of the jury, made the comments as he 
was ruling against a defense motion to dismiss the case, saying he does believe 
the officers discharged their firearms negligently in the Feb. 9 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he added that the account of a California Highway Patrol officer -- 
who testified that he could see the powder flash and hear the bullets zing by 
as the officers fired on him and other vehicles during a car chase on the 
Harbor Freeway -- was "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he doubts that more serious charges would be upheld by a jury.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 MEN ARRESTED, 1,900 
POUNDS OF DRUGS SEIZED IN RAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Narcotics officers raided a complex of shacks and trailers in a remote area 
west of Hesperia and seized 1,900 pounds of methamphetamine with a projected 
street value of $190 million, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The raid, which was carried out Wednesday, culminated a two-day investigation 
that started in Los Angeles. It was the largest seizure of methamphetamine in 
department history, said Los Angeles Police Lt. Frank Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug laboratory had operated for several months, Valdez said. Because of 
the size of the operation, investigators speculate that the methamphetamine, 
known as speed, was intended for drug wholesalers in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 Two suspects were arrested and booked at Parker Center on suspicion of 
manufacturing a controlled substance. Each was being held in lieu of $500,000 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Rubalcava, 51, who was believed to be in charge of the drug lab 
operations, was arrested at the scene, where he apparently lived in a trailer. 
Jorge Cerpas, 27, was arrested at his residence in San Bernardino. Police say 
he provided the chemicals needed to manufacture the drug, Valdez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez said the size of the operation was surprising, especially in light of 
how quickly the investigation panned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no inkling it would be anything that large," he said. "We've been on 
cases for three months and have come up empty." 
</P>
<P>
 The lab was alongside a dirt road in the unincorporated San Bernardino County 
community of Phelan.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were no neighbors, no running water and no electricity -- they had 
generators coming out the ying-yang," Valdez said. "What we had were a bunch of 
little shacks made out of things like garage doors and dilapidated trailers." 
</P>
<P>
 Narcotics officers found some of the methamphetamine buried in plastic bags. 
But it was not until forensic scientists examined beakers several hours later 
that they discovered the bulk of their haul: liquid methamphetamine that was 
one step away from being turned into white, powdery crystals for street 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Other arrests are expected, Valdez said. TOM GORMAN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COURT RULES AGAINST CITY DRUG TEST POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case that could prevent all California cities and public agencies from 
screening potential employees for illegal drugs unless the public's safety 
could be threatened, a state appeals court has struck down a major portion of 
the city of Glendale's drug testing policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union called the decision a victory for personal 
privacy. The ACLU filed the lawsuit in 1986 on behalf of a woman who objected 
to the city's then-new practice of requiring all job finalists or employees 
seeking promotions to take urine tests. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys for the city said they may seek a new trial or even ask the 
state Supreme Court to consider the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pursued this case because Glendale's drug-testing policy was a clear abuse 
of power," said Marvin Krakow, an ACLU attorney. "We've begun to recognize as a 
society that 'Dragnet'-style testing doesn't deal with substance abuse. It is a 
chemical witch hunt, and the courts have begun to concur." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale has about 1,600 employees that fall within several hundred job 
categories. During a long trial at the Superior Court level, the city was 
forced to justify why it required a drug test for each position, from file 
clerk to firefighter to police officer to shop mechanic to city manager.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the court ruled that the city could require applicants for roughly 
80% of its jobs to submit to drug testing. But both the ACLU and the city 
appealed the verdict, with the ACLU seeking a broader injunction and the city 
contending that none of its drug-testing policy should be banned. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Scott Howard said Thursday that the 2nd District Court of Appeal's 
decision "essentially eroded" the city's ability to test employment and 
promotion candidates for drugs from about 80% of its jobs down to about 50%.  
</P>
<P>
 The appellate court redlined dozens of job categories for which the lower 
court had ruled drug testing was acceptable, and said that "drug testing is 
valid only as to positions in which the regular duties involve some special or 
obvious physical or ethical demand," according to court documents.  
</P>
<P>
 The court did not rule out drug testing for police officers, jobs involving 
heavy driving and other positions where the potential threat to public safety 
outweighs an individual's right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Howard said the city will probably pursue the matter either by seeking a 
new trial at the Superior Court level or asking the state's highest court for a 
hearing. He contended that the appeals court, which handed down its decision 
Monday, held the city up to different standards than private companies, whose 
rights to conduct blanket drug testing have been upheld repeatedly in the 
courts.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think job applicants should have a greater expectation that they're 
going to be tested for drugs in the public sector versus the private sector," 
Howard said. "I also think the taxpayers have an interest in ensuring the 
employees hired by the city are not drug users." STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: GROUND BROKEN FOR $11-MILLION COLLEGE LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It started out in a tiny classroom in San Fernando, then moved to a bank, then 
to a five-and-dime store, and finally to the basement of the student center at 
Los Angeles Mission College's new Sylmar campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for the first time ever, the school's library will have a building of its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never worked in a library that was meant to be a library," said Rayma 
Greenberg, head librarian for the college. "This is so exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Greenberg joined fellow faculty members, administrators and 
community leaders to break ground for the college's $11-million library and 
learning resources center at the campus on Eldridge Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony also marked the beginning of the college's 20th anniversary 
celebration, a reminder to many of how much the college has changed since it 
began holding classes in scattered storefronts in San Fernando in February, 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Torres, a field representative for Councilman Richard Alarcon, pointed 
out that the center will add 400 new computers for students, giving them access 
to the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that long ago I was a student taking courses at Mission College 
near meat markets in San Fernando," said Torres, who attended the school from 
1988 to 1990, before the Sylmar campus opened in 1991. "Now there's going to be 
an off-ramp on the superhighway that says 'Eldridge.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Participants celebrated the event by digging into the soft earth with 13 
golden shovels, breaking ground for the new, three-level facility in the heart 
of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a library, the 57,000-square-foot building will include 
computer, tutoring and teleconferencing centers, as well as an audiovisual 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by a state bond measure approved by voters in 1992, the facility will 
also house a fully automated library about three times larger than the current 
makeshift library and contain about 20% more books. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though the facility is not expected to open until 1997, students on 
campus Thursday said they are glad it is getting under way now for future 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when the material we need isn't at the library we have to go out of 
our way to get it for our papers," said Monica Escobar, 21, a second-year 
student from Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 But college President Jack Fujimoto sees the new center providing a helping 
hand for an older generation of learners, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see senior citizens in the area get involved with the computers," 
Fujimoto said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WEST HILLS; STUDENTS SEND AID TO SCHOOL BY THE VOLUMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inside a copy of "The Castle in the Attic," LaRue Floyd, 10, found a letter 
written in pencil.  
</P>
<P>
 Signed by a girl named Emily George, it read: 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you like the book. I'm really sorry what happened. I live in Erie. I 
wish I could be there to help. Enjoy the sun. We do not get much." 
</P>
<P>
 The volume was one of the more than 600 pounds of children's books sent to 
students at Hamlin Street Elementary School in West Hills by elementary and 
junior high school students in Erie, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, the Mill Creek School 
District in Erie started a drive to collect books for a quake-damaged San 
Fernando Valley school. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Nourbakhsh, a PTA representative at Belle Valley Elementary School in 
Erie, said she had heard that Hamlin was one of the many schools that had to be 
closed for two weeks because of the quake. So Hamlin was chosen as the 
recipient of the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw the need (Hamlin had) to be replenished with books," Nourbakhsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pennsylvania school district called the book drive, "Tales from the East," 
and pooled the efforts of its students and local bookstores for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The 600 pounds of books collected arrived by truck at Hamlin elementary 
earlier this month. They were divided into hard-covers, which will go into the 
school library, and paperbacks, of which students are allowed to pick one to 
read and then put into their classroom collection. 
</P>
<P>
 A tag in each book is printed with the name of the Pennsylvania child who 
chose it and then raised the money to purchase it. Many of the books also 
carried letters with messages of friendship and concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's their allowance (that they spent to buy this book). They could have 
bought Nintendo games or a computer for their school. But they thought of us 
first and that's real nice," said Adir Biton, 10, who selected for his class, 
"The True Story of the Three Little Pigs! by A. Wolf." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlin Principal Donna Wheeler said her students will write back to the Erie 
students in a pen-pal exchange. She said she also will compile a scrapbook of 
pictures and thank you notes to send to the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so pleased. It's so thoughtful," Wheeler said. "This will make them 
(Hamlin students) feel the earthquake is over and we can get back to feeling 
things are OK." MAKI BECKER

 Environmental organizations in the United States have, of late, suffered from 
financial difficulties, decreases in membership and a lack of supportive 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 With a budget deficit of several million dollars, the Sierra Club, the 
nation's oldest environmental organization, is in its worst financial shape in 
20 years. Its local membership has dropped by 15% over the last three years. 
Recently, Greenpeace also reported its membership down 1 million from its 1990 
high of 2.5 million, with revenues steadily declining. Some attribute these 
weak figures to our nation's economy, in which monetary concerns supersede 
environmental. Others simply claim a growing complacency toward the 
environmental movement as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the environmental movement losing momentum? 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Recalde, coordinator, Reseda High School Environmental/Physical Sciences 
Magnet Center 
</P>
<P>
 "People these days are finding their niche when it comes to improving the 
environment, and some practices, like recycling or composting, have become a 
matter of course in their lives. . . . Field work, though, is still very 
important. We took our students to clean up a local creek so they could see 
firsthand how important it is to be environmentally responsible. Now, they're 
talking about adopting the creek on behalf of the school, which may turn out to 
be a great graduating thesis project for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Stauss, finance chairman, San Fernando Valley chapter, National Audubon 
Society 
</P>
<P>
 "Our local chapter has nearly 100 active members who are just as active now as 
they were five or 10 years ago. Our local chapter is not a fund-raising 
organization, but more of a social group of people who have a common interest 
in bird-watching. . . . We try to work on an educational basis by providing 
books and other information to local schools. Other than that, our main focus 
is just enjoying nature."  
</P>
<P>
 Fred Krupp, executive director, Environmental Defense Fund 
</P>
<P>
 "In these tough economic times, it is vital to approach environmental concerns 
in the most efficient way possible. The general public is looking to get the 
most out of their buck and that goes for the environment, too. That's why 
people supported the Clean Air Act of 1990, (which rewards companies complying 
with clean air standards with salable pollution 'credits'). The trading 
provides incentives for companies to reduce their air emissions in the best way 
possible in order to obtain reduction credits to sell to other firms. With 
this, we get entrepreneurs and inventors working to do the right thing at the 
lowest cost possible."  
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Simila, coordinator, Cal State Northridge's earth science program in the 
geology department 
</P>
<P>
 "When people are concerned about losing their jobs and homes, it's hard for 
them to contribute to environmental groups because they must concentrate on 
their own private causes. In turn, there will be greater lobby pressure to 
delay environmental requirements. The county and the state have argued that in 
no way can businesses afford to meet California's air-quality standards. If 
they have to close down or leave California because they cannot meet tough 
air-quality standards, cities and the state will oppose it. Priorities are 
shifting because problems are shifting." 
</P>
<P>
 Francesca Walsh, office manager, Sierra Club Angeles chapter 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see it as an economy-versus-environment issue. If you have a good 
environment, you're going to have a good economy because nobody will want to 
live or do business in a place that's completely polluted."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PAIR PLEAD GUILTY IN TOY COMPANY FRAUD

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland Hills man and his former colleague have pleaded guilty to tax 
evasion and securities fraud in connection to siphoning more than $1 million 
from a Chatsworth toy company. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Benjamin, 57, of Woodland Hills and Steven Zuloff, 50, of Bel Air 
entered the pleas in federal court to two counts of tax evasion and one count 
of securities fraud, said Assistant U.S. Atty.Peter G. Spivack, who prosecuted 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuloff is the former president of With Design In Mind Inc. of Chatsworth, and 
Benjamin is the former secretary and treasurer of the company, which is 
publicly traded. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Spivack, the defendants diverted funds from With Design in Mind 
and used them to pay personal expenses.  
</P>
<P>
 This income was not listed on their tax returns, Spivack said, leading to a 
charge that Zuloff evaded approximately $69,938 in taxes and Benjamin evaded 
about $37,336. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin and Zuloff also admitted they diverted commission payment for sales 
of the company's products to their own bank accounts through a variety of 
means. 
</P>
<P>
 Spivack said the defendants agreed to make a combined restitution of 
$1,168,310, which is the amount they diverted from the company between 1988 and 
1991, Spivack said. So far, the defendants have repaid the company $250,000 and 
turned over 701,000 shares of stock that they own. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, both men face up to 20 years imprisonment and a $1.5-million fine 
for tax evasion and securities fraud. Sentencing will be Dec. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is a result of a joint investigation by the FBI and Internal Revenue 
Service. JEFF SCHNAUFER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; BANK 
ROBBERIES DOWN 50% IN 2 YEARS, FBI REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of bank robberies in Southern California has decreased 50% in the 
past two years, but the region remains the nation's bank robbery capital, the 
FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,300 bank robberies are expected to be committed in the seven-county 
Los Angeles region this year, down from 2,641 in 1992, said Charlie Parsons, 
FBI special agent in charge of the agency's Los Angeles office.By comparison, 
New York had about 400 robberies in 1992 and Chicago recorded 98. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics were announced at an FBI conference on bank crimes and 
financial industry fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the FBI assigned more agents to investigate bank robbery cases 
and targeted violent criminals, Parsons said. Many of the financial 
institutions took their own action, including the installation of sophisticated 
video cameras to identify criminals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although bank robberies are decreasing, some forms of fraud are on the rise, 
such as check fraud and mortgage fraud, in which loan applicants submit false 
financial data to secure credit.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles FBI office has 1,200 financial institution fraud cases pending 
that represent $4 billion in losses.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: STUDIO CITY; LEGAL 
AGREEMENT ENDS PARTY DAYS AT RENTED MANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The party's over at a Studio City mansion where advertised bashes attended by 
as many as 1,000 revelers drove neighbors to distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for the owner and a manager of the property Thursday agreed to a 
court order that will ban the illegal sale of alcohol, advertising and parties 
after 10 p.m. or with more than 25 people, according to Deputy City 
Atty.Deborah Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenant Jerry Bolduc, who staged many of the parties, said he had not read the 
agreement. But he said he understood that it merely required that neighbors be 
notified in advance of any bash.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Sanchez said the owner must enforce the new restrictions and begin 
eviction proceedings immediately if the tenants violate the deal. She said she 
expects a judge to sign a permanent injunction Oct. 17, resolving a lawsuit 
filed by her office against the mansion's owner, manager and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was signed by property manager Steven Powers and an attorney 
representing owner Paul Campbell, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors had begun complaining to police as early as 1990 about the mansion 
on the 3400 block of Wrightwood Drive. City prosecutors filed the lawsuit in 
August after police raids, parking citations and undercover efforts proved 
ineffective.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CONDITIONS 
AT INS LOCKUPS UNCONSTITUTIONAL, SUIT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conditions at U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service lockups in San Pedro 
and elsewhere violate constitutional standards, according to a lawsuit filed 
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The six plaintiffs, all of whom are being held at INS facilities awaiting 
deportation, are seeking certification of the case as a national class 
action.The detainees are also requesting a court order enjoining several 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the action charges that INS prisoners are wrongly held in 
isolation, provided with inadequate medical and dental care and exposed to 
detainees with contagious diseases. Those held are also denied sufficient 
exercise, visits with relatives and access to law books and telephones, the 
lawsuit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major challenge to INS detention practices and policies 
nationwide," said Peter A. Schey, who heads the Center for Human Rights and 
Constitutional Law, a Los Angeles-based legal advocacy organization handling 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Trubiano, an INS spokeswoman in Washington, said she had not heard of 
the lawsuit and could not comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; OFFICERS 
RAISING FUNDS FOR FAMILY OF ACCIDENT VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Los Angeles police officers are raising funds for the family of a 
7-year-old girl who was killed this week as she was walking to school with her 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, Lara and Gezella Ramirez were walking to school in San 
Pedro when a passing car's brakes failed, causing the driver to strike the two 
girls, ages 7 and 8.Lara was killed and Gezella was hospitalized and remains in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Curtis Jackson and Joe Barrera of the LAPD's South Traffic division 
began soliciting contributions from police officers Wednesday and toured the 
department's South Bureau police stations Thursday. Jackson said the money will 
go to help defray medical and funeral expenses and to buy Gezella a gift.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; CONSTRUCTION TO START ON 10-ACRE PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction is scheduled to begin next month in Agoura Hills on a new 10-acre 
park that includes a regional equestrian facility, city officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted Wednesday to award a contract for $618,465 to Terra Cal 
Construction Inc. for the first phase of the facility. The project could be 
complete by February. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been involved in a few such projects and I've never seen such a diverse 
group of people come together and work so well," said Jess Thomas, a member of 
the Old Agoura Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will replace a 2.75-acre facility built by the county and taken 
over by the city when it incorporated in 1982. City officials point out that no 
general funds will be used and that all costs will be paid through grants. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase, the equestrian center, will be located between Chesebro Road, 
Colodny Drive and Driver Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 That part of the project was made possible by a $600,000 grant from the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy. Additional funds will come from money raised 
under the Los Angeles County Park Bond Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding has also been obtained for a baseball field and a children's 
playground, said Audrey Brown, the city's director of community services. Funds 
are still being sought for a full-size basketball court and a 1,500-square-foot 
recreation building. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who was on a committee that spearheaded the park-construction effort, 
said the committee is considering naming a portion of the park after 
Councilwoman Fran Pavley, who was instrumental in obtaining the conservancy 
grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would only be a fitting tribute," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plans, the equestrian center would be free and open to users from 
throughout the region. It would be near a portion of the Zuma Ridge Trail, an 
equestrian trail running through the county. 
</P>
<P>
 To acquire land for the new park, the city traded the old park property to 
Chesebro Development Group for nine acres of land, Brown said. The city already 
owned one acre at the site. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CONCERT GROUP SEEKS WIDER AUDIENCE

<P>
 Even though it's been making music for 34 years, not many people have heard of 
the Glendale Community Concert Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the best-kept secret in Glendale," said Charles Hamer, president of the 
nonprofit group that hosts a series of concerts at the Glendale High School 
auditorium annually.This year the association -- which has about 1,700 
subscribers who pay $30 each for a season pass -- will hold six concerts 
between October and May. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerts have always been varied, ranging from Big Band to classical 
music, but Hamer said the organization is slowly trying to reach a wider 
audience and make its presence better known. Most of its subscribers are 
seniors.  
</P>
<P>
 To attract younger members and families, the upcoming programs will include a 
performance by the Shanghai Acrobats from the People's Republic of China on 
Nov. 27, the Banjomania banjo ensemble on Jan. 22, and a concert by Armenian 
organist Aram Basmadjian on April 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited about the upcoming season, and we also just got word that next 
year we'll have a concert by the Royal Army Band of Great Britain," Hamer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's program committee selects acts from those offered by a New 
York-based talent agency. The association spends up to $10,000 to stage each 
event -- a far cry from the $750 fee it paid to violinist Itzhak Perlman about 
30 years ago. STEVE RYFLE

FEDERAL GRAND JURY INDICTS 15 IN WESTSIDE DRUG RING PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury this week indicted 15 high-ranking Westside gang members 
and associates for drug trafficking, the U.S. attorney's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges came after an extensive, two-year joint investigation by the FBI, 
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, and the Los Angeles Police 
Department.If convicted of the most serious charge -- trafficking in crack 
cocaine -- four of the defendants could face life without parole in federal 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect (these indictments) to have a big effect on crime in the area," 
said Assistant U.S. Atty. John J. Byrne. "These are among the most active crack 
cocaine traffickers in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants include reputed leaders of two prominent gangs, the Shoreline 
Crips, who operate in the Oakwood neighborhood of Venice, and the Schoolyard 
Crips, who dominate the Mid-Wilshire area. All the defendants are in custody 
except one, who is being sought, Byrne said. He declined to release the 
suspect's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Those indicted include Clifford Ray Featherstone, 37, and his brother, 
Christopher Anthony Featherstone, 35; Vincent Dewain Hamm, 28; Robert Cleotha 
Brown, 29; Michael Joel Davis, 26; William Earl Jones, 31; John Derrick Tyree, 
34; Harrison Walcott Smith, 31; Henry Brown, Jr., 29; Dwayne White, 24, and 
Michelle Stacy, 26.

FIREFIGHTERS NAMED IN MALIBU BLAZE FILE CLAIMS AGAINST COUNTY; ARSON: THEY SAY 
SHERIFF BLOCK RUINED THEIR CAREERS BY RELEASING INFORMATION THAT LED TO THEIR 
IDENTIFICATION BY MEDIA. A FEDERAL OFFICIAL SAYS THE TWO ARE STILL SUSPECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two firefighters who were publicly implicated as arson suspects in last year's 
deadly Malibu blaze -- but never prosecuted -- have filed legal claims against 
Los Angeles County, saying Sheriff Sherman Block ruined their careers with 
politically motivated grandstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Nicholas A. Durepo and Steven R. Shelp pursue their defamation 
case, a federal arson investigator said Thursday that they remain suspects in a 
continuing probe into the November brush fire, which killed three people and 
destroyed more than 300 homes, causing an estimated $325 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not eliminated them as suspects," said Larry Cornelison, who 
supervises the arson-explosives task force of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not elaborate, declining to say whether there are other suspects, but 
said the bureau is investigating the fire "on the premise that it was arson." 
If enough evidence is collected, it will be presented to a federal grand jury, 
Cornelison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry R. Feldman, a lawyer for Durepo and Shelp, contended that they were 
innocent victims of Sheriff Block, whom Feldman characterized as a powerful 
public figure who was seeking reelection when he prematurely disclosed on 
national TV that they were under suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the district attorney's office decided not to prosecute Shelp and 
Durepo last July, citing a lack of evidence, Block continued to harm the men's 
reputations by refusing to admit he was wrong, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a real test case to determine whether we're going to hold public 
officials with all this power responsible for ruining people's lives," the 
lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 A county grand jury also declined to indict the firefighters last summer after 
weeks of testimony -- including that of a contractor who corroborated their 
alibi when he said he provided a special adapter needed to connect their water 
hose to a hydrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Durepo, 24, and Shelp, 29, have steadfastly maintained their innocence, saying 
they were driving along Old Topanga Canyon Road in Calabasas, off duty, when 
the fire began and they tried to put it out with equipment they had at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 News crews arriving at the site of the rapidly spreading flames photographed 
them hosing down a burn victim as they tried to put out the beginning of the 
blaze that went on to consume thousands of acres of brush between Topanga 
Canyon and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 But Block, when he identified the two men as prime suspects in the case, said 
investigators had strong circumstantial evidence against them and believed they 
had set the fire so they could enhance their fledgling careers by putting it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he did not name the two during a nationally televised interview May 
4, Block described them and their actions in sufficient detail to enable news 
reporters to deduce who they were and publicize their identities, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that Block's interview on NBC took place a month before he was 
up for reelection. "He didn't name them by name but he named them by 
description," Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did not blame news organizations for his clients' ordeal because 
"their job is to print what the sheriff said." He also credited news reporters 
and photographers with tracking down a picture of the long-anonymous 
contractor, who authorities earlier dismissed as nonexistent. It was 
publication of the photo that brought forward the contractor and his crucial 
testimony supporting the two men's version of events, Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then afterward, instead of being a gentleman and saying 'I was wrong,' he 
just stonewalls it," Feldman said of Block. 
</P>
<P>
 Block stood fast, saying through a spokesman that his department's 
investigation had been "complete, thorough and professional." 
</P>
<P>
 "He never named them, the media did," Deputy George Ducoulombier said of 
Block. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrative claims filed against Block and the county this week -- for 
defamation, invasion of privacy and denial of due process -- are a necessary 
step before Shelp and Durepo can sue. If the county does not respond within 45 
days, the firefighters can file suit in Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Durepo, from the South Bay area, was working as a part-time reservist for the 
Manhattan Beach and Culver City fire departments when news of the arson 
investigation led to his termination at both departments, Feldman said. He is 
now doing odd jobs, "from cleaning pools to working in retail stores," Feldman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelp, of the San Fernando Valley, was a recently hired Los Angeles 
firefighter who was confined to desk duty as a result of Block's disclosures, 
the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelp still has a job and salary, Feldman said, but his career is indefinitely 
stalled.

CITY REFUSES TO PICK UP TAB FOR $5,000 FAREWELL LUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years after Harbor Commissioner Jun Mori retired from office, city 
officials are still bickering over who will pay for his $5,000 going-away 
luncheon. 
</P>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle on Thursday sent a letter requesting that the City 
Council force the harbor department to pick up the tab by collecting private 
funds from those who attended the 1992 send-off at the port. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor officials have repeatedly asked that the city controller's office use 
harbor user fees to pay for the gathering -- attended by more than 60 city 
officials at $78 a person. Among those on the guest list were former Mayor Tom 
Bradley and six members of his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The company that catered the event, which came complete with a chef and seven 
waiters, has filed a claim against the city to recoup its expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the harbor has done has gone so far beyond the norm," said Timothy B. 
Lynch, deputy city controller. "It is unprecedented to be having retirement 
lunches paid for by the public. That just isn't what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 But harbor general manager Ezunial Burts defended the port's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Burts said Mori "made a tremendous contribution to this organization. He was 
instrumental in landing major accounts. He helped bring in tens of millions of 
dollars in revenue annually. He was highly respected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me a going-away luncheon is perfectly legitimate and 
justifiable," Burts added. "There is nothing that is out of the ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Two council members said Thursday that they are outraged that officials want 
to use harbor funds for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pig-out at the public's expense," Councilman Joel Wachs said. "It's 
disgusting. I've been here 23 years, and I have never seen a party that people 
don't pay for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said: "I think this shows very poor judgment. As 
far as I know, taxpayers are not supposed to pay for people's retirement 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
 The council could act next month on Tuttle's proposal. The controller is also 
asking the council to pass a measure making it clear that people who attend 
retirement parties should pay their own way. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how other departments do it," Lynch said.

LAX ARRIVALS WARNED ON SIGNS OF PLAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It seemed a bit out of place against the backdrop of modern-day jets, but 
passengers coming to Los Angeles International Airport from India received 
warnings Thursday to watch out for signs they had been exposed to plague, the 
deadly disease that ravaged Europe during the Middle Ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal health officers handed out "plague alert" notices to passengers 
arriving on the one flight a day from India, a Delta Air Lines jet. It warned 
them to seek medical treatment if they develop plague-like symptoms, including 
nausea, vomiting and fever. Immigration officers also were issuing the warnings 
to Indian immigrants arriving on other flights. 
</P>
<P>
 As is always required, flight attendants on all international flights have 
been instructed to notify health officials of all on-board illnesses. So far, 
there have been no reports in Los Angeles or any other U.S. city of any 
passengers with symptoms of the disease, according to health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Pneumonic plague -- a strain of the bubonic plague or "Black Death" that 
killed an estimated 25 million people, or one quarter of the population of 
Europe during the 14th Century -- has killed at least 48 people in India since 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Shirley Fannin, director of disease control for the Los Angeles County 
Department of Health Services, said earlier this week that she alerted hospital 
emergency rooms to be on the lookout for the disease. She also is preparing a 
contingency plan in the event of an outbreak here. 
</P>
<P>
 The bubonic form of the disease is spread to humans by fleas that have bitten 
infected rats; the pneumonic form is transmitted from one human to another. 
Both forms of the disease have been reported in India, the health warning says. 
</P>
<P>
 People who are infected with the pneumonic form suffer high fevers, vomit 
blood and their lungs fill with fluid. Death occurs within three to four days. 
Despite its deadly reputation, plague can be cured if a victim is treated 
promptly with antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 The notice says that the incubation period of plague is usually two to seven 
days and advises anyone arriving from India who develops a fever to consult a 
physician.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; POLICE OPEN STATION AT RECREATION CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His jacket covering the patches of sweat spreading on his dress shirt, Mayor 
Richard Riordan joined other city officials Thursday in opening a new community 
policing center at Valley Plaza Recreation Center, the first such center in a 
San Fernando Valley park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should all be proud of this place," said Riordan, who showed up early for 
the dedication ceremony and opted to get into a two-on-two pickup basketball 
game before the event. The mayor's side lost 10-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was something wrong with the basketball hoop," Riordan joked afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighbors, police and other officials were more excited by the new police 
station than Riordan's adventure on the courts. The two bicycle-patrolling 
police officers and the senior lead officer working out of the park eight hours 
a week will help deter crime, give the community easy access to police and help 
police respond better to potential trouble spots, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park facility is the second community police station opened by the Los 
Angeles Police Department's North Hollywood Division this year. The first is at 
the Sun Valley Chamber of Commerce offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Richard Wahler, commander of the North Hollywood Division, said plans 
are to have other stations set up elsewhere in North Hollywood and in Studio 
City and Valley Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it creates a safe and welcoming atmosphere in the park," Councilman 
Joel Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Whitworth, a police community representative who lives near the park, 
said the center will give local Neighborhood Watch groups a central meeting 
place, and serve as a way for residents to work out problems with police long 
before authorities have to take official action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for pulling people together," she said. "When we're trying to get 
people involved it's easier if we can have a central location." 
</P>
<P>
 David Mills, another police community representative, said that having the 
center at the park will help allay fears some residents have about the police. 
"Some people are too scared to come down to the police station," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city officials said they hope police working in the park will cause 
the youths who play there to see officers in a more positive light. 
</P>
<P>
 Wahler said the center will not necessarily improve police response times to 
crimes in the neighborhood, but the closer contact with the community will help 
officers plan patrols of potential trouble spots better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes even when there isn't a problem, our presence helps the community 
feel more comfortable," Wahler said. To reach the new station, call (818) 
756-7674. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; NEIGHBORS GET THEIR WISH FOR TRAFFIC LIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For four years, Ray Jackson estimates, Pacoima residents begged Los Angeles 
for a traffic light at the T-shaped intersection of Vaughn Street and Foothill 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, president of the Northeast Valley Community Improvement Assn., said 
residents even offered to pay for the light out of an amenities fund 
established by Lopez Canyon Landfill for surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The light was badly needed, Jackson said, because of heavy traffic from the 
nearby San Fernando Swap Meet on weekends and Tuesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it looks as though the light will be installed, allowing residents of 
northeast Pacoima to leave and enter their neighborhood in an orderly and 
timely fashion. The light has been placed on the "fast track" for 
implementation of traffic improvements, said a spokesman for Los Angeles City 
Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 And the cost -- $70,000 -- will come out of the city's pocketbook, not the 
amenities fund, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At an upcoming meeting of the improvement association, Jackson will discuss 
the traffic light and other public works projects needed in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to talk about other improvements in the community," Jackson said. 
"We need more street lights; we need to discuss our Neighborhood Watch and 
police patrol. People can come to the meeting and express their problems; maybe 
we can do something about them." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, open to the public, will be held at 7 p.m. Tuesday at the 
Pepsi-Cola Bottling Plant, 1200 Arroyo Ave., San Fernando. TIM MAY

TRIAL HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A look at some of the key events in the murder trial of O.J. Simpson on 
Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Summary: Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito gave the final group of 
prospective jurors detailed questionnaires probing their views on an array of 
topics that might be relevant to the trial. A total of 304 prospective jurors 
have completed the documents and are expected to begin undergoing questioning 
by Ito and the lawyers starting Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 * Court action: A defense motion opposing sequestration of the jury was 
unsealed. In it, Simpson's lawyers cite the "folklore that a sequestered jury 
is a convicting jury." 
</P>
<P>
 * Outside the court: Scores of television crews that have set up outside the 
Criminal Courts Building temporarily pulled out of their encampments. No more 
hearings in the Simpson case are scheduled until Wednesday.

IS $20,000 A STRETCH FOR SIMPSON LIMO? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way he sees it, he didn't sell his story to the Star or grant an exclusive 
interview to "Hard Copy" or make up trading cards or anything like that. But 
now, Dale St. John figures it is time to sell off a piece of the O.J. Simpson 
murder story. 
</P>
<P>
 The limousine that took Simpson to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John, the owner of Town and Country Limousine in Torrance, said Thursday 
that he has decided to sell the stretch 1988 Lincoln Towncar that drove Simpson 
to the airport the night Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her 
friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to sell it over the last couple days, but I've been thinking about 
it for the last six months," St. John said. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to sell it now, St. John said, for two reasons. "It's not the newer 
model, the trendy car," he said. "And there is the fact it was involved in the 
murder case. I mean, I think it is a selling point." 
</P>
<P>
 St. John, who was not driving the limo the night it took Simpson to the 
airport, had counted the football legend among his regular clients. And after 
shuttling Simpson to and from airports and to special events as often as three 
times a week during the football season, St. John said, he is convinced that 
Simpson is innocent of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment aside, he says it is time to sell the Lincoln, which has 
160,000 miles, the last of them figuring in one of the most widely watched 
murder cases in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it seems untimely to do it now, but why should I not take advantage of 
this fact?" said St. John, who said he has turned down tens of thousands of 
dollars in offers to sell his story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not cashing in. I am not selling out. I am simply selling a car," he 
said. "If it happens to be worth more money than before because of the O.J. 
Simpson murder case, so be it. But I am simply selling a car." 
</P>
<P>
 The minimum bid for the vehicle -- to be sold through a silent auction -- is 
$20,000.

MAN ARRESTED IN SHOOTING DEATHS OUTSIDE NIGHTCLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police Thursday night arrested a Sylmar man they said fired into a 
crowd outside a popular nightclub, killing a 17-year-old boy and a 20-year-old 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Casas, 21, was arrested at his house after he was identified by witnesses 
to the shooting, Detective Frank Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said George Beltran of Arleta and Maria Theresa Hernandez of Sun Valley 
were among a group of people who quarreled with another group, including Casas, 
inside El Girasol, a nightclub at 13545 Van Nuys Blvd., about 12:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The group left the bar and walked north on Van Nuys Boulevard when Casas 
appeared and shot Beltran and Hernandez, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Casas) came back with a gun and shot into the crowd, but they happened to be 
in front," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beltran died at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, and Hernandez died at Holy 
Cross Medical Center, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group they were with were drinking, there was some kind of altercation 
with another group, and later there was the shooting," Bishop said. "We don't 
know if the (victims) had been drinking or if they were involved in the 
argument." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on a tip, police recovered the alleged weapon involved, a 9-millimeter 
pistol, from a friend of Casas, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casas was being held without bail on suspicion of murder, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the patrons at El Girasol on Wednesday night did not know there was a 
quarrel going on, said Jesus Payan, the nightclub's bartender.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was working, and I didn't know what was happening," he said. "We didn't 
know about it until the police came in later. . . . We said we didn't see 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the area of Pacoima bounded by the Simi Valley Freeway, Whiteman 
Air Park, Glenoaks Boulevard and Haddon Avenue had 12 homicides -- more than 
any other area in the Valley, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, there have been fewer than five. 
</P>
<P>
 But police said the neighborhood's mix of liquor outlets, illicit drug sales 
and gangs has fueled a recent surge in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of bars, a lot of dope dealing, a lot of alcohol," said Bishop. 
"And then people get into these hassles and end up getting shot."

COURT ORDER CURBS PARTIES AT NOTORIOUS MANSION; STUDIO CITY: IT REGULATES 
ALCOHOL SALES, ADVERTISING AND IMPOSES 10 P.M. CURFEW. TENANT REMAINS 
UNDAUNTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Everybody agreed Thursday that the party's over at a Studio City mansion where 
advertised bashes attended by as many as 1,000 revelers drove neighbors to 
distraction -- everybody, that is, except the host. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for the owner and a manager of the property agreed Thursday to a 
court order that will ban the illegal sale of alcohol, advertising and parties 
after 10 p.m. or with more than 25 people at the $2.1-million home, according 
to Deputy City Atty. Deborah Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 But tenant Jerry Bolduc, who has staged many of the offending parties, scoffed 
at the claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to agree to a curfew and having 25 people," Bolduc said. "Those 
weren't the terms of my rental agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't tell me I have to be in bed by 10. Get serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Bolduc, who had not read a copy of the agreement, said he understood that it 
merely required that he and other tenants put their neighbors on notice when 
they plan to throw a bash. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the owner must enforce the new restrictions and begin 
eviction proceedings immediately if the tenants violate the deal and a solution 
can't be reached, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Sanchez said she expects a judge to sign the permanent 
injunction Oct. 17, resolving a lawsuit filed by her office against the 
mansion's owner, manager and tenants. Sanchez said that anyone violating the 
provisions could be subject to citation and arrest for contempt of court. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was signed by property manager Steven Powers and by an attorney 
representing owner Paul Campbell, Sanchez said. Bolduc said he had signed 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the mansion at 3240 Wrightwood Drive has been the subject of more 
than 100 complaints filed with the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Party-goers would block their driveways, run parking shuttles up and down 
their narrow road, hold elaborate theme parties and copulate and urinate on 
their lawns and play music at all hours of the night, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to pull the plug on the raucous activities, the city attorney's 
office sued the mansion's owners, managers and tenants in August for allegedly 
selling alcohol without a license. The lawsuit also alleged that underground 
parties at the mansion violated safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 City prosecutors filed the lawsuit only after police raids, parking citations 
and undercover infiltrations proved ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 The mansion, which once hosted a birthday bash that was aired on MTV, was the 
site of countless parties, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the theme events that were held, to the dismay of neighbors, were a 
beach party, a toga party, a lingerie party, the Age of Aquarius Classic Disco 
Party, the Tax Relief party and the Day in Paradise event, which welcomed any 
female reader of a widely posted advertisement. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors reacted to Sanchez's announcement Thursday with hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really happy," said Margot Lachman, a resident of Wrightwood Drive. 
"That's what we've been fighting for three years. We just hope this will be the 
thing that stops the parties."

POLICE SEARCH FOR PROSTITUTE WHO GAVE PHONY NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are searching for a woman who was the first charged under a new 
campaign by the Los Angeles city attorney's office aimed at San Fernando Valley 
prostitutes who frequently use phony names to deceive authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Fay Fonderson, 29, of Northridge was charged Thursday with giving 
false information to police, a charge that carries a sentence of up to six 
months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was arrested for prostitution by vice officers last month, she gave 
them an alias, authorities said. The following day, Fonderson was arraigned 
under the false name, pleaded guilty to prostitution and, because it appeared 
she was a first-time offender, was given a year of probation.  
</P>
<P>
 This is a common tactic employed by prostitutes with long criminal records, 
the city attorney's office said. If the woman's true identity had been known, 
her previous conviction for prostitution would have resulted in a more severe 
penalty, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prostitutes who lie to police about their names are subject to arrest for 
giving false information to authorities, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Laura 
Van Eyk, who will oversee the new enforcement program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The filing of new charges is to discourage future use of false names," Van 
Eyk said. "It is to show them that there is a consequence when you do give a 
false name." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is part of the mapping program City Atty. James Hahn started this 
year under which convicted prostitutes are banned from carrying out certain 
otherwise-legal activities during the evening in areas of the Valley, according 
to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mapping program, prostitutes' fingerprints are checked to keep closer 
track of the women, a tactic that reveals those who use several different 
names, Van Eyk said.

BRUSH FIRE IN SEPULVEDA PASS BURNS 8 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A smoky brush fire burned a Sepulveda Pass hillside near expensive homes and a 
golf course Thursday, snarling rush-hour traffic on the San Diego Freeway 
between the San Fernando Valley and the remainder of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries or building damage were reported from the blaze, which was 
reported shortly before 2:30 p.m. near the Mountaingate Country Club.The fire 
burned about eight acres along the freeway and threatened large hilltop homes 
at the country club, a Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flames were kept from the homes by cleared areas and a concrete wall. No 
homes were evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
 Golfers pulled up in their carts to watch firefighters battle the blaze on the 
steep hillside before employees evacuated the south course. The fire burned 
within 10 feet of the course but stopped at the well-watered greens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had flames shoot up about 30 feet high right along our No. 1 hole. It 
burned until it couldn't burn anymore," said Kurt Zepf, the club's assistant 
golf pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Gawkers slowed southbound freeway traffic to a crawl. The freeway remained 
open, but Sepulveda Boulevard adjacent to the freeway was closed for emergency 
vehicles, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire was under investigation.

NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS RAZING DELAYED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The final razing of the Northridge Meadows Apartments, which claimed the lives 
of 16 tenants when it collapsed during the Jan. 17 earthquake, was postponed 
again Thursday when the city and the wrecking company failed to work out 
contractual details. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had expected to finalize a $281,500 demolition contract with 
Cleveland Wrecking Co. on Wednesday, said Bob Hayes of the city's Department of 
Public Works. But there were two sticking points that prevented demolition from 
beginning Thursday as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys involved in the seven wrongful death suits stemming from the 
collapse were not, as they had been guaranteed, given rights in the contract to 
observe the demolition. What's more, Hayes said, area residents had complained 
that the city needed to take steps to ensure the safety of several cats that 
they believe are living in the dilapidated structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things come up and who would expect it?" Hayes said. He added that the 
city hopes to begin demolition next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for the project will come from the same Federal Emergency Management 
Agency program that has already paid for the removal of 134 quake-ruined 
structures, city officials said. Another 96 buildings are still marked for 
demolition under the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Freedman, the attorney for building owners Shashikant and Renuka 
Jogani, said the demolition will take about a month.  
</P>
<P>
 A judge had originally halted the three-story building's demolition so that 
structural engineers and other experts could investigate the catastrophic 
collapse of the building's first floor.  
</P>
<P>
 The building is in one of the Valley's 13 "ghost towns" of abandoned, quake 
damaged structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-nine people, including relatives, heirs and neighbors of the 16 people 
who died in the moments after the 6.8 earthquake, have joined the legal action 
against the building owners, Freedman said.  
</P>
<P>
 A trial to determine whether the collapse was a result of negligence is set to 
begin in March.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MEN GET LIFE TERMS FOR KILLING 2 ANTELOPE 
VALLEY TEEN-AGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men convicted of killing a pair of Antelope Valley teen-agers have been 
sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Orcasitas, 21, was sentenced in Los Angeles Criminal Court on Wednesday to 
two consecutive life terms and Jose Orona, 21, was given one.They were both 
found guilty last month of first-degree murder, conspiracy and the special 
circumstances charges of murder while lying in wait and multiple murder for the 
1992 killings of David Benjamin Scott, 14, and Daniel Joseph Kufeldt, 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a finding of guilty on special circumstances can lead to the death 
penalty, the jury ruled it out in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Orcasitas) should have been sentenced to death," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Ron Smalstig. "But the judge gave him the maximum under the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The partially decomposed bodies of David and Daniel were found June 22, 1992, 
near a rural road in Llano. The boys had been missing for nearly a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Smalstig said Orcasitas fatally stabbed the teen-agers as part of a plan he 
worked out with Orona to stop the boys from telling authorities that Orcasitas 
and Orona were involved in a burglary ring.  
</P>
<P>
 Orona and Orcasitas tricked the boys into driving off with them by telling 
them they were going to burglarize a nearby home, Smalstig said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BUSINESSES, SCHOOLS BACK REDEVELOPMENT PLAN; 
CONSTRUCTION: SANTA CLARITA OFFICIALS ATTACH CONDITION TO APPROVAL -- A SAY IN 
HOW THE FUNDS ARE USED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With one condition, a proposed multimillion-dollar city redevelopment plan has 
gotten support from local business and education officials. 
</P>
<P>
 That condition, expressed at a City Council study session Wednesday night, is 
that they be given "meaningful participation" in governing the plan, said Joan 
MacGregor, a trustee for the College of the Canyons who spoke on behalf of all 
Santa Clarita campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Santa Clarita's five school districts and three of its 
business groups suggested the creation of an advisory board to directly oversee 
the redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 MacGregor said school officials want much more than occasional monthly status 
reports on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools are the largest combined single employer in the valley," MacGregor 
told the council. "We are an important player." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members adopted the redevelopment plan in February to help Santa 
Clarita recover from the Northridge earthquake and also to improve its 
infrastructure, redevelop blighted areas and build affordable housing. The plan 
is to be funded by property tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, council members got their first look at the responses to a 
50-question survey given to residents who participated in public meetings this 
past summer about the redevelopment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 3,900 surveys distributed, only 232 were returned. Many urged 
caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Restraint needed," wrote a Castaic resident, warning against getting Santa 
Clarita in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (redevelopment agency) is a very dangerous governmental unit," wrote a 
Canyon Country respondent. "There is great potential for cronyism, corruption 
and general abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 A strong majority of those who sent in surveys supported projects that focus 
on earthquake recovery, such as road and bridge repair, debris removal and the 
renovation of damaged schools. 
</P>
<P>
 They were less enthusiastic about providing funds for first-time home buyers 
or to purchase mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "How dare you put this in!!" wrote a Newhall respondent. "Redevelopment was 
meant to revitalize run-down areas, not to (be) a welfare program for middle 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 Least popular was the suggested construction of a multipurpose sports complex, 
which 60% of those surveyed indicated was "not important."

THE SCENE: IDENTITY CRISIS; SKINHEADS AREN'T ALL ALIKE, O.C. TEEN-AGERS SAY IN 
DEFENSE OF THEIR SUBCULTURE THAT BELIEVES IN RACIAL HARMONY 
</P>

 Paul says he gets annoyed when he hears about crimes like the gay-bashing 
spree in Laguna Beach last year and the recent fatal shooting of a black man in 
Huntington Beach. He not only gets angry over the suffering of the victims, but 
also when the suspects are called skinheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who commit crimes based on race prejudice, says the Fullerton High 
senior, are not true skinheads -- unlike Paul, 18, who is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Racist, Nazi, bonehead" are just a few of the terms he calls the people who 
seem to dress and wear their hair like him, but whose ideology and moral 
philosophy differ. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow Fullerton resident Bobby Aragon agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a skinhead, a true skinhead in the traditional sense, is not about being 
racist and it's especially not about swastikas, says Bobby, a La Vista High 
senior. A patch on his black flight jacket features a swastika in a red circle 
with a red slash through it. 
</P>
<P>
 To Bobby, Paul, their network of friends in Orange County and the thousands 
worldwide they consider part of their scene, skinhead culture claims a rich, 
complex history three decades old that has been besmirched at the hands of 
extremist politics and misinformed perceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Much attention has been focused on the packs of nearly bald teens with 
swastikas inked on their clothes and skin who align themselves with the 
white-power Nazi revivalists. You've seen them on Geraldo a zillion times. 
</P>
<P>
 As threatening and dangerous as they may be, these people are not true 
skinheads living the skinhead culture, insist Paul -- who requested anonymity 
-- and Bobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinheads, the teens note, take pride in dressing smart, listening to the 
Jamaican-born sounds of ska and reggae, and living a way of life that cherishes 
the blue-collar work ethic and doesn't compromise their ideals -- including 
interacting with fellow skinheads no matter the color of their skin. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to what most might think about skinheads, Bobby, a Native American 
who claims Pima, Yaqui and Mayan blood lines, says "there are no racial 
barriers" among them. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned about skinheads four years ago after two years spent as a misguided 
punk rocker, he quips. Bobby, 19, hung around skin friends and studied the 
culture, but it wasn't until this past March that he shaved off his thick locks 
to a fuzz and fully adopted the look. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people at school know Bobby's a traditional skin -- even though he's 
shared the campus with two "boneheads."  
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't want to believe I'm not racist, fine. I know I'm not," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a problem equally with anyone who's not a skin," he continues. "We 
have a problem with anyone who's for black power, brown power, white power. 
They're all racists." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement is aware of this sub-group, says Gary S. Paer, a deputy 
district attorney in the county gang unit. "There's definitely a skinhead 
faction that we know about that preaches against racism and that dresses like 
racist skinheads," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regular skinheads," he adds, "don't like them because they go against their 
main philosophy of white purity." 
</P>
<P>
 But Paer notes that these anti-racist skins are in the minority -- even when 
it comes to labels. "When you say skinhead, most people associate the term with 
those skinheads whose philosophy is racist." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Skinheads trace their origins to around 1964, to the working-class 
neighborhoods of England, as another youth culture, the Mods, was beginning to 
wane. Mods, like most youth cultures before and after them, defended their 
music, look, territory and very existence through street fighting. (Rent the 
Who's "Quadrophenia" film.) 
</P>
<P>
 A branch of hard mods around this time began to favor a harsher, more 
aggressive image. They sported short polished boots and even shorter haircuts; 
a neat look some parents actually approved of. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of Jamaican ska and American soul, these skinhead predecessors began 
frequenting parties with their West Indian neighbors. Many of these younger 
black immigrants adopted the "rude" taste for snappy suits, wrap-around shades 
and violence so in vogue back home in Kingston. Jamaican rude boys and rude 
girls rallied around ska and its newer, slower form, rock steady. And when 
reggae emerged from rock steady in Jamaica around 1968, it did also in England. 
Skins were to draw from this influence both in fashion -- wearing trousers 
ankle-length to expose boots -- and in attitude -- always ready for "aggro," or 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Another oft-overlooked influence in early skinhead cultural development was 
England's World Cup victory in 1966, according to author George Marshall in 
"Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible" (1991, ST Publishing, Scotland), the most 
authoritative and objective documented history of skinheads. Young fans began 
attending with friends instead of family and showing their team pride through 
catchy chants and violence directed at the opposing team's supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1968, skinheads had a name and a uniform. It had nothing to do with 
psychedelic hippy gear of the time, instead taking its cue from the good old 
blue-collar ranks. In between the cropped hair and boots, skins wore corduroys 
or jeans, shortened or cuffed 1 1/2 inches. The ideal shirts were button-down 
Ben Shermans and the tennis style Fred Perry, with skinny braces (suspenders). 
When the occasion was -- and still is -- special, the wardrobe consisted of 
brogues, mohair suits and, for the "birds" (girls), minis instead of trousers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair was cropped short, never worn bald. Young women wore theirs in a feather 
cut, usually cropped on top, with short bangs and longer, wispy strands at the 
sides and back. The crop tops were not, as has been hastily assumed, a reaction 
to long, dirty hippy hair. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the look demands great attention to detail, down to polished shoes or 
a properly folded handkerchief (as detailed in Marshall's book). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The mid-'70s marked another era for skinheads, including factors that would 
mar an already less-than-angelic reputation. Skinhead culture had already been 
experiencing a deluge of newer members who had little interest in anything 
other than expressing the full power of their boot at football games, clubs or 
the local street corner. 
</P>
<P>
 A troubled economy got worse and young people increasingly believed there was 
no future. The influx of poor immigrants from Pakistan and India only worsened 
the situation in the minds of many English, young and old. 
</P>
<P>
 Paki-bashing, as it was all called, became a form of racism fueled by 
economics. The English, including immigrants who had arrived only a decade 
before, saw this new wave from one of Her Majesty's former British colonies 
taking away their jobs, their housing and state services. 
</P>
<P>
 The inflamed aggression of the newer skinheads became a target for two extreme 
right-wing organizations gaining attention, the National Front and the British 
Movement. Their enthusiastic recruitment campaign shrouded in the flag appealed 
to many youngsters seeking validity. The National Front and British Movement 
not only approved of their hate rampages, they encouraged them in the name of 
patriotism. The media began to brand all skinhead fans as fascist youth. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Spirit of '69," Marshall notes the ironies. On one hand, newspapers would 
print photographs of so-called racist skinhead bands but would ignore that 
those groups included black members. On the other hand, the new fascist faction 
considered bands who sang against racism as communists -- even though they were 
singing about Poland's Solidarity movement. 
</P>
<P>
 By the '80s, the Ku Klux Klan in the United States was following the National 
Front's cue, as did other racist and fascist groups internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The second and third coming of ska, in 1978 and 1988, however, breathed new 
life into the traditional skinhead culture. There was also the convergence of 
ska and punk into what became known as Oi! 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, after the late '70s, both camps claimed their own bands, record 
labels, fanzines and following worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more respected sources still in active circulation is the Skinhead 
Times out of Scotland, which reports on everything from skewed news on 
skinheads by the media and the negative activities of Nazi supporters, to the 
birth of children from skinhead parents (cute baby pictures included). 
</P>
<P>
 But to the dismay of true skins, their culture would always be marked by 
perceptions of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Youth cultures thrive on their inherent sense of being outsiders and few have 
experienced greater alienation than skinhead culture. The added drama of being 
branded fascist or racist only seems to reinforce their determination to keep 
the original concept alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States claims two of the largest non-racist skinhead organizations, 
the United Front and Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice (SHARP). 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, the Fullerton High senior, wears a SHARP button on his red Fred Perry 
shirt. When he was a sophomore, he learned about the movement through an older 
friend. This semester he included the SHARP logo of a boot stomping a swastika 
in a collage for his art class. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, he recalls, his art teacher only saw the swastika and disapproved 
of his entry. Once he asked her to look at the larger picture and he explained 
what SHARP and the traditional skinhead culture was all about, she "thought it 
was cool." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of my teachers are cool about it once we talk," Paul says about his 
image. He spends a lot of time educating others about traditional skinhead 
culture and its anti-racist stance -- but never around the dinner table at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 He says his views contrast sharply with his father's, who has a fixed opinion 
of Jews and blacks. Paul says he and his siblings long ago gave up debating 
with their father. 
</P>
<P>
 This "education" process not always involves talk. Being anti-racist doesn't 
include being anti-violent. Skinheads have always expressed themselves however 
they see fit. Most group in crews -- gangs, really -- and adopt names that 
identify where they're from. 
</P>
<P>
 In England it's usually the name of the football team they support. Here, it's 
a county, an English term or some other abstract connection. Occasionally crews 
clash, but with all the external problems they face, most try to keep the 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 They figure their energy is better spent defending their culture. There are 
the racists to contend with, as well as the new generation of ska fans who 
insist on moshing at live shows. Skins will frequently try to stop the pit 
either by not moving or moving those who keep slamming into them. Usually they 
win on their intimidating looks alone.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not Mr. Pacifist. I don't go looking for trouble, but if it comes, it 
comes," says Paul. "We know we're not necessarily going to make change through 
violence. But if we're hanging out and we see some bonehead we'll hit em up. It 
might be just verbal how we confront him. But we feel if we can wake him up 
with a punch. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, much of this talk, some skins admit, is school-ground bravado. At 
the apartment of Paul and Bobby's friends, John Montgomery, 19, and Amy Rados, 
20, in Placentia, a couple of punks hang peacefully with them even though they 
visibly adhere to another way of life and dress. All of them admit to having 
good friends not in their scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby's parents have accepted his interests -- with some trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom's just worried about all of us getting confused for Nazis. She's just 
worried about people not knowing the difference," Bobby says. "We tell her we 
explain things to people thoroughly." 
</P>
<P>
 His father has also taken it in stride, except for recent concerns over the 
Huntington Beach slaying. So, as with other times when skinheads make the 
headlines, the two rehashed discussions about the differences between the two 
camps and reached an understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go over things a lot of times," Bobby says. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy notes that racist skinheads feel competitive with traditional skins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nazis think they're better and tougher than us," she says. "But they have a 
problem with us because we're an obstacle to them. We promote integration and 
are against a white America." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Paul: "We don't believe in anarchy. We don't like women-beaters. We're 
not thugs full of disrespect for everything. We work for a living, and we don't 
need people telling us what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And despite what his older brother says, Paul insists he's not going through a 
phase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a skinhead is a way of life," he continues. "It's about pride in our 
work ethic, pride in being a skin. There are a lot of misconceptions about what 
skinheads are about. Hopefully people can learn that their definition of 
skinheads is not Nazis."

 As some teens headed back to school decked out in their favorite looks, they 
ran head-on into school rules: 
</P>
<P>
 * Danielle Kriegsman, 13, an eighth-grader in New Milford, Conn., strutted her 
stuff with a bright-pink hairdo on the first day of school. It caught some 
attention and a pink slip -- a suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials described Danielle's hairdo -- and the neon purple shade 
chosen by fellow student Jenn Samias -- as distractions. They were ordered home 
and told to wear wigs or return their hair to its natural color. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenn relented and dyed hers back to blond, but Danielle vowed to keep her pink 
locks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't hurt anyone. I like my hair this way," Danielle said. "I went to a 
concert a few weeks ago, and a lot of kids had it." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother, Gina Satmary, said her daughter will be allowed to return 
but only to a special class for troubled students. 
</P>
<P>
 "That class is for kids who bring guns to school. She's just an average kid 
who experimented with her hair." Satmary said.  
</P>
<P>
 All sides are trying to work out a solution before it hits the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meanwhile, in Ventura . . . John Spindler, 14, has been told he can't wear 
his favorite T-shirt, which has an American flag and eagle emblem on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taking away my rights," he said, after being sent home for the second 
day in a row after showing up in his flag shirt. The school adopted a stricter 
dress code -- including a ban on any shirt with a logo on it -- after a fatal 
on-campus stabbing of a student. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Don Gaudioso said he has no choice but to enforce the dress code, 
which also requires students to wear pants that stay up without a belt and 
knee-length shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be different if it was gang- or drug-related, but it's an American 
flag. I think they've gone overboard," said John's mom, Ellen Spindler, who has 
contacted the American Civil Liberties Union about the flap. Losing Ground 
</P>
<P>
 Probably without knowing it, you've been winning the struggle against gravity. 
Go ahead and savor the victory -- for now.  
</P>
<P>
 Gravity governs the height and shape of our bodies, also dictating the size 
and shape of organs and limbs. In the aging process, sagging skin, varicose 
veins, arthritis and failing hearts all result partly from the losing battle 
against gravity.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; SAVING YOUR SKIN; HAS YOUR SKIN REBELLED? ACNE 
ATTACKS VIRTUALLY EVERYONE. BUT THERE ARE SOME WAYS TO BATTLE BLEMISHES AND 
MAKE IT A FAIR FIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSLIN GEMSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES. Joslin Gemsch is a senior at Capistrano 
Valley High School in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being a teen-ager is filled with new experiences: You can get your driver's 
license and your first car, attend high school and the prom and battle acne. 
</P>
<P>
 Back up a minute, you might say; Can't we just skip that last part? 
</P>
<P>
 While acne is a part of young adulthood that we'd all like to skip, few are 
able to escape it entirely. Ninety percent of teen-agers will experience some 
form of this pesky problem on the face, neck, chest, back or arms. To the other 
10% -- the rest of us envy your luck. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years it was thought that acne was the result of improper hygiene, 
what you ate or even a person's degree of sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Those beliefs are misconceptions, and you are not at fault for your acne, 
according to "Overcoming Acne: The How and Why of Healthy Skin Care," a book by 
Alvin, Virginia and Robert Silverstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, point a finger at your body chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the ages of 12 and 17, your body undergoes many changes, and sex 
hormones begin to surge. These hormones are responsible for increasing the 
amount of oil in your skin. Your skin is constantly shedding dead cells and 
replenishing them with new ones. Sometimes the dead skin cells and oil clump 
together, along with bacteria. This mixture lodges itself in the tiny holes in 
your skin, called pores. This is where the problems begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil continues to flow in your pores despite the backup. This causes pressure. 
There are two options for the trapped mass. It will either remain in the pore, 
adopt a dark color and create a blackhead or push through the pore and form a 
pimple. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither option is good for your complexion. If the mass decides to push 
through the pore, your body will launch a war on the escaped contents. Blood 
will surge to the injured site, and your white blood cells will attack and 
destroy the bacteria, dead skin cells and oil. The white blood cells, having 
completed their job, die and form pus. The end result is a pimple. Believe it 
or not, that pimple is a victory sign for your body. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done about acne? Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure. However, 
you need not weather the problem alone. Drugstore shelves are loaded with 
products -- Clearasil, Oxy and Stridex to name a few -- that are waiting to 
help clear up your complexion.  
</P>
<P>
 The brands have something in common -- benzoyl peroxide. 
</P>
<P>
 Benzoyl peroxide helps fight acne because it delivers extra oxygen to your 
skin. The bacteria that causes acne hates oxygen. When benzoyl peroxide is 
applied, it releases the excess oxygen. The oxygen kills the bacteria and, 
therefore, reduces formation of pimples. 
</P>
<P>
 Benzoyl peroxide does have side effects for some people, though, including 
causing peeling skin and leaving a stinging sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 A former benzoyl peroxide user among acne sufferers interviewed for this 
article recalled an uncomfortable experience: "I was walking into school one 
morning, and my face was burning so bad that it felt like I was on fire. My 
face was red and splotchy. When my friend saw me, she laughed and called me a 
fire engine." 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid this discomfort, it's recommended that a person starting treatment 
use the weakest concentration. Wash your skin before your application, but 
allow plenty of time for drying. Rub the medicine over the entire affected 
area, not just on one blemish. Keep the benzoyl peroxide away from eyes, nose 
and mouth. If your skin stings, leave the medicine on for a short time -- say 
an hour -- and then wash it off. As your skin becomes less sensitive, gradually 
increase the time you keep the medication on until you can endure a full night 
or day. 
</P>
<P>
 You should be aware of another side effect: Benzoyl peroxide can create dark 
spots on some skin types. Asian and African American skin types are most 
vulnerable to this side effect. 
</P>
<P>
 This medicine also causes sun sensitivity in all races, so don't forget your 
sunscreen for excursions to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun isn't the only thing you will be sensitive to. "I have learned to stay 
away from soaps and lotions with heavy fragrances and dyes. They irritate my 
skin and cause more stinging," says one acne sufferer. 
</P>
<P>
 This medication can even take a toll on your wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ruins your clothes. It takes the color out," says another victim of acne. 
To prevent bleaching of clothes, thoroughly wash your skin before dressing. If 
you apply medicine to your back, consider wearing a T-shirt under your clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 If over-the-counter medications just don't seem to cooperate, don't despair. 
Visit a dermatologist. She will personalize your treatment with prescriptions 
for stronger benzoyl peroxide, Retin-A, tetracycline or other topical and oral 
medications. Be sure to ask about side effects. A dermatologist can also 
perform chemical peels and help with acne scars. 
</P>
<P>
 As a last resort for extreme acne, Accutane can be prescribed. This oral drug, 
which remains in your system for two months, cures nearly all patients, 
according to "Overcoming Acne." There are significant potential side effects to 
Accutane, including blurred vision, liver problems and heart disease. Blood 
tests are routinely taken during treatment to monitor the patient. A pregnancy 
test is also performed before treatment begins, due to Accutane's history of 
causing birth defects and miscarriages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are some simple things you can do to keep from aggravating your skin 
whether you have an active case of acne. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't do things that prevent oil from escaping from pores, like resting your 
chin on your hand during boring lectures or wearing a football helmet with a 
chin strap for prolonged periods. Also, be wary of cosmetics and foundations. 
The products you use to improve your looks could be clogging pores and 
exacerbating acne. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduce stress in your life. Stress stimulates the release of oil and can make 
you susceptible to a variety of bacteria and viruses. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is last: Eating a candy bar does not cause acne. Although what 
you eat will affect your overall health and therefore your skin, studies are 
finding that the food you eat is not what triggers acne. So, if you dare, enjoy 
your favorite chocolate bar, soda and potato chips! The thing most likely to be 
affected is your waistline. 
</P>
<P>
 Take heart in knowing that you may be stuck with acne for now, but eventually 
it will disappear. Look around. You are not alone. Nearly every teen can 
relate. They are all waiting for the same day -- the day that acne isn't a 
daily battle.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; EXCHANGES; GETTING FIRST, HEALTHY DOSE OF 
CZECH NURSING SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAMRIN CHRISTENSEN , Camrin Christensen, a junior from Laguna Hills High 
School, is spending the school year as an American Field Service student in the 
Czech Republic, where she is living with a family of five. She attends a 
Secondary School of Nursing in Kolin, about 45 miles from Prague. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's how it's been going:  
</P>
<P>
 We managed to fit all of my luggage into my host family's Skoda, the Czech 
national car, and drove about one hour to Kolin.  
</P>
<P>
 They had come to meet me in Prague, where I had arrived earlier and gone 
through orientation along with other newly arrived AFS students. 
</P>
<P>
 After a good night's sleep, we walked to the Secondary School of Nursing for 
the first day of school. My host mother, Frantiska Markova, is a teacher there. 
</P>
<P>
 I was introduced to the school's headmaster and then headed off to class. 
Frantiska had worked it out so that I would be in her class. She introduced me 
to fellow students, and then I got a tour of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students here have four classes a day. The first two are general subjects, 
such as history and mathematics. The last two are specialized classes ranging 
from analytic chemistry to somatology (the properties of organic bodies). 
</P>
<P>
 The Secondary School of Nursing is a very old and established school. It went 
through many changes during the (1989 anti-communist) revolution. Under a grant 
from the government, the school has begun to restore the crumbling facade. 
Before entering, you can see the building supports and new windows. They have 
replaced the front doors, and the inside smells of paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the revolution, there were 40 students to a class. The number has 
dropped to 24, so the administration has cut the number of classes offered. 
There are about 25 teachers, including two men. Over the year, about 40 doctors 
visit to teach their specialties. CAMRIN CHRISTENSEN

HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION: WHICH CREEP SHOWS HAVE A GHOST OF A CHANCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 I was having this drink in a bar alone, and an alien approached me. -- Woman 
in "Ghostbusters 2" * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us would go just about anywhere for a good scare. 
</P>
<P>
 Even to PBS, where Sunday's season opener for the once-grand, now-gray 
"Masterpiece Theatre" stars Oscar-winning Emma Thompson in a ghost story called 
"The Blue Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Blue boy, shmue boy. Bob's Big Boy is scarier. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, there are hair-raising alternatives to this limp PBS offering. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to TV tales about the supernatural and other seemingly 
inexplicable phenomena, Fox's celestial second-year series, "The X-Files," is 
by far television's finest. And though resonating comical tabloid headlines, 
the syndicated series "Sightings" and "The Extraordinary" are also eerier than 
"The Blue Boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Still more tingle potential arrives Oct. 9 with the return of "Encounters: The 
Hidden Truth," Fox's replacement for the just-shelved "Fortune Hunter." Even 
"The UFO Cover-Up: Live From Area 51" -- Larry King's Saturday-night special on 
cable's TNT -- promises more suspense than "The Blue Boy." It couldn't promise 
less. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when the season's first "Masterpiece Theatre" was an awaited 
event, but that golden age is long past, mirroring a decline in British 
productions of the quality that for years had nourished TV's most Anglophilic 
drama series. Those redcoattails are now so short that "Masterpiece Theatre" 
has little to grab onto. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's box-office potential is the only possible rationale for launching 
things with something as bad as "The Blue Boy." Inspired by legend, it's an 
inferior, one-hour story that finds Thompson playing a Scottish woman whose 
stay at a rural lakeside hotel with her philandering husband (Adrian Dunbar) 
turns ghostly -- but never ghastly enough to supply even a mild fright. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that the place is haunted by the spirit of a boy who drowned in 
the lake, the cold depths turning him blue. Despite laboring to veil his BBC 
production in dark mystique, director/writer Paul Murton falls short of even 
murkiness. Even the highly proficient Thompson can't warm this cadaver. When 
the blue boy does show up, well, the word silly comes to mind, making this the 
slightest "Masterpiece Theatre" premiere in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Measured against "The Blue Boy," Fox's consistently intriguing hour, "The 
X-Files," is a true masterpiece. There's no more challenging series on 
television and, as a bonus, it's also brainy fun. 
</P>
<P>
 While assigned last season to investigate unsolved cases called X-Files, FBI 
agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) 
encountered all sorts of creepy, crawly things. And even though their separate 
X-Files operation has now been mysteriously scotched by superiors, paranormal 
specialist Mulder and physician Scully are still on the job this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday's exquisitely stinky episode had them investigating a 
sewage-habitating parasite, a half-human/half-monster hybrid that turned out to 
be a radiation-bred creature of the Chernobyl disaster. That revelation ended 
the hour on a note of melancholy not atypical of this interestingly moody 
series. But while "The X-Files" is straight-faced sober except for an 
occasional sardonic crack by Mulder, there was something delectably 
tongue-in-cheek about having the yucky predator at one point hide in the slop 
of a portable toilet. And something terrifying about the eely thing that 
slithered from the corpse of one of its victims as Scully performed an autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, Mulder -- assisted mostly from long range by Scully -- probes a 
series of killings by phobic individuals who receive subliminal commands from 
digitalized messages transmitted via screens of all kinds. Although a 
thickening residue of clues allows Mulder to figure out what is happening, not 
all is revealed, and the episode purposely dangles a big loose end for viewers 
to ponder. It also expands its running mystery about unseen government forces 
shaping the fates of Mulder and the X-Files venture. 
</P>
<P>
 The underplaying Duchovny and Anderson are swell in their roles as attractive 
opposites who somehow are not romantically attracted to each other. Credit 
executive producer Chris Carter with knowing that romance could dilute the 
cerebral inkiness of his series, which to date has been remarkably 
schmaltz-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so "Sightings," which suckles on schmaltz while featuring a bunch of 
Coneheads who have either been in the sun way too long or know a lot more than 
the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 To believe the messages delivered by "Sightings," you have to first believe 
the messenger. In this regard, "Sightings" is more show biz than fact biz. It 
doesn't help the show's credibility that it has an obvious unsavory side, 
merging creepy music, real footage and unlabeled re-enactments in ways intended 
to confuse viewers and promote belief in the paranormal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "Sightings" somehow remains seductive, if only because the exotic claims 
it chronicles -- from alien abductions to disembodied souls acquiring human 
form -- cannot be entirely discounted. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though most seem pretty loopy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of weeks ago, "Sightings" checked in on a "frightening entity" that 
was terrorizing a family somewhere in the Midwest, capturing on videotape its 
"hours of bizarre ghostly activity." Look, there on the wall, a dark blotch. 
Was that the shadow of a frightening entity or what? 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that the entity was a long-dead girl named Sally, whose presence 
could be detected by a "swirling frigid aura," after which, if she really got 
ticked off, she would inflict deep scratches on the body of the husband in this 
household. 
</P>
<P>
 And look, it was happening right there on the screen. The camera zoomed in on 
the guy's arm, which bore bloody scratch marks. "Sally, stop it," demanded the 
man's wife. Then a "Sightings" crew member said, "It's cold in this part of the 
room." Things got so scary that a psychic had to be summoned. "I feel her," he 
said. "Hi, Sally. What's goin' on?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was a definite crisis. So who do ya call? Showing up at this haunted house 
in the following week's episode was "Sightings" host Tim White, who not only 
felt a supernatural coldness but also was horrified by the "mysterious welts" 
forming on the forehead of one of his crew members. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing in next was "ghost expert" Al Rauber, who suggested that Sally could 
be a form of energy, even though he wasn't ruling her out as a ghost. In any 
event, White concluded, "This case merits further investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 As do so many others, including the two women claiming in the same episode to 
have been abducted by aliens and taken aboard their spacecraft. To make things 
worse, one of them reported, when she was returned, her contact lenses were 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 But enough of them and on to "Angels Rescue Schoolmates from a Madman." If not 
angels, then at least "some unseen force was at work," White deduced before 
moving on to the cattle mutilations linked to "many lights up in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 As for this Sunday's episode, you may want to skip the segment on alien 
spacecraft ("Suddenly a series of red-orange objects . . . ") and even the 
psychic animal therapist who learned from a dog that its owner's husband was 
sleeping with the next-door neighbor. But don't miss "Alien Abductees Receive a 
Terrifying Message From Their Captors." 
</P>
<P>
 That message, controversial Harvard Prof. John Mack says in the segment, could 
be that these "little gray" abductors are mad at us and consider Earth "a 
malignancy at a cosmic level." Mack, the author of the book "Abductions," says 
that "there's no reason to believe they (the alleged abductees) are not telling 
the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 That level of trust also permeates Saturday's campy premiere of "The 
Extraordinary," whose highlights include Telly Savalas' terrifying account 
(related in an interview taped shortly before his death) of years ago 
encountering a dead man with an effeminate voice. Even more chilling is that, 
in a re-enactment, the voice sounds like Julia Child. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are Ghostbusters when you need them? 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Blue Boy" airs at 9 p.m. Sunday on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV 
Channel 15, and at 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. It also airs Tuesday at 8 p.m. 
on KOCE-TV Channel 50.  
</P>
<P>
 * "The X-Files" airs at 9 p.m. Fridays on Fox (Channels 11 and 6). "Sightings" 
airs at 6 p.m. Sundays on KTTV-TV Channel 11. "The Extraordinary" premieres at

CHANNEL 4: TUNE IN TO THE OTHER SIDE; TELEVISION: BY PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE 
VIEWING, BRITAIN'S NEWEST OUTLET IS GOBBLING UP AWARDS -- AND EARNS A THREE-DAY 
TRIBUTE AT THE UK/LA FEST. 
</P>

<P>
 So imagine this: You go to see the guy who runs Channel 4 and after an hour's 
conversation about TV, he suddenly says: "Our viewers are very discerning, you 
know. People don't sit down and watch this channel for a whole evening. And I'm 
perfectly happy with that. In fact, it's our greatest strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't happen, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Not with the Channel 4 you're thinking of, it couldn't. But this Channel 4 has 
nothing to do with KNBC-TV, the folks over in Burbank who bring you Paul Moyer 
and Kelly Lange for news at 11. 
</P>
<P>
 This one is quite a different proposition. It is the smallest and newest of 
Britain's four TV channels, with an overall audience share of just more than 
10%, and since its debut 12 years ago it has staked a claim as one of the 
world's most original and innovative broadcast entities. Its contributions to 
the world of filmmaking will be celebrated at the UK/LA Festival with 
screenings tonight through Sunday at the Directors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 4 was set up by an act of Parliament to provide alternative viewing 
for non-mainstream audiences. The channel produces no shows of its own, but 
commissions from independent TV companies or buys from other countries. 
Consequently, Channel 4's programming is a rich, heady, some might say bizarre 
mix: strong on documentaries, the arts and shows about ethnic groups and 
Britain's gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 Its schedule is also lightly sprinkled with what Michael Grade, 51, Channel 
4's chief executive, calls "the literate, intelligent end" of U.S. network fare 
-- skillfully written shows like "NYPD Blue," "I'll Fly Away," "Frasier," 
"Northern Exposure" and "Roseanne." 
</P>
<P>
 But Channel 4 may be best known for its enthusiastic backing of theatrical 
movies. It has poured money into some 180 films, most of them British, since 
its inception, and in a typical year helps back 10 or 12 films with a total of 
$15 million-$20 million. In some cases, notably Stephen Frears' 1985 hit "My 
Beautiful Laundrette," the channel wholly finances films. Recent movies made at 
least partly with Channel 4 money include "Four Weddings and a Funeral," "The 
Crying Game," "Howards End" and Mike Leigh's "High Hopes." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a set-up Americans cannot comprehend," says Grade, 51. "It's not only 
our programming. They don't see why a broadcaster would finance theatrical 
films. It seems to them that's the competition." 
</P>
<P>
 So why do it? Grade explains Channel 4 is an equity participant in films it 
backs, which means it shares profits from hits like "Four Weddings" and "The 
Crying Game." It also holds the British broadcasting license for those films: 
"Our losses, when they occur, are mitigated by the fact that we can use these 
movies on air," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we air 'The Crying Game' on Channel 4, it will be a huge event. And 
we've found that we get even bigger audience figures the second, third and 
fourth time we air films like "Beautiful Laundrette." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was something of a high point in terms of Channel 4's visibility 
within the theatrical film community. Three films backed by Channel 4 won an 
astonishing 16 Oscar nominations between them. "The Crying Game," for which 
Channel 4 put up one-third of the budget, gained six; "Howards End," backed 
25%, grabbed nine; "Damage," which received one nod, was 10% financed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, when Grade visits America he usually encounters people who 
assume Channel 4 is part of the BBC. "You get used to it," he sighs. "Little by 
little the message gets across, but you have to keep flying the flag." 
</P>
<P>
 This is one reason Grade is in Los Angeles this week for the tribute, which 
will include a question-and-answer session about the state of Britain's film 
industry and Channel 4's role in it. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribute runs over three days and includes films partly or wholly financed 
by the channel: Ken Loach's new movie, "Ladybird, Ladybird," "My Beautiful 
Laundrette," "Shopping" from first-time director Paul Anderson, and "Danny 
Boy," an obscure 1982 film directed by Neil Jordan and starring Stephen Rea, 
who reunited a decade later in "The Crying Game." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the festival is the Los Angeles premiere of "Lipstick on Your Collar," 
the final part of the late Dennis Potter's trilogy of dramatic series for TV, 
which started with "Pennies From Heaven" and "The Singing Detective." Like 
those works, "Lipstick" features the device of characters lip-syncing to pop 
hits of the era being portrayed; in this case, it is the mid-1950s with the 
Suez Canal crisis looming in Britain and rock 'n' roll threatening to overturn 
the values of an older generation. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribute offers a cross-section of the challenging provocative programming 
which has given the channel a distinct edge among Britain's youngish, upscale 
viewers. Not included in the tribute, but also fully funded by Channel 4 (at a 
cost of $8 million) was last year's gay-themed series "Tales of the City." It 
was shown on PBS this year, but the candor of the material made the public 
broadcaster shy away from controversy and express reluctance to air a projected 
second series. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing you always believed about the States was that success is rewarded," 
Grade says sourly. "And in anybody's terms "Tales of the City" was the biggest 
success PBS had had for years -- in terms of ink, critical acclaim and sheer 
numbers of people watching. And they (PBS) turned their back on it, all because 
allegedly it wouldn't play in Oklahoma or places like that. It's very 
depressing and sad. But that's the end of it, unless a sugar daddy comes 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Grade accepts that controversy is likely to follow a programming 
philosophy such as Channel 4's. "We always try to do things differently from 
other people," he says. "We throw the balls up in the air and turn things 
upside-down." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not idle talk; Channel 4 is amassing a tradition for subverting 
classic television genres. A Channel 4-commissioned sitcom, "Drop the Dead 
Donkey," set in a TV newsroom, has an extra twist; it is literally topical. 
Each week's episode is littered with references to and jokes about the week's 
news.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grade characterizes the Establishment BBC channels as "very backward-looking. 
Not a night goes by when there isn't a retrospective, an archive or anniversary 
show. The BBC's like a museum. And ITV's wall-to-wall entertainment. That has 
its place, but if you want TV that's topical, relevant and about the way you 
live, you have to watch Channel 4." 
</P>
<P>
 After being a sportswriter for several years, Grade worked in television in 
Britain beginning in 1973. In 1981 he accepted an offer to join Norman Lear as 
president of Embassy Television. In 1988, he became chief executive of upscale 
Channel 4. He is generally thought to have steered it skillfully, increasing 
its audience share gradually while adhering to its original remit to serve 
minority and alternative viewing interests. Grade may have turned 50, yet as a 
London critic recently remarked, he remains the nearest thing to a Wunderkind 
in British TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Grade believes predictive research provides all the wrong answers: "Go and ask 
the public what they'd like to see, and they'll say: more shows like 'Roseanne' 
or 'Cheers.' That's useless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think Shakespeare walked up and down outside the Globe Theatre, asking 
the crowds what they fancied seeing next? Television programs are living, 
organic things, not commodities."

'STAR TREK': EVEN SPACE HAS ITS ROAD BUMPS; FILM: FIRST, THE SCRIPT APPEARED ON 
INTERNET AND AT TREKKER MEETINGS; NOW PARAMOUNT IS DEALING WITH BUZZ ABOUT A 
TEST SCREENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is someone out to sabotage "Star Trek: Generations," the next space sequel 
from Paramount Pictures? 
</P>
<P>
 First, the entire script was leaked about a year ago onto the Internet, the 
global computer network. Next, pirated copies of the screenplay began appearing 
at "Star Trek" conventions around the nation. Now, someone is spreading rumors 
that a recent test screening of the movie resulted in a lackluster audience 
response -- a rumor the studio and the film's producer vehemently deny. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe it could all be the work of irate Trekkers, those "Star Trek" 
groupies who boldly go wherever their worship of the series takes them, and who 
are upset over the rumored death of Capt. James T. Kirk (William Shatner), 
which reportedly happens in this film. Or perhaps it is the work of a 
disgruntled Paramount employee or someone associated with the "Star Trek" 
television series. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever is responsible -- and Paramount says it hasn't a clue -- studio 
officials say they aren't particularly worried about the newest "Star Trek" 
film, the seventh in a series, which opens Nov. 18. After all, they point out, 
the "Star Trek" films have a built-in core audience and have grossed almost a 
half-billion dollars at the domestic box office. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount distribution chief Barry London said he does not believe a Paramount 
employee is the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would it be surfacing now if it was an inside situation?" London asked. 
"Why would they not have hit on a lot of other movies? This company has had a 
lot of high-profile movies." 
</P>
<P>
 London and "Star Trek" producer Rick Berman said they are concerned about 
inaccurate reports that the Sept. 13 test screening at Paramount of 
"Generations," the first film to feature cast members from the original "Star 
Trek" series as well as "The Next Generation," went poorly. They noted that 
even if it were true, such screenings are intended to be used to iron out 
problems before the film is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now getting movies reviewed in the press before anyone has seen the 
movies," London said. "Outside of maybe 250 people who saw the ("Generations") 
research preview and some (Paramount) executives, nobody has seen this movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Research screenings, London explained, are conducted with unfinished prints 
and are used to help filmmakers gauge audience responses to plot points, 
character development and dialogue in the movies. If something doesn't work, 
the director can go back and shoot more footage or try to solve the problems in 
the editing room. 
</P>
<P>
 But with high-profile films, a bad test screening can create buzz in Hollywood 
that is difficult for a studio to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Two recent films from Columbia Pictures garnered bad buzz after test 
screenings. The most famous was Arnold Schwarzenegger's "Last Action Hero," in 
which someone inside the studio may have been leaking negative information to 
the press. The other involved James Brooks' "I'll Do Anything," which was made 
as a musical until people walked out of a test screening when star Nick Nolte 
broke into song. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is going to put a bad buzz on a film before it opens, there should 
be some founding to that," Berman said. "It seems that anyone who is 
considering putting a bad buzz on this film, is doing it based on totally 
unfounded information. I have read all kinds of things about this film that are 
flagrant examples of things that are totally fictitious." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said he is concerned that even by responding to the rumors now 
circulating around "Generations," he could be feeding the "bad buzz." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, he said, it just isn't true that the test audience gave 
"Generations" a lackluster score of 63%, as has been reported in a New York 
tabloid. Berman called that figure "double-digit incorrect" but declined to 
divulge the actual score. Sources told The Times it was "close to 80%." 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie tested very well," Berman said. "They were blown away by this 
film." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman, however, did confirm that the crew will be returning soon to a 
mountaintop location in the Valley of Fire 80 miles north of Las Vegas to 
"embellish" scenes in the movie's finale, which involves Capt. Kirk, Capt. 
Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and a dangerous alien called Soren (Malcolm 
McDowell). 
</P>
<P>
 "There were things about the movie that we knew well before that screening 
that we wanted to go back and shoot -- a tiny amount of stuff, but stuff we 
wanted to punch up a little bit," said Berman of the film, which is budgeted 
between $30 million-$40 million. "We knew it before we showed it to the studio. 
It has nothing to do with changing the story. It has nothing to do with the old 
characters. We are not doing anything to change fate of any of the characters. 
It's all nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said he refuses to respond to questions about the plot. "If Kirk dies 
in this movie, it's a story point that I don't think I need to divulge to 
anybody before the movie comes out. I think that's unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Berman denied another rumor that Kirk appears in the film for only 12 minutes, 
which, if true, may infuriate many Trekkers. Berman said the actual screen time 
for Kirk is "over a half-hour" in a film that currently is about 110 minutes 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a story about the original cast," Berman said. "This is a story 
about the next generation. It has a prologue that involves (three) of the 
original cast members and it has a through-line of James Kirk, so he is in it 
more than others." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost since its inception, the new "Star Trek" has touched off controversy 
among Trekkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with a film that has the most verbal and passionate group of 
fans that exists for any film or television phenomenon that is around right 
now," Berman said. "You name me one other franchise where anytime, day or 
night, you can log on to computer networks and see literally hundreds of people 
discussing things that they haven't even seen yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Trekkers are unhappy that all of the original cast won't be in this 
movie. Only Shatner, James Doohan (Scotty) and Walter Koenig (Chekov) are in 
the film. Leonard Nimoy, who portrayed Spock, chose not to appear this time, as 
did DeForest Kelley, who played Dr. McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason they're putting the two (casts) together is to make money," 
said Alisha Black, a San Diego-area homemaker and Trekker. "Paramount is not 
stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Black, who identifies herself as Vice Admiral Black on the telephone, heads a 
250-member Star Trek writing club called "Starships of the Third Fleet;" her 
husband, Ken Brannon, is Fleet Admiral. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of the crew should have been in it," Black said. "I don't think 
it should be a 'Next Generation' movie. If it's a pass-the-torch movie, it 
should be half and half." 
</P>
<P>
 Black said she has seen the "Generations" script circulating at Trekker 
conventions. In fact, she said, before "Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country" 
came out in 1991, Paramount used her in a "sting" to help arrest four people 
who were selling bootleg copies of that script. 
</P>
<P>
 Black said many Trekkers won't like it if Kirk dies, but she is prepared. Her 
advice to fellow Trekkers: "Bring some Kleenex."

FOX, NBC YANK THREE SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE MARGULIES, TIMES TELEVISION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only 10 days into the fall season, both Fox and NBC yanked shows out of the 
prime-time lineup to shore up obvious ratings weaknesses. Sent to the bench 
were NBC's "The Martin Short Show" and Fox's "Fortune Hunter" and "Wild Oats." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC said Short's Tuesday night sitcom will definitely be given another shot in 
December, after the producers have had a chance to overhaul it -- again. The 
show had been revamped after the pilot that was shot to sell the series. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of "Fortune Hunter" and "Wild Oats" is not so certain, particularly 
with the ouster on Wednesday of Fox programming chief Sandy Grushow. Whether 
his replacement, John Matoian, will want to keep them or cancel them was 
uncertain Thursday, a Fox spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortune Hunter" and "Wild Oats" were two key factors that apparently led to 
Grushow's dismissal -- part of the Sunday lineup that has been trounced by ABC, 
CBS and NBC despite the expensive addition of NFL football as a lead-in to the 
prime-time fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wild Oats," a sex-oriented sitcom at 9:30 p.m., ranked 89th among last week's 
92 prime-time network programs, and "Fortune Hunter," a spy drama slotted at 7 
p.m. opposite "60 Minutes," was 92nd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortune Hunter" will air again this weekend, then will be replaced by 
"Encounters: The Hidden Truth," a magazine-style series about "strange and 
unexplained phenomena" that Fox tried out this summer. The 9:30 slot will be 
filled for two weeks by reruns of "Married . . . With Children," then by "The 
George Carlin Show," a sitcom returning from last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratings for "The Martin Short Show" declined nearly 10% this week and were 
lower than for shows on either side of it, "Wings" and "Frasier." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC will fill the next three Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. with repeats of "Wings" and 
"Mad About You," with plans after that still to be determined.

GUBER LEAVES SONY PICTURES TO FORM OWN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and ELAINE DUTKA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Guber, the mercurial movie producer tapped five years ago by consumer 
electronics giant Sony Corp. to build its movie business, quit Thursday as the 
company's top executive in Hollywood, dissolving one of the priciest and most 
tumultuous regimes in recent motion picture history. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber, 52, who with producing partner Jon Peters was lured by Sony's Japanese 
owners with an outlay of more than $700 million to lead the company, will leave 
his post as chairman and chief executive of Sony Pictures Entertainment 
immediately to form a Sony-backed entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber's departure -- a topic of speculation all year because of the poor 
performance of Sony's movie business -- comes at a critical time for Sony 
Pictures, which owns the Columbia and TriStar studios. The company has lagged 
behind other major studios in movie production and, critics say, lacks a clear 
strategy for taking advantage of today's rapid shifts in the entertainment 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Guber, Sony's releases ranged from the highly profitable "Sleepless in 
Seattle" and "In the Line of Fire" to such flops as "Last Action Hero" and 
"I'll Do Anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Sony's well-publicized problems this year, Guber and Michael P. 
Schulhof, chief executive of Sony Corp. of America, insisted in interviews that 
it was Guber's idea to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are my interests, my passions and concerns with this kind of job? Clearly, 
right now, they are no longer. That's what motivated the change," Guber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Guber's move was viewed by Hollywood executives as a graceful way to 
give Guber and an increasingly impatient Sony what they both want -- a fresh 
start. One top executive who knows Guber said he was weary of the pressure and 
criticism, while others said he has been unhappy for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sony job was so removed from what excites him -- putting together and 
creating movies," said James Wiatt, president of the International Creative 
Management talent agency. "He was never thrilled with the job, and the negative 
attention that came with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some senior studio executives who worked under Guber speculated that he may 
have taken matters into his own hands out of a belief that a showdown was 
brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Peter sensed that he might be let go and didn't want to go down in 
disgrace. He wanted to do it before it was done to him," said one high-level 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber will leave with a lucrative payout, including an unspecified share of a 
$50-million bonus he is said to be splitting with a handful of Sony executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber is the second major film executive to move on in the past few weeks. 
Jeffrey Katzenberg disclosed last month that he will leave as chairman of Walt 
Disney Studios effective this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber's departure is yet another chapter in Sony's five-year ordeal in trying 
to build a movie business, which it calls "software," to complement the 
company's electronics "hardware." Sony bought Columbia Pictures for $3.4 
billion in 1989, and by some estimates has overall sunk $6 billion to $7 
billion into Hollywood, an investment that so far remains far from paid off. 
Sony's experience serves as a vivid reminder of the minefield that foreign 
investors face trying to turn a profit in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such movie successes as "City Slickers" and "A League of Their Own" 
during his time at Sony, Guber's tenure the past 15 months has brought the 
studio an unprecedented level of scrutiny and criticism. Sony suffered through 
such public embarrassments as the "Last Action Hero" debacle, the Arnold 
Schwarzenegger film that is said to have lost about $25 million for Sony, and 
the media frenzy surrounding the scandal involving alleged Hollywood madam 
Heidi Fleiss. Sony was linked to the affair when one of its Columbia executives 
publicly denied being involved with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Sony's movie business has been plagued by a string of box office 
disappointments such as "North" and "City Slickers II." The combined box office 
market share for Columbia and TriStar -- now at less than 10% -- is less than 
that of major competitors Walt Disney, Warner Bros., Paramount, Universal and 
20th Century Fox. One top financial analyst estimated Sony Pictures' negative 
cash flow at $250 million in the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sony has suffered through turmoil in its executive ranks, 
complaints from producers about a logjam in getting projects approved and the 
inability of Sony officials to attract a strategic partner to invest in the 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia's release schedule also slowed to a trickle early this year, with 
only two movies released in the first five months compared to seven during the 
same period in 1993. The number of films released is expected to pick up in the 
next few months, however. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining his move, Guber said he wanted to take the "ee" out of his title 
and add an "er" to it -- becoming an employer instead of employee. He added 
that changes in his personal life -- including turning 50 in 1992, the recent 
adoption of two children by Guber and his wife, and receiving a full 
professorship at UCLA -- caused him to re-evaluate his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the third act of my life," said Guber, who is expected to work the 
next few weeks raising money from overseas investors for his venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulhof, who developed a close friendship with Guber to the point where their 
children once dated, said he supported Guber's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four months ago, Peter came to me and said, 'I think my time is up,' " 
Schulhof said. "When he told me what he had in mind, to create an entertainment 
company, I said, 'Not only will I support it, I'll invest in it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sony said it will not replace Guber, and that Sony Pictures Entertainment will 
be run by Alan J. Levine, a low-profile lawyer who has been at the studio for 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine retains his title of president and chief operating officer, and has 
signed a new contract, believed to be for five years. The arrangement is 
similar to the structure Schulhof set up at Sony Music, where he oversees the 
operation but allows Thomas D. Mottola, also a chief operating officer and 
president, to run it. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said he did not expect to make many changes, and defended Guber's 
tenure, saying that criticism has unfairly blamed Guber for movie flops and 
ignored more successful operations such as Sony's television and movie theater 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always focus on just the movies. They say they had a good movie, so it 
must have been Peter. They had a bad movie, so it must have been Peter. He was 
chairman and CEO of the whole company," Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine, Guber and Schulhof all refuted talk that Guber's departure was sparked 
by the recent hiring of former CBS Entertainment chief Jeffrey Sagansky as an 
executive vice president directly under Schulhof. They also denied that 
Sagansky, who also formerly ran TriStar, will play a major role in Sony 
Pictures movie operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have stayed in California if that were the case," Schulhof said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources say that Sagansky -- more highly regarded for his work in TV 
than in film -- does not want to focus on the big screen. They also discounted 
talk that Katzenberg will play a role at Sony. 
</P>
<P>
 One theory circulating had Mark Canton, who oversees Columbia and TriStar and 
reports to Levine, being given a grace period to turn things around. Others 
argued that a company that has been through so much turmoil is unlikely to 
shuffle its executive ranks soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Canton, who recently extended his contract, reportedly for three years, said 
he has no plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Sony decided to extend my deal a month and a half ago, they made all the 
statement they need to make about my ability. I have no plans to leave. My sole 
interest is doing this job as well as I can. . . . I'm not nearly living up to 
my own standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "For six or eight months, things went awry," Canton said. "I'm not trying to 
sweep that under the rug. But the only paralysis these days is in my neck from 
reading so much material. Between Columbia and TriStar, we'll release eight 
movies before the end of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Guber's deal was worked out late Tuesday. A dozen or so department heads were 
called together for the announcement Thursday morning. None, said one 
participant, expected the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber and Peters, his production partner on such 1980s hits as "Batman," were 
an odd couple when conservative Sony picked them in 1989. Guber cut his 
ponytail and shed his T-shirts for suits. Peters left Sony two years later and 
is now an independent film producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony spent dearly to get them -- buying their production company for $200 
million and paying $500 million to spring them from their long-term producing 
contract with Warner Bros. The two also spent Sony's money freely, generating 
now-legendary stories about excesses such as delivering flowers via a Sony jet. 
</P>
<P>
 One producer who has worked with Guber said that Guber and Sony will both be 
better off in the end. "He's a better maker of movies than 99% of the producers 
around town. He may have miscast himself as the mogul," the producer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guber's office once housed movie-making legend Louis B. Mayer when Sony's lot 
was the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer facility. On Thursday, Guber said a picture of 
Mayer he keeps on his desk helps keep the latest development in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I get full of myself, I look at it and remind myself that I'm only 
renting," he said.

5 PRO-DEMOCRACY HAITIANS KILLED IN GRENADE ATTACK; CARIBBEAN: MORE THAN 40 ARE 
HURT IN PORT-AU-PRINCE BLAST BLAMED ON BACKERS OF MILITARY. U.S. TROOPS SEIZE A 
SUSPECT; AMERICAN AMBASSADOR ASSAILS 'BRUTAL ACTS.'

<P>
 A grenade attack on a pro-democracy demonstration Thursday killed at least 
five people and wounded more than 40 in a bloody act of apparent resistance by 
Haiti's military dictatorship and its supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings came on the eve of the third anniversary of the violent overthrow 
of the country's only democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
whose impending return has been marked repeatedly in recent days by sneak 
attacks, beatings and shootings of his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that hundreds of demonstrators marching between downtown and 
the city's airport were passing a warehouse owned by Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph 
Francois, Haiti's feared police chief and a leader of the ruling military 
junta, when at least one grenade was thrown from a car that may have emerged 
from the building. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Francois, one of the three Haitian officers who have ruled 
Haiti with violence and corruption since the coup, was reported by friends and 
U.S. military sources to have packed up things from his office and was 
preparing to leave the country within days. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois would be the first of the three Haitian military leaders to accede to 
U.S. and U.N. demands that they leave power. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Thursday's grenade or grenades were thrown by known members of 
a civilian wing of the Haitian army, at least one of whom was later tracked by 
a U.S. military police team using dogs and led away in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The final death toll from the second attack on peaceful demonstrators in two 
days was incomplete by dusk Thursday, but eyewitnesses, hospitals, the Haitian 
Red Cross and U.S. officials agreed that the total killed or wounded was more 
than 40. 
</P>
<P>
 A passing U.S. Army patrol came upon the scene and opened fire just moments 
after the explosions. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether the American gunfire hit any of the demonstrators or 
any of the attackers, but at least one of the attackers was reported among the 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Army Col. John Ryneska, who also happened by the scene soon after the 
attack, said none of the American troops were injured, and he confirmed that at 
least one Haitian had been detained. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to the incident, U.S. Ambassador William Lacey Swing told reporters 
that the U.S. government "condemns in the strongest terms the explosions which 
took place this afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 With Haiti "undergoing fundamental, watershed change . . . such brutal acts of 
violence are not totally surprising," Swing said. He issued a stern appeal for 
calm today, saying, "We would simply urge everyone to avoid violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Tension and violence have been building since a mission led by former 
President Jimmy Carter, backed by the threat of an imminent U.S. invasion, 
forged an agreement Sept. 18 under which the Haitian military leadership is to 
resign no later than Oct. 15 and allow Aristide's return in exchange for 
immunity from prosecution for its role in the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was followed by the peaceful arrival of U.S. troops, who have 
taken increasing but not yet total control of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Thursday that about 19,000 U.S. troops are now in Haiti -- 
including some brought in to replace soldiers who are about to depart -- and 
the number "may go a little higher." Pentagon officials initially estimated 
that about 15,000 would be deployed here. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian military leaders and the civilians who often do their bidding say they 
are abiding by the Sept. 18 accord, but they apparently have engaged in various 
acts of violent resistance. One person was fatally wounded Wednesday, and 
several others were also hurt, when men fired from a car at demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 As Francois prepared to leave and some of his followers apparently were 
engaged in Thursday's attack, thousands of Haitians swarmed outside City Hall, 
listening through loudspeakers installed by U.S. forces as Port-au-Prince Mayor 
Evans Paul reclaimed the office taken from him during the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Paul tried to enter City Hall, on Aug. 8, 1993, a mob summoned 
by the military stormed the building and killed eight people. Paul, a 
38-year-old former radio newscaster and playwright with an immense public 
following, had been in hiding ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, whose popularity and anti-military stance have brought several beatings 
and near-fatal torture in 1988, called on each ruling general -- and on 
Francois by name -- to depart. 
</P>
<P>
 "No law says you must leave the country. . . . but for the sake of peace, you 
should do it," Paul said to deafening applause. "Leave the country for a time. 
When peace is restored, you can come back." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor, who many Haitians believe could succeed Aristide in presidential 
elections scheduled for next year, punctuated his speech with the trademark 
chant of Haiti's pro-democracy struggle: "The cock has crowed! Get up! Stand 
up!" 
</P>
<P>
 He also announced a new battle cry: "Justice! Democracy! Progress!" And the 
crowd outside chanted with him as he shouted the words more than a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul also appealed several times during his half-hour speech for peaceful 
change and called on all Haitians to shun revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "A true democrat does not seek vengeance," he said. "A democrat does not seek 
violence. A democrat seeks only peace, democracy, justice, unity and progress. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We wish that no one will fear anyone or anything," he said as dozens of U.S. 
troops stood guard outside. "If someone does not believe what we believe, leave 
them in peace. We are all Haitians. We should live together in the same country 
in peace, even if we disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's pro-democracy marchers did not heed Paul's call. They sacked the 
warehouse at the site of the grenade attack, hauling out thousands of bags of 
cement that Francois had obtained while still in control. 
</P>
<P>
 Francois, who used his position to earn millions in businesses ranging from 
auto towing to smuggling to cement importing, will retire and go into exile in 
the neighboring Dominican Republic, where he has a home and huge investments, 
sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 36-year-old Francois was the backbone of the Sept. 30, 1991, coup that 
drove Haiti into the bloody spiral of violent chaos that brought on a 
devastating economic embargo and climaxed with the U.S. military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in his office yesterday and packed up his things," said a friend who 
accompanied the shadowy, almost mythical head of Haiti's corrupt and brutal 
police force to his headquarters in the center of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect him to turn in his papers for an early retirement and leave for the 
DR within 24 to 72 hours," the friend said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. military source confirmed the account, adding that Francois may have 
left by the end of the day Thursday. Military commander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras 
and his chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, have repeatedly denied that 
they will leave the country, although both are expected to resign their 
positions before the Oct. 15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloody as it was, Thursday's violence could be only a prelude to future 
horror, observers here said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats and U.S. military officials expressed deep fear that the grenade 
attack and the earlier bloodshed will be dwarfed by conflicts today as huge 
pro-Aristide demonstrations collide with opponents who have threatened, and now 
have acted, to exact revenge for their impending loss of power. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they took Thursday's grenade attack "extremely seriously" 
and indicated that Lt. Gen. Hugh Shelton, commander of the American forces that 
began arriving here Sept. 19 to guarantee Aristide's eventual safe return, will 
meet urgently with Cedras in an effort to stop the violence. 
</P>

 "These attacks are the last, desperate acts of a dying regime," one Haitian 
political expert said. "They are so filled with hatred and fear that they are 
giving in to barbarism. They know they are dying, and they want to make certain 
that others die with them." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager indicated that the U.S. military will 
beef up its forces and has a detailed plan to handle any violence today. But 
U.S. troops will try to remain as much in the background as possible, Schrager 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have a significant deterrent presence at this march and at these 
demonstrations," he said. But he too urged restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're after . . . is a safe, peaceful demonstration with no provocation, 
no incidents and no injuries," he said. "This is a chance for peaceful 
expression and a chance to demonstrate discipline as well."

SWEDES ENDURE HEARTACHE OVER FERRY DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were writing tickets, patrolling the streets and making arrests, but 
the Stockholm police department, like much of Sweden, was finding the heartache 
Thursday nearly too much to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-eight employees of the police force were among the passengers aboard the 
ferryboat Estonia, which sank in the turbulent Baltic Sea early Wednesday in 
one of Europe's worst maritime disasters. Five employees survived, but the 
others are among the more than 800 people still missing and presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like a whole generation has vanished," said a teary-eyed Lotta 
Eriksson, who like the victims is a civilian employee of the department. "There 
is an enormous emptiness everywhere, in the canteen, in the corridors." 
</P>
<P>
 The police employees, who were attending a union seminar aboard the Estonia, 
were among a handful of large groups from communities across Sweden that made 
up much of the passenger list. In a country where ferry cruises are a favorite 
national pastime, images of pajama-clad corpses being snatched from the sea 
have created a deep sense of agony not felt since the assassination of Prime 
Minister Olof Palme eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are exhausted both physically and emotionally," said Soren Carlsson, 
chief nurse at Stockholm's Sodersjukhuset, a hospital where some of the 140 
survivors have been treated. "There is sadness today. Maybe the anger comes 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 In the central Swedish town of Jonkoping, anguished church officials were at a 
loss to explain why 15 evangelists returning from a Bible trip to Estonia were 
consumed by the sea. Six members of the group survived, but the loss was so 
great to the Pentecostal Church's Bible school that officials expect to have to 
cancel the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The headmaster and another teacher are among the missing," said Bo-Eric 
Malmvall, a church board member who was comforting distraught relatives 
Thursday. "Hope is very small right now. The church has been open day and 
night, but we don't have answers." 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was equally melancholy in the eastern town of Norrkoping, where none 
of the 56 members of a retirement club have turned up alive. The club had 
organized one of its many getaway excursions, this time to the Estonian capital 
of Tallinn for some shopping and sightseeing. For about $120 each, members got 
meals, lodging and transportation for three days. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of horror in the industrial town southwest of Stockholm was made 
worse by accounts Thursday of the panic aboard the sinking vessel. Some 
survivors hospitalized in Finland spoke of desperate efforts to get off the 
ship, with some frail and elderly passengers, knowing that they could not make 
it, giving up and dropping to the floor in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are seeing pictures in their minds of their relatives and friends 
trapped in the ferry at the bottom of the sea," said Gert Forge, a psychiatric 
nurse at the Norrkoping senior citizen center. "The biggest problem here is 
that none of the 56 has been found." 
</P>
<P>
 Finnish Coast Guard Capt. Raimo Tiilikainen, who is in charge of the rescue 
effort, said 65 bodies had been retrieved from the sea by late Thursday. 
Although accounts continue to vary on the number of people on board, 
authorities say there are as many as 800 still in the sunken boat or lost at 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Finnish forensic pathologist Antti Jaaskelainen said the job of identifying 
the bodies was under way, but the effort has been difficult because the victims 
were exposed for many hours to the cold seawater. Family members have been 
asked to provide photos, medical records and, in some cases, personal objects 
that might be used for DNA matching tests. 
</P>
<P>
 In Stockholm, owners of the ferry apologized for the disaster and said they 
were eagerly searching for one of the craft's two captains, who was reported by 
Finnish authorities to have survived. Officials from Estline, the ferry's part 
owners, said they have not been able to locate Estonian Capt. Ahvo Piht. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure he will be able to provide valuable information," said Sten-Crister 
Forsberg, executive vice president of Nordstrom & Thulin, Estline's Swedish 
parent company. "I can assure you, in that weather he was probably on the 
bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Forsberg said the cause of the sinking was still unknown, but he hinted that 
the investigation was focusing on eyewitness accounts of water flooding the 
large car deck. Although Forsberg insisted that the seals on the deck ramps 
were not faulty, he said the flooded deck was probably "the main cause of the 
accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Per Forsskahl, managing director of the Finnish Ship Owners Assn., also said 
water leaking into the ship probably caused the accident, and he pointed an 
accusing finger at the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must have been something wrong with the way the crew handled the 
situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish and Finnish news reports have speculated that the Estonian crew was 
not up to the job, was hired on the cheap and may have contributed to problems 
because of inexperience and some language barriers. Estline officials said the 
Estonian crew members were qualified to run the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude of the disaster -- and the level of exasperation -- grew 
Thursday when the Finnish coast guard reported that the ferry had apparently 
been carrying 1,049 passengers and crew members, instead of 964, as it had 
previously said. But in Stockholm, Estline officials said 982 people were on 
board. There was even disagreement over who belonged on the passenger list. 
</P>
<P>
 Above flowers and candles left by grieving friends and relatives in Tallinn, a 
long tally of victims was taped to a ferry terminal wall. Among them was 
26-year-old Kulli Tanava. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tanava had not been on the ferry. She had taken it two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I am not calling from the ship," she told Tallinn's KUKU radio Thursday. 
"I am alive and well." 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy reported from Stockholm and Walsh from Turku, Finland. Times special 
correspondent Eva Tarm in Tallinn, Estonia, also contributed to this report.

NEWS ANALYSIS; RIORDAN'S PERSONAL EFFORTS WARM THE BUSINESS CLIMATE; ECONOMY: 
BUT MANY SAY THE MAYOR NEEDS A BROADER VISION. HE IS EXPECTED TO OUTLINE GOALS 
IN A SPEECH TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan didn't like what he read a year ago in 
Fortune magazine: a report that a Venice-based ceramics firm was prepared to 
bolt the city because its expansion plans were being stymied by red tape and 
high costs. 
</P>
<P>
 So Riordan did what he loves best. He got on the phone and asked to talk to 
the boss at the Feltman-Langer Co. Within months, the mayor's office guided the 
company through a maze of city agencies and toward several government loans. 
Now the 65-employee company that specializes in coffee cups will move, not to 
Mexico or Asia, but to a factory in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 Such personal intervention has been the hallmark of Riordan's economic program 
since he took office 15 months ago -- warming the collective heart, if not the 
mind, of much of the business community. But many business people say the mayor 
still needs a broader vision -- and systemic improvements in the city's 
bureaucracy and tax structure -- that will help lead Los Angeles out of its 
worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan plans to tackle that larger mission beginning today, when he will 
deliver what his office is calling a "major address" on "Investing in the 
Future of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 What Riordan is expected to offer today, more than anything, is continuing 
goodwill toward business and a summary of his achievements so far. He will also 
talk about a 19-member team dedicated to attracting and retaining business, the 
impending release of proposals to make it less onerous to undertake 
construction, and a one-stop loan guarantee office. Tax breaks and other 
economic incentives are, at best, on the more distant horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican Riordan is also likely to take a page from his party's manual and 
assert government's limited influence on economic growth. In the past, he has 
warned of "magic bullets" and grandiose plans, saying: "I'm not a bull artist." 
</P>
<P>
 In his first year, Riordan concentrated on balancing the city's budget and 
finding money to expand the Police Department. He reasoned that the creation of 
a safer city is the single best economic development action he can take. 
</P>
<P>
 The businessman-turned-mayor also played to his natural strength -- talking 
person to person with entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Riordan, bless his heart, he had the chutzpah to call up and say, 'I don't 
want you to leave Los Angeles, I want you to stay in L.A.,' " said Jan Belson, 
Feltman-Langer's owner. "That kind of bowled me over." 
</P>
<P>
 In his second year, the mayor's aides concede that they must move beyond what 
one business consultant called Riordan's "random acts of goodness." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, his willingness to talk and to seek out the business community 
seems to have put him in good favor. Even Joe Sanchez Jr., a prominent 
supporter of Riordan election opponent Mike Woo and owner of a wholesale 
grocery business, said he has developed a reluctant admiration for the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been pleasantly surprised," Sanchez said. "I sort of like what he's 
saying and . . . I think the guy is really trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers suggested that Riordan could have done more if not for the Jan. 
17 earthquake, which absorbed money and energy that might otherwise have gone 
to economic development. Others said Riordan stumbled out of the blocks when he 
appointed Al Villalobos, his first deputy mayor for economic development. 
Villalobos resigned last year after The Times published stories detailing 
allegations of a checkered business career. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow with the Center for the New West, a 
public policy think tank, said he believes Riordan's greatest success has been 
in lifting the spirits of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's at least a sense that City Hall is interested in talking to business 
and that he is accessible," Kotkin said. And yet, "I'm not sure that the 
results have been spectacular. . . . In terms of substantive changes, I don't 
think there have been all that many." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in Los Angeles feel their future success is closely aligned with 
Riordan's. And they are loath to criticize him. "Nobody wants to attack him 
because he is the best we have," said one business consultant, who asked not to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 But most business people don't doubt that Riordan is trying. 
</P>
<P>
 When Coast Federal Savings Bank threatened to take more than 700 employees 
from its San Fernando Valley headquarters and go elsewhere, for example, 
Riordan and his aides arranged for the bank to move to the former Hughes 
Aircraft research facility in Chatsworth. The deal still must be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor also helped talk California Fashion Industries, maker of the Carole 
Little women's clothing line, into undertaking a $10-million expansion of its 
Downtown factory instead of moving to Nevada. He also helped push ahead 
long-stalled plans for a Food 4 Less supermarket at Adams Boulevard and Vermont 
Avenue that will employ about 150 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had not been for the intervention of the mayor's office and Councilman 
(Hal) Bernson's office, Coast Federal would have left Los Angeles," said 
Downtown lawyer-lobbyist George Mihlsten, who represented the institution. "I 
think the business retention and attraction strategy is working." 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been losses too. 
</P>
<P>
 An intensive lobbying effort by Riordan was not enough to keep computer maker 
Packard Bell and its 1,500 employees in Chatsworth, especially after the 
January earthquake devastated the company's plant. Citing an "unacceptable 
earthquake risk for (a) sole U.S. manufacturing location," the company 
announced last month that it would leave Southern California, perhaps for 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrifty Corp. also announced that it would move its headquarters after a 
well-publicized dispute with the mayor's office. Riordan said he gave up on the 
case when he learned that Thrifty was intent on moving to Oregon to complete a 
merger with the larger PayLess drugstore chain that is based there. But Thrifty 
principal Leonard Green said Riordan had made little effort to keep Thrifty in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The next great battle on the business promotion front: Bloomingdale's. The 
upscale department store is currently weighing whether to open its first West 
Coast outlet in Beverly Hills or Century City, within the Los Angeles city 
limits. Bloomingdale's Chairman Michael Gould said a meeting with Riordan 
convinced him that the city will do "whatever it takes" to land the store, but 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents the area, is already decrying the 
traffic problems it would bring. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's office claims a host of other victories on more global issues that 
confront business. 
</P>
<P>
 * In September, Riordan succeeded in removing from a regional clean-air plan 
stringent anti-smog measures for airplanes, trucks, trains and ships. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a major move to improve the area's infrastructure, Riordan's staff helped 
negotiate the long-delayed purchase of railroad right of ways to construct a 
high-speed train link between the Port of Los Angeles and Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a nod to one of the city's top industries, Riordan has appointed a deputy 
for entertainment affairs, who has already simplified permit procedures for 
location filming and cut the number of fire inspectors required on most film 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
 * His office also helped arrange for a foreign trade zone near the port, where 
businesses can defer or avoid duties on imports and exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has also not been shy about soliciting federal aid for the city. The 
mayor prides himself on his ties with the Clinton Administration and recently 
announced that more than $2 million in federal transit money is projected to go 
for improvements along eight major transportation corridors in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Riordan's efforts to make fundamental changes in the city bureaucracy 
have been less successful. 
</P>
<P>
 He attempted to remove a 7 1/2% surcharge on business licenses this summer, 
but the City Council agreed only to cut it in half -- leaving Los Angeles' 
business licenses the most costly in the area. An effort to consolidate the 
city's economic development efforts from four departments into one was also 
rejected by the council. And plans for turning some city services over to 
private firms -- a Riordan campaign mantra -- have been pushed firmly onto the 
back burner by city employee unions. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the mayor's hand-picked Committee on Fiscal Administration said 
Riordan and the council had not completed nearly enough of its program for 
firming up the city's finances. The group's chairman, Michael E. Tennenbaum of 
the Bear, Stearns & Co. stock brokerage, compared the city's finances to a 
"kindergarten PTA" and said the city's elected leaders had "failed." Tennenbaum 
said the city can't get its finances in order until it reduces contributions to 
city pension systems and improves bill collections, among other reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the mayor's efforts to play the tough businessman in his municipal 
domain can cut both ways in the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan won a major victory last year when his Airport Commission was able to 
triple landing fees for airlines at LAX -- a boon to the airport treasury but a 
blow to relations with the airline industry, which has suffered major losses in 
recent years. And the mayor's attempts to take more money out of the Port of 
Los Angeles for police and other programs has shipping companies worried that 
their dockage fees could go up. That could drive them to other West Coast ports 
and cripple one of the city's most powerful economic engines, the shippers 
warn. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the mayor's aides bemoaned the lack of tools available to lure and 
retain businesses. So far, officials can promise to cut through bureaucratic 
red tape and to connect entrepreneurs with myriad of state and federally backed 
loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
 That has been enough for some like Belson, the coffee cup maker from Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mayor's office hopes to soon commission a study that will prove its 
contention that the city's business license taxes and other charges -- in 
particular a fee for using the city sewers -- are out of line with neighboring 
cities. Deputy Mayor Michael Keeley reported earlier this year, for example, 
that a manufacturer that would pay $118,000 in business taxes in Los Angeles, 
would be charged just $1,200 in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Further proof of such a disparity might be used to fuel a City Charter 
amendment that would allow the mayor and City Council to approve business tax 
reductions to spur economic growth, mayoral aides said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; MEXICO KILLINGS STIR FEARS OVER THE SYSTEM'S STABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second major political assassination in six months raised questions 
Thursday about the continuing effectiveness of the system that has kept this 
nation stable for six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, the virtual one-party system -- which Peruvian writer Mario 
Vargas Llosa has called "a perfect dictatorship" -- seemed less so as federal 
police began to slowly provide information and correct Wednesday's 
misinformation about the killing of yet another prominent figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Humberto Benitez said late Thursday that Francisco Ruiz Massieu -- 
the second-ranking official in the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, 
which has ruled this country for 65 years -- was killed by an Intratec 
9-millimeter handgun and that the suspect in the slaying had previously been 
misidentified.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspect in custody is now believed to be Daniel Aguilar Trevino from the 
northern state of Tamaulipas, where authorities on Wednesday conducted sweeps 
against the "Gulf" drug cartel. He told authorities that two men paid him the 
equivalent of $17,000 to commit the killing, Benitez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon used to kill Ruiz Massieu has been traced to a community in the Rio 
Grande Valley in Texas, U.S. law enforcement sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Benitez refused to take questions after reading a brief statement or to 
confirm information about the gun that U.S. authorities, who helped with the 
investigation, said is a model known as a "Tec 9" and was purchased in an 
unnamed border city. It was not immediately clear who made the purchase or 
when. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballistics tests match the bullet that killed Ruiz Massieu to the gun, Benitez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar Trevino allegedly said in his statement to police that he was hired by 
Carlos Angel Cantu from his village of Corralejo in San Carlos county in 
Tamaulipas, a state with a reputation for violence and illegal drugs. Cantu and 
Aguilar Trevino arrived in the capital three weeks ago, and, for the four days 
before the killing, stayed at the home of Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez, whom 
Aguilar Trevino identified from a photograph, Benitez said.  
</P>
<P>
 Cantu and Rodriguez Gonzalez showed the suspect a magazine photo of Ruiz 
Massieu, and Cantu accompanied him to the murder scene, the attorney general 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrants have been issued for the arrest of Cantu and Rodriguez Gonzalez on 
murder charges, Benitez said. He provided no explanation for why they might 
have hired the suspect to kill Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 The mixup about identity -- which Benitez attributed to the suspect's having 
initially misidentified himself, then clarified when he made his formal 
statement -- exacerbated lack of public confidence in law enforcement's ability 
to solve crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the investigation continued, Mexicans mourned and confronted doubts about 
their political system, public safety and the seeming impunity of drug dealers 
as they conducted funeral services for Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming just six months after the assassination of PRI presidential candidate 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, Ruiz Massieu's slaying heightens worries that Mexico 
could be returning to the days of political violence that this nation endured 
in the 1920s, which led to the formation of the PRI as a peaceful way to broker 
power struggles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu was fatally shot Wednesday morning in front of a downtown hotel 
as he left a breakfast for his party's recently elected federal deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 His body lay in state at party headquarters Wednesday evening, later being 
moved to a funeral home in the south of the capital, where a small group of 
mourners gathered Thursday morning, until he was taken to the Spanish Cemetery 
for cremation. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens paying tribute to the politician got into a shouting match as they 
reviewed the events that have shaken their country this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person who pulled the trigger did not do this on his own; there was 
somebody behind him," said Maria Concepcion Moguel, 60, a retired government 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Manuel Zavala Sanchez, 50, an engineer, answered sharply, "You do not 
know that." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my opinion," she snapped back. 
</P>
<P>
 "And what about Colosio?" shouted another voice from the crowd, weaving an 
elaborate conspiracy theory. "Do you know when this is going to be solved?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Never," responded Moguel. "It's the PRI, the system itself. They are killing 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are trying to blame it on drug dealers," said one man, who would not 
give his name. "Who is going to believe that?" 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. law enforcement sources said they find plausible the scenario that 
drug traffickers had killed Ruiz Massieu to send a message to his brother, 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Mario Ruiz Massieu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good theory," a U.S. official said. "But that's all it is -- a theory. 
Mario Ruiz has been active in directing (anti-drug) operations and providing 
manpower to go after the cartels." 
</P>
<P>
 Any of Mexico's top drug cartels could have been involved in the slaying, the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Ruiz Massieu also had visibly stepped up efforts to capture Benjamin, 
Javier and Ramon Arellano, the drug lords believed to have masterminded a 
Guadalajara airport shootout last year. Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo was 
killed in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arellano brothers have recently been identified as suspects in the slaying 
earlier this year of Tijuana Police Chief Jose Federico Benitez. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a special team of more than 150 federal police agents swooped into 
Baja California to press the hunt for the fugitive Arellanos, leaders of the 
Tijuana cartel. The raids resulted in 15 arrests, including a cartel lieutenant 
and a former chief homicide detective of the Baja state police; the detective 
is accused of helping Ramon Arellano escape a March shootout between corrupt 
state officers and federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arellanos are considered particularly violence-prone and are influential 
enough to have eluded capture with the help of a protective network of corrupt 
officials. The simultaneously brazen and bumbling style of the Ruiz Massieu 
assassination, in which the gunman's weapon -- capable of either fully 
automatic or semiautomatic fire -- jammed after firing a single bullet, 
resembles previous incidents involving Arellano hit men. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. law enforcement officials familiar with Mexican cartels were 
reluctant to speculate whether the Arellanos or other kingpins would choose to 
strike back at law enforcement by killing a political figure. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible involvement of drug dealers, though, gives renewed credence to 
concerns about an alliance between narcotics cartels and some political 
factions.  
</P>
<P>
 Concern about violence was an important issue in last month's presidential 
election, which Colosio's successor, Ernesto Zedillo, won after a campaign that 
emphasized peace and stability. Reform of the judicial system, from police to 
the courts, was an important plank in his platform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seed of instability has been planted in the country," Moguel said. "Now 
besides the hunger we have in this country, there is also fear."

VICTORY OVER POLIO DECLARED IN AMERICAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Polio -- the dreaded scourge that killed or paralyzed millions of children in 
the world and caused near-hysteria among U.S. parents earlier in the century -- 
has been eradicated from the Western Hemisphere, the World Health Organization 
declared Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 This achievement "should be a source of pride to all of us and it shows what 
can be done when everybody works together for a common cause for the benefit of 
mankind," said Dr. Carlyle Guerra de Macedo, director of the Pan American 
Health Organization, which is the Western Hemisphere office of WHO. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us now hope that the example set in the Americas is followed by the rest 
of the world, so that after the year 2000 no child will ever again fall victim 
to this dreadful disease," he added, speaking at a press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Pan American Health officials attributed the success to an aggressive and 
widespread $540-million immunization campaign launched in the region in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The last documented case of polio in the Americas was recorded in 1991 in 
Pichanaki, a village in Peru. A 3-year-old boy was afflicted. The last case in 
the United States occurred in 1979, according to Pan American Health. 
</P>
<P>
 But 120,000 cases still occur annually in other parts of the world, most of 
them "in the poorest and most politically unstable areas," officials of the 
organization said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease largely has declined worldwide, with the Eastern Mediterranean 
region the sole exception, where a 24% increase was reported in 1993, 
particularly in Pakistan and the Sudan, Pan American Health said. China, which 
reported epidemics of more than 5,000 in 1989 and 1990, has mounted a major 
immunization program. In 1993, Europe recorded 187 cases, of which 161 occurred 
in nine of the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Poliomyelitis, or infantile paralysis, is an infectious disease caused by a 
virus that attacks the central nervous system and can produce paralysis and 
death by asphyxiation. There are no effective drugs to treat it. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients whose respiratory cells have been destroyed usually require a 
respirator to control breathing and keep them alive. The image of a child in a 
so-called "iron lung" became a terrifying specter in this country during the 
height of the epidemic in the early 1950s -- particularly 1952, when the United 
States experienced an explosion of thousands of cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of infection led parents to take extreme measures. Because outbreaks 
mostly occurred during summer, parents frequently would shelter their children 
at home when warm weather arrived. Children were often forbidden to play in 
parks or use public swimming pools. Households with an infected family member 
were placed under quarantine and isolated from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The first effective vaccine against polio was developed by Dr. Jonas Salk in 
1954. Salk's vaccine, which was put into widespread use in 1955, was injectable 
and used killed polio virus to provoke immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1957 and 1959, Dr. Albert Sabin developed an oral vaccine that used a 
live but weakened virus. The Sabin vaccine was licensed in 1961, and continues 
to be the vaccine most widely used in the world today. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease mostly afflicts young children, although adults also are 
susceptible. In fact, the most famous American stricken was President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt, who fell ill at the age of 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Pan American Health officials said that the battle plan to immunize the 
region's children involved several strategies. These include national 
vaccination days, when most of the infant population is vaccinated; "sweep 
operations," when health care workers immunize children, house to house, after 
a suspected case is identified, and intensive surveillance efforts to detect 
new cases. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1985, 11 countries classified as "endemic" -- that is, having had at least 
one confirmed case during the previous three years -- began to sponsor national 
vaccination days on a semiannual basis. Officials of the Western Hemisphere 
organization said that this often involved massive education campaigns in 
advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the civil war in El Salvador ended, for example, Pan American Health 
negotiated with guerrilla fighters and the military, asking them to declare a 
temporary truce and respect a cease-fire during the vaccination day, the 
organization said. In Peru, Pan American Health sponsored a press conference to 
inform the nation -- and Shining Path guerrillas -- of the coming vaccination 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult problem was finding ways to keep the vaccine cold, 
organization officials said. The medication requires constant temperatures 
below 10 degrees Centigrade (50 degrees Fahrenheit). 
</P>
<P>
 In Peru, for example, many of the cold packs were kept frozen every night in 
refrigerators loaned by villagers. In Lima, during an especially hot summer, 
more than 10 tons of ice were needed to preserve the vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign was funded by the collaborative effort among countries and 
agencies, including $430 million provided by the countries themselves, and the 
remainder from collaborating agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 These included the U.S. Agency for International Development, Rotary 
International, United Nations Children's Fund, the Inter-American Development 
Bank and the Canadian Public Health Assn. AID officials said that the agency 
contributed $79 million between 1986 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 WHO said it would concentrate its efforts next on the complete eradication of 
polio in the rest of the world, as was achieved with smallpox in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it will turn its attention to launching a similar effort against 
measles, another vaccine-preventable illness that kills 1 million people 
annually, most of them children. Polio-eradication programs have left a health 
infrastructure within the Americas "that will facilitate the struggle against 
measles," Pan American Health said. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization said that it hopes polio can be wiped out by the year 2000. 
Today, 81% of the world's children have received the vaccine, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge . . . will be to reach the remaining 20% of children who live 
in the most isolated and impenetrable areas of the world," the organization 
said.

U.S. PANEL URGES FULL OVERHAUL OF CANCER RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal advisory panel Thursday recommended a sweeping overhaul of the 
nation's anti-cancer campaign, predicting that -- if its present course 
continues -- cancer will surpass heart disease as the nation's leading killer 
within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to Congress, the group said that the program suffers from a lack 
of coordination and a shortage of funds needed to pursue "unprecedented 
opportunities" in scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
 It said that a White House-led effort -- including Cabinet-level 
representation -- is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 It also called for tougher federal policies against tobacco, including higher 
taxes, the elimination of tobacco subsidies and of tax deductions for tobacco 
product advertising, prohibiting tobacco exports and an end to federal funding 
to cancer research organizations that accept tobacco industry support. Tobacco 
use has been scientifically established as the primary cause of lung cancer and 
has also been associated with several other types of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, a subcommittee of the National Cancer Advisory Board -- an 
independent group of outside experts that advises the National Cancer Institute 
-- characterized existing cancer care for the poor, elderly and uninsured as 
inadequate and said that most congressional health reform measures would have 
worsened an already bad situation by failing to provide explicit "universal 
cancer-care coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not taking full advantage of opportunities for prevention," said Dr. 
Paul Calabresi, a professor of medicine at the Brown University School of 
Medicine, who served as chairman of the subcommittee. "Patients' and survivors' 
quality of life can be improved. Most importantly, the advances we have made in 
prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation are not available equally 
to all of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 One in three people will be diagnosed with cancer during a lifetime and an 
estimated 1.2 million new cancer cases will be added this year to the 8 million 
Americans alive today who already have been diagnosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although enormous medical advances have been made, the incidence of cancer has 
risen 18% and the death rate 7% since 1971, when Congress launched the nation's 
"war on cancer" by passing the National Cancer Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-member panel -- made up of representatives from cancer research, 
medicine, nursing, industry, communications and patient advocacy -- was asked 
by Congress to evaluate why cancer is still on the rise after $23 billion in 
spending since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 The report called for a detailed evaluation of cancer research programs and 
priorities, the elimination of excessive earmarking or redirection of research 
funds and an expansion of the National Cancer Institute's network of cancer 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Cancer Society praised the report, particularly its emphasis on 
health reform and the need to crack down on tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 It "adds substantial new weight to the need for health care reform that 
provides universal access to care," said Dr. Irvin Fleming, president of the 
society. Also, the report "adds to the inevitability that tobacco taxes will be 
raised substantially." Such a tax increase "is the single most effective way to 
reduce smoking rates and especially among children," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also noted that more support is needed for so-called 
translational research -- the bridge connecting basic research to its 
application in humans. Such researchers are becoming "an endangered species," 
and the result will be that "the transfer of knowledge from the laboratory to 
the people will be delayed needlessly," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said that an additional $60 million per year -- or about $1 million 
for each NCI-approved cancer center -- should go toward encouraging 
translational research. This money is especially needed now because support 
that formerly came from pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries "is 
diminishing rapidly" because of health reform pressures, the panel said.

ALL L.A.'S A STAGE AS WORLD WATCHES THE SIMPSON TRIAL; MEDIA: TO MANY OVERSEAS, 
THE DRAMA DISPLAYS WHAT THEY SEE AS AMERICA'S ESSENCE -- HOLLYWOOD, RACISM AND 
VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As millions of Americans tune in to the O.J. Simpson murder trial, much of the 
world is tuning in to America. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, the Simpson case has been a kind of two-way mirror. While 
Americans debate its legal and moral content and reflect on its meaning for 
American society, the world watches and analyzes America's media, its legal 
system and its seeming penchant for self-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 To many abroad, this is simply the quintessential American story: a gruesome 
murder in Hollywood (to Europeans, all of Los Angeles is Hollywood); an 
American hero's flight down a freeway with those all-American accouterments, a 
gun and a cellular telephone, broadcast live to a country transfixed; then, 
court television and, possibly, a final act played out in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama is described as American soap opera and Hollywood action film, 
"Columbo" and "L.A. Law" in one. When, last June, fans lined the freeway to 
cheer on a man sought for murder and threatening suicide, it was viewed from 
afar as the the ultimate Hollywood blurring of life and docudrama. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fascinated nation is being presented a play that is half Shakespeare, 
half soap opera: Othello and Richard Kimble, garnished with a bit of Coppola's 
'Apocalypse Now,' " wrote the German weekly magazine Stern, which has made much 
of the fact that Nicole Brown Simpson was born in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine it happening anywhere else in the world," said Nicole 
Marchand, a Belgian accountant who viewed the spectacle from Namur. 
</P>
<P>
 To audiences baffled by a country that prefers a tedious legal proceeding to 
the World Cup, foreign correspondents based in Washington and Los Angeles this 
summer have had to explain American psyche and sociology. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of Americans are on a first-name basis with Simpson, they wrote. No, 
not first name -- first initials . They feel as if he is a personal friend. 
They feel "as if a family member had been torn from their midst," Stern 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "No country in the world builds pedestals for its heroes, especially its 
sporting heroes, as high and as gilded as this one does," Independent of London 
correspondent David Usborne wrote days after Simpson's dramatic arrest June 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as his colleague Peter Pringle saw it, Americans were "once again 
confusing film stars and sports celebrities with real heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 Europeans in particular seem incredulous at how thoroughly the Simpson case 
took over -- and will again consume -- American airwaves and brain waves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember -- and this may be hard for a British reader to imagine," Anne 
Applebaum wrote in the Spectator magazine, "that the O.J. Simpson story was, at 
various moments over the past six weeks, running on CNN 24 hours a day while 
leading all of the news programs and simultaneously appearing on the front 
pages of every newspaper and the front covers of every news magazine. This is 
not even to mention the dozens and dozens of ever-multiplying talk shows and 
television 'magazine' programs, each with its celebrity host and celebrity 
guests, each with its own angle, tabloid-trashy or upmarket-serious or 
caring-therapeutic." 
</P>
<P>
 Tragedy as soap opera is more than some can stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montreal Gazette's Jack Todd called Simpson fans on the freeway "the 
warped and weird thousands." Noting that USA Today had said the case 
"tarnished" Simpson's image, Todd wrote, "If there's anything more sickening 
than the crimes of which Simpson stands accused, it's the reactions of the 
millions who just don't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 The case confirms the beliefs of many about America's worst traits: It is a 
racist country addicted to violence and sensationalism. The Simpson trial is an 
extension of the Clarence Thomas hearings and the Los Angeles riots, of the 
Menendez brothers' murder trial and the William Kennedy Smith and Lorena 
Bobbitt and Tonya Harding and. . . . It's all one big media blur. 
</P>
<P>
 "To satisfy the spectacular nature of the market one no longer hesitates to 
show a manhunt live," sniffed Paul Nahon in the French magazine Le Nouvel 
Observateur. "There is no longer any limit. Neither to the sordid nor the 
cynical."  
</P>
<P>
 Michio Ochi of the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun indicted America for 
racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time magazine printed a cover of O.J. Simpson that darkened his face so that 
he looked like a vicious criminal. It symbolized a malicious intent of white, 
mainstream people to pull this black murderer of his divorced Caucasian wife 
down from his 'Hercules' status and to throw him back into the slum from which 
he made the toughest effort to escape." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Independent, Kenan Malik wrote, "After Simpson's arrest, the Los 
Angeles Police Department faced considerable criticism for having allowed him 
to escape in the first place. 'If it had been any other black man,' said a 
young African American angrily, 'he would have been arrested, handcuffed and 
thrown in the slammer so quick he wouldn't have known what hit him.' He was 
articulating his anger about the LAPD's racist attitudes toward ordinary 
blacks. White Americans have been making the same point -- but for very 
different reasons. What they want to know is why Simpson was treated like a 
celebrity, when he is just a black man." 
</P>
<P>
 The international media note that racism is both an agonizing issue for the 
American public and part of the defense's strategy. The defense's plan to 
impugn the integrity of the police officers who investigated the case will 
raise "bad cop" issues, as in the Rodney G. King case, and consequently, will 
force Americans to further examine what is wrong with themselves and their 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (toddler) James Bulger was murdered by two children last year, Britain 
also descended into an orgy of self-examination. . . . But in the end, Britain 
did not put itself on trial," Applebaum wrote in the Spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 "In America, however, the use of terms borrowed from psychoanalysis is so 
widespread -- popularized by countless self-help books and talk show hosts with 
therapy training -- that it no longer seems odd that the whole society should 
be held accountable for a single crime," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding that American political commentators sometimes refer to Yugoslavia as a 
"dysfunctional country," she went on to say it is hardly surprising that a 
celebrity murder is seen "as an occasion for national soul-searching and an 
investigation of racism -- the great national personality disorder -- rather 
than as a time to evaluate the facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the international media explain how the American trial will proceed, how 
the two sides will work the jury. As the defense tries to raise doubts about 
police integrity and competence, the prosecution will try to "wipe away the 
image of the nice guy who has worked his way up from the ghetto to the dream 
factory, and produce the one of a common murderer," wrote Michael Schwelien in 
the German newspaper Die Zeit. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this will be played out as an American story on American television, 
the media note. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of television has elements of a brothel," Schwelien wrote. "But a 
brothel with a separate room for self-righteousness. The viewer is allowed to 
moan 'Terrible, terrible,' while the juicy details of sex- and blood-crimes are 
put on the table."

SENATE TO VOTE ON TRADE ACCORD AFTER ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Abandoning an effort to win speedy approval of a new world trade agreement, 
the White House and its Senate allies agreed Thursday to delay a vote on the 
pact until Dec. 1, forcing the Senate into an extraordinary post-election 
session, White House and Senate sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), chairman of the Senate 
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, and others seeking to defeat 
the trade plan will gain an additional two months to rally opposition but will 
not, as the White House feared, succeed in delaying the vote until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement also means that the fate of the trade accord will be decided by 
a lame-duck Senate. Major nations awaiting the result of the vote here could 
end up delaying their ratification decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which the House is expected to vote on next week, was endorsed 
Thursday by the Senate Finance Committee, 19 to 0. White House officials remain 
confident that it will win Senate approval, with one senior aide saying that as 
many as 80 senators are expected to vote for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be a problem," the aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact would implement a massive revision of the rules that have governed 
global commerce since World War II. The agreement, negotiated over more than 
seven years, would cut tariffs -- the taxes imposed on imports -- by an average 
of 40% and bring down quotas and other barriers to trade around the world. It 
would expand the scope of the rules to such growing economic endeavors as 
services, insurance, pharmaceuticals and some entertainment activities. 
</P>
<P>
 By the Clinton Administration's estimate, the proposed changes in the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which has set the rules of international 
commerce for 47 years, would amount to a $740-billion tax cut around the world, 
providing a stunning boost to economic growth and employment as a result of 
lowered prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every serious economic study of GATT has estimated that it will create 
hundreds of thousands of high-paying American jobs over the next decade and 
ultimately add between $100 (billion) and $200 billion to our (gross domestic 
product) every single year," President Clinton said at a ceremony at the 
Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's plan to win congressional approval next week was thrown 
into disarray Wednesday when Hollings said that he would bottle up the accord 
by exercising his prerogative as a committee chairman to hold it in the 
Commerce Committee for the full 45 days allowed under Senate rules. 
</P>
<P>
 His plan would have put off a vote until after the Senate's anticipated 
adjournment for the year on Oct. 7, a move that ordinarily would have pushed 
the vote over to next year and into the new Congress. No sooner had he 
announced his plan than Clinton said he would ask the Senate to return after 
Election Day when the 45-day clock has expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration preferred the special session to seeing the issue carry 
into the new year because the delays could unravel support and raise doubts 
among trading partners about the United States' commitment to free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly one quarter of the 123 nations taking part have ratified the plan and 
the Administration hopes it will go into effect on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 As described by White House and congressional officials, the Senate will 
recess at the end of next week, rather than adjourn, and then return after 
Thanksgiving to consider the trade plan. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a degree of grumbling among Senate Democrats on Thursday morning 
over the possibility that they would be dragged back into session after the 
election and, although White House and Senate aides said the Dec. 1 date is 
firm, Hollings could still relent and allow a vote next week. 
</P>
<P>
 As sketchy details of the procedural agreement emerged Thursday evening, it 
was unclear whether other issues could be raised during the lame-duck meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Griffin, the White House legislative affairs director, said "the hope 
would be" that the session would be limited to the trade legislation. But, 
"there's a lot floating around out there" that the senators might try to bring 
up, under their peculiar and often malleable rules, once they are back in 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollings has been an ardent and longtime opponent of the effort to reduce 
trade barriers and he has said that his concerns about the agreement go beyond 
its impact on one industry. But there is little doubt that, as a result of the 
trade pact, the textile and apparel industries struggling in his state would be 
open to even greater competition from lower-wage producers in Asia than they 
now face.

 As a gung-ho Marine, she was among the first troops sent to the Persian Gulf. 
And although she never saw combat, she was shipped home suffering the same kind 
of shock, depression and flashbacks that combat veterans often experience. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong-willed woman in her mid-20s who had hoped to make the Marine Corps a 
career, she had been assaulted while sleeping. Several male Marines threw a 
blanket over her head and began pummeling her in a kind of hard-core harassment 
called a "blanket party." Fearing that she was being attacked by the enemy, she 
ran out of her tent naked, in full view of other Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 Her confidence shattered and her military career over, she is undergoing 
counseling under a new Veterans Administration program to help women veterans 
who have been sexually traumatized while on active duty.

 "She has been almost totally unable to function," said Mavis Young, a 
registered nurse and sexual trauma counselor at the veterans center run by the 
VA in Vista, north of San Diego. "There is still a lot of work to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Long ignored by the military and the society at large, the problem of sexual 
attacks on military servicewomen by their male colleagues is now a major 
concern for the Veterans Administration, which has begun an unprecedented 
outreach to the nation's 1.1 million women veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that effort, a three-day conference in San Diego this week brought 
together 500 VA employees from across the nation to discuss women's health 
issues and, specifically, the post-traumatic stress disorder associated with 
sexual attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 One focus of the conference is a sampling done by a researcher at the Tufts 
University Medical School that suggests that 8% of the 36,000 American 
servicewomen sent to the Persian Gulf were the objects of attempted or 
completed sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, done by Tufts researcher Jessica Wolfe, a specialist in post-trauma 
stress disorders, also found that more than half of the women who served in 
Desert Storm felt they had been at least verbally harassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were not Iraqi soldiers raping American women," said Dr. Susan Mather, 
assistant chief medical director for environmental medicine and public health 
at the VA's central office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were American soldiers raping other American soldiers," said Mary P. 
Koss, a professor of family and community medicine at the University of Arizona 
medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 Koss, who gave the keynote address "The Health Burden of Rape," said studies 
have shown that a rape victim is just as likely as a combat veteran to suffer 
from post-traumatic stress, including flashbacks, depression, lethargy and 
unreasoning fear and anxiety. About 15% of rape victims, and 15% of combat 
veterans, undergo some post-traumatic stress, Koss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional hearings in mid-1992 were highlighted by riveting testimony from 
women veterans from operation Desert Storm telling about being sexually 
harassed and assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Congress passed a bill increasing VA care for women veterans and 
giving priority to those who have suffered sexual trauma. To be eligible for 
counseling and other care, women must notify the VA by December, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Persian Gulf War and the Tailhook scandal, the military had 
taken steps to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to sexual harassment and sexual 
assault. How successful that approach will be is unclear, as women take a 
larger role in the military, including some combat assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever women are brought in to a previously male-dominated occupation, you 
have higher rates of harassment," Koss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no studies were done of women who served in Vietnam or other forward 
deployments, anecdotal evidence suggests that the Persian Gulf operation was 
not the first time that servicewomen were victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time the military condoned harassment of women," said Donna K. 
Buechler, a nurse in Vietnam and now a counselor with the Veterans 
Administration. "Men who would never have harassed women in civilian life 
thought it was fine in the military." 
</P>
<P>
 The sexual trauma counseling is part of a larger shift in attitude toward 
women veterans on the part of the Veterans Administration, which has 172 
medical centers nationwide and serves 2.8 million patients annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many years ago, the VA's idea of helping women veterans was largely 
restricted to providing gynecology care and separate bathrooms, said Mather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody even studied women veterans until 1988," said Joan Furey, an Army 
nurse in Vietnam and currently director of the VA's Office of Policy and 
Planning. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the change is growing evidence that women, civilian or 
military, have medical problems and histories that differ from those of men. 
For example, they have higher rates of thyroid disease, lupus, arthritis, 
diabetes, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, and a different set of 
symptoms for heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 As it tries to implement the 1992 law, the VA is attempting different 
approaches at different VA medical centers. 
</P>
<P>
 At six centers -- including the center in West Los Angeles -- fellowships are 
offered for physicians interested in women's health issues. The goal is to get 
those physicians to write the textbooks that will guide VA care in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In other VA regions, counselors have been hired and trained to work with women 
suffering post-traumatic stress resulting from sexual trauma. In some areas, 
the counselors are deliberately stationed away from the medical center so that 
women do not suffer flashbacks when re-entering a male-oriented atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego County, with a large number of women veterans, the counselors are 
stationed at centers in Vista and near Balboa Park, far from the county's 
military bases. Like other counselors, they are finding that many women who 
have been harassed or assaulted in the military had also suffered earlier 
sexual trauma, often in their childhood.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON ATTACKS RIVAL ON JUDGES; 
CHALLENGER SAYS IN NEW ADS THAT SEN. FEINSTEIN HAS VOTED FOR TWO LENIENT 
FEDERAL JURISTS. BUT HER CAMPAIGN COUNTERS THAT THE JUDGES' RECORDS HAVE BEEN 
DISTORTED. 
</P>

<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington stepped up his attack on Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein's anti-crime record Thursday, broadcasting a new television 
commercial that says she has voted for lenient federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's ad criticizes two judges Feinstein supported for the federal 
bench, saying they have been soft on crime. But in both cases, the commercial 
omits information that contrasts with the ad's claims. 
</P>
<P>
 In one example, the commercial charges that a Feinstein-supported judge 
opposed capital punishment more than 100 times -- "even more than Rose Bird," 
California's controversial former chief justice. 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents of the Florida judge, Rosemary Barkett, said that she has also 
upheld death sentences more than 200 times. Legal analysts defending the 
commercial for the Huffington campaign disputed that figure, but they 
acknowledged that Barkett may have upheld more death sentences than she 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a second example, Huffington's ad complains that Feinstein supported New 
Jersey Judge Lee Sarokin even though he once freed a "cop killer." But the 
defendant's conviction for killing a police officer was overturned because the 
prosecution withheld pertinent evidence. A retrial is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feinstein judges let killers live after victims died," the ad says. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein supporters said Huffington distorted the judges' records to paint an 
inaccurate picture of the senator's crime record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think congressman Michael Huffington underestimates the sophistication of 
the people of California," said the Rev. Cecil Murray of the First African 
Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles. "They have a very good b.s. meter, 
and the meter is registering pretty high with Mr. Michael Huffington. . . . He 
takes a little bit of something to (make) the mass media create mass hysteria." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein supporters contended that Huffington was attempting to counter the 
endorsements given to the senator recently by a dozen prominent California 
police groups. And they said the Republican candidate was attacking Feinstein's 
crime record because he does not have one of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always easy to attack someone who has a record," Los Angeles City Atty. 
James Hahn said. "Huffington has never been there to support law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee, where she is required to 
vote on President Clinton's nomination of judges to the federal bench. House 
members, including Rep. Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), do not vote on judicial 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's new television commercial expands an advertising campaign about 
Barkett that he began this week in newspapers and on radio commercials. In 
doing so, he brings to California a highly partisan debate over the two judges 
that has been raging in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkett's approval by the Senate followed a six-hour debate in which 
conservatives attacked the judge's record on capital punishment. Still, she was 
approved by the Senate in April, 61 to 37, for a seat on the U.S. 11th Circuit 
Court of Appeals. Barkett won the votes of eight Republican senators including 
the only GOP member from her home state of Florida, Connie Mack. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarokin's nomination has not reached the floor of the Senate. But he was 
favored by Feinstein last month in a 12-5 vote of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. Sarokin's support on the committee was also bipartisan, including 
former Philadelphia Dist. Atty. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.), Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.) 
and William S. Cohen (R-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
 In other Senate campaign developments Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Feinstein released a list of 75 Republican supporters, including some 
prominent business, law enforcement and agricultural leaders. Some names on the 
list have been disclosed previously. The new additions include Orange County 
developer Kathryn Thompson, a former member of President George Bush's elite 
Team 100, and actor Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feinstein's campaign confirmed that the senator has contributed $400,000 of 
her own money to her campaign. Feinstein said last week she was talking to 
banks about leveraging her home and a beach house to help pay for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * Both campaigns confirmed that their first debate will be held Thursday on 
the "LarryKing Live" television program. The one-hour broadcast will be on CNN 
beginning at 6 p.m. in California. Political Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 39 days to go before Californians go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Wednesday: Democrat Kathleen Brown told students at San Jose 
State that Gov. Pete Wilson has devastated the state's educational system by 
raising tuition, curtailing proposed college loan programs and failing to 
promote a vision for the future. She also announced plans for a new offering of 
California savings bonds to help future students pay for college. Wilson 
remained in his Sacramento office in the midst of a marathon bill-signing 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Brown's campaign declined to release its schedule. Wilson's 
campaign said he will spend the day in Sacramento, where a deadline for signing 
or vetoing legislative bills looms at midnight tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Wednesday: Rep. Mike Huffington began airing a new television 
commercial that criticizes incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein for supporting 
what he termed lenient judges. Feinstein replied by releasing endorsements that 
made her day, from movie tough guy Clint Eastwood and 74 other prominent 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Today both candidates will remain in Washington, where 
Congress is in session.

DESERT BILL DEADLOCK BROKEN; ENVIRONMENT: FEINSTEIN SAYS REPUBLICANS HAVE 
AGREED TO A SCHEDULE THAT COULD LEAD TO A VOTE ON THE LAST DAY OF THE SESSION. 
BACKERS ARE CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) announced Thursday that progress had been 
made in freeing the California desert bill from parliamentary gridlock after 
Republican foes agreed to allow the massive land-use legislation to go to a 
House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the arrangement hammered out by Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell of Maine and Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, the bill will be 
placed on a nerve-racking procedural schedule with a final vote planned for 
next Friday -- the day that Congress hopes to adjourn. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, known as the California Desert Protection Act, could still be 
derailed if partisan disputes erupt during the final, frenetic days of 
legislative business, and proponents stressed that its fate remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein and other supporters are cautiously optimistic that the 
framework is in place to pass the bill -- albeit in end-of-session melodramatic 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best offer we've had, and gives us a fighting chance," said 
Feinstein, who has been chief sponsor of the bill since she arrived in 
Washington in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 During a Democratic Caucus meeting Monday, Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.) implored Mitchell to break the deadlock. He telephoned Feinstein 
Wednesday night to report the agreement with Dole. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mitchell-Dole arrangement calls for House and Senate conferees to be 
selected Tuesday and for a reconciled version of the bill to be returned the 
next day. Assuming there are no political flare-ups, the compromise version 
would be put to final votes next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's the opportunity we're given, I'll take it," said Rep. George Miller 
(D-Martinez), chairman of the Natural Resources Committee and prime mover of 
the desert bill in the House. "It had very substantial support from both 
parties but it's been hung up for months by one of two senators . . . (but I 
think) we can get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's nemesis in the Senate has been Malcolm Wallop, a Wyoming Republican 
and adamant foe of the legislation who is retiring after 17 years in the upper 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to let the bill go to conference and forced time-consuming votes on 
other procedural motions. Even though supporters apparently have more than 
enough votes for final passage, the delaying tactics threatened to run out the 
clock on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Janis Williams, a Wallop spokeswoman, the bill's timetable next 
week is roughly the same as if the other procedural votes had taken place. To 
reach a compromise, Republicans dropped their opposition to the conference 
committee and Mitchell waived some debating requirements, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the bill win final passage, it will almost certainly be lacking one of 
its original key goals: making the East Mojave National Scenic Area into a new 
national park. The Senate bill upgraded the land but the House, succumbing to 
pressure from the National Rifle Assn., made the land a preserve where hunting 
could continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be discussed in conference," Miller said. "But the House has voted 
twice (to approve preserve status), so the likelihood (of such a compromise) is 
pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 8 million acres would be preserved under the legislation. In the House 
and Senate versions, Death Valley and Joshua Tree national monuments would 
become national parks and have their lands expanded. Millions of acres of 
desert territory would be off limits to mining and motorized recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert bill would become the largest land conservation law since the 1980 
Alaska Lands Act, which protected 103 million acres from development.

WILSON HELPED FOSTER ILLEGAL INFLUX, RENO SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and SAM FULWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson "fostered some of the illegal immigration that we're trying 
to deal with" when he was in the Senate, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said Thursday, 
suggesting that the California governor is responsible for some of the problems 
he blames on the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno, however, said in her weekly meeting with reporters that she wants to 
avoid "a fussing match" with Wilson, who has made criticism of Administration 
border policies a major element in his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in an interview, Reno questioned the wisdom of Proposition 187, which 
would bar illegal immigrant children from California schools. But she noted 
that the Administration has not taken a stand on the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oftentimes, it is the failure to educate, the failure to provide support that 
causes" crime, Reno said when asked her view of the initiative as the nation's 
chief law enforcement officer and as an official who has demonstrated a 
particular interest in children. 
</P>
<P>
 While noting that the Justice Department has not done a legal analysis of 
Proposition 187, Reno said: "I think we must address the issue of what happens 
to young people who are here, who are not educated, who are not provided with 
the essentials that enable them to grow in a safe, positive and law-abiding 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno's comments on Wilson came when a reporter asked if she was getting fed up 
with Wilson's increasingly heated attacks on the Administration's immigration 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I never get fed up with people. . . ," Reno began. "It's very, very 
important that we understand that Gov. Wilson and others, during their times in 
the Senate," occasionally opposed efforts to control illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed for an example, Reno said: "In a number of instances, if you review 
the record of officials in California and in representing California, they have 
in prior years been concerned about agricultural interests and others who are 
reluctant to have enforcement, or were reluctant to have INS be as effective as 
it might in enforcing against illegal immigration." Wilson, in a statement from 
Sacramento, said Reno's comments were "a shameful attempt to turn the spotlight 
away from the Clinton Administration's total failure to secure our border." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that while he was a senator, he sponsored an amendment to allow guest 
workers into the United States for limited periods. To ensure their return to 
their home countries, he said, the proposal would have withheld a portion of 
their wages, which they could receive only in their own countries. But the 
amendment never became law, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Wilson has written Reno three times in 10 days on the immigration 
issue, a Justice Department official said that the governor "is clearly 
attempting to engage the attorney general in debate. We will respond 
proportionately simply by citing his record if he attempts to escalate the 
debate further." 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said that the 
Administration will close its San Clemente checkpoint on Interstate 5 on 
Saturday as part of a five-month test to assess whether the redeployment of 
border agents from secondary, inland positions to the California-Mexico border 
will staunch the flow of illegal crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Named Operation Gatekeeper, the plan, among other things, calls for 
temporarily reallocating 93 agents from the highway checkpoint to patrols along 
the San Diego border area. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference at INS headquarters, Meissner said that the test would 
provide information to see if more agents on the border will deter illegal 
entry or whether the inland checkpoints are still necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both the attorney general and I have stated publicly that we are trying new 
tactics to bring illegal immigration under control," Meissner said. "This San 
Clemente checkpoint test is an example of something we have not tried before." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the INS plan, the San Clemente checkpoint, located about 60 miles from 
the U.S.-Mexico border along a main highway connecting the two countries, will 
be closed beginning Oct. 1 and reopened at some future time. When the agents 
return to the San Clemente checkpoint, INS officials will compare the impact 
the closing had on illegal crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the current fiscal year, about 1,000 Border Patrol agents worked in the 
San Diego area. Next year, after the test is completed, INS officials expect 
the Border Patrol force there to total nearly 1,400 agents. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Meissner said, the Border Patrol will begin fingerprinting all 
illegal immigrants apprehended in the San Diego area to help in the stepped-up 
effort to identify criminal immigrants.

INS JUDGE RULES HONORS STUDENT CAN STAY IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old illegal immigrant from Mexico who became a high school honors 
student here and now attends the University of Chicago was granted permission 
Thursday by an immigration judge to remain in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Ibarra, who is studying biochemistry and hopes to become a doctor, can 
remain in this country for five years and then apply for citizenship under a 
ruling by Immigration and Naturalization Service Judge Kenneth Bagley. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley said Ibarra easily met the legal criteria to remain: That he has been 
in the United States for seven years, is of high moral character and would 
suffer hardship if deported. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra's application to remain in the United States had been supported by 
numerous community leaders and teachers. The INS will not appeal the ruling. 
"We're as human as the next person," INS spokesman Rudy Murillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra was an A-plus student at Point Loma High, a star on the track and 
wrestling teams, and valedictorian of the 1993 graduating class. He did 
volunteer work and tutoring with social service groups in the Barrio Logan 
neighborhood of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 When he won a full four-year scholarship to the University of Chicago, he 
voluntarily contacted the INS, lest his undocumented status be discovered later 
and deprive him of an education. 
</P>
<P>
 After Thursday's ruling, Ibarra said he was near tears with happiness. The 
ruling also means he can have a part-time job and send money to his mother, who 
is disabled. He leaves Friday for Chicago for his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely felt like I had my hands tied behind my back because of this 
barrier," Ibarra said. "Now I feel free." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was not free of the rancor that is part of the political debate in 
California over illegal immigration. Alfred Strohlein, a San Diego resident, 
tried to speak to the judge but was not allowed to because he was not involved 
in the case. He fumed later to the press. Describing himself as an angry 
taxpayer regarding illegal immigration, he said Ibarra deserves no leniency 
because he broke U.S. law by entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge disagreed. "He has not taken more from the system than he has put 
back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen years ago, Ibarra, his mother, brother and sister crossed into this 
country illegally in the hills near San Ysidro. His father, whom he has never 
met, remained in the state of Michoacan.

LAW EASES PROCEDURES FOR GREEN CARDS; IMMIGRATION: THE MEASURE HAS CAUSED 
WIDESPREAD CONFUSION. IT ALLOWS UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS TO APPLY WITHOUT LEAVING 
U.S., BUT ONLY IF THEY ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At a time when policy-makers nationwide have targeted illegal immigration, a 
controversial new law that goes into effect Saturday will make it easier for 
tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants in California and elsewhere to 
receive so-called green cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure allows illegal immigrants who are already eligible for green cards 
-- those approved because of family sponsors or job guarantees -- to adjust 
their status while in the United States rather than returning home to complete 
the paperwork, a major convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its technical nature, the law has provoked widespread confusion and 
raised false expectations, prompting criticism of government implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten hundreds of phone calls from people who think it's a new amnesty 
program," said Peter A. Schey, director of the Center for Human Rights and 
Constitutional Law, a Los Angeles organization that assists immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The prevailing ambiguity even prompted Immigration and Naturalization Service 
Commissioner Doris Meissner to issue an unusual clarification this week. 
"Contrary to rumors, this provision in no way provides amnesty to anyone," 
Meissner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who will benefit have waited for years for their visa numbers to 
be called. Starting Saturday, those approved for green cards may finish the 
process in the United States -- after paying a $130 filing fee plus a penalty 
of $650 for anyone in the country illegally, the agency's highest levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under previous law, illegal immigrants had to complete the documentation at 
U.S. consulates or embassies, a requirement that forced many people who were 
already in the United States to make the often costly trip back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, according to the INS, about 100,000 visa seekers who formerly would 
have been obliged to file abroad will now be able to take care of everything at 
local INS offices. Most are undocumented relatives of legal permanent residents 
or U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 A bipartisan congressional majority passed the measure largely without public 
debate last month as part of a huge appropriations bill. President Clinton 
signed it into law Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was designed to relieve the burden on overseas consular officers, 
legislators emphasize, not to make life easier for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns in the House that the change could spur illegal immigration prompted 
inclusion of a so-called sunset clause terminating its provisions in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the new law rewards criminal behavior and favors wealthy 
immigrants who can handle the stiff penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that a person who comes in illegally shouldn't be allowed to 
adjust under any circumstances," said Dan Stein, executive director of the 
Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington-based group that seeks 
curbs on new entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that the measure "opens up a three-year window for people who wish 
to flout our country's laws," Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) said: 
"This change in law opens a loophole so large you could drive not only a truck 
through it, but a truck filled with illegal aliens." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, respond supporters, who say the law merely recognizes reality: Many 
of the multitudes now languishing on visa waiting lists are already in the 
United States. Illegal immigrants who are not immediately qualified for green 
cards remain subject to arrest and deportation, the INS says. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one who is not eligible for an immigrant visa will get one by virtue of 
anything that was changed," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Berman and other backers say, those who choose to file in the United 
States will henceforth contribute tens of millions of dollars in fees and 
penalties to the threadbare treasury of the perennially underfinanced INS. The 
money, supporters note, now enriches the carriers that shuttle green card 
candidates back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone except foreign airlines will be better off," Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $780 combined fee and penalty will, for many immigrants, amount to less 
than round-trip travel and other expenses associated with returning home to 
file, experts said. The major exceptions are Mexican nationals, who could 
probably make the trip to U.S. consulates in Tijuana or elsewhere for 
considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many advocates say the $650 penalty is absurdly high for a population 
often struggling to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This allows the wealthiest people to take advantage, while forcing the poor 
who cannot afford these exorbitant charges to remain underground and 
undocumented," Schey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exempt from the penalty are those 16 and younger and so-called family unity 
cases -- the spouses and children of amnesty recipients, mostly Mexican 
nationals, who became legal under the broad amnesty statute passed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law explicitly seeks to encourage immigrants to file in the United 
States and pay the attendant costs. Those who opt for consular processing 
abroad will face no monetary penalty, but most will have to wait three months 
before receiving green cards -- a considerable disincentive for working people. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from avoiding costly travel, advocates said those seeking green cards 
will enjoy another major benefit: Those filing in the United States will have 
greatly expanded due process rights if they are turned down because of criminal 
records, indigence, health problems or other reasons. After denials at consular 
offices, there are few practical avenues for appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 With State Department posts swamped with visa matters, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) wrote the law as a means of alleviating pressures and improving 
background investigations of the many temporary visa seekers who apply at 
consulates. The quality of overseas visa screening has come under intense 
scrutiny since last year's bombing of New York's World Trade Center was tied to 
terrorists allowed into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consular offices in many areas are stretched too thin to do much 
anti-fraud work," noted one Senate staffer who worked on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a further bow to security concerns, the new law requires that most adults 
be subject to full FBI fingerprint checks before green cards are issued. 
Criminal histories can be reason for disqualification. 
</P>
<P>
 The high penalties for those who file in the United States were devised to 
assist the financially strapped INS, which is now assuming as much as one-third 
of the consulates' former visa responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers see a dark side: Protracted delays may get worse at an agency 
that has been assailed for emphasizing enforcement duties over service to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The INS is already hopelessly backlogged, and I can't imagine this won't be 
yet another problem for local offices to deal with," said Charles Wheeler, 
directing attorney for the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the potential deluge of paperwork, INS officials have no immediate 
plans to hire new personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 The workload burden will be particularly acute in Southern California, home to 
millions of immigrants and perhaps a third of the nation's undocumented 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS office in Los Angles -- anticipating handling as many as 50% of those 
seeking adjustment under the new law nationwide -- is bracing for a crush of 
applicants and information seekers starting Monday. Special attendants will be 
deployed to assist those with queries. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The law) caught some of us off guard," said Richard K. Rogers, INS district 
director in Los Angeles. "We almost didn't get a good handle on it till it was 
too late." How the Law Will Work 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at a law that takes effect Saturday and revises procedures for 
foreign nationals residing in the United States who have been notified of their 
eligibility for so-called green cards, or legal U.S. residence documents. 
</P>
<P>
 * What it will allow: Permits eligible visa-seekers to complete paperwork in 
the United States instead of returning to their homelands and filing there. 
Immigrants who are here illegally at the time they file will have to pay a $650 
penalty on top of the $130 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who is affected: An estimated 100,000 immigrants, mostly undocumented, who 
become eligible for green cards each year because of family sponsors or job 
guarantees. Under current law, they had to file at U.S. consulates abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 * Costs: Implementation price tag unknown. Total fees and penalties paid to 
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service could run into the tens of 
millions of dollars; some may be used to offset costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * For more details: The INS is not prepared for telephone inquiries, but 
agency officials say information will be available at INS headquarters, 300 N. 
Los Angeles St. in Downtown Los Angeles or 14550 Magnolia St. in Westminster. 
Nonprofit groups that work with immigrants may also have information. 
</P>
<P>
 * What hasn't changed: There is no new amnesty law, no increased immigration 
total. This statute is merely a technical revision allowing eligible immigrants 
to complete the process in the United States.

NATO MINISTERS AGREE STRIKES AT BOSNIA SERBS A FAILURE; BALKANS: THEY VOW 
GRUDGINGLY TO STEP UP AIR ATTACKS TO PROTECT TRAPPED U.N. PEACEKEEPERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 NATO defense ministers agreed Thursday that their strategy of tit-for-tat air 
strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina has been a failure, but the Western allies 
remained at odds over how much tougher they should get with defiant Bosnian 
Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceding that NATO's credibility has been damaged by flagrant and unpunished 
violations of alliance edicts, the defense ministers vowed to escalate the use 
of air power to protect U.N. troops trapped between the warring factions 
without any authority to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 But even their promise to make air strikes "proportionate, robust and 
effective" came grudgingly from countries with soldiers deployed in Bosnia as 
part of the beleaguered U.N. Protection Force. 
</P>
<P>
 British Defense Minister Malcolm Rifkind limited British support for 
intensified bombing runs to deterring attacks on U.N. troops, rather than as a 
means of protecting designated "safe havens" for Bosnian civilians or to 
enforce NATO-proclaimed weapons exclusion zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if North Atlantic Treaty Organization ministers had worked out a plan 
for escalating air strikes, Rifkind said they had but added: "We don't want to 
see that, and I hope that doesn't happen. And it won't happen if Bosnian Serbs 
do not provoke U.N. forces." 
</P>
<P>
 French Defense Minister Francois Leotard described the firmer resolve to 
respond to Bosnian Serb provocations as "the price to pay" for getting the 
United States to back off from plans to unilaterally breach a U.N. arms embargo 
that has hampered only the Bosnian government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arrival here for a two-day NATO strategy session, U.S. Defense Secretary 
William J. Perry had pushed for broader use of air power to compel rebel gunmen 
to accept an internationally mediated peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 All NATO countries with troops in Bosnia rejected any use of force with such 
political aims, sources involved in the closed-door talks reported. But they 
said the 16 defense ministers had agreed that the symbolic strikes launched so 
far had been too timid. 
</P>
<P>
 "NATO's credibility is at issue here," a senior U.S. official said. "We would 
like to see air power, when it is used, used in a robust way." 
</P>
<P>
 The official criticized a Sept. 22 NATO response to a Bosnian Serb attack on 
French peacekeepers as "an effort to strike a derelict tank that didn't impress 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 A British official said Perry pushed for bombing rebel supply lines and 
ammunition depots as well as tanks and heavy weaponry used to attack U.N. 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tough talk from the U.S. delegation only highlighted the crux of the 
intra-NATO conflict, which is that member states with peacekeeping troops in 
Bosnia are less willing than Washington to support uses of force likely to 
anger the dominant Serbs and expose their forces to retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Britain, France, Canada, the Netherlands and Spain -- all NATO members -- 
provide the bulk of the 20,000-plus peacekeeping force in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs have intensified their defiance of NATO and the U.N. mission 
since the latest "pinprick" air strike last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Humanitarian aid convoys and the airlift of food into Sarajevo have been 
suspended because of rebel threats to fire on them, and attacks on the six 
purportedly U.N.-protected areas have been daily routine for months. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the rift between the United States and its allies, the verbal 
grappling session also confirmed disputes between NATO and the U.N. Protection 
Force that the allies have sought to play down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had this problem for 18 months. There is always a gap between the 
political will in the capitals and the generals" from NATO countries serving 
with the U.N. mission, a senior French military official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense ministers, who meet again today, plan to urge U.N. Secretary 
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to pressure U.N. commanders in the Balkan war 
zones to act more aggressively to enforce the NATO exclusion zones and a 
resolution threatening air strikes if Bosnian Serbs persist with the 
strangulation of Sarajevo by cutting off water, electricity and gas to the 
Bosnian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But a U.S. official conceded there had been problems in getting "individual 
allied countries to make clear to the United Nations what they want."

EASTERN EUROPE; FORMER SLOVAK PREMIER GETS BACK IN THE RING; VLADIMIR MECIAR'S 
PARTY IS FAVORED IN ELECTIONS TODAY AND SATURDAY. THE EX-BOXER'S POPULIST 
MESSAGE STRIKES A CHORD IN HIS ECONOMICALLY TROUBLED NATION.

 You can listen to his theme song on the radio, drink his personalized brand of 
coffee and gaze at his grinning mug on billboards across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Meciar is back. Two years after whipping up a nationalist fervor that 
swept Czechoslovakia off the map, the heavyweight boxer-turned-politician is 
mounting a political comeback -- leaner by about 50 pounds but still very much 
a cagey, determined fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters cast ballots today and Saturday for the first time since the breakup of 
the former Czechoslovak Federation, and opinion polls show Meciar's Movement 
for a Democratic Slovakia, which engineered the split, favored by more than a 
quarter of expected voters. 
</P>
<P>
 His closest challenge comes from a coalition of parties dominated by 
ex-Communists, with 16 others lagging behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Just six months ago, Meciar was nearly written off as a political has-been 
when he was ousted as prime minister by the Slovak Parliament and his own 
political movement began hemorrhaging. A group of Meciar foes -- including 
defectors from his own party -- formed a new government and called early 
elections in the hope of winning public support. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the elections have opened the door for the resurgence of the 
pugnacious former prime minister, who has become the biggest campaign issue in 
a country beset with some of the toughest economic problems in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are overwhelmed by the problems, and they are looking for optimism," 
said Viliam Sobona, Meciar's campaign manager. "They need a man who is smiling 
and will lead them from their problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Pumped by a rich campaign chest and the populist street smarts of advisers 
from Forza Italia, the party of Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, 
Meciar has traveled the country preaching his "Vivat Slovakia" message. His 
rallies offer cheap beer, free goulash and a patriotic program intended to 
seize upon fears of the poor, the elderly and the uneducated about the dizzying 
changes under capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Meciar has promised to cut taxes, increase retirement benefits, create jobs 
and slow Slovakia's already snail-paced selloff of state enterprises to foreign 
investors. He has hinted that he will try to remove President Michal Kovac, 
whose harsh appraisal of Meciar last spring was said to have inspired the 
rebellion that toppled him. 
</P>
<P>
 Meciar's opponents say his government was riddled with corruption, and they 
describe him as dangerously xenophobic and ultra-nationalistic. Critics fear 
his victory would bring instability to a country already perceived as reluctant 
to shed its Communist trappings. 
</P>
<P>
 Slovakia ranks near the bottom of Eastern European countries in attracting 
foreign investment and only just began mastering some of its economic problems 
with the arrival in March of Prime Minister Jozef Moravcik's government. 
</P>
<P>
 The governing coalition has won a loan from the International Monetary Fund, 
has aggressively begun selling state-owned enterprises and recently received a 
letter of praise from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our first election as an independent country, we will decide between a 
policy of confrontation and a policy of cooperation," said Milan Ftacnik of the 
Party of the Democratic Left, the former Communists in the ruling coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Meciar's party is expected to draw the most votes, but too few to form a 
government. If the broad-based opposition -- an improbable jumble encompassing 
former Communists and the religious right -- wins a plurality, it could 
continue governing. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the opposition falls short, virtually any combination of parties is 
possible -- with the most likely scenarios teaming Meciar with the former 
Communists or the Christian Democrats. Both parties say they would not join a 
Meciar-led coalition; pragmatism, though, may ultimately prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slovakia needs a government," said Juraj Kohutiar of the Christian Democratic 
Movement. "Even a bad government is better than no government." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean E. Murphy was recently on assignment in Bratislava, Slovakia.

NORTH AFRICA; ISLAMIC RADICALS TARGET SINGERS AS ALGERIA SEEKS END TO TURMOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 When Lounes Matoub was kidnaped from an outdoor cafe in the Algerian mountains 
this week, no one doubted that his 15 armed captors were radical Islamic 
fundamentalists. As they grabbed Matoub, one of Algeria's most popular singers, 
they harassed customers for drinking alcohol and opposing "the law of God." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Matoub's ethnic Berber people, a fiercely independent force in Algeria, 
have vowed "total war" against Muslim fundamentalists if the 38-year-old singer 
is not released. 
</P>
<P>
 That threat, followed Thursday by the shooting death of another Algerian 
singer, Cheb Hasni, has further complicated the political scene, and Islamic 
militants are said to have issued death sentences for singers whose lyrics are 
considered vulgar. 
</P>
<P>
 Most worrying, political analysts say, is that an uprising by Berbers, the 
country's largest ethnic minority, could undermine a "national dialogue" that 
President Liamine Zeroual has begun, at considerable political risk, with 
Muslim leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is extremely fragile," said Nicole Grimaud, a specialist on 
Algeria at the Institute for Political Sciences in Paris. "Everybody is very 
pessimistic that the outcome will be peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeroual's hope is to end the killing that has claimed about 6,000 lives since 
the government canceled parliamentary elections in January, 1992. But the 
government and the radical fundamentalists have added to the country's bloody 
toll in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 Government forces killed the head of the Armed Islamic Group, or GIA, which 
has claimed responsibility for killing 61 foreigners in the last year. On the 
same day, radical fundamentalists killed two journalists and a foreigner, a 
surveyor from Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 By week's end, Algerians and political analysts in France were uncertain 
whether the troubled nation was hurtling toward an escalation of violence, at 
best, or a coup d'etat, at worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Much depends on the government's ability to bring leaders of the Islamic 
Salvation Front, or FIS, to the negotiating table, to control opponents of 
talks within its own ranks and to minimize the guerrilla threat of the Armed 
Islamic Group, which has ruled out "dialogue, truce or reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
 The FIS was heading for victory when the government halted elections and 
banned it two years ago. But Zeroual, under pressure from Western governments, 
freed the top two FIS leaders from prison earlier this month and invited them 
to join talks with more moderate Muslim leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the FIS is demanding that the government legalize the front, free all 
political prisoners and include all rebel leaders in the talks. If the 
president agrees, Abbasi Madani, the FIS leader, will have to persuade his 
followers to go along with a cease-fire, a difficult task after two years of 
brutal government repression. Analysts agree that new elections are needed. But 
that seems a distant hope for now. 
</P>
<P>
 The success or failure of the fledgling peace process in Algeria has broad 
ramifications for France, home to tens of thousands of Algerian refugees and 
fearful of becoming home to more. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has implications for other Western powers, including the United 
States, which are concerned about the growth of Islamic fundamentalism and its 
frequent byproduct, terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeroual's attempts to make peace with the fundamentalists will be a severe 
test of his ability to retain power. Many in his army, and among the powerful 
elite that put him in power, oppose reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if a deal is struck, the peace brokers will have to deal with the GIA. It 
has refused to accept democracy, demanding instead an Islamic state. 
</P>
<P>
 The GIA campaign, though, may have been blunted by the firefight Monday that 
killed Cherif Gousmi, 26, the GIA leader, and his deputy, Abdessalam Djemaoune. 
Authorities had offered a $70,000 bounty for Gousmi, and Djemaoune was known as 
the group's "throat-cutter," suspected of slitting the throats of two French 
businessmen, a father and son, in Algiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The unknown fate of the singer Matoub, who had recently recorded an album 
satirizing the fundamentalists, could cause even more problems.

IN SEATTLE, YELTSIN GIVES HOSTS THE BUSINESS; RUSSIA: THE PRESIDENT SEEKS TO 
ENHANCE COMMERCIAL TIES ACROSS THE PACIFIC RIM. EXECUTIVES GREET HIM 
ENTHUSIASTICALLY BUT REMAIN WARY.

<P>
 In further acknowledgment of the westward shift of America's economic 
potential, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin on Thursday concluded his U.S. 
visit in the other Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, far from the lawn of the White House and the chambers of the United 
Nations, the difficult matters of global arms and diplomacy yielded to an 
equally challenging proposition: Russia's claim to be a credible business 
partner along the flourishing Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 Potato chips and microchips, the lowly Arctic codfish and the lofty space 
station -- these are the early and thin economic links already established 
across the North Pacific between America's Pacific Northwest and Russia's Far 
East. In a seven-hour visit to Seattle, Yeltsin lent his prestige to try to 
shore up the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The West Coast of the United States has established very good contacts with 
us. . . . It is time to cooperate on a pragmatic basis," the Russian leader 
said. "Last year our trade volume doubled. . . . I see considerable change for 
the better." 
</P>
<P>
 His audience of 800 business and political leaders was enthusiastic with its 
greeting, but a good deal more cautious in assessing the climate for conducting 
commerce in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing Co. Chairman Frank Schrontz met privately with Yeltsin for half an hour 
but said there was no discussion of Russia's 50% tariff on aircraft imports. 
The Weyerhaeuser Co., which for five frustrating years has been seeking a joint 
venture with the Russians to harvest Far East timber, was to meet with Yeltsin 
deputies, but spokesman Frank Mendizabal remarked: "Will it help? I don't know. 
Russia is a tough place to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble is, you don't know who to deal with," Mendizabal said. "Who owns 
the forest? The Moscow government? The provincial government? The local people? 
The ex-party officials?" 
</P>
<P>
 After three days in New York and Washington, D.C., Yeltsin seemed in high 
spirits as he toured Boeing's airplane manufacturing facilities and a mock-up 
of NASA's planned space station, a joint project of the United States and 
Russia. And he joked and toasted his way expansively through what was supposed 
to be a luncheon with the business leaders -- a meal for which Yeltsin 
rearranged the program and brought food service to a halt so that he could 
launch directly into his speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are gathered entrepreneurs," Yeltsin explained with a grin. "I should 
do business, and then I should do food." 
</P>
<P>
 He repeatedly played to the western part of the country's image of itself as 
the vibrant heart of the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the West of the United States, there are more smiles. In the East, more 
stress," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin seemed to acknowledge investor concerns, particularly about crime and 
political stability. He joked that business executives could travel to Russia 
these days "without about 15 bodyguards." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no joke in his voice when he said, "Let me tell you, we have 
achieved political stability." 
</P>
<P>
 And his pitch was blunt: "You have to understand, you are investing in a 
reliable country. You are investing in a great country with a very large 
market. . . . Trade means new jobs for Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin then toured Seattle's port aboard a passenger ferry and dropped in for 
a brief visit with a "typical American family" -- at the home of Rolf and Dawn 
Gruen and their two teen-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Gruen is a psychotherapist and Mr. Gruen a jobs counselor, and the couple 
is host to a 16-year-old Russian exchange student. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a visit was similar to a family drop-by that Chinese President Jiang 
Zemin made during a visit to Seattle last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, West Coast trade with Russia remains small -- $36 million was 
exported from the state of Washington to Russia last year, less than went to 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 But a good many entrepreneurs with a tolerance for risk are setting up joint 
ventures based in Seattle, ranging from container shipping to seafood, and even 
a much-publicized effort to break into the Russian snack food market by Tim 
Kennedy of Tim's Cascade Style Potato Chips.

4 SLOVAKS SEIZED TRYING TO SMUGGLE BOX OF URANIUM 
</P>

 Four Slovaks were caught Wednesday trying to smuggle 26.5 ounces of 
uranium-235 across the border into Hungary, a Slovak Interior Ministry official 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The radioactive material was concealed in a lead box in the back seat of a car 
and was seized in the south-central town of Slovenske Nove Mesto, Jaroslava 
Ivor, an investigator in the Slovak Interior Ministry, told reporters Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Slovak men and a woman were in the car at the time of the arrest, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since May, German authorities have made five seizures of radioactive material, 
much of it believed to originate in the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The seizures have prompted fears that criminals are taking advantage of lax 
security at installations in the former Soviet Union to smuggle out dangerous 
nuclear material, perhaps for terrorist purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow officially denies that its security is lax and says there is no proof 
that any of the seized material comes from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's Interfax news agency reported early this month that police had 
arrested thieves in the city of Glazov trying to dispose of 220 pounds of 
low-grade uranium -- the biggest cache of radioactive material reported in the 
recent spate of smuggling cases.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; WOUNDED HAITIAN POLICEMAN DISPUTES MARINES' 'AMBUSH' 
STORY; FIREFIGHT: CAP HAITIEN ADJUTANT DENIES HIS MEN HAD ORDERS TO SHOOT 
AMERICANS. THE HOSPITALIZED OFFICIAL FEARS FOR HIS FUTURE.

<P>
 He lay on a thin mattress in the men's ward at Justinien Hospital, swatting 
flies with his one good arm. His right leg was tightly wrapped in bandages, and 
below his knee, three large metal screws held the bone together. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Rousseau Pamphile, 44, the Haitian police chief adjutant who was in 
charge the night the U.S. Marines killed 10 of his men and badly wounded him at 
police headquarters in this northern city. He is a big man, a proud man, the 
kind who suffers quietly the pain from three bullet holes and numerous broken 
bones. 
</P>
<P>
 His worry is not his shattered body. His mind is elsewhere -- concerned with 
his family and his future and why the Haitian military far away in the nation's 
capital has not provided him the best medical treatment, befitting an officer 
shot in the line of duty. And why the police force he risked his life to defend 
has fled the city and is not here to protect him from the pro-democracy crowds 
hungry for his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "God saved me," he said Thursday in his first interview since the Marines 
opened fire six days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Contradictions about the shootings continue to swirl here in Haiti's 
second-largest city. The bodies of the 10 dead were exhumed Wednesday for a 
grand military funeral in Port-au-Prince, but the controversy about what 
happened Saturday night at the police building may never be put to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamphile's version of the incident was the first time anyone from the Haitian 
police has spoken out about the shootings. One other officer who was slightly 
injured and five others who escaped unharmed through a back door remain in 
hiding. 
</P>
<P>
 "But where now am I going to hide?" Pamphile asked. "Where am I going to go? I 
have a broken leg. All I wanted to do was serve my country. I was always there 
to serve my country. I never killed anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 His account differs sharply from that of Marine Lt. Virgil Palumbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Palumbo earlier this week said he and his men started firing on the police 
because they believed they were about to be ambushed when two Haitian officers 
suddenly pulled weapons on the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pamphile said only one of his officers was armed, and no orders were given 
for him to shoot Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't pass any orders," he said. "We tried to remain calm, and we were 
playing cards. And we weren't armed. Why should we be armed? We were playing 
cards and dominoes, and the only one there on duty was a sentinel, and he had 
an Uzi." 
</P>
<P>
 Pamphile was referring to Rosemond Joseph, a guard posted at the gate of the 
police building in the center of town -- the man the Marines said drew first. 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Pamphile, "he was just a simple soldier. And the only movement he 
would have made would be to shift the weight of his gun on his shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines said the Haitians fired repeatedly at them during the firefight, 
but Pamphile contradicted that statement as well. He said none of his men even 
had time to fire their guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Impossible for them to do that," he said. "They never had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the police headquarters on 20th Street is pocked with holes made by 
bullets that witnesses said came from Marine guns. Across the narrow street, a 
row of houses stands without holes or any other signs of gunfire in that 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines said they fired into the building from the street, never going 
inside, but Pamphile remembered that differently too. And there are relatively 
fresh blood stains on the interior. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamphile said he had been relaxing on his bunk and that about 10 of his men 
were out in front of the building when the shooting started about 7 p.m. At the 
first crack of gunfire, he said, he rolled to the floor and crouched next to a 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard some of my soldiers yelling, 'Help me! Help me! What have I done?' " 
he said. "Some of my soldiers were running inside to take shelter. The door to 
my room was open because it was hot, and I took the first bullet while lying on 
the ground there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw him. It was pretty dark. I couldn't see. But the person who shot 
me was in my room." 
</P>
<P>
 Lying next to his bunk, he said, was his own .38-caliber revolver, unloaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the Marines took him to the amphibious assault ship Wasp in the 
harbor, where he underwent eight hours of surgery. He was shot in the right 
leg, the right foot and the left elbow. Every bone in the foot was shattered, 
and his thigh bone was broken in two. 
</P>
<P>
 If he walks again, it will be with a limp, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, he was returned to Cap Haitien and taken to the hospital. 
He said he cannot make sense of why the Marines would shoot him and his men. 
But he noted that the U.S. troops had been at the station for several hours, 
and he believes they were planning all along to ambush his unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't know why," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As people danced outside on the streets of Cap Haitien to celebrate the U.S. 
military's restoration of electricity to the city for the first time in about 
two years, Pamphile worried about what lies ahead. Laid up in the hospital, he 
cannot support his family, which includes five children. He hears stories of 
the large, angry crowds massing by day in the streets of his town, and he 
realizes that after his 25 years as a police officer his fellow citizens have 
turned against him. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no military authorities in Cap Haitien to investigate the Saturday 
night incident, though on the U.S. side, the Marines' superiors have already 
commended the troops for a quick and proper response to a dangerous situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamphile mused Thursday that Palumbo will probably receive a Bronze Star, 
while Pamphile, lying under a blood-stained hospital sheet, has for all 
practical purposes been abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't pull a gun on anybody," he said. "I am an innocent victim."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; BLAST SHOWS ALL THE 'FACE OF EVIL'; VIOLENCE: ATTACK 
ON CIVILIANS BRINGS THE HARSHEST U.S. CONDEMNATION OF HAITI'S LINGERING 
MILITARY RULERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 James Benjamin clutched his shrapnel wounds Thursday as he lay bleeding on top 
of his protest poster with the red-and-blue paint declaring, "First Justice, 
Then Reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
 Wincing as he waited for the ambulance in the blistering afternoon sun, the 
young pro-democracy demonstrator summed up the most brutal attack by Haiti's 
paramilitary forces since the U.S. military landed here to put an end to just 
such horror. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you know what life is like for the people in Haiti for the past three 
years," Benjamin said in a near-whisper, moments after members of a 
paramilitary squad apparently threw at least one grenade into his group of 
hundreds of demonstrators Thursday afternoon, killing or wounding at least 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't a life. It is this. It's living death," Benjamin said. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened at 1:45 p.m., as the group was marching home after welcoming the 
U.S.-backed return of Port-au-Prince's charismatic, democratically elected 
mayor, Evans Paul. They were passing a small cement warehouse owned by Haiti's 
dreaded police chief, Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, when, Benjamin said, he 
stopped to buy some water. He spotted two paramilitary agents nearby, but it 
was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds, he said, the explosion deafened him. The shrapnel ripped 
through his leg and abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack brought the harshest U.S. condemnation of Haiti's lingering 
military rulers since the first American troops arrived 10 days earlier. 
Briefing reporters on the incident, U.S. Embassy spokesman Stanley Schrager 
poignantly echoed Benjamin's words. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that the world can now see the face of evil that has been 
operating in this country for many years," Schrager said, moments before U.S. 
Ambassador William L. Swing condemned the attack and appealed to the Haitian 
nation for calm. 
</P>
<P>
 For U.S. military commanders in Haiti, the second bloody assault on 
pro-democracy demonstrators in two days foreshadowed what many observers fear 
is worse violence to come. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurred on the eve of the third anniversary of the coup that overthrew 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and brought Francois and Haiti's other 
military rulers to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, amid plans for a huge religious service and a massive pro-Aristide 
march in the capital, senior U.S. commanders are expecting the worst. They have 
an intricate plan to keep the violence to a minimum. But in a city awash with 
rumors that the attacks are part of a calculated Haitian paramilitary plan, 
Schrager conceded: "We can't be everywhere at once." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he stressed that it is not the U.S. military but the Haitian police 
and army that are in charge of law and order here. The intervention force, he 
said, plans to function only as a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, though, the U.S. forces were not far away. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Army military police company was just 10 minutes away when at least one 
grenade exploded amid the marchers. With assault rifles ready and a dog team in 
tow, the soldiers jumped out of their Humvees and opened fire on the warehouse, 
causing no apparent injuries and drawing no return fire. The dog team tracked 
the attackers, at least one of whom was led away in handcuffs minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 The MPs looked a lot like policemen, a role that U.S. forces commander Lt. 
Gen. Hugh Shelton has insisted the U.S. military is not -- and should not be -- 
playing in Haiti. But that was the role the crowds demanded the MPs assume as 
people quickly gathered at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not here as policemen. We are here to assist the Haitian police," a 
U.S. Army translator shouted in Creole through a loudspeaker in one of the 
Humvees. 
</P>
<P>
 As ambulances snaked their way through to take away the dead and wounded, the 
crowd began a chant: "Down with the police! You be the police! Down with 
Francois! Long live Aristide!" 
</P>
<P>
 Another siren wailed as a black van filled with uniformed Haitian police tried 
to push through the crowd to the blast scene. The crowd attacked the van, 
smashing out the back window before the vehicle managed to get through. 
</P>
<P>
 Word spread fast from eyewitnesses like James Benjamin: The man who threw the 
grenade and was taken away by the Americans, they said, was known to be a 
lieutenant who worked directly for Francois. 
</P>
<P>
 The final moment of fury at the scene illustrated what many fear lies ahead in 
Haiti: anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 When the U.S. troops finally pulled away from the warehouse nearly two hours 
after the attack, the crowd descended on it in a frenzy. Grinning and shouting 
chants of victory and justice, as they have several times elsewhere in the city 
in recent days, the marchers carted off every last bag of Francois' cement. 
U.S. Troop Tally 
</P>
<P>
 Though Pentagon officials initially anticipated only 15,000 troops would be 
involved in the Haiti operation, there are now nearly 20,000 on the ground 
there. And the number "may go a little higher," a Pentagon spokesman said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military troops on the ground: 19,600 
</P>
<P>
 Troops and sailors offshore: 9,200 
</P>

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; U.N. VOTES TO LIFT CURBS ONCE ARISTIDE RETURNS; HAITI: 
BRAZIL, RUSSIA ABSTAIN. SECURITY COUNCIL DECISION WILL PROMOTE COUP LEADERS' 
EARLY DEPARTURE, U.S. SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 After hearing Secretary of State Warren Christopher report that Haitians now 
"enjoy their first respite from terror in three years," the Security Council 
voted Thursday to lift all sanctions against Haiti on the day after President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide returns to power. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were two glaring abstentions -- Brazil and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil abstained as a protest against foreign troops occupying a Latin 
American country. Russia abstained because it said the Clinton Administration 
was too hasty in pushing a resolution through the council before Haiti's 
military leaders had been removed and Aristide restored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian abstention was a surprise. But Russian Ambassador Sergei V. Lavrov 
expressed his displeasure that the council had not even received an assurance 
from the United States that the Haitian military leaders will leave Haiti. And 
he noted sharply that, even in the case of South Africa, the council had not 
lifted sanctions until that country had complied with all U.N. anti-apartheid 
resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 This prompted U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright to insist: "Let me be clear. 
My government believes that voting today is the right choice. By voting today, 
we promote the early departure of the coup leaders, the early return of 
President Aristide, and thus the early restoration of democracy to Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 The simply worded, relatively short resolution would disband an array of 
strictures imposed on Haiti to punish its military rulers for refusing to step 
down in favor of Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 The sanctions, which have crippled Haiti's economy, include a ban on all trade 
-- which also affects oil shipments -- and a halt to all financial 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 13-0 vote, with the two abstentions, the council decided that the 
sanctions will end a minute after midnight EDT "on the day after the return" of 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members acted in the evening even after news reached the United 
Nations of the bloody grenade attack on Haitians in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's optimistic assessment of the situation had been delivered at an 
extraordinary session of the council in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, sitting in the seat usually occupied by Albright, had warned the 
council that "our courageous troops will face difficult, and sometimes 
dangerous, situations. There will be setbacks and risks, and we must be ready 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when told of the bloodshed in Haiti, he said to reporters: "We will do 
everything we can to minimize incidents like that, but we can't reduce it to 
zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the seats in the 15-member council were filled by foreign ministers, 
such as Christopher, during the morning session. The general debate of the 
General Assembly opened this week, an event that annually attracts scores of 
presidents, prime ministers and foreign ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 The council usually takes advantage of this period to schedule one session 
with as many foreign ministers as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher's report on the U.S.-led intervention in Haiti was well received 
by most members of the council.  
</P>
<P>
 But Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim offered a negative assessment that 
signaled his nation's later abstention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil has taken note that a traumatic military operation was avoided," he 
said. "Nevertheless, I should express the concern of my government over the 
very fact that foreign military forces are deployed in the territory of a Latin 
American country. This is a disturbing precedent." 
</P>
<P>
 In his report to the council, Christopher referred to the troops in Haiti -- 
now totaling about 19,000 and almost all American -- as part of the 
"multinational coalition" led by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 He reported that the coalition had moved almost 42,000 tons of supplies into 
Haiti and that "hundreds of coalition personnel are in training in Puerto Rico, 
on their way to oversee and monitor the police in Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 He also repeated President Clinton's promise that the United States "will lift 
all unilateral sanctions on Haiti, except those targeted on the coup leaders 
and their named supporters." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration had frozen the bank accounts of Haitians in the 
United States and had stopped all U.S. commercial flights into Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said "hundreds of Haitians" have left their detention camps on the 
U.S. naval base in Guantanamo, Cuba, and returned to Haiti because they are 
"reassured that they can walk their streets, speak their minds and sleep in 
their homes without fear." 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that "with President Aristide's restoration, many more will want 
to go back to their homeland." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the United States had committed $100 million to a Haitian economic 
recovery program and is "ready to provide additional aid," Christopher called 
on "other nations and the international financial institutions to respond 
rapidly and generously."

PENTAGON IDENTIFIES SOLDIER WHO DIED OF GUNSHOT IN HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first U.S. soldier to die in Haiti has been identified by the Pentagon as 
Army Spec. Alejandro Robles of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death remains under investigation, but military officials have 
said Robles, who would have been 21 today, apparently died of a self-inflicted 
gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti was the third major deployment for Robles, who joined the Army in 
January, 1992, and was assigned to Company A, 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry 
Regiment of the 10th Mountain Division based in Ft. Drum, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 An Army spokesman said Robles, who died Tuesday, had also been part of the 
Hurricane Andrew relief effort in Florida and had served in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles -- so far the only member of the U.S. troops now deployed in Haiti to 
die there -- was found shot to death in a northern area of Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said the death occurred at 
a state guest house, Villa d'Accueil, where Haitian Parliament members stay. 
U.S. soldiers were cleaning the mansion and making security arrangements on the 
hillside estate above the capital city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army said Robles was divorced and the father of an 18-month-old son, who 
lives with Robles' former wife in Idaho. Robles' father lives in Los Angeles 
and his mother in Pico Rivera.

U.S. TO UNLOAD EUROPEAN NUCLEAR WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Energy Department said Thursday that it is going ahead with a 
controversial plan to unload nuclear waste from Europe for storage in South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 The department had delayed unloading for two days while the U.S. 4th Circuit 
Court of Appeals considered South Carolina's petition to block the shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Energy Department told the court that for safety and scheduling 
reasons it could no longer wait for the ruling and will begin unloading the 
spent fuel rods from two ships at the Military Ocean Terminal at Sunny Point, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary said that "this shipment is an important step 
in our nation's efforts to stem the proliferation of nuclear weapons materials 
worldwide." The 153 nuclear fuel rods contain highly enriched uranium. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuclear material from Austria, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands will 
travel by rail to the Savannah River Site on South Carolina's border with 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina fears it will get up to 15,000 more rods from foreign reactors 
in the next 15 years.

LAWMAKERS SEND CLINTON $244-BILLION DEFENSE BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress gave final approval Thursday to a $244-billion defense bill that 
gently trims President Clinton's spending plans while financing a new aircraft 
carrier and reviving the retired SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting a consensus that the Cold War's end and the tight overall budget 
would make big spending increases difficult to justify, the House debated the 
measure for just 12 minutes before approving it, 327 to 86. The Senate 
discussed the bill for an hour before sending it by voice vote to Clinton, who 
is expected to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a good agreement, which will provide for the safety and support of our 
men and women in uniform," said Sen. Daniel K. Inouye, (D-Hawaii), who chairs 
the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that wrote the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some dissenters. Liberal Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.) complained that 
the measure would waste billions of dollars on some weapons systems, while 
conservative Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) warned that continued low levels of 
spending would create "a hollow military force." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, lawmakers sent Clinton a spending plan for fiscal 1995 that 
falls $822 million short of what he requested last winter, while allowing for 
most of his priorities. It provides $3.5 billion more than this year's Pentagon 
budget, not enough to stay even with inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense bill would provide $2.3 billion for continued work on a 
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. It also supplies $100 million to keep the 
SR-71 Blackbird spy aircraft aloft. The Air Force, worried about the plane's 
expensive operating costs, has said it is no longer needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also makes $2.9 billion available for missile defenses, $300 million 
less than Clinton wanted. It also provides $2.2 billion for the purchase of six 
more C-17 transport planes, $300 million below the Administration's request. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure also provides $728 million for the B-2 Stealth bomber program; 
$125 million to keep builders of the B-2 from going out of business, even 
though the planned number of planes have been acquired; $467 million for 
continued research and development, but not construction, on the V-22 Osprey, a 
tilt-rotor plane the George Bush Administration tried in vain to kill, and $421 
million for development of a new attack submarine. 
</P>
<P>
 Also included are a 2.6% pay raise for military personnel; a limit of 1.5 
million active troops, continuing a gradual reduction in numbers; $3.3 billion 
to help defense contractors convert to production of peacetime products, and 
$400 million to help the former Soviet states dismantle their nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was the 12th of the 13 annual appropriations bills lawmakers have 
dispatched to the White House. Earlier Thursday, the Senate gave final 
approval, 89 to 11, to the $38.3-billion transportation bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation measure finances road-building, rail and air systems 
throughout the country. The bill includes $40 million for renovation of Penn 
Station in New York. Defense Bill Breakdown 
</P>
<P>
 The 1995 defense spending bill Congress sent President Clinton on Thursday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Total: $244 billion, $822 million less than Clinton requested and $3.5 
billion more than this year's total. 
</P>
<P>
 * Weapons: $2.3 billion for a nuclear aircraft carrier, $100 million to resume 
flights by the SR-71 Blackbird spy plane, $2.9 billion for missile defenses, 
$728 million for the B-2 Stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 * Personnel: Cap of 1.5 million active troops, who would get a 2.6% pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Soviet states: $400 million to help them disarm their nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defense conversion: $3.3 billion to help defense industries retool for 
production of peacetime products.

CONGRESS FAILS IN 1872 MINING LAW OVERHAUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawmakers abandoned efforts Thursday to overhaul a 122-year-old mining law 
that critics have called a taxpayer rip-off because it allows the purchase of 
mining claims for as little as $2.50 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.) said he no longer has hopes for a bill 
acceptable to mining interests and Western senators who in the closing days of 
Congress can block legislation if they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston said he had gained the support of a major mining company, American 
Barrick, in his latest attempt at working out a compromise but then "the 
industry got into motion . . . and put tremendous pressure" on Barrick. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), who led House negotiators, accused the mining 
companies of stonewalling and pressuring Western senators into opposing 
whatever bill came out of the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Gerard, a spokesman for the Mineral Resources Alliance that represents 
the hardrock mining industry, said the mining companies wanted a reform law 
this year but were not prepared to accept some of the provisions in the 
legislation being discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnston and Miller had been locked in talks over several months in an attempt 
to work out a compromise after the House and Senate passed significantly 
different bills aimed at ending abuses under the 1872 mining law. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, enacted at a time when government wanted to promote development of 
Western natural resources, allows individuals or mining companies to take 
ownership of a hardrock mining claim on federal land for as little as $2.50 an 
acre and pay no royalties on minerals taken from the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The House and Senate bills would have required payment of market value for 
land under the 1872 law and, for the first time, would have required payment of 
a royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mining companies let it be known they would accept no more than a 3% 
royalty and had trouble with other parts of the compromise, including giving 
the Interior Department greater authority.

STATES TAKE UP HEALTH REFORM FIGHT; LEGISLATION: GOVERNORS AND SOME UNLIKELY 
ALLIES LOBBY TO CHANGE FEDERAL LAW BARRING LOCAL BENEFITS REGULATION. UNIONS, 
INSURERS OPPOSE EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oops. Just when members of Congress and their exhausted staffs thought the 
bruising health care reform fight was behind them, a new skirmish is brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to agree on a national reform agenda, members are arguing over how much 
authority to cede to the states -- an issue that has taken on new urgency now 
that the federal initiative is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest controversy focuses on the 20-year-old Employee Retirement Income 
Security Act, which effectively bars states from regulating the health benefits 
of most of their residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In these waning days of Congress, many states are aggressively seeking 
individual exemptions from ERISA, without which their sweeping reform efforts 
will all but collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the stakes, however, the battle's outcome is highly uncertain. For one 
thing, as with so many other controversies in health care reform, this issue 
has led to some unlikely alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the nation's governors in arguing for greater state flexibility are 
many Democrats who long have championed federalism, including Sens. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan of New York and Bob Graham of Florida and Rep. Ron Wyden of 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, closing ranks in the name of uniform national standards are 
big, multi-state employers, insurers and labor unions, joined by moderates and 
conservatives who otherwise have vigorously backed states rights, including 
Sens. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.), John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), Don Nickles 
(R-Okla.), John C. Danforth (R-Mo.) and Richard C. Shelby (D-Ala.). 
</P>
<P>
 According to congressional sources, the struggle over state flexibility versus 
national uniformity was one of the more divisive issues within the bipartisan, 
"mainstream" coalition of 20 senators that sought, but ultimately failed, to 
craft a last-ditch compromise reform plan, prompting Senate Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) on Monday to throw in the towel on health care 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Still another factor contributing to the uncertainty of the outcome, Capitol 
Hill sources said, is the large number of senators who have publicly professed 
support for state flexibility only to tell colleagues behind closed doors that, 
in fact, they would not vote against the wishes of big, multi-state employers 
back home. 
</P>
<P>
 ERISA prevents states from interfering with the health plans of self-insured 
companies, which use their own assets to pay employees' medical claims. By 
giving exclusive jurisdiction over employee benefits to the federal government, 
the law "represents a terrible barrier" for reform-minded states, in the words 
of Debra J. Lipson, an analyst at the Alpha Center, a think tank here. 
</P>
<P>
 Multi-state employers and insurance companies tremble at the prospect of 
having to abide by up to 50 different sets of rules and regulations, saying 
that would increase administrative costs and disrupt the delivery of services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need national rules in local markets," Durenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, unions oppose ERISA waivers because they fear that states, 
in seeking revenue to finance reform initiatives, will tax the health benefits 
of self-insured firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But many liberals in Congress, traditional union allies, support state 
flexibility -- at least on this issue -- because many of "the reforming 
states," as they call themselves, are moving to provide universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlene Rydell, a Democratic state representative from Maine who chairs a 
coalition of 24 "states that can't wait," has been in town this week vigorously 
lobbying for waivers. "We've been going to a lot of (congressional) offices 
this week too," added Richard I. Smith, an analyst at the Assn. of Private 
Pension and Welfare Plans, a group of large employers. 
</P>
<P>
 The state most desperate for a waiver is Washington, which has passed a law 
that seeks universal coverage by requiring employers to pay at least 50% of a 
worker's insurance premiums -- a concept that both President Clinton and his 
congressional allies sought to pass without success. Washington state's 
employer mandate would take effect on July 1 -- but only if Congress grants it 
a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon's legislature has also adopted a mandatory workplace-based insurance 
law, scheduled to take effect in several years. But as one state official put 
it: "It goes down the toilet without a waiver." 
</P>
<P>
 Durenberger said Thursday that he expects waiver supporters to strike without 
warning, perhaps offering waivers for individual states as amendments to 
unrelated bills on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every bill is an opportunity," Durenberger said, urging his allies to remain 
alert. ERISA waivers would lead to the law's "evisceration," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the advocates of ERISA waivers fail in the remaining days of the 103rd 
Congress, they are widely expected to take up the issue in the new Congress 
next January. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be one of the real hot issues leading off next year," said a senior 
Senate health aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton made clear in a speech 
here that she continues to believe that universal coverage must remain a goal 
for health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some rough spots on the road, but this journey is far from over," 
she told future physicians at the George Washington University School of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future of this country, not just our health care system, depends upon us 
continuing our journey toward universal coverage," she said in her first 
extended comments since Monday's declaration by Democratic leaders that health 
reform was dead for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton was an architect and chief saleswoman for her husband's plan to 
overhaul the country's health system. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people keep asking me if I'm going to give up on health care reform, my 
answer is always the same," Mrs. Clinton said. "Why would I give up on America 
or the American people? I am the result of privilege. I am the result of good 
health. I am the result of a great education. Why would I not want to do what I 
could in any small way to make it possible for others to have the same 
opportunities that I have had over my lifetime? 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have the courage to keep going," she said. "If this were easy, 
somebody else would have done it."

U.S. IMMIGRATION DOOR AJAR TO SOME OF 30,000 CUBAN DETAINEES AT GUANTANAMO; 
CARIBBEAN: IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS, 15 CHILDREN, INCLUDING ONE WITH LEUKEMIA AND A 
NEWBORN, AND SOME FAMILY MEMBERS ARE TO BE FLOWN TO THE U.S. 
</P>

 Faced with tinderbox tension in Cuban detention camps here and diminishing 
Cuban American support for its internment policy, the Clinton Administration 
appears willing to back away from a vow that none of the 30,000 refugees held 
here will be permitted into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few days, 15 Cuban children, including one with leukemia and a 
newborn infant, are expected to be flown to the United States for humanitarian 
reasons, according to members of an ad hoc advisory committee of Cuban 
Americans at a Miami press conference Thursday. Each child will be accompanied 
by an unknown number of family members. 
</P>
<P>
 But late Thursday, U.S. Justice Department spokesman Carl Stern said that the 
request is still under review and has not been granted. He added, however, that 
even if approved, the humanitarian release of the 15 and their families would 
not signal any change in U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the rules are not inflexible," Stern said. "There are always going 
to be exceptions for humanitarian reasons, medical concerns or the like." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 10, reiterating a policy first announced Aug. 19 in an effort to shut 
off the waves of Cuban rafters entering Florida, U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno 
said that any Cubans wishing to enter the United States must apply from Cuba. 
"They will not be eligible for processing into the U.S. from Guantanamo," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clinton Administration won the backing of many Cuban American 
leaders for its detention policy in exchange for tighter sanctions against the 
government of Fidel Castro, the prospect of detaining Cubans was never popular 
in Miami. News media reports of the stark living conditions and pictures of 
Cubans in tent cities surrounded by concertina wire and military police have 
only heightened the level of frustration among Cuban Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustration among those in the camps is even higher. "Clearly, we have an 
explosive situation. Anything can happen, from a disturbance to an epidemic," 
said Guarione M. Diaz, appointed by the Clinton Administration to serve as 
civilian ombudsman for the Cubans here. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of the first group of Cubans from Guantanamo is seen by many in 
the Cuban American community as the beginning of a process in which eventually 
all those in detention will be given a chance to enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never agreed that Cubans could be held there indefinitely, only that they 
could be held until a solution was found," said Ninoska Perez, director of the 
Cuban-American National Foundation's short-wave radio station, which broadcasts 
daily to Cuba. "Now we have been offering solutions. Those with relatives have 
sponsors. We will find sponsors for the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conditions in the camps are deplorable," added Perez, whose visit here this 
week touched off a hunger strike at one camp after she was denied entrance. 
U.S. military officials said that Perez, traveling as a reporter, was with a 
group of journalists whose arrival coincided with a food delivery, so they were 
denied entrance to that camp. They subsequently toured another Cuban camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even the commander of the joint task force overseeing the camps for 
the Cubans and 14,000 Haitian migrants admitted that living conditions are 
barely adequate and that the camps could erupt into violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an awful lot of tension, frustration and anger in those camps," said 
Brig. Gen Mike Williams of the U.S. Marine Corps. "There is work to be done 
before they meet even the minimal humane standards we'd like to set." 
</P>
<P>
 The newest Cuban camp, called Oscar I, is a stark illustration. Here, on a 
relatively flat piece of land within sight of a rolling, scrub-brush minefield 
and a U.S. guard tower at the border between Cuba and the 45-square-mile U.S. 
naval base, more than 3,300 men, women and children are waiting out their fate 
under a sea of canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are being treated like animals here," said Isiah Alonso, 38, who was an 
English teacher at Havana's Institute of Foreign Affairs before he, his wife, 
Ileana, their two young daughters and 15 other family members got into a boat 
that he bought for $2,000. "We are being held political prisoners by Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Although complaints about the food, the stench of the portable toilets and the 
heat are common to both the Cubans and to the Haitians interned nearby, many of 
the Cuban camps have been erected on freshly bulldozed land, where the 
slightest rain turns the bare earth to mud. Shower facilities are minimal. No 
mail has been delivered and many people complain that relatives in Cuba and the 
United States have received no word yet on whether they lived or died after 
setting off to sea, often in flimsy rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone lines, only for collect calls to the United States, are to be ready 
today, according to AT&T officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Without much shade, temperatures are high, tempers short. So far, only a few 
dozen Cubans have been isolated because of disciplinary problems, Williams 
said. "Most realize that violence doesn't help," he added. "But the 
peacefulness of the camps is only an inch deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those in Oscar I left Cuba after the Administration had reversed a 
32-year-old policy and announced that Cubans would not be automatically 
welcomed to the United States. But many said they climbed on a raft anyway, 
unable or unwilling to accept that Guantanamo would not be a rest stop on the 
way to Florida. Of the more than 33,000 rafters picked up after Aug. 19, and 
sent to Guantanamo, about 2,500 have volunteered to go to a temporary camp in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not bad people," said Ileana Alonso, 35, as she sat on an army cot 
under a sand-colored tent. "We knew about the American policy (of detention), 
but we also know that policy has to change." 
</P>
<P>
 While a growing number of Haitians are choosing to return to their homeland as 
democracy is restored, the Cubans have no such option. But almost 60 Cubans 
have fled the camp to return home, either by swimming or by making it through 
the minefield, according to Cuban officials. U.S. military authorities have 
stopped at least 20 others. Williams said he suspects that a few Cubans get out 
of the camps every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Castro government and the U.S. State Department 
reportedly are working on a plan for Cuban repatriation that could include 
paying those who return to Cuba a cash resettlement stipend. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams called a method of returning willing Cubans to Cuba "the most 
critical need. That is absolutely my No. 1 priority, to get that solved."  
</P>
<P>
 Unsolicited, about 44 Cubans have offered to go back to Cuba. Williams said 
that the rest of the Cubans will not be surveyed about their wish to return 
until a plan to repatriate them is in place.  
</P>
<P>
 Most, however, seem determined to stay. "People left Cuba with one idea -- to 
get to the U.S.," said Francisco Escobar, 31, a leader in camp Oscar I who was 
heading up a hunger strike to protest the decision to turn Perez away on 
Tuesday. About 200 people moved their cots from the tents and pushed them 
together next to the fence in protest.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a hard life here, but life was even harder in Cuba," Escobar said. 
"We know the history of the United States, the generosity of the American 
people. They understand who we are: men, women, old people, children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will make it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami, meanwhile, Cuban American radio stations and civic groups are piling 
up donations of money, foodstuffs and clothing for the camps. In the first of 
several shipments, a load of 2,300 pounds of powdered milk is to arrive by 
chartered aircraft this weekend, according to ombudsman Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military is doing the best it can," said Diaz, who commutes weekly 
between Guantanamo, Miami and Washington. "In the short term, we need immediate 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long term, we need to find an alternative."

PLEA LETS YOUTH AVOID PRISON FOR $20 THEFT OF ICE CREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-ager once sentenced to three years in prison for stealing $20 worth of 
ice cream from a school cafeteria avoided time behind bars by pleading guilty 
Thursday to reduced charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Dehundra Caldwell, 18, was sentenced to a year's probation and was ordered to 
perform 40 days of community service and pay $600 in fines and court fees. He 
pleaded guilty to two counts of misdemeanor criminal trespassing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I want to finish school and, hopefully, within the next month or so 
choose which college I want to go to," said Caldwell, a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 He had pleaded guilty last year to burglary. His three-year sentence sparked 
an uproar, with the NAACP and other critics saying it was racist to punish 
Caldwell, who is black, so severely since he had no previous criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent 10 days in jail before being freed pending a review of the case. 
Caldwell's original guilty plea and felony conviction were eventually 
overturned by the Georgia Court of Appeals. Last month, he was re-indicted on 
the burglary charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's all messed up. The kids of today, instead of letting them go to 
school, get an education so they can better themselves when they get out, 
they're putting them in jail," Caldwell said. "Society makes you what you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey C. Fisher, an Atlanta-based official with the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, said a white person would have been treated 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Racism played a very strong part in all of this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Johnnie Caldwell, who is not related to Dehundra, has denied 
that racism played a part. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1993, Caldwell, his younger brother and a friend broke into Upson-Lee 
Middle School near Thomaston, about 60 miles south of Atlanta. They stole ice 
cream bars from the freezer in the cafeteria. The other boys were dealt with in 
Juvenile Court.

 A Florida man accused of murdering an Ohio woman and her two teen-age 
daughters and dumping their bodies into Tampa Bay was found guilty less than 
two hours after jurors in Clearwater began deliberations.The jury of eight 
women and four men returned the quick verdict after hearing nine days of 
testimony in the triple murder case against Oba Chandler. Chandler, 47, was 
convicted of strangling Joan Rogers, 36, and her daughters, Michelle, 17, and 
Christe, 14, then weighting their bodies with concrete blocks and throwing them 
into Tampa Bay the night of June 1, 1989. He could face death in the electric

 Responding to rising criticism, the Smithsonian's National Air and Space 
Museum said Thursday it is overhauling its planned Enola Gay exhibit. The 
changes came as a result of two marathon meetings with representatives of the 
nation's largest veterans' group, both sides said. 
</P>
<P>
 The forward section of the plane that dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima 
will remain a central feature, but much else will be added and deleted from the 
exhibit, which some critics believed would portray the Japanese as innocent, 
even noble victims of Americans hellbent on revenge for the attack on Pearl 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes in the exhibit, titled "The Final Act: The Atomic Bomb and the End 
of World War II," include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Substituting a picture of American prisoners of war at the time of the 
Japanese surrender for another photo of Japanese POWS hearing the Emperor's 
surrender speech. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dropping such emotionally charged items as the dial of a wristwatch from 
Hiroshima, its face frozen in time to the "precise moment that the atomic bomb 
exploded," and the jacket of a dead schoolboy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminating much of the last section dealing with the postwar nuclear arms 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 As now agreed to, the exhibit scheduled to open next May, will close with the 
formal Japanese surrender in September, 1945, thereby omitting a lengthy 
discussion of the atomic bomb's "legacy," which had been a major concluding 
section in earlier versions of the script. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest changes came about as a result of a line-by-line review by a dozen 
museum officials and two representatives of the American Legion. They met for 
12 hours Wednesday, and 10 hours the week before, in a windowless room at the 
museum on the Mall. Museum curators and staff met all day Thursday to implement 
the changes.

 Sen. Jesse Helms stalled the nomination of a Jimmy Carter protege as 
ambassador to Panama, criticizing his role in the recent negotiations with 
Haiti's military and in the "giveaway" of the Panama Canal. President Clinton 
named Robert Pastor, a Latin American specialist at the Carter Center in 
Atlanta, as envoy to Panama. Prospects for his Senate approval before Congress' 
scheduled adjournment on Oct. 7 appeared dim after Helms (R-N.C.) stalled a 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote on the nomination.

 Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), who two days earlier attacked his Republican 
opponent in the Senate race over his Mormon religion, appeared to be backing 
off those earlier remarks after a barrage of press criticism. "I believe that 
religion should not be an issue in this campaign," Kennedy said in a 
statement."The way to make that so is to stop talking about it and to focus on 
issues like jobs and health care, which is exactly what I intend to do." 
Kennedy's conciliatory statement came after both of Boston's main newspapers 
blasted him for telling reporters Monday that Mitt Romney, a multimillionaire 
and former Mormon leader, should be questioned about his church's policy of 
excluding blacks from the priesthood prior to 1978.

 The Supreme Court in Tallahassee ruled that it was unconstitutional to charge 
motorists a steep "impact fee" to bring cars into the state, forcing Florida to 
refund $187 million collected over the past three years. About 633,000 
motorists paid the $295-per-car fee since July 1, 1991, when they brought cars 
into Florida and registered them for the first time. Lawmakers passed the 
measure in 1990 to help finance highway construction, claiming the money was 
needed because of the ever-increasing stream of vehicles on Florida's roads.

VIRGINIA LAWMAKERS VOTE TO END PAROLE, CUT TIME OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virginia legislators voted overwhelmingly Thursday to abolish parole, backing 
the centerpiece of the governor's crime package. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate endorsed the legislation on a vote of 33 to 6. The House of 
Delegates approved a similar measure, 88 to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, proposed by Republican Gov. George F. Allen, now heads to a 
conference committee before a final vote by the Legislature, expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is approved, Virginia will join about a dozen other states and the 
federal government in eliminating parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, inmates serve as little as a sixth of their sentences. 
Under the new proposal, they would have to serve at least 85%. Time off for 
good behavior would be limited to 15% of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminals could still be sentenced to up to three years of parole-like 
supervision after their release. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen has estimated that his crime package will require 27 more prisons during 
the next decade at a cost of $1 billion, but a study by the Democrat-controlled 
Legislature put the cost at more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted to spend $37 million on nine work camps for nonviolent 
offenders, expansion of two maximum-security prisons and planning for two new 
prisons. But legislators put off most other funding questions until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen won the election last fall after declaring that he would abolish parole 
and curb violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the parole bill said it would do little to cut crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a balanced approach to preventing crime. This is a very punitive 
approach," said Democrat Sen. Yvonne B. Miller, one of the six senators who 
voted against the measure. "It turns my stomach to even think about spending 
state money this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the bill's supporters agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the end of crime. This is a way of treating crime," said Sen. 
Clarence A. Holland, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Delegate Robert D. Hull said lawmakers are fearful that a vote against the 
bill could be used against them in next year's campaigns. He said he is also 
concerned that the bill will be viewed as the solution to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid we're getting people's hopes up," Hull said.

HIGH COURT TO WEIGH LAW ON PARENTS' CONSENT FOR ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court agreed Thursday to consider the question of 
whether a minor must get permission from a parent or judge before having an 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the high court decided to review the constitutionality of a law 
that was passed by the Legislature in 1987 but never enforced that requires 
women under age 18 to obtain parental or judicial consent for an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is the first abortion rights matter to come before the current court, 
which now includes two women among its members, Justices Joyce L. Kennard and 
Kathryn M. Werdegar. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower court rulings have blocked enforcement of the law and an appellate court 
found in June that the statute was unconstitutional because it violated state 
protection of the right to privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court's decision to hear the case does not necessarily signal an 
intent to overturn the lower court but may simply mean that the justices 
believe they should have the final word on an issue of this importance, lawyers 
familiar with the case said. No date has been set for oral arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Under California's parental consent law, an unmarried woman under 18 living 
with her parents would be required to get permission from at least one parent 
before having an abortion. If she did not want to ask her parents, she could go 
to court and seek consent from a Superior Court judge in a private hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 After the law was passed, it was challenged in court by a coalition of health 
care providers and abortion rights advocates. The group estimates that nearly 
30,000 women under 18 get abortions in California each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our core contention is that this law is bad for teen-agers," said Linda 
Shostak, attorney for the coalition. "It's bad for their health and it's bad 
for their families as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren appealed to the high court, arguing that it was within 
the discretion of the Legislature and the governor to enact a parental consent 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas and Justices Kennard, Armand Arabian and Marvin 
Baxter voted to consider the appellate court ruling -- the minimum number of 
justices needed to grant a review.  
</P>
<P>
 If the court had refused to hear the case, the appellate court ruling striking 
down the law would have become the final word on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pleased that the people of California will have this matter considered 
by the state's highest court," said David Puglia, a spokesman for Lungren.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who got back at her boyfriend by baking his cat in the oven has been 
sentenced to 60 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Marie Lillard of Hayward put the cat in the oven, turned the oven on and 
then set the kitchen on fire March 26 because she thought her boyfriend had 
been cheating on her, she told police. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal "suffered . . . both mental and physical torture by the manner of 
which it was killed," the doctor who performed the autopsy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lillard, who told police she was not sorry for her actions, pleaded no contest 
Wednesday to an animal cruelty count. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she had stopped taking medicine for schizophrenia several months 
before the killing.

NHL LABORS TOWARD POSTPONED OPENING; HOCKEY: OWNERS REJECT PLAYERS' PLEDGE NOT 
TO STRIKE. BETTMAN MAKES DECISION TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NHL's Board of Governors rejected a no-strike pledge offered by players 
Thursday, giving Commissioner Gary Bettman additional leverage to indefinitely 
postpone Saturday's season openers until a new collective bargaining agreement 
is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that move, a lengthy delay is not certain. An NHL source said "there 
could still be some surprises" today in New York when Bettman holds a news 
conference to formally turn down the NHL Players Assn.'s promise to play 
through the season and playoffs if the owners did not lock them out. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when asked if it is still possible for the season to start as 
scheduled, the source said, "I can't say that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman said last week, in announcing he would not allow the season to start 
until a deal had been hammered out, that a one-week wait would be worth it -- 
and the small number of games relatively easy to make up -- if differences 
could be settled in that time. 
</P>
<P>
 No formal vote was taken by the governors Thursday, and none is needed for 
Bettman to prevent the first puck of the NHL's 78th season from being dropped. 
A gag order was imposed on the governors, but sources said at least four clubs 
-- the New Jersey Devils, Philadelphia Flyers, Boston Bruins and Dallas Stars 
-- opposed accepting the players' pledge and were adamant about establishing 
the salary-revenue link Bettman advocates. Players want owners to share the 
burden of subsidizing small-market teams through a levy on payrolls and gate 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a pretty frank conversation and rejected the offer," a source who 
participated in the call told the Canadian Press. 
</P>
<P>
 A second source who listened in on the call said: "It's pretty obvious we 
won't be playing on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHLPA, could not be reached for 
comment Thursday night. At a news conference earlier in the day, he said the 
union's proposal would keep hockey in the public eye and ease Bettman's 
concerns that, like baseball, hockey's integrity would suffer if he allowed the 
season to begin and players walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a business proposal that would keep the game in place and keep the 
season uninterrupted," Goodenow said. "It would avoid a labor fight. And if 
there is a labor fight, it will be a long, nasty, dirty fight, there's no 
question about that." 
</P>
<P>
 The players' offer requires Bettman to restore a series of givebacks he 
imposed before training camp. He has previously said he would reinstate those 
benefits, which include meal money and insurance payments for players who make 
more than $350,000, if an agreement were reached before the season began. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the NHL wants a labor fight now, so be it," Goodenow said. "The players 
are fully prepared to sustain a long battle throughout the season. We made this 
proposal because we are mindful of the effects a long owner lockout will have 
on our game. We hope our proposal will allow us to have another great, 
uninterrupted season." 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen prominent players joined Goodenow in a show of solidarity at the 
news conference. Coincidentally, it was held at SkyDome, home of the striking 
baseball Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those present were the Kings' Wayne Gretzky and Marty McSorley, who took 
a red-eye flight to Canada after the team's final exhibition Wednesday at the 
Forum. Gretzky, who has been sharply critical of Bettman and the commissioner's 
lack of hockey experience, contended Thursday that a postponement would not 
benefit owners even though they would not have to pay players' salaries during 
a lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky, however, will receive his $6-million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the Los Angeles Kings want to play hockey. I know our management would 
like to see the season start," Gretzky said. "I know our owners would like to 
see us play in San Jose on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all very disappointed. We all want the season to begin Saturday, 
especially with all the success hockey has had recently . . . the success we've 
had now in Florida, with Tampa Bay and Miami franchises doing so well, and 
Dallas, and of course the three California teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're willing to play this year to push our league to another level and we 
hope the owners in the league feel the same way, that this is not the right 
time for a lockout." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Gartner, president of the NHLPA, said he fears a lockout might loosen 
hockey's hold in the United States and drive away fans who are unhappy over the 
labor strife in professional sports. Baseball players have been on strike since 
Aug. 12 and NBA officials have talked about a possible Thanksgiving lockout of 
their players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there wouldn't be anything worse to alienate the fans than not having 
hockey at all," Gartner said. "If you see baseball and what's happened in 
baseball, the national pastime of the United States, people turned it off in a 
heartbeat. What do you think is going to happen to hockey? What's going to 
happen to the markets that have just been brought on in the United States? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to seriously hurt all the steps that have been made over 
the last number of years, especially the last couple of years. I don't think 
it's going to be good for the game at all. I would certainly hope the owners 
realize that." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow said no accord is near and that a rejection of the players' pledge 
would not sweeten the tone of the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a lockout and this proposal is rejected, things that have been 
said in the past and the positions of parties would probably change 
considerably," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's latest proposal, which was rejected by the NHLPA on Wednesday, 
centered on a graduated levy imposed on teams whose payrolls exceed a 
negotiated figure of about $15 million to $16 million, reflecting the average 
payroll last season. The fees would be pooled and reallocated to small-market 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Players, who vetoed that plan because they say it would restrain salaries, 
have proposed 5.5% levies on the salaries and gate receipts of the clubs whose 
revenues rank in the top 16 of the NHL's 26 franchises. The funds would be 
redistributed to the teams whose revenues rank in the bottom 10.  
</P>
<P>
 Under that formula, the top-ranked New York Rangers would pay $2.406 million 
into the pool. The Kings, who rank fourth, would pay $2.237 million. The Mighty 
Ducks, who rank 12th, would pay $1.669 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest beneficiary would be the Winnipeg Jets, who would receive $8.239 
million, and the Edmonton Oilers, who would get about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow also said Chicago Blackhawk defenseman Chris Chelios had apologized 
to Bettman for comments Chelios made about Bettman Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his remarks, Chelios said, "If I was Gary Bettman, I'd be worried about 
my family, about my well-being right now. Some crazed fan or even a player, who 
knows, might take it into his own hands and figure that if they get him out of 
the way this might get settled. You'd hate to see something like that happen, 
but he took the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow said he believed the comments to be a product of the players' 
frustration but said he did not condone them. He said Chelios "did the right 
thing" in apologizing. 
</P>
<P>

PARK GETS DOUBLE-A'S IN ROOKIE SEASON; BASEBALL: KOREAN PITCHER IMPROVES 
ENGLISH, LEARNS LESSONS FROM HOOTON WITH DODGERS' SAN ANTONIO FARM TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chan Ho Park enters the room, dressed casually, listening to a Walkman. Hard 
rock, maybe? Korean music? 
</P>
<P>
 He places the earphones on the visitor to hear the tape, which turns out to be 
the same stuff Park had listened to all spring. Another English lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "How are you?" Park asks. 
</P>
<P>
 His English has improved dramatically since spring training, when Dodger 
players did their part by teaching Park such cultural gems as "Hey, dude," and 
"Hey, man." It probably doesn't hurt, either, that he has recently become 
addicted to karaoke, singing along daily with his favorite artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elvis Presley," Park says, smiling. "And reggae music." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Park had just finished classes at a school he is attending in Los 
Angeles, where he studies English four hours daily. He still needs an 
interpreter most of the time, but there are some questions he answers without 
any help. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no more interpreters next year," Park says through his uncle 
and agent, Steve Kim. "Tommy (Lasorda) and Peter (O'Malley) want to converse 
directly with me." 
</P>
<P>
 The language difference was only one barrier last season for Park, a 
20-year-old Korean pitcher who was thrust into the spotlight at Dodgertown. His 
talent was superior, his moves on the mound quirky, his fastball clocked at 94 
m.p.h. When camp broke, Park had made the team, becoming the first Korean to 
play in the major leagues, an honor he cherishes. 
</P>
<P>
 But as heady as it all was, it was also soon to be disheartening. Once the 
season started, he struggled on the mound. He was soon sent to the minors, 
where he continued to show raw talent but struggled before showing improvement. 
By the end of the season, Park had pitched more than 100 innings for the first 
time in his life and was sidelined because of a sore elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 That Park handled it all as well as he did was impressive, because it had not 
been an easy season. When the Dodgers sent him down 15 days after the season 
started, he thought it would be for only a week or two. But May turned into 
June and Park was still playing for double-A San Antonio, his Spanish improving 
along with his English, which was not exactly the reason he was there. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Park didn't really understand why he was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of things Chan Ho didn't understand," said Burt Hooton, 
Park's pitching coach with the San Antonio Missions. "When he came down, he 
thought that he was going right back. At first, he didn't understand the long 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from talent, he has much further to go than other kids, with coming 
over to this country for the first time, not knowing the language, experiencing 
a different culture, a different diet. 
</P>
<P>
 "He struggled here with double-A hitters, and it wasn't because he doesn't 
have the ability, but because he doesn't have the experience. What I learned is 
that in Korea, they don't play amateur baseball all year long like we do over 
here, so as far as experience and maturity, kids here are ahead of Chan Ho. But 
talent-wise, he has major league talent -- much more than other kids. What he 
needs to do is learn how to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Park had a 5-7 record and a 3.55 earned-run average in 20 starts with San 
Antonio. He struck out 100 and walked 57 in 101 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 He says now he's glad he was sent down, that it was a great experience for 
him, but he acknowledges he was depressed and disappointed at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult down there, a whole new different environment," Park said. 
"The weather was hot, but Mr. O'Malley and Tommy kept calling me to see how I 
was doing, and that really kept me going." 
</P>
<P>
 He lived in an apartment in San Antonio with his interpreters, Don Yi and then 
Billy Che. Yi, who had been with Park from the time the Dodgers signed him 
during the winter, had to return to Los Angeles to run his computer business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Verbally, people prepared us for the difference between the big leagues and 
the minors, but boy, were they ever right," Yi said. "I remember our first road 
trip, we were sitting in this little bus for about six hours. But we didn't 
actually complain to each other too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim thought it might help if he sent for Park's mother, but Park decided 
against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted my mom with me," Park said. "But I did not want her to see me in San 
Antonio." 
</P>
<P>
 Then in late June, Park was pleasantly surprised to see Darren Dreifort, the 
other Dodger rookie pitcher who had skipped the minors and made the big club. 
Dreifort, who struggled after a great start, joined Park in San Antonio to work 
with Hooton. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Darren came, he didn't seem that disappointed about it," Park said. "I 
think it is because Darren is more used to the American system. He knows young 
players usually don't start in the majors. It was good to see him." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Park learned to cook Korean food and found a few Korean 
restaurants. He even found Koreans, who used to come to the games and root for 
him.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was glad to see Koreans in Texas," Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also learned to cook pasta.  
</P>
<P>
 "In spring training, the night before I was supposed to pitch, I ate pasta 
with Tommy and I was able to do well," Park said. "Tommy came down to San 
Antonio during the All-Star break and he bought me a pasta dinner that night 
and the next day, I pitched my best game.  
</P>
<P>
 "Pasta is a power food." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The power with which Park propels his fastball is undeniable, but he spent 
most of the season in denial of his ability to unleash it. When he was with the 
Dodgers, pitching coach Ron Perranoski would talk with Park about throwing the 
fastball more, all the while trying to build his confidence. Hooton continued 
the process. By the end of this season, Park finally began to trust it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Chan Ho's best pitch is his fastball, and he throws it 92 or 93 m.p.h.," 
Hooton said. "He started throwing it more and more and showed me he has some 
raw instincts on how to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Korea, Park said, he threw sliders half the time and fastballs the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The slider was my strikeout pitch," he said. "When I came here I was using 
sliders, because I wanted the hitters to miss it. I knew American players had 
power, so if they hit it, it would go somewhere deep. I knew I had a fastball, 
and knew I had the speed, but I didn't think it was going to work. But talking 
to Perranoski and Tommy and everyone, they told me that if I was throwing 95 
m.p.h., I should be able to strike out players. Toward the latter part of the 
season I was able to feel confident that it was working." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also toward the latter part of the season that Park's right elbow began 
to hurt, probably because of fatigue. Park has an overgrowth of bone in his 
elbow, a condition he says was discovered about five years ago. It causes him 
pain occasionally, but this appeared to be unrelated. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Five years ago), surgery was recommended, but I was able to pitch through it 
so I decided not to have surgery," Park said. "I saw no reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Jobe, the Dodgers' orthopedist, examined Park before the Dodgers signed 
him and saw the overgrowth, but said it was not serious, just something to be 
aware of. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said an MRI taken this month showed nothing unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chan Ho had never gone through seven full months of pitching and never gone 
over 100 innings, but at San Antonio he did," Kim said. "So his elbow and arm 
is not used to going that far. It's something he needs to learn and has to 
overcome if he wants to stay in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is a direct thing from the overgrowth, I just think it was 
fatigue more than anything. But the overgrowth will be there forever and is 
something that he is used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Park will soon return to Korea to visit his family for the first time since 
January. He has become a hero there, Kim says. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean journalists heavily chronicled Park's season, and a recently signed 
two-year contract with Nike has put him in Korean commercials with Michael 
Jordan. He will also promote the shoe company in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an amazing year for me," says Park, who turned 21 in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.2-million bonus he received from the Dodgers was sent home to his 
parents. He said he has bought only clothes for himself, although he wants to 
buy a utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 But what concerns Park about returning to Korea is that he doesn't want to 
lose his command of English.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult, as far as not being able to speak to him directly, because 
you don't know if you are getting your point across," Hooton said. "He may say, 
'Yeah, I got it,' but you are not sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he has the will and the drive, and he certainly has the talent, better 
talent than probably 99% of the other kids who have come through here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he knows how good he is."

SHAW SAYS BALTIMORE REMAINS IN THE RUNNING TO GET RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 St. Louis continues to gain momentum in its bid for the Rams, and an improved 
Orange County offer is still being considered, but team President John Shaw 
discounted reports Thursday that Baltimore has fallen out of running. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the Rams had narrowed their choices to St. Louis and Anaheim, Shaw 
said, "Absolutely not.I don't know where those perceptions came from. We really 
haven't had any conversations with St. Louis for a few weeks. They're trying to 
come in next week, but I'm not sure whether (those meetings) will materialize." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's vote among NFL owners to approve the Washington Redskins' proposed 
move to Laurel, Md., about 20 miles south of Baltimore, seemed to swing the 
Rams' pendulum toward St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason: St. Louis offers the path of least resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Redskins hoping to corner the Washington and Baltimore markets with a 
new 78,600-seat stadium in Laurel, many believe Washington owner Jack Kent 
Cooke will rally enough support to block Baltimore's attempts to land a 
franchise.  
</P>
<P>
 Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer said that a recent meeting with Ram 
officials left him less optimistic that the team will move to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the Laurel resolution does not bar 
Baltimore from getting a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Orange County task force working to keep the Rams in Southern 
California recently made an enhanced offer that includes a $60-$70-million 
renovation of Anaheim Stadium, a $12-million practice facility, and ticket and 
luxury box sales guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still reviewing it," Shaw said. "We're hoping to get together with them 
next week too." MIKE DiGIOVANNA

AS RAIDERS FADE, MCDANIEL SHINES BRIGHTLY; PRO FOOTBALL: CORNERBACK'S EFFORT, 
INCLUDING TWO TOUCHDOWNS, OVERSHADOWED BY 1-3 START. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raider Pro Bowl cornerback Terry McDaniel hates to lose. So you can imagine 
how he feels as the Raiders head into this weekend's bye with a 1-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was definitely no way I would have thought that we would start off 
1-3," McDaniel said. "In fact, if someone had asked me before the season, I 
probably would have said we'd be 4-0, and at the worst 3-1." 
</P>
<P>
 Those lofty dreams of getting off to a fast start and taking control of the 
AFC West quickly turned into a continuing nightmare for the Raiders when they 
were trounced by San Francisco on Labor Day to start the season. 
</P>
<P>
 They were routed by Seattle, then bounced back to blow out Denver. Last Sunday 
against San Diego, they rallied from a 20-point second-half deficit only to 
lose on a last-second field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mistakes, just too many mistakes," McDaniel said of the team's poor start. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the season is still young, the Raiders find themselves three games 
behind the Chargers with their next two games on the road against the AFC's top 
two scoring teams, New England and Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have not had everyone clicking at the same time," said McDaniel, a 
first-round draft pick from Tennessee in 1988. "It doesn't matter if we have 
everyone playing great for one or two snaps, then on the third or sixth snap we 
mess up. That may be the snap that breaks us for that moment in time." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Raiders as a team have had trouble with consistency, McDaniel as an 
individual has not had that problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He has scored two touchdowns, made two interceptions and caused another, 
recovered three fumbles and forced another. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been one bright spot for the team this year," said John Fox, the 
Raiders' defensive coordinator. "As poorly as we've played, he's stood out with 
the plays he has made." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Raiders' 44-14 loss to San Francisco, McDaniel deflected a pass 
intended for John Taylor that ended up being intercepted by Greg Biekert. The 
play led to a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, in a 38-9 loss to the Seahawks, McDaniel recovered a fumble and 
returned it 41 yards for the Raiders' only touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Raiders' victory over Denver, McDaniel was named AFC defensive 
player of the week. He returned a pass by John Elway 15 yards for a touchdown, 
forced two fumbles and recovered another. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last week against the Chargers, McDaniel made his second interception of 
the season and came close on two others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terry has been playing like a Pro Bowl player and is sending a message that 
he deserves to be grouped with the best," Coach Art Shell said. "Like all the 
great players, he puts enough pressure on himself to excel and is never 
satisfied. He's always pushing himself to get better." 
</P>
<P>
 In seven seasons with the Raiders, McDaniel has matched up against the best 
receivers in the NFL. Although he does not rate them in any particular order, 
here is what he has to say about a few: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jerry Rice: "Very explosive. A big-play receiver who's always around the 
ball. If you don't stop him, he'll take advantage of you." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sterling Sharpe: "Strong guy who is always (Green Bay's) go-to guy. You 
know that he is going to get a lot of balls." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Irvin: "A big guy who always wants the ball, (who wants) to make 
the big play and has the ability to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Andre Rison: "A lot of quickness. A guy who is always trying to make the 
difficult catch." 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel, 29, prepares for each receiver by studying hours of film, 
cataloguing strengths and weaknesses. That's why he can attack an opponent's 
slant pattern as if he heard the route called in the huddle, then outrun the 
same receiver on a deep route for an interception on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be the type of cornerback that is just good in one area," he 
said. "I want to be able to do whatever is needed. From feathering a receiver 
with finesse or coming up playing bump-and-run. I try to be the best in all 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Some other defensive backs have gained exposure because of their flash (San 
Francisco's Deion Sanders) or their tough hitting and trash talking 
(Pittsburgh's Rod Woodson), but McDaniel has earned recognition by quietly 
doing his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since he's been in the league, he's just gotten better and better each year," 
said Denver wide receiver Anthony Miller, a teammate at Tennessee. "He used to 
rely on his speed all of the time, but now, since his technique has improved, 
he's one of the best." 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel credits his home life with his wife, Janna, and 2-year old daughter, 
Shayla, with keeping him focused during the Raiders' struggle this season. 
</P>
<P>
 For McDaniel, it doesn't matter that he is on his way to earning his third 
consecutive Pro Bowl trip to Hawaii. What's important is reaching the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is wins and losses," McDaniel said. "I can go out and play my 
best but it doesn't matter if we don't win. We just have to find another notch 
to reach for us to start winning again."

USC TIGHT END ALLRED BREAKS LEG AND WILL MISS THE REST OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tight end John Allred, USC's No. 2 receiver, broke his left leg in practice 
Wednesday and is lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Allred caught 10 passes for 131 yards in three games before he went down with 
what at first appeared to be a sprained ankle.Later, X-rays showed a break in 
the lower leg, and he was scheduled for surgery Thursday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
 Allred led the Trojans in receiving yardage, and only wide receiver Ken Grace 
had more catches, with 16.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame, John was just coming off two other injuries and was really 
getting into a groove," said David Robinson, who coaches the tight ends. "It's 
a great loss for our offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Allred, a 6-foot-5, 240-pound sophomore, also sat out the last two games of 
the 1993 season because of a broken leg. Earlier this season, he had a sprained 
right ankle and was slowed in training camp by a hamstring pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he played behind senior starter Brad Banta and caught 10 passes 
for 93 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said juniors Tyler Cashman and Johnny McWilliams will fill in for 
Allred, and that sophomore Jeff Diltz will play when USC is in a three-tight 
end set. EARL GUSTKEY

O.C. GARMENT INDUSTRY IS TARGET OF CRACKDOWN; LABOR: MORE APPAREL CONTRACTORS 
ARE EXPLOITING JOB-HUNGRY IMMIGRANTS BY ILLEGALLY GIVING THEM AT-HOME WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Targeting Orange County's vast underground network of home sewing operations, 
labor and welfare fraud inspectors this week are sweeping private residences 
and apparel contractors suspected of giving their employees work to take home. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown is part of a much broader effort by state and federal officials 
to curb labor and safety abuses in Southern California's garment industry, 
which has been growing rapidly in recent years amid retailers' demands that 
clothing orders be filled more quickly. That growth has spurred intense 
competition among garment contractors, some of whom have tried to undercut 
rivals and meet the increased demand by tapping an immigrant community hungry 
for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, doing home garment work for pay is illegal. On top of that, 
inspectors say, those who are sewing, cutting or doing other apparel tasks at 
home typically are paid only a fraction of the minimum wage and sometimes toil 
in sweatshop conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Marianne Blank of the Cross Cultural Community Center in Garden Grove, which 
has helped thousands of Southeast Asian refugees find jobs, said that home 
garment work in the county "is just spreading unbelievably." 
</P>
<P>
 While home apparel work has long been prevalent in Los Angeles County and, to 
a lesser degree, in the San Francisco Bay Area, inspectors say the situation 
has become acute in Orange County. Many hard-pressed immigrants and refugees, 
especially in the county's large Vietnamese community, are sewing at home as a 
way to supplement income from other jobs and, in some cases, welfare payments, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a significant problem" in Orange County, said Jose Millan, the state's 
senior deputy labor commissioner in Los Angeles. "It's gotten worse because 
you've got so many more people willing to do this to earn a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping the practice is difficult, said a labor inspector in Orange County 
who specializes in the Vietnamese community, because "employer and employee 
both benefit from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the sweeps taking place this week were not available Thursday. 
Millan said that about 40 federal, state and county inspectors were expected to 
raid more than 80 garment businesses and homes, many in Orange County but some 
also in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. They are expected to issue 
fines against the contractors totaling more than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In clamping down on the practice, state labor officials have gotten an 
unpleasant surprise: In the past year, 18 private homes in Anaheim and Santa 
Ana that were busted for doing illegal garment work produced business licenses 
from those cities, Millan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," Millan said. "They're saying they've got a business license from 
the city, so the business must be legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
 Millan said he recently wrote letters to officials in Anaheim and Santa Ana 
asking for a list of those who have been issued business licenses for home 
garment work. Neither city has responded to his request, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the business license agencies in Anaheim and Santa Ana said 
permits for home businesses are cleared with the cities' planning departments. 
</P>
<P>
 John Borrego, senior planner at the Anaheim planning department, said he was 
not aware that his department was approving that type of license but that, in 
any case, screening out garment work is not part of his department's job. "The 
only thing we do is make sure (home work) complies with the zoning code," he 
said. "Garment work isn't specifically prohibited by the ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 Planning department officials in Santa Ana could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 That people are able to get permits for home garment work is a big concern, 
labor officials say, because, along with ads for home work found in ethnic 
newspapers, it leads people unfamiliar with U.S. laws to believe that such work 
is legal. 
</P>
<P>
 One Westminster apartment that inspectors visited Wednesday afternoon had 
three sewing machines on metal worktables next to the refrigerator. Overhead 
was a fluorescent lamp, and strewn on the floor were spools of thread. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-year-old Vietnamese man who answered the door said that a man and woman 
who share the apartment with him sew at nights and on weekends to supplement 
their pay from full-time jobs at electronics plants in Los Angeles. The man at 
the apartment, who said he and his family are on welfare, said that he himself 
does not do any garment work but that he has considered it. "I didn't know it 
was illegal," he said through a translator. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Taverner, head of the U.S. Labor Department's wages and hours division 
in Santa Ana, said that many people legitimately employed by garment 
contractors take work home to make extra money after hours. Therefore, as the 
apparel industry has grown, so has home garment work, said Taverner, whose 
division has been involved in the sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statewide survey earlier this year, about 15% of garment sewing companies 
were found to be engaging in illegal home work. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Southern California as a whole, the number of garment workers in Orange 
County has climbed steadily in recent years. The Employment Development 
Department listed 8,700 workers at 511 garment makers in Orange County for the 
first quarter of 1994, the latest figures available. That was up from 7,725 
workers at 470 firms two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state officials have been trying to crack down on manufacturers as 
well as contractors to solve the home work problem. But in many cases, the 
workers are reluctant to disclose who has given them the work. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is getting worse "because contractors are getting squeezed by the 
manufacturers," said Steve Nutter, the western regional director of the 
International Ladies Garment Workers Union. "So they're trying to save money by 
cheating workers, and they can cheat them the most at their houses."

FAMALARO FACES SEX CHARGES IN HUBER SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adding another twist to the gruesome killing of Denise Huber, the Orange 
County Grand Jury on Thursday indicted John J. Famalaro on charges of sexual 
assault as well as murder and kidnap, increasing the possibility that he will 
face the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment is the first formal accusation of sexual assault in the case, 
which began when Huber's naked, handcuffed and frozen corpse was found this 
summer in a freezer in Famalaro's Arizona driveway. Huber, 23, a Newport Beach 
waitress, had disappeared three years earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 Sources confirmed this week that police discovered semen in Huber's body. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of testimony by 15 witnesses, including detectives, medical 
examiners and Huber's friends and relatives, the grand jury indicted Famalaro, 
37, on charges of first-degree murder with the special circumstances of sodomy, 
kidnap, attempted sodomy and attempted kidnap. 
</P>
<P>
 The special circumstances make Famalaro, a handyman and house-painter, 
eligible for the death penalty, though prosecutors have not yet decided whether 
they will seek his execution. He is being held without bail in the Orange 
County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro has pleaded not guilty to murder and kidnap and is expected to plead 
not guilty to the additional charges at his arraignment Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's indictment was "no surprise at all," Deputy District Atty. 
Christopher Evans said. "We're working on prosecuting Mr. Famalaro, and this is 
just one step in prosecuting him." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the new allegations of sodomy, Evans said simply: "We asked for an 
indictment based on what the evidence shows." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia, who is representing Famalaro, said that 
while the sodomy charges complicate the case, he was expecting them to be 
included in the indictment based on reports he received last week about the 
semen in Huber's body.  
</P>
<P>
 But Gumlia warned that the samples might be too small to conclusively link 
them to Famalaro, whether the sodomy occurred before or after her death, and 
whether it was forced. Forensic tests on the semen are ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who thinks they know what happened that night is only guessing," he 
said. "There is no evidence of any trauma that something forcible (happened). 
There may be something consensual happening, or maybe at an earlier time. Some 
of the questions remain unanswered, and you can read the physical evidence in 
many ways, depending on who you are and what you want to see in the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia also questioned the inclusion in the indictment of "attempted 
kidnaping" and "attempted sodomy" as well as kidnap and sodomy. He posited that 
the attempted sodomy might have been listed in case the sodomy is found to have 
occurred after Huber was killed, because sodomy and rape laws do not apply to 
assaults committed on dead people. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said the inclusion of the "attempted" charges was routine. "That's 
correct pleading practice," he said. "It's a form of pleading that we commonly 
use in our office." 
</P>
<P>
 Autopsy reports released Wednesday show that Huber, who disappeared after a 
rock concert on June 3, 1991, suffered at least 14 blows to the head and a 
fractured nose, injuries so severe that a forensic anthropologist was hired to 
reconstruct her smashed skull. The condition of her body left authorities 
unable to pinpoint the time of Huber's death, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The autopsy did not indicate any obvious sign of sexual trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities suspect that the murder weapon was either the claw hammer or nail 
puller found in Famalaro's cluttered Prescott Country Club home. Both appeared 
to be bloodstained. Police allege that Famalaro killed Huber in a Laguna Hills 
warehouse, then toted her body around for three years until it was discovered 
in the running freezer in a truck in Famalaro's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested in Arizona in July, then extradited to California earlier this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors called an array of witnesses during the grand jury proceedings, 
including Huber's mother, boyfriend, best friend and the man she was with the 
night of the killing. Also testifying were Famalaro's ex-fiancee and a man who 
had known him when he was living and working in South County in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Three representatives from the Orange County crime lab, three detectives from 
the Sheriff's Department in Yavapai County, Ariz., the doctor who prepared the 
autopsy and an expert on DNA testing were also called before the grand jury 
this week. Transcripts of the proceeding have not yet been released. 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia said he had expected his client to be indicted, but cautioned against 
early assumptions of guilt, particularly of sexual crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any defendant would prefer not to face sodomy charges, but we're not 
confident (enough based on preliminary testing) to say whether it will or won't 
be proven, or that it even occurred," Gumlia said. "We would prefer to face no 
special circumstances. And one would be better than two. Then again, it's not 
clear to us, and we're not confident yet that anyone can (prove) that it is 
John Famalaro's sperm, or when it was placed there."

5-MONTH I-5 CHECKPOINT CLOSURE TO SERVE AS TEST; IMMIGRATION: STATION IS FIRST 
CASUALTY OF CHANGING POLICY. LOCAL OFFICIALS APPLAUD MOVING AGENTS TO BORDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The controversial Border Patrol checkpoint near here -- a fixture in Southern 
California since 1924 -- became the first casualty of sweeping changes in 
immigration policy Thursday, when the Clinton Administration took the 
unprecedented step of temporarily closing the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 INS Commissioner Doris Meissner called the closure, which takes place 
officially Saturday, part of a five-month test to assess whether redeploying 93 
Border Patrol officers from the checkpoint to the California-Mexico border can 
significantly reduce illegal crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Named Operation Gatekeeper, the plan would also reallocate 47 officers from 
the inland checkpoint along Interstate 15 near Temecula to the international 
border during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Meissner said in Washington that she and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno "have stated 
publicly that we are trying new tactics to bring illegal immigration under 
control. This San Clemente checkpoint test is an example of something we have 
not tried before." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange and San Diego counties, civic officials and civil libertarians alike 
hailed the decision, calling the checkpoint just south of San Clemente a threat 
to public safety. Frequently over the years, illegal immigrants have been 
killed or injured while dashing across the freeway to avoid the checkpoint, and 
the Border Patrol has engaged in many high-speed chases through nearby 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for the American Civil Liberties Union said the criteria for 
detecting illegal immigrants had been reduced to little more, in the words of 
spokesman Jordan Budd, "than seeing who has brown skin or drives an old car." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Thomas Shaver, a Mission Viejo surgeon and head of the Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center trauma unit, applauded the closure as an important and 
long-overdue step. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fact that there was loss of life because of the checkpoint and serious 
injuries -- even injuries to many people who were not involved -- for what is a 
nonviolent crime," Shaver said. "There is simply no way to justify having that 
checkpoint this far north (66 miles from the border). Immigration is such a 
complex problem, of a magnitude we will probably never understand, that it will 
take a multitude of solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-lane facility, through which more than 122,000 automobiles pass every 
day en route to Orange County via northbound Interstate 5, has drawn bitter 
attacks in recent years from both conservative and liberal politicians who 
cited its high operational costs -- more than $7 million annually -- and openly 
questioned its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) and Rep. Lynn Schenk (D-San Diego) have 
advocated closing the checkpoint in favor of placing an El Paso, Tex.-like 
blockade along the border between San Diego and Tijuana. Such a Border Patrol 
tactic has proved particularly effective in the Rio Grande River area in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for the California Highway Patrol said Thursday that closing the 
checkpoint should make their jobs easier, citing the high number of pedestrian 
fatalities. In 1990 alone, 15 people were killed and 9 seriously injured while 
running across Interstate 5, including an 8-year-old boy who was clutching his 
mother's dress when hit by a passing car. A $458,000, seven-mile-long fence was 
erected last year in an effort to discourage people from crossing the freeway. 
No fatalities have occurred since the fence went up. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly in recent years, the San Clemente checkpoint has been a sore 
point in both south Orange County and north San Diego County, albeit for 
different reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Diehl, the mayor of San Clemente, has complained bitterly about the 
fiscal and emotional toll of high-speed chases that on occasion have burdened 
area emergency rooms and, in Diehl's opinion, placed everyday motorists at 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In the northern San Diego County communities of Oceanside and Carlsbad, city 
officials blame the checkpoint for a sharp increase in the illegal immigrant 
population of both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente Councilwoman Candace Haggard said Thursday that she and other 
city officials have never liked the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that (Border Patrol agents) feel they get a lot of people at that 
checkpoint, but that has never made sense to me," Haggard said. "Having more 
people at the border makes a lot more sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Border Patrol agents say the checkpoint has been a valuable deterrent in 
stopping illegal immigration, citing a record 75,042 arrests in 1990 as 
evidence of its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 46,000 illegal immigrants were arrested at the checkpoint in the 
1993 fiscal year, officials said Thursday, while during the same period agents 
seized 7,552 pounds of marijuana, 63 1/2 pounds of cocaine and 9 1/2 pounds of 
heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traffic check operations are an essential part of the Border Patrol's mission 
to prevent the illegal entry and smuggling of aliens into the United States," 
U.S. Justice Department official Ralph B. Thomas said recently in a written 
plea to Congress to keep the San Clemente and Temecula checkpoints open. 
"Without them, our ability to prevent the penetration of illegal aliens into 
the interior of the country would be greatly hampered." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics say the risks of operating the San Clemente checkpoint far 
outweigh its usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point Mayor Judy Curreri seconded the views of San Clemente officials and 
Shaver, saying the impact of the checkpoint often stretched into her 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a scare for neighboring communities," Curreri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Budd of the ACLU has frequently attacked the checkpoint, calling the methods 
of its agents racist. He cited a case, investigated by the ACLU, in which 
Anthony Brailow, an Orange County clinical psychologist commuting to work from 
his home in Oceanside, was harassed every day for almost a year by agents who 
suspected him of being a smuggler. 
</P>
<P>
 Brailow said Thursday that, from October, 1992, to August, 1993 -- when he 
purchased a new car -- he was stopped every day while driving to work in his 
"late '80s model Chrysler." 
</P>
<P>
 "They said I fit the profile of a dark, Hispanic looking man dressed up as a 
businessman," Brailow said. "They said, 'Smugglers drive your type of car and 
dress up like you do.' I tried giving them my (Orange County Health Care 
Agency) ID card, or getting a letter from my employers, but none of it worked 
-- until I bought a new car. I absolutely felt like my civil rights had been 
violated, and of course, none of their searches ever led to anything."

LAW EASES GREEN CARD PROCEDURES; IMMIGRATION: O.C. LAWMAKER CRITICIZES MEASURE, 
WHICH ALLOWS UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS TO APPLY WITHOUT LEAVING UNITED STATES, BUT 
ONLY IF THEY ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 At a time when policy-makers nationwide have targeted illegal immigration, a 
controversial new law that goes into effect Saturday will make it easier for 
tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants in California and elsewhere to 
receive so-called green cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure allows illegal immigrants who are already eligible for green cards 
-- those approved because of family sponsors or job guarantees -- to adjust 
their status while in the United States rather than returning home to complete 
the paperwork, a major convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its technical nature, the law has provoked widespread confusion and 
raised false expectations, prompting criticism of government implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten hundreds of phone calls from people who think it's a new amnesty 
program," said Peter A. Schey, director of the Center for Human Rights and 
Constitutional Law, a Los Angeles organization that assists immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The prevailing ambiguity even prompted Immigration and Naturalization Service 
Commissioner Doris Meissner to issue an unusual clarification this week. 
"Contrary to rumors, this provision in no way provides amnesty to anyone," 
Meissner said.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who will benefit have waited for years for their visa numbers to 
be called. Starting Saturday, those approved for green cards may finish the 
process in the United States -- after paying a $130 filing fee plus a penalty 
of $650 for anyone in the country illegally, the agency's highest levy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under previous law, illegal immigrants had to complete the documentation at 
U.S. consulates or embassies, a requirement that forced many people who were 
already in the United States to make the often costly trip back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous penalty," said Amin David, chairman of Los Amigos of Orange 
County, a business, community and professional organization. He added: "I agree 
with those who say it's confusing. It's a Catch-22. The amount of money is very 
stiff. Leave it to the government to make it confusing and difficult to work 
properly. I'm very concerned about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, according to the INS, about 100,000 visa seekers who formerly would 
have been obliged to file abroad will now be able to take care of everything at 
local INS offices. Most are undocumented relatives of legal permanent residents 
or U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 A bipartisan congressional majority passed the measure largely without public 
debate last month as part of a huge appropriations bill. President Clinton 
signed it into law Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was designed to relieve the burden on overseas consular officers, 
legislators emphasize, not to make life easier for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns in the House that the change could spur illegal immigration prompted 
inclusion of a so-called sunset clause terminating its provisions in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the new law rewards criminal behavior and favors wealthy 
immigrants who can handle the stiff penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that a person who comes in illegally shouldn't be allowed to 
adjust under any circumstances," said Dan Stein, executive director of the 
Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington-based group that seeks 
curbs on new entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that the measure "opens up a three-year window for people who wish 
to flout our country's laws," Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) said: 
"This change in law opens a loophole so large you could drive not only a truck 
through it, but a truck filled with illegal aliens." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, respond supporters, who say the law merely recognizes reality: Many 
of the multitudes now languishing on visa waiting lists are already in the 
United States. Illegal immigrants who are not immediately qualified for green 
cards remain subject to arrest and deportation, the INS says. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one who is not eligible for an immigrant visa will get one by virtue of 
anything that was changed," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Berman and other backers say, those who choose to file in the United 
States will henceforth contribute tens of millions of dollars in fees and 
penalties to the threadbare treasury of the perennially underfinanced INS. The 
money, supporters note, now enriches the carriers that shuttle green card 
candidates back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone except foreign airlines will be better off," Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $780 combined fee and penalty will, for many immigrants, amount to less 
than round-trip travel and other expenses associated with returning home to 
file, experts said. The major exceptions are Mexican nationals, who could 
probably make the trip to U.S. consulates in Tijuana or elsewhere for 
considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many advocates say the $650 penalty is absurdly high for a population 
often struggling to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This allows the wealthiest people to take advantage, while forcing the poor 
who cannot afford these exorbitant charges to remain underground and 
undocumented," Schey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exempt from the penalty are those 16 and younger and so-called family unity 
cases -- the spouses and children of amnesty recipients, mostly Mexican 
nationals, who became legal under the broad amnesty statute passed in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law explicitly seeks to encourage immigrants to file in the United 
States and pay the attendant costs. Those who opt for consular processing 
abroad will face no monetary penalty, but most will have to wait three months 
before receiving green cards -- a considerable disincentive for working people. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from avoiding costly travel, advocates said those seeking green cards 
will enjoy another major benefit: Those filing in the United States will have 
greatly expanded due process rights if they are turned down because of criminal 
records, indigence, health problems or other reasons. After denials at consular 
offices, there are few practical avenues for appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Mark I. Pinsky contributed to this article. How the Law 
Will Work 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at a law that takes effect Saturday and revises procedures for 
foreign nationals residing in the United States who have been notified of their 
eligibility for so-called green cards, or legal U.S. residence documents. 
</P>
<P>
 * What it will allow: Permits eligible visa-seekers to complete paperwork in 
the United States instead of returning to their homelands and filing there. 
Immigrants who are here illegally at the time they file will have to pay a $650 
penalty on top of the $130 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Who is affected: An estimated 100,000 immigrants, mostly undocumented, who 
become eligible for green cards each year because of family sponsors or job 
guarantees. Under current law, they had to file at U.S. consulates abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 * Costs: Implementation price tag unknown. Total fees and penalties paid to 
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service could run into the tens of 
millions of dollars; some may be used to offset costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * For more details: The INS is not prepared for telephone inquiries, but 
agency officials say information will be available at INS headquarters, 300 N. 
Los Angeles St. in Downtown Los Angeles or 14550 Magnolia St. in Westminster. 
Nonprofit groups that work with immigrants may also have information. 
</P>
<P>
 * What hasn't changed: There is no new amnesty law, no increased immigration 
total. This statute is merely a technical revision allowing eligible immigrants 
to complete the process in the United States.

O.C. LAWMAKERS' SCHOOL SAFETY BILLS SIGNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson signed a raft of legislation from two Orange County lawmakers 
Thursday designed to help curb school violence, including a new law that 
creates a 1,000-foot "gun-free zone" around campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the measures are a trio of bills from Assemblywoman Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress) that address school hate crimes, establish a "zero-tolerance" 
policy requiring expulsions for possession of guns or drugs at school and make 
it a felony to violate the gun-free zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also signed a bill authored by Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) 
that prohibits drug dealers or convicted offenders from entering school grounds 
or loitering nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools should be a safe haven for children, not another in a string of 
places where they fear for their safety," Wilson said in putting his stamp of 
approval on the legislation, which was among 11 school safety measures he 
signed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's approval was a particular victory for Allen, who had made 
school safety her paramount issue this year. She began pushing a slate of bills 
to quell school violence after witnessing her own granddaughter endure several 
acts of school violence -- including having rivals try to set her hair on fire 
-- before the family moved from Southern California to Montana to escape the 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she won broad support from parents and educators, Allen had to fight 
a pitched battle against Sacramento's powerful gun lobby last month to win 
approval for her measure creating a gun-free zone. 
</P>
<P>
 During the waning days of the legislative year, gun advocates attempted to 
sabotage the bill. Allen managed to save it only after a heated round of 
lobbying. Miffed by the episode, Allen fired back by casting the deciding vote 
to push a bill banning copycat assault weapons out of a key committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun lobby responded by pushing for substantial amendments to an Allen bill 
designed to toughen vagrancy laws on school campuses. That move scuttled the 
vagrancy bill because the changes were deemed by legislative leaders to be 
major amendments that could not be taken up so late in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the gun-free zone law, those possessing a weapon within 1,000 feet of 
school grounds could face felony charges. The measure exempts residents living 
within the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's "zero-tolerance" measure requires expulsion of students caught with 
drugs or weapons on campus. Expelled students will be sent to special 
"community schools" to continue their education under tight supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Several students from Huntington Beach High School were the inspiration for 
Allen's measure that directs schools to punish pupils for racist hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's bill, which was sponsored by the city of Anaheim, makes it a 
misdemeanor for a drug offender to enter school property or loiter on public 
areas next to schools without written permission of administrators. Drug 
offenders who are the parents or guardians of children attending the school are 
exempted. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg said the new law will help close "a bizarre loophole" for local law 
enforcement. In trying to enforce existing laws that prohibit convicted drug 
users and sellers from entering city parks, officers have been foiled when the 
offenders step onto school grounds, where city ordinances are invalid.

BUSCH, $175-MILLION EXPANSION WILL STAY IN VALLEY; INDUSTRY: THE COUNTRY'S 
THIRD LARGEST BREWERY, WHICH HAD INDICATED IT MIGHT LEAVE, WILL MODERNIZE, BUT 
IS NOT EXPECTED TO HIRE ANY NEW EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY.

<P>
 Assured by a promise of help from Mayor Richard Riordan to expedite official 
paperwork, the Anheuser-Busch Co., one of the San Fernando Valley's biggest 
private employers, will remain in the Valley and launch a $175-million 
expansion program at its Van Nuys brewery, city officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 They pointed to nearly a year of meetings between brewery executives -- who 
they said were thinking of moving -- and the mayor's office as an example of 
Riordan's emphasis on keeping business and jobs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan even telephoned Anheuser-Busch President August Busch earlier this 
year to persuade him to keep the brewery in Van Nuys, city officials said. It 
is the third largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan received City Council approval Wednesday to establish a 
business-retention team and hire at least a dozen people to staff it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anheuser-Busch modernization effort is not expected to increase the number 
of employees at the brewery, a cluster of buildings along the San Diego 
Freeway, nor to increase the amount of land it occupies. The 40-year-old plant 
employs about 1,250 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anheuser-Busch is one of the manufacturing jewels in the city's crown, and 
it's really good news that they're staying put here in L.A.," said Assistant 
Deputy Mayor Rocky Delgadillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their modernization will allow them to increase production capacity there. If 
they didn't do it, it would have meant an eventual reduction in jobs. But many 
years down the road, we'll probably see many more jobs at this facility. If 
you're a state-of-the-art plant, you'll be more competitive and will eventually 
hire more people to stay competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 In a press release, the company said the modernization plan will include 
construction of new high-speed can and bottle lines as well as improvements to 
its brewing system. Executives added Wednesday that the company also plans to 
automate its warehouse operations and build a new 36,000-square-foot brew house 
and fermentation room by the time the project is completed in late 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anheuser-Busch brewery in Van Nuys, which ranks in size only behind the 
Coors facility in Golden, Colo., and the main Anheuser-Busch plant in St. 
Louis, exports beer to countries ranging from Central America to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in 1954, the 90-acre facility once included a theme park named Busch 
Gardens, complete with rides and performing macaws. In 1979, the demand for 
more beer moved the company to pave over the gardens for more production space. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Anheuser-Busch representatives first approached the city a year 
ago to say they were considering relocating to another city but wanted to 
explore any help the company could get in expediting the expansion process if 
it chose to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never came to the point of a threat," Delgadillo said. "Whenever a company 
explores an expansion, they consider all their options, and that's what they 
told us. They were exploring other sites. So, if it didn't work out, they could 
have left. But it has always been a friendly dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 The company needs approvals for the expansion work from several agencies, 
including the city's Public Works Department, Planning Department and the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted us to be upfront with them about the planning process, and 
expedite the permitting process and make sure it was done in a timely manner," 
Delgadillo said. "We told them we'd do the same thing for anybody who we had 
concerns about leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Southern California has lost more than 500,000 jobs, many of them 
prime manufacturing positions, Delgadillo said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been competitive in a business-friendly way," he said. "We're 
working right now to improve on that, to make this a business-friendly city." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Henry, a planning and land-use aide to Councilman Joel Wachs, who 
represents the district where the brewery is situated, said Wachs' office 
received a letter from Anheuser-Busch a few months ago requesting additional 
help in the permit process. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the biggest single employer in the Valley," he said. "Considering 
their track record about being good neighbors, we should keep them." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry said Wachs was unaware that the company had been meeting privately with 
the mayor's staff and wants to be sure that legal requirements are not 
short-circuited. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are any necessary environmental reviews or discretionary actions by 
the city that necessitate public hearings, we want them to take place," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anheuser-Busch is a great employer in this community. We want their permits 
granted quickly, but definitely not secretively."

BLOODY BUT UNBOWED; AFTER BEING BEATEN AND STABBED, VAUGHAN FOCUSES ON FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ruben Vaughan, defensive end and poet, stood up to face his teammates. This 
was his first week of action for Foothill High School, his adopted school. His 
first game. His first pregame meal. 
</P>
<P>
 The end-of-meal entertainment, the Knights' weekly pregame ritual, had bailed. 
Team captains were searching for a stand-in. They asked Vaughan to recite a 
poem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote it down real quick," said Vaughan, a sophomore. "I talked about not 
giving up. I talked about staying with it until the end. I talked about hanging 
in there, no matter how down you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Words for his team and words for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan has hung in there and stayed with it. He was beaten and stabbed in 
August, a victim of a racial attack, according to his stepfather and others. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent four days in the hospital. He left Santa Margarita High School. He 
had physical and emotional scars. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan was down, all right. Who wouldn't have been? Yet there was a focal 
point for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to get back to football as soon as possible," he said. "I wanted 
to prove to everybody that I couldn't be kept down." 
</P>
<P>
 He finished reading the poem. After the applause ended, the players left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruben went above the moment," Foothill 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Tom Meiss said. "It sounded like he was talking about himself. He has 
overcome personal setbacks. But he was also talking about the team. The team 
should become the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 And Vaughan would rather talk about the team. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been nearly two months since he was attacked. He is trying to deal with 
emotions that no one, especially a 16-year-old, should have to deal with. So 
who can blame him for wanting to talk football? 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to bring it up all the time," Vaughan said of the attack. "That's 
the hardest thing. I really don't want to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 So let's talk football. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan, who lives near the school, transferred to Foothill in early 
September. He was still recovering from a broken jaw, which had been wired 
shut, and stab wounds, one of which nearly severed the artery in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, on Sept. 16, he played against Woodbridge. A week later, he started 
against Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan swooped into the backfield to make a tackle for a loss early in the 
game. He got up, yelled and growled . 
</P>
<P>
 "The ref told me to cool it down," Vaughan said. "I said I was sorry and that 
I was just real excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan was back. 
</P>
<P>
 Football has always been important to Vaughan. His father, Ruben Vaughan II, 
was a defensive lineman for the Raiders and San Francisco 49ers. Ruben began 
playing at 7, in youth leagues. He said his mother saw how aggressive he was 
and thought it best to get him in football. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was bigger than most kids and I think that drew him to football faster," 
said Melvin Aaron, Vaughan's stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Vaughan: "I loved the game from the first moment I played." 
</P>
<P>
 Loved it so much, he'd do anything to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth leagues have weight limits to balance the competition. For Vaughan, it 
was always a struggle to keep under the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
 He would skip dinner the night before games. Then he would skip breakfast. All 
to make the weigh-in before each game. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started taking laxatives, my mom said, 'Enough,' " Vaughan said. "That 
was too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan, who was 6 feet 3, 225 pounds heading into this summer, stopped 
playing for two years, until he was a freshman at Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked out one day with the Eagle freshman team. The next day, Coach Jim 
Hartigan asked Vaughan to join the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruben caught our attention," Hartigan said. "He had physical presence. We 
thought he was ready to play varsity immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 They thought correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we heard that Ruben was coming to Foothill, we got out a Santa Margarita 
game film from last season," Meiss said. "Ruben was the best defensive player 
on the field that night." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always so easy. Vaughan struggled at first. He had raw ability but 
lacked experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was bounced around like he was in a pinball machine the first game," 
Hartigan said. "I remember when he first came out, he had every pad imaginable. 
He looked like the Michelin man. As the season wore on, he wore fewer and fewer 
pads. You could tell he was adjusting to the level." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan, who played tight end and defensive end, caught his first touchdown 
pass against Tustin. He knelt in the end zone and prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were going so well," Vaughan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had no way of knowing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan can't escape the memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's dealing with it the best he can," Aaron said. "In some ways, his youth 
helps him. It's still setting in. As he grows older, he will begin to 
understand the scenario better." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Vaughan: "It seems like every little thing makes me remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan said he was given directions to a party in Portola Hills by a 
classmate in August. When he arrived, he said a mob was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 30 people surrounded me," Vaughan said. "I'd rather not talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan suffered a broken nose, a broken jaw and several stab wounds. His 
attackers shouted racial slurs, according to witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Four have been arrested. The district attorney's office is not prosecuting the 
case as a hate crime at this time. Officials said there was insufficient 
evidence that the attack was racially motivated. But the case is still under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan said he was set up, possibly by some of his own classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron and others said they believe the incident was racially motivated. During 
a preliminary hearing, Municipal Judge Pamela L. Iles urged prosecutors to 
consider filing hate-crime charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember sitting down in shock," he said. "A neighbor came over and asked 
me if I was all right. I remember the ambulance coming and I looked up in a 
daze." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan left Santa Margarita because his family felt it was no longer safe 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were people there who may not like me and this could happen again," 
Vaughan said. "I don't want to make it sound like Santa Margarita is a bad 
school. I loved playing for Coach Hartigan and I have a lot of friends there. 
It's just a small percentage." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Aaron: "Ruben feels fortunate to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The plate in Vaughan's jaw will remain. But the other physical damage has 
healed. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan was back working out two weeks after leaving the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 It was tough at first. His jaw was wired shut, which prevented him from 
breathing hard. The stab wounds ached. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are those he believes tried to prevent him from playing football," 
Aaron said. "That has given him a new drive. I notice more enthusiasm. He 
attacked the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan had lost 20 pounds and a lot of upper body strength. He lifted weights 
and ate to regain what he lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The raw ability was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has those long arms," Meiss said. "When he grabs you, you're done." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan was cleared to play Sept. 12. He began full contact that day. He 
played that Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tired of watching," Vaughan said. "I was ready to hit." 
</P>
<P>
 The other scars, the ones inside, have not mended as easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen mood swings I didn't see before," Aaron said. "But can you fault 
him? It's easy for him to get down and become despondent, But mostly he keeps 
things upbeat. I find that healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Poetry has helped, some. Vaughan began writing a year ago, jotting down his 
views and emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll write about one a week," Vaughan said. "I get feelings and I try to put 
them into words. I just get things off my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan has written about the attack, trying to exorcise it. He said it has 
helped only a little. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to put it behind me," Vaughan said. "But it's never going to be 
behind me. It's going to be a part of me the rest of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writing about it helps some. But for the anger and frustration, I have 
football."

MIKE DOWNEY: TWO MINUTES FOR STUPIDITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I once ate dinner in the hills above Sarajevo, when there was still a 
Yugoslavia, at a party where the host roasted a goat on a spit. The host, an 
American restaurateur, was the father of hockey player Chris Chelios, and he 
personally devoured a portion of the main course that I will describe no 
further because of my high regard for the squeamish. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what happened to that goat was nothing compared to the roasting Chris 
Chelios gave the other day to Gary Bettman, commissioner of professional 
hockey. Oozing an astounding amount of vitriol, for which he later apologized, 
Chelios, a no-holds-barred defenseman for Chicago, said in language that would 
make a Teamster blush that if he were Bettman, "I'd be worried about my family, 
about my well-being right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But although I cannot condone such sentiments, bilious as they are, I can 
almost understand young Chelios' rage. Like a lot of us, he is exasperated -- 
no, make that mortified -- over the most stupendously dunderheaded, 
self-destructive act of this sporting generation, the imminent lockout of 
National Hockey League players that follows on the heels of a baseball strike 
that has alienated one and all, man and boy, woman and girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about an image-wrecking, public-relations blunder the likes of which 
hasn't been seen since Pee-wee Herman went to an adult movie! Hockey players, 
fighting for years for something a lot more important than a puck -- namely, 
respect -- are about to squander ample amounts of goodwill at a time when 
nobody is playing baseball, nobody is playing basketball and nobody has a team 
sport to view on television except for football -- and volleyball in bathing 
suits. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was more peeved at the commish, Bettman, for failing to halt this 
madness than the volcanic Chelios, who continued, "Some crazed fan or even a 
player, who knows, might well take it into his own hands and figure if they get 
him out of the way, this might be settled. You hate to see something like that 
happen, but he took the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris has apparently been to one too many Martin Scorsese movies. Who does he 
think Bettman fronts for -- da mob? 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, the guy wants to put the hockey boss on ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even a more level-headed colleague, Mike Gartner of the Toronto Maple 
Leafs, has trouble controlling his fury over all this. 
</P>
<P>
 Gartner likes to think of himself as a rational, conscientious elder statesman 
of hockey, but at 34 he has only so many seasons to go, and like so many in his 
profession, he has been waiting for hockey to emerge as a multi-national 
pastime with coast-to-coast television coverage, and that means Miami to San 
Jose as well as Montreal to Vancouver. So this thing steams him. 
</P>
<P>
 No more headlines about strikes and walkouts or skate-outs, Gartner says. 
"It's time to put it back in the back room where it belongs, and not on the 
front page. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people are sick and tired of looking at the front page of their 
newspapers and seeing labor situations and negotiations and all, first baseball 
and now this. I know I'm sick of it, and I'm part of the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Truer words were never spoken. There are people I know who wouldn't spend a 
penny on a sporting event right now, because they equate everything with greed 
and nothing with need. The issues at stake are so much larger, but it doesn't 
matter because of the timing, which could not be worse. Hockey had a window of 
opportunity, starting here, starting now, to dominate public attention, to 
attract first-time callers and to rise and shine while baseball parks stay 
dark. For once, an October, all to itself. It could have been hockey's month to 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Wayne Gretzky also was awash in sadness, shaking his head in 
discouragement as he intoned what "one man" was doing to hockey, how "one man 
and one man only" was responsible for what was happening to Gretzky's favorite 
sport, that villainous cur being Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which undoubtedly must be causing distress to Bettman, who never 
dreamed upon accepting this job that the hot-tempered players of hockey would 
be cursing his name while even the meekest were loath to speak it. 
</P>
<P>
 As a P.R. maneuver of their own, the players made sure Thursday that they 
volunteered for all to hear their complete willingness to begin this season 
under any circumstances, with or without contracts, hell, with or without 
sticks or pucks. This is part of the process of which Gartner spoke, 
endeavoring to control the public spin. If North America needs a villain, then, 
by gum, the players are more than happy to identify one. And he ain't one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 I have no idea if Gary Bettman has done everything that need be done, or if he 
appreciates the consequences of this action. All I know is that, like a lot of 
people, I was looking forward to taking a gander at my new Mighty Ducks, and to 
my fallen Kings starting fresh, and to Chelios checking the goat cheese out of 
Gartner, and to Mark Messier slapping a shot at the crazy St. Louis coach, and 
to Luc Robitaille of the Pittsburgh Penguins bearing down on a goaltender with 
one man to beat, Marty McSorley. I was primed for some hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't anybody playing anything anymore? Can't we all get along?

THREAT TO ANTITRUST EXEMPTION; BASEBALL: CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE APPROVES 
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD PARTLY REMOVE PROTECTION OF OWNERS FROM SUITS BY 
PLAYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A congressional committee Thursday approved legislation that would partly 
remove baseball's antitrust exemption, signaling a growing frustration in 
Congress with a labor dispute that ended the 1994 season and threatens next 
year's games. 
</P>
<P>
 The exemption, created by a 1922 Supreme Court decision, protects owners of 
major league baseball clubs from being sued by players under federal antitrust 
laws. It was a major factor in the players' decision last month to go on strike 
in an effort to prevent management from imposing a salary cap that would limit 
their pay.  
</P>
<P>
 In a move designed to assist the players, the House Judiciary Committee voted 
to scrap elements of the antitrust exemption if club owners unilaterally impose 
the salary cap or other work rules opposed by the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
 The voice vote on a bill sponsored by Rep. Mike Synar (D -- Okla.) marked the 
first time that a congressional committee has acted against the exemption. It 
would allow players to challenge in federal court as an unfair "restraint on 
trade" any salary cap or work rules that owners might seek to impose, leaving 
the decision in the hands of a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser joined other major league 
players Thursday in urging another congressional committee to impose binding 
arbitration in the baseball strike if that is needed to salvage spring training 
and next year's season.  
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser, New York Yankee center fielder Bernie Williams and Pittsburgh 
Pirate shortstop Jay Bell were heard during a House Education and Labor 
subcommittee hearing on a bill sponsored by subcommittee chairman Pat Williams 
(D-Mont.) to impose binding arbitration "to preserve the 1995 season if the 
parties fail to reach agreement on their own by Feb. 1, 1995."  
</P>
<P>
 The prospects are uncertain for final action by Congress on the antitrust 
exemption or on the matter of binding arbitration because lawmakers hope to 
adjourn within the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we want to put this league and the players on notice that the 
antitrust exemption they enjoyed is on its deathbed," Synar said. "It's a very 
narrow, straightforward approach to give players their day in court so we can 
end this strike." 
</P>
<P>
 The anger of members of Congress over the baseball strike that began Aug. 12, 
wiping out the rest of the season and the World Series, was apparent at the 
hearing before the labor-management relations subcommittee of the Education and 
Labor Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Williams, wearing a Yankee cap at times, said that he and other fans 
"are angry, sad and disappointed." He demanded to know what bargaining sessions 
are taking place. When told that none had occurred in the last two weeks and 
none are scheduled, the congressman thundered, "That ain't going to get it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said that he is determined to push his bill for binding arbitration 
through his committee in hopes of getting action by the House and Senate by the 
end of next week.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the legislation, an arbitration board would be established to choose 
between one final offer from each side, with a decision by March 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Endorsing such an approach, Hershiser told the subcommittee, "We need your 
help. We appreciate any efforts you are making to get involved. We feel 
collective bargaining is the way to go. But the rules we are playing under are 
not working." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Major R. Owens (D-N.Y.), a subcommittee member, told players and owner 
representatives sitting at the witness table, "I urge you to resolve your 
differences without congressional intervention. But I assure you we will get 
involved to protect the interest of fans and the best interests of baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ravitch, management's chief negotiator, said that congressional action 
of any kind "is not the appropriate mechanism" for resolving the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The serious economic problems faced by major league baseball can only be 
resolved through a free collective bargaining process," Ravitch said. He 
attacked the players' union for what he termed "its philosophical refusal to 
negotiate labor costs as contemplated by the federal labor laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Some committee members, too, appeared reluctant to approve binding 
arbitration. Rep. Harris W. Fawell (R-Ill.) said, "I love this game, but the 
strike is not an economic tragedy and I basically take the view that we ought 
not to break into the collective bargaining process." 
</P>
<P>
 Added California Rep. Howard P. McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), "I'm a big Dodger 
fan, but I have great concerns when the government gets involved in private 
enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Ravitch told reporters that club owners had started 
thinking about whether to declare an impasse and impose a salary cap.

LAME DUCK; JOHN ROBINSON WASN'T MUCH OF A PLAYER AT OREGON, BUT IT WASN'T FOR 
LACK OF KNOWLEDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oregon week. The Ducks are coming to the Coliseum on Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Some cursory research reveals that one of the USC Trojans used to play for 
Oregon. And a few phone calls reveal further that he wasn't much of a player at 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 A real Webster Webfoot, in fact.  
</P>
<P>
 But once the guy came on board at USC, he became famous.  
</P>
<P>
 That guy, of course, is John Robinson, USC's 59-year-old coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Robinson has had a number of wisecracks at the ready to 
describe himself in his 1954-58 Oregon playing career.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got so little playing time at Oregon, the zipper on my warm-up jacket 
rusted shut," he often says.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, a two-way end, played in the 1958 Rose Bowl game, when Ohio State 
beat Oregon, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
 On the last play of the game, that is.  
</P>
<P>
 "Casanova (Oregon Coach Len Casanova) sent me in for the last play," Robinson 
said. "The Ohio State quarterback took the snap, went to one knee and the game 
was over. 
</P>
<P>
 "An Ohio State tackle slapped me on the back and said, 'Nice game.' I said, 
'Thank you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 OK, how bad was he? 
</P>
<P>
 One reason Robinson never started a game at Oregon was because he played 
behind an All-Coast receiver -- they called them ends then -- Ron Stover.  
</P>
<P>
 "John's problem was his speed," Stover said recently. "He didn't have any. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Robby to run a deep pattern, the quarterback needed about 14 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 And frankly, he didn't have the greatest hands in the world, either. I think 
Stickum was invented for him.  
</P>
<P>
 "We finally designed a play he could run. It was a buttonhook. John could get 
downfield 10 to 12 yards in four or five seconds, then turn around and catch a 
pass." 
</P>
<P>
 So how did he wind up in a major college football program? 
</P>
<P>
 Casanova, who is 88 and will attend Saturday's game, blamed it on a bum 
recruiting tip. "Robinson could catch the ball, but he couldn't run fast enough 
to get open," Casanova said.  
</P>
<P>
 "His high school coach (at Serra High in San Mateo) played for me at Santa 
Clara, and he called me one day about Robinson. He told me Robinson could 
really catch that ball, but didn't say anything about his speed. So I took his 
word for it and we brought him up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Robinson's arrival, his boyhood pal from Daly City, John Madden, 
showed up too. According to Casanova, the future Raider coach wanted a tryout.  
</P>
<P>
 "Madden was a big, strong tough guy, so I took a look at him," Casanova said. 
"He had good straight-ahead speed for a lineman but he had no lateral movement 
at all. We turned him down." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and Madden were grammar school chums, went to separate high schools 
and were finally reunited in 1975, when Madden made Robinson his backfield 
coach with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson began coaching on Casanova's staff after graduating from Oregon and 
stayed there 12 seasons before becoming USC's offensive coordinator in 1972.  
</P>
<P>
 Stover, Casanova and another former teammate, Jim Shanley, all remember 
Robinson as a coach in the making.  
</P>
<P>
 "He had a great imagination," said Stover, a vice president of Willamette 
Industries in Portland.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was always drawing up plays, with guys running in all different 
directions, saying, 'Stover, you give a curl here, then a fake there. . . . ' 
Someone would break in and tell him, 'John, it would take five minutes to run 
that play.'  
</P>
<P>
 "But even then he was a football technician, always thinking of little things 
that would make plays work better. He used to drive Casanova crazy. He had a 
technical perception of football that none of the rest of us had. We could all 
see he'd be a good coach one day." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanley, an Oregon running back who later played for the Green Bay Packers, 
recalls Robinson as a good downfield blocker.  
</P>
<P>
 "Robby once threw a downfield block on a defensive back for me against San 
Jose State that I needed for a 50-yard touchdown run," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't play a lot. He had bad knees the whole time he was at Oregon. But 
he was great on the sideline. He was like a coach in a uniform. He was always 
fired up, always encouraging everyone.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he'd be a coach. He was the coach of our fraternity basketball team. 
The great thing that's never changed with him in all those years is his ability 
to laugh when things aren't going so good.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never saw him complain or gripe about not playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who today often talks with players unhappy about their playing time, 
said it just wasn't done in the 1950s.  
</P>
<P>
 "Complaining to the head coach -- you just didn't do that," Robinson said. "It 
was another era. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, I knew I wasn't as good as the guys who were playing ahead of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalled Stover: "In those days, your head coach was God. You showed him 
respect, like you did your parents. Complaining to Casanova then meant maybe 
spending the rest of your career on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 Stover also said Robinson could take a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time we were playing UCLA at the Coliseum," he said. "He got hit on his 
blind side running downfield on a play and it was one of the worst hits I ever 
saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "He almost got knocked into the seats. I started looking for the ambulance. 
But he bounced right up and ran back to the huddle, a big smile on his face." 
</P>
<P>
 Casanova remembers Robinson as . . . well, pesky. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always coming into my office with some play he'd drawn up," he said. 
"He'd say, 'Coach, we gotta try this one.' He had some good ideas. But some 
were not so good. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time he showed me a play he said would revolutionize football. We tried 
it, and it didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I said to him, 'I thought you said that play would revolutionize 
football.' He said to me, 'It's not worth a damn, coach -- too easy to 
defense.' 
</P>
<P>
 "One time he talked me into painting our green and lemon-yellow helmets all 
green for the Oregon State game. So we did. I think we lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great guy on the sideline, always yelling, cheering everyone. Most 
games, he didn't play at all, but I don't ever remember him complaining.  
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I could see he'd be a coach. He was brimming over with ideas. One time 
we played a bad first half against Idaho and were down at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came into the locker room and I was going to really tear into the team. 
Robinson meets me at the door and says, 'Coach, we gotta do this, we gotta do 
that. . . . '  
</P>
<P>
 "I said to him: 'If you don't mind, I'll do the talking here.' "

ANGELS' CAREW CONSIDERING OFFER TO JOIN ROCKIES' COACHING STAFF

<P>
 Angel hitting instructor Rod Carew has postponed a decision to renew his 
contract with the Angels, and is considering an offer to join the Colorado 
Rockies' coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Carew, a member of the Hall of Fame and former teammate of Colorado Manager 
Don Baylor, has received permission from Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi to 
talk with the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 Carew, the Angels' batting coach the last three seasons, was invited back to 
the staff last week by Manager Marcel Lachemann. However, Baylor is attempting 
to add Carew to his staff and created an opening for him Thursday when hitting 
coach Dwight Evans was forced to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Baltimore Orioles have invited former Angel Manager Buck 
Rodgers to interview for their managerial vacancy. Rodgers, who is vacationing 
in Boston, is expected to accept the invitation and be interviewed within 10 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles also invited Whitey Herzog, former Angel general manager, to 
interview for the job. However, Herzog said he is unsure whether he wants to 
return to managing, and still has a standing offer from the Kansas City Royals.

RAMS STILL WEIGHING THREE SITES; FOOTBALL: SHAW SAYS ST. LOUIS, BALTIMORE AND 
ANAHEIM REMAIN IN THE RUNNING FOR TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 St. Louis continues to gain momentum in its bid for the Rams, and an improved 
Orange County offer is still being considered, but team President John Shaw 
Thursday discounted reports that Baltimore has fallen out of running. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the Rams had narrowed their choices to St. Louis and Anaheim, Shaw 
said, "Absolutely not. I don't know where those perceptions came from. We 
really haven't had any conversations with St. Louis for a few weeks. They're 
trying to come in next week, but I'm not sure whether (those meetings) will 
materialize." 
</P>
<P>
 A series of circumstances, including Wednesday's vote among NFL owners to 
approve the Washington Redskins' proposed move to Laurel, Md., about 20 miles 
south of Baltimore, seemed to swing the Rams' pendulum toward St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason: St. Louis offers the path of least resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Redskins hoping to corner the Washington and Baltimore markets with a 
new 78,600-seat stadium in Laurel, many believe Washington owner Jack Kent 
Cooke will rally enough support to block Baltimore's attempts to land a 
franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 If at least eight of the league's 30 owners vote against such a move, a team 
would have to sue the NFL -- as the Raiders did after their 1982 move from 
Oakland to Los Angeles was not approved by the league -- to relocate to 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram owner Georgia Frontiere has admitted a strong distaste for protracted 
litigation, but it is believed a move to St. Louis would readily be approved by 
NFL owners -- thus sparing Frontiere a seat on the witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think (the Laurel vote) enhances our chances," said Mac Scott, director 
of communications for the St. Louis County Executive's office. "The Redskins 
are apparently well connected in the NFL, and you'd have to think they'd 
encourage other teams to vote against a move to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Baltimore is not an option, you're down to staying in Anaheim or coming to 
St. Louis. We already know we have a better lease and stadium than Anaheim, and 
despite what the Baltimore contingent believes, we have a solid and 
enthusiastic fan base." 
</P>
<P>
 NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the Laurel resolution does not bar 
Baltimore from getting a team, though, and Shaw said it didn't make Baltimore a 
less attractive alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it changes Baltimore's status one way or another," said Shaw, 
who attended the NFL owners meetings in Irving, Tex., this week. "I know when 
we've contemplated Baltimore, it's always been looked at with the possibility 
of having a team in Laurel." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Baltimore's NFL efforts have maintained Baltimore and Washington 
are two distinct markets, and that even if the Redskins moved to Laurel, they 
would not impact a team in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Will (a team in Laurel) be a problem for us? No, I don't really think so," 
said novelist Tom Clancy, who has joined Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos 
in an attempt to purchase an NFL team. "Sooner or later, one way or another, 
there will be an NFL football team in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine the NFL would actively prevent a team's establishment in 
Baltimore," Clancy said. "Their track record on doing such things is bleak, and 
even if it was better, it just wouldn't be a smart thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Orange County task force working to keep the Rams in Southern 
California has the simple solution for avoiding such legal hassles: Stay in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The group recently made an enhanced offer to the Rams, which includes a 
$60-million to $70-million renovation of Anaheim Stadium, a $12-million 
practice facility, and ticket and luxury box sales guarantees.

IT'S ALL A LITTLE HARD TO BELIEVE; HOCKEY: KINGS WERE PREPARED FOR WORST, BUT 
STILL HELD OUT HOPE FOR A LATE SETTLEMENT. SAYS DONNELLY: 'IT'S NOT GOING TO 
SINK IN FOR A WHILE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 King left wing Mike Donnelly was home Thursday night, listening to news of his 
immediate future as he heard of the NHL owners' rejection of the players' 
no-strike, no lockout proposal, which clears the way for Commissioner Gary 
Bettman to postpone Saturday's season openers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe this is happening," he said. "It's not going to sink in for a 
while. When we left practice today, the plan was to practice at Iceoplex and 
travel to San Jose at 6. Isn't that sad?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the developments didn't surprise any of the Kings, although they 
had been holding out a small measure of hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (same) proposal was rejected not long ago and Bettman gave all 
indications he was going to go that way," goaltender Kelly Hrudey said. "It's 
in keeping with what we expected. We were hoping for the best and the wisest 
decision. But. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Donnelly: "It's frustrating because you didn't know if it's going to 
happen or not. You try to block it out as much as possible, even though it's so 
important to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Hrudey has been frustrated by people asking him about "going on strike." He 
continues to correct them and makes it clear that the work stoppage is a 
lockout and it is coming at the worst possible time for hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's disappointing is that we're all trying to make this game grow," he 
said. "No one has done a better job than Wayne (Gretzky). In some small part, 
we've all done a lot to help it. We're the ones who grew up with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are we employees and players, we're fans. Ask any player if he 
watches games and he'll tell you, 'Tons of them.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what's upsetting. I truly believe some of the people who make the 
decisions aren't fans. Just executives trying to make money." 
</P>
<P>
 He also believes the perception of sports as a business has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's important is that I don't think people are fooled by rich people 
owning big businesses, saying they're losing money," he said. "With the economy 
and the climate of the world we live in, (people) are more business-wise now." 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Thursday night, the players had no specific plan of action and were 
waiting to hear from union leadership this morning. There has been some talk of 
a players' meeting in Toronto this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it lasts a long time -- more than a couple of weeks -- maybe I go home for 
a while," said defenseman Alexei Zhitnik, a native of Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hrudey, it all hadn't quite sunk in yet as he said: "Tomorrow, it'll 
really hit us."

NEW RINK PUTS SIMI VALLEY ON CUTTING EDGE; SKATING: EASY STREET ARENA FEATURES 
OLYMPIC- AND REGULATION-SIZE ICE SHEETS UNDER SAME ROOF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sean McGillivray is giving The Tour for close to the 500th time, and the 
thrill just won't go away. Nor will the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have the capacity to do so many things with hockey and figure 
skating," McGillivray says, hopscotching his way over rolls of insulation, 
between metal piping and through the ever-present layers of construction dust. 
"There's almost 20,000 square feet of ice, we'll have two electric Zambonis 
going at the same time and there's 1,200 pairs of new rental skates boxed up 
out back." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Easy Street Arena in Simi Valley, thought up and brought to 
life by McGillivray, and the only rink in California to feature Olympic and 
regulation-size ice sheets under the same roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The arena, which is scheduled to open late next week and will have a grand 
unveiling sometime in November, has generated excitement among skaters 
throughout the region and is a dream come true for McGillivray, a transplanted 
Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly simultaneous with the arena's opening will be the closing of the Conejo 
Valley Ice Rink in Newbury Park, run by McGillivray for the past seven years. 
The 18-year-old Conejo Valley facility, which is used nearly 22 hours a day, 
leaves much to be desired. It is dark, cold and cramped, and the $300,000 
annual rent is prohibitive, McGillivray said. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no such difficulties in Simi Valley, where city officials were 
more than happy to rework zoning requirements to accommodate McGillivray. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody cries that there's nothing for kids to do, and here's something for 
them to do and have fun at the same time," Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton 
said. "People using the rink will see our community. There's still a lot of 
people looking to get out of L.A. and they may see Simi as a place to 
relocate." 
</P>
<P>
 The arena will cost at least $3.5 million, according to McGillivray, who said 
he raised the funds privately through investors in several limited 
partnerships. It will benefit groups and organizations from competitive figure 
skaters to youth hockey players to families looking for recreational 
opportunities. Covering approximately 80,000 square feet, the building and its 
two ice sheets will be enhanced by fixed seating for almost 1,000 fans, 
spacious locker rooms, an Italian delicatessen and a state-of-the-art 
ice-making system. 
</P>
<P>
 McGillivray said almost all of the rinks' hours are already booked, though he 
added that a large number of public-skating sessions will be available. He 
plans to run the rink 17-19 hours a day at a rate of approximately $250 an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility will be home ice for the Ventura Mariners, a team of 16- to 
19-year-old players coached by McGillivray. The Mariners are one of six teams 
playing in the inaugural season of the Western States Hockey League and have 15 
games scheduled at the arena. The WSHL, one of several "Junior B" leagues in 
the United States, also has teams in Anaheim, San Jose, Phoenix, Las Vegas and 
Salt Lake City. McGillivray is hopeful the league will feed players to college 
hockey programs. 
</P>
<P>
 One prominent college coach, Michigan Tech University's Bob Mancini, already 
is interested in both the new rink and in developing talent in Southern 
California. The third-year coach, whose team competes in the Western Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. with traditional powers such as Wisconsin and Minnesota, is 
planning four weeks of hockey camps next summer at the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outstanding, it has everything that a first-class facility should have," 
Mancini said. "There's room to evaluate players from off the ice and the 
Olympic ice surface gives us a better opportunity to coach. With more ice you 
can have more players moving at one time." 
</P>
<P>
 Skaters throughout the area are impatiently waiting to work up a head of steam 
on the new ice. And none are more anxious than 17-year-old Ace Pascual, a 
member of the Mariners and a student at Simi Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't wait to skate there. The (Olympic rink) seems almost twice the size 
of the one at Conejo Valley," said Pascual, who learned to skate at the old 
Newbury Park rink six years ago after first playing roller hockey. "It's the 
first time we're gonna be able to take showers when we come off the ice. Now we 
don't have to worry about upsetting our girlfriends after a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many older skating facilities with poor sight lines, the Easy Street 
building has few visual obstacles. The permanent bleacher seating hugs the 
arena's outer walls and is raised well above ice level. Between the twin rinks 
is a raised viewing platform that will house the deli. Underneath the platform 
is a warming area enclosed by sheets of transparent tempered glass that sit 
atop the hockey boards. "Wherever you go in this building you can see ice," 
McGillivray said. 
</P>
<P>
 All McGillivray could see on the site a year ago was a vast, empty building. 
He had combed the San Fernando Valley and other nearby regions for several 
years in search of a suitable site, but until touching down in Simi Valley, had 
yet to find the right location at the right price. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was land available here and there, but my God, you'd never be able to 
pay the bills," said McGillivray, whose chosen site a quarter-mile west of the 
Easy Street-Madera Road intersection was previously occupied by a building- and 
garden-supply store. 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting several months to attain the necessary amendments and approvals 
from Simi Valley, McGillivray was ready to begin construction -- until the 
early morning of Jan. 17. Though the earthquake left his building relatively 
undamaged, it shook up the engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Whoa, let's rethink this,' " McGillivray said. "All our 
structural and geological plans changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Predictable delays followed. Engineering firms were tied up with emergency 
evaluations and repairs and the Easy Street project didn't break ground until 
April. Thousands of additional rivets and welds went into the ceiling, and 
support pilings were driven much deeper into the ground than originally 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We even added a full sprinkler system in case a fire breaks out on the ice," 
McGillivray said wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the construction process, curious visitors flooded the rink, to a 
point where McGillivray had to stop giving tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were just streaming in and out of the building all day on Saturday and 
Sunday," McGillivray said this week. "One guy showed up with a whole van-load 
of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 McGillivray hopes the crowds grow even larger once his building opens. The 
popularity of roller-blading and on-ice stars such as Wayne Gretzky and Nancy 
Kerrigan has contributed to a youth hockey and figure-skating boom. McGillivray 
expects to enhance that growth locally with the Mariners' home schedule and the 
addition of Peter Caruthers, 1984 Olympic silver medalist, to the arena staff 
as a program consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Slinger, board member of the Thousand Oaks Thunder youth hockey 
organization, said membership has swelled from 76 players in 1984 to 525 this 
season. McGillivray, who founded the organization, said the Thunder is 
California's largest youth hockey program. 
</P>
<P>
 Local figure-skating organizers say their numbers have increased as well. And 
both groups agree that they owe McGillivray, both for keeping the Conejo Valley 
rink open for the past seven years and for creating a sparkling facility they 
say will increase skating participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the new rink will broaden our sport's exposure in the Tri-Valley 
area, especially for the younger skaters," said Nadine Starr-Graziano, a former 
competitive figure skater and a professional skating instructor for the past 
five years. "It's going to be a place for them to learn discipline and at the 
same time make friends." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be even more of an attraction near Easy and Madera once McGillivray 
turns the building adjacent to the new ice arena into a roller rink. 
Construction on that project is scheduled to begin in January and the rink will 
feature a plastic surface identical to those used in Roller Hockey 
International, the North American professional league. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who play on the streets want a nicer, more controlled environment 
that's truer in terms of skate control," McGillivray said. "We think one 
building will feed the other in terms of users." Easy Street Arena 
</P>
<P>
 When the Easy Street Arena opens in Simi Valley, it will be the only rink in 
California to have both Olympic and regulation-size ice sheets under the same 
roof. 
</P>
<P>
 The rinks will be open 17 to 19 hours a day for recreational and competitive 
use. It will be the home ice for the Ventura Mariners of the Western States 
Hockey League, a junior league kicking off its inaugural season this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-story facility will also be used for summer hockey camps, skating 
instruction and possibly figure skating competitions in the future. Rink Info

 A void was created in the Big Sky Conference last week, and Cal State 
Northridge may ultimately help fill it.

 Idaho and Boise State of the Big Sky have received preliminary clearance to 
defect to the NCAA Division I ranks. Northridge and fellow American West 
Conference members Cal State Sacramento and Southern Utah have expressed "real 
interest" to Big Sky members about joining their conference, Northridge 
Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State and Idaho, which will move to Division I from the I-AA Big Sky, 
could join the Big West Conference as soon as 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
 An NCAA ruling on the move is expected in a few months. Hiegert said Boise 
State and Idaho must receive exemptions from the NCAA regarding stadium size 
before the shuffle takes place. Neither school's home stadium meets minimum 
seating criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge would join the Big Sky in all sports, except men's and women's 
swimming, baseball, soccer, softball and men's volleyball. However, depending 
on the final composition of the Big Sky, these programs also could be included 
in the conference if enough new schools field those teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most respects, (the Big Sky) takes care of most of our problems," Hiegert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Northridge move of any sort likely will be contingent on the passage of a 
student referendum next month. Students will be asked to vote on a $49 increase 
in semester registration fees to underwrite the Matador athletic budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge and other AWC members last spring made inquiries about merging with 
the Big West, but officials said the conference was not in an expansion mode at 
the time. Last week, that changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland State, a Division II school, also has expressed interest in joining 
the Big Sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Boise State and Idaho, the Big Sky would consist of Eastern 
Washington, Idaho State, Montana, Montana State, Weber State and Northern 
Arizona. The NCAA requires a minimum of six teams for a conference to earn an 
automatic postseason berth, which means the Big Sky's margin for error could 
soon be nil. The AWC has no automatic berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could go with one big conference, or a north and south (division) or 
whatever," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The AWC membership could soon dwindle. Hiegert said Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 
the fourth member of the AWC, already has received an invitation to join the 
Big West, along with Boise, Idaho and North Texas State. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge's football, cross-country and track and field teams are in the AWC, 
the baseball and softball teams play in the Western Athletic Conference, and 
several other teams play in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. The men's 
basketball team competes as a Division I independent. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said Northridge also is in a wait-and-see posture regarding the Big 
West, which includes Cal State sister schools such as Long Beach State and 
Fullerton. The Big West also is shrinking -- Fresno State left the Big West for 
the WAC two years ago and Nevada Las Vegas and San Jose State are doing 
likewise in 1996-97. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Big West's long-range plans aren't clear and Northridge has no 
plans to tread water. What's more, discussions with the Big West haven't been 
as formal, Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Big West, for us, is probably the closest fit," Hiegert said. "But we 
need to get our house in order and do what we need to do."

FALLING INTO LINE; SMITH ADDING HIS NAME TO LIST OF KENNEDY'S STANDOUT 
TAILBACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kennedy High tailback Antwane Smith didn't exactly welcome a break from a 
grueling practice in scorching heat earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When his coach called him over to talk to a reporter, not even the mask of his 
brown football helmet could hide the distress on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a quiet and shy kid," Kennedy Coach Bob Francola said. "The publicity 
has made him nervous. He's really feeling the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 But Francola warned Smith long ago: If you play tailback at Kennedy, you get a 
lot of attention. After all, the team's offense is known as "tailback delight." 
</P>
<P>
 The position has been a springboard to Division I colleges in past years. 
Those who have earned scholarships include Ontiwaun Carter, Arizona's 
All-American candidate, Edwin Jones (Iowa State), Ron Hardy (Oregon), Elijah 
Raphael (Washington State) and Donte Scarbrough (San Jose State). 
</P>
<P>
 At Kennedy, the tailback racks up big numbers and becomes the obsession of the 
opposing team's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 How does a reserved 16-year-old junior, in his second season of varsity 
football, handle it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I just try to block it all out," Smith said. "I mean I walk around school and 
people say, 'You're the big man on campus. You are a superstar.' Of course I 
feel the pressure of it all, but I gotta ignore that and focus." 
</P>
<P>
 So far so good. 
</P>
<P>
 In three games, Smith has carried the ball 50 times for 473 yards, which ranks 
second in the area among City Section players. He also has 11 receptions for 
107 yards and is the leading scorer among the Valley's City Section players 
with 56 points on nine touchdowns and a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5-foot-9 and 170 pounds, Smith is smaller than most of Kennedy's previous 
backs but just as good, according to Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman. "I think he's 
thinner than most of the backs they've had there but he still has the same 
technique," Engilman said. "His cutback is great and he shifts well. He's real 
tough and he's just a damn good runner." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy lost its opener, 16-14, to the top-ranked Spartans but Smith had a 
63-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that made the loss a bit easier to 
take. The Golden Cougars will take a 2-1 record into tonight's North Valley 
League opener against neighborhood rival Granada Hills (1-2).  
</P>
<P>
 Smith says the pregame jitters that struck before the opener have faded and 
will not be around before tonight's showdown at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very nervous against Sylmar," Smith said. "There was a lot of hype and 
people wanted to see who the next Kennedy tailback would be and can he live up 
to the tradition? It was nerve-racking." 
</P>
<P>
 Not as much as his sophomore season, though. Smith was moved to receiver 
because senior Scarbrough started at tailback. Smith had 23 catches for 352 
yards and two touchdowns but disliked the position and counted the days until 
the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he began playing Pop Warner football at the age of 7, Smith had always 
been a running back and the switch was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought, 'He's crazy!' " Smith said of Francola. "I had never even 
caught a ball. It was real strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Francola made Smith a receiver because Scarbrough was the team's key rusher, 
but Smith was too good to sit on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the Golden Cougars pitch the ball on most running plays so running 
backs need good hands. "You can't be a '90s tailback and be one-dimensional," 
Francola said. "You have to train with weights, you have to block and you have 
to be able to catch the ball. Antwane didn't do any of that when he came in." 
</P>
<P>
 Things have changed. Not that Smith is a natural at catching the ball, but he 
can hold his own. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also in better shape than last year and says he feels stronger, thanks to 
an intense weight-training program in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 Francola believes Smith will follow his predecessors and receive a Division I 
college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some may say he's too small, but he makes up for it with speed," Francola 
said. "He has the same acceleration that all my great backs have had. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time he gets out of here, he'll be twice as strong as he is now 
without losing any quickness and he'll be tougher." 
</P>
<P>
 And Smith probably will be more comfortable with the high profile of a Kennedy 
tailback.

FLANDERS' TEST LANDS LUKAS IN HOT WATER 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William T. Young's Flanders, undefeated in three starts and a leading 
contender for 2-year-old filly divisional honors, produced a urine sample that 
tested positive for Isoxurpine, a vaso-dilator used to improve circulation in 
the foot, after her victory in Belmont Park's Grade I Matron Stakes on Sept. 
17. The drug may be used, but only up to 36 hours before a race. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a successful appeal, the filly will be disqualified from the Matron's 
winner's share of $64,740. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, trainer D. Wayne Lukas faces a 45-day suspension that would 
become 60 days if his appeal is thrown out. Lukas is pinning his hopes for a 
successful appeal on the outcome of a test of a sample of the urine that was 
sent to another lab. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York State Racing and Wagering Board has not set a date for the appeal 
hearing and Lukas can work until its heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his barn at Churchill Downs, Lukas was puzzled. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't get any medication," he said. "She doesn't need any the way she 
runs."

'AND DID YOU TRY FINDING A JOB LAST WEEK, MR. BONILLA?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Mattingly on the dole? 
</P>
<P>
 It could happen in New York, the only state where striking major league 
baseball players will become eligible for unemployment benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But a state senator said Thursday he will introduce a bill next year that 
would prohibit striking players from receiving benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "New York must be the land of milk and honey," said state Sen. Joseph Holland. 
"It is the only place where you can make millions of dollars playing a game, 
ask for more money and get unemployment benefits while you strike." 
</P>
<P>
 New York is one of only two states that provide unemployment benefits to 
strikers -- baseball or otherwise. Rhode Island is the other, but it doesn't 
have any major league teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Strikers become eligible for benefits eight weeks after a work stoppage, so 
Bobby Bonilla, Paul O'Neill and the rest of the New York Mets and Yankees can 
sign up for benefits at their local unemployment office starting Oct. 7. The 
strike began Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits are based on half an employee's weekly salary up to $300, state Labor 
Department spokeswoman Kathy Do said. Other team employees affected by the 
strike, such as batboys and ticket takers, can also receive benefits for as 
long as 26 weeks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Do said she could not comment on whether the Labor Department has had any 
inquiries from ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole strike has been about one thing -- greed," Holland said. "The real 
victims of the strike are the people whose livelihood is dependent on 
baseball."

HAVE TALENT, WILL TRAVEL; CHARTER OAK RUNNING BACK MICHAEL GRAHAM HAS PLAYED AT 
THREE SCHOOLS IN THREE SEASONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The marketing of an NCAA Division I prospect is no small matter, as the 
supporting cast in the Michael Graham Family Tailback Tour can testify. 
</P>
<P>
 With an eye toward their son's future in college football and beyond, Graham's 
parents, Leanzo and Lucinda, have packed the family's belongings and moved four 
times in the last two years in a quest to find an offense to showcase Michael's 
running skills. A junior, he is attending his fourth high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Transferring for purely athletic reasons is generally discouraged in high 
school sports. The Grahams, however, follow their own plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents do what is best for me," said Graham, 16. 
</P>
<P>
 But problems arose at each of the much-publicized first two stops -- Santa Ana 
Mater Dei and Huntington Beach Edison. Michael had difficulty adjusting; his 
parents say they encountered hostility from the parents of some of his 
teammates, and they left at least one skeptical coach, Edison's Dave White, in 
their wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the family decided that it was time to swing the road show around and 
head home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our only child, so we were trying to do the best thing for him," Leanzo 
said. "You do what you think is best. Sometimes it's not." 
</P>
<P>
 The Grahams lived with relatives in Pasadena over the summer while scouting 
for a program in the San Gabriel Valley, where Michael grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 They recently moved to Glendora so Michael, 5 feet 10 and 195 pounds, could 
play at Covina Charter Oak, a much smaller school with a lower-profile program 
than the previous two. It is like a homecoming for Graham, and his parents say 
it is the final stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many people who had their hands on him. . . . There were too 
many people involved in his future," Leanzo said. "So what I decided was, once 
we got out of Edison, we're going back home to the San Gabriel Valley, and I'm 
going to let (Michael) be a kid, because he hadn't got a chance to be a kid. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the time he was in eighth grade, it was, like, Mike Graham the athlete, 
and as a father, I probably put too much emphasis on it, myself. So, I decided 
(Michael) needs to grow up . . . and be like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Farrar, Charter Oak coach, got angry when a reporter went to the school 
recently to interview Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just came here to go to school and be with his friends and family," Farrar 
said. "We don't want to make any bigger a deal of it than that. I just want to 
see him have a chance to be a student who can concentrate on his studies and be 
a regular kid." 
</P>
<P>
 The hitch, of course, is that Graham is not a regular kid. His talent sets him 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Grahams started scouting high school football programs during Michael's 
eighth-grade year at Duarte Northview middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Michael wanted to stay in the San Gabriel Valley, Leanzo decided that 
his son would get the most exposure under Coach Bruce Rollinson at Mater Dei, a 
perennial parochial powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 During Graham's freshman year, he commuted to Mater Dei each day from Duarte, 
a 45-minute trip. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rollinson strolled over to freshman football practice that fall and 
watched Graham play, he was ecstatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had a real talent," Rollinson said. "He has explosive speed and 
great balance, and there's a characteristic in a running back that they know 
where the problems are going to come from before they happen and they get away 
from it. Some people call it vision." 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of displaying that vision for the Monarch varsity during 
Michael's sophomore year, the Grahams moved to Costa Mesa to be closer to the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham's varsity debut was eagerly awaited by the media, and Graham apparently 
believed the hype. After gaining 107 yards in 17 carries in a 21-0 victory over 
Anaheim Servite, he told a reporter, "I should have had 150 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Such cockiness did not endear Graham to his teammates. And Rollinson said that 
Graham's tendency to showboat went against team rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want enthusiasm and excitement, and we don't want anyone to draw attention 
to themselves," Rollinson said. "Michael held that in check, but I think it was 
hard for him. It was in his personality." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham also began having other troubles. He sat out several days of practice 
because he was upset after one of his closest friends left school. Rollinson 
benched him for the first half of a game against La Canada St. Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no real big problems, but just a small series of infractions," 
Rollinson said. "As the season wore on, I just think the boy was unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Grahams said that they received threatening, racist mail. They believe 
that the letters came from parents of Michael's Mater Dei teammates, who they 
suspect were jealous of the attention Michael was receiving. Michael is black 
and Mater Dei is a predominantly white school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grahams told Rollinson about the letters, but there was little the coach 
could do. 
</P>
<P>
 After four games, in which Graham gained 560 yards rushing and scored six 
touchdowns, Rollinson and the Grahams decided a transfer would be best for all 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Football, of course, would remain in the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't come all the way down there for him to play in four games and then 
he didn't play football anymore," Leanzo said. "I knew I wanted him to at least 
finish the football season." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Grahams got out their scouting notebooks once again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and my dad got together and we listed . . . a couple schools I would go to 
and it was Edison, Fountain Valley and a couple City schools," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main consideration was each team's offensive line -- "If they had a nice 
offensive line, how big the offensive line was," Michael said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't care if they were juniors or seniors because I didn't plan on 
staying anyway. It was just to finish up the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison was the choice and Graham played six games there, gaining about 900 
yards rushing, scoring 14 touchdowns and leading the Chargers to the Southern 
Section Division II quarterfinals, where they lost to Los Alamitos, 34-8. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the hype surrounding Graham and because of his unusual 
mobility, so to speak, Graham's eligibility has been scrutinized by many. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a high-profile kid like that, everyone is going to check," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the transfers to Edison and to Charter Oak, within eight months, the 
CIF Southern Section has no problem with them. The CIF rule at the time allowed 
eligibility immediately after such transfers as long as the family had moved 
into the new school district, and the Grahams always followed that guideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Graham's transfers, however, his grades have come under scrutiny. He 
was on academic probation when he arrived at Edison. He needed to raise his 
grades to be eligible for track in the spring. Graham had won the South Coast 
League 100- and 200-meter sprints as a freshman at Mater Dei, but never got off 
academic probation at Edison and was declared ineligible for spring 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 So Graham transferred again, to Valley Vista continuation school in Fountain 
Valley for the spring semester, where he raised his grades enough to become 
eligible for football this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 His academic problems were a source of frustration for White, Edison's 
football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a tendency to be a little lazy, and he wasn't going to his classes 
like he should have," White said. "I wasn't so much angry at him as it was that 
I knew that was going to hurt him in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Graham agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Michael) didn't take care of academics like he should," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leanzo said that Michael learned his lesson by being ineligible last spring 
and that he had worked hard to regain his eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling you, this kid has come a long way," the elder Graham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter Oak (3-0), which plays a nonleague game against Glendora at Citrus 
College tonight at 7:30, has reaped the benefits. Graham has gained 421 yards 
and scored seven touchdowns in 48 carries.  
</P>
<P>
 But skeptics remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were problems at the first school and problems at the second school and 
there will probably be problems at the third school," White said.

FULLERTON, ANAHEIM OFFICIALS DENY SECTION ENDORSEMENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cynthia Grennan, superintendent of the Anaheim Union High School District, and 
Ken Jones, superintendent of the Fullerton district, denied Thursday they have 
agreed to endorse an Orange County high school athletic section. 
</P>
<P>
 Grennan said the district remains neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Anaheim Union High School District has continued to not take a position," 
Grennan said. "That was our position as of Sept. 29 and it has not changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Andrews, superintendent of the Tustin Unified School District, said 
Wednesday that the Anaheim and Fullerton districts had agreed to join a county 
section. The county's other 13 districts have passed resolutions to support the 
new section. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews spoke at a meeting involving the Southern Section executive committee 
and members of the steering committee attempting to form a county section. 
</P>
<P>
 Grennan and Jones have said they would wait to make a decision until the State 
Strategic Planning committee finished its report. That report has not been 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no position," Jones said. "We're waiting for the state to finish to 
see what a section would look like and what the governance would be." CHRIS

MCGILLIVRAY BUILDING ON PASSION FOR HOCKEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sean McGillivray's involvement in hockey has been a coast-to-coast affair. 
</P>
<P>
 From a youth spent on skates in Nova Scotia to planning and developing the new 
Easy Street Arena in Simi Valley, McGillivray has had a love for the game and a 
desire to spread that passion to others. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I want to be involved with him," said Michigan Tech University 
Coach Bob Mancini, who plans to run a series of summer hockey camps at the 
arena next summer. "Sean's driven, he has a fantastic work ethic and he cares 
about the kids he works with. I was impressed immediately by both those 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 McGillivray, who lives with his wife and two hockey-playing sons in Thousand 
Oaks, was raised in Sydney, Nova Scotia, and played hockey with several 
classmates who eventually made National Hockey League rosters.

 "My grandmother put me on skates when I was 4 and after that I used to walk 
over the snow to the pond with my skates on and come home at night just dead 
tired," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he finished the Canadian equivalent of high school and graduated from 
Xavier College in Sydney, McGillivray found a real estate promotion job in 
Detroit and moved with the company to San Diego in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, his younger brother Bernie came west to attend college, 
and the McGillivrays got back on blades after discovering that late-night ice 
time could be had at a nearby rink. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years later, the hockey bug followed McGillivray up the coast to Los 
Angeles where he played in late-night adult leagues, organized the Thousand 
Oaks Thunder, a youth ice hockey program, and served as coach of the club team 
at Pierce College in 1983-84 and at Pepperdine from 1989-92. McGillivray, 49, 
said the Thousand Oaks Thunder is now the largest youth-hockey program in 
California with more than 500 players and 100 coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not just a great administrator, he's a great hockey strategist and I 
consider myself a student of his," said John Arbuckle, a Thousand Oaks Thunder 
coach. "He's put a system in place and kept it going so that the kids don't 
have to start over when they move up from team to team." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, with the Conejo Valley Ice Rink in Newbury Park on the verge of 
shutting down, McGillivray led a community protest and eventually assumed rent 
payments on the rink through his financial planning business in Thousand Oaks. 
The costs and the rink's poor facilities led McGillivray to launch plans for a 
new arena and to search for a suitable site. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with his $3.5-million Easy Street complex nearing completion, McGillivray 
sees his favorite cold-weather sport beginning to blossom in the heat of 
Southern California. The future for ice hockey has never looked brighter, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are kids playing roller hockey by the thousands. They have games on 
cul-de-sacs and you see 'em walking around town with their sticks and blades. 
It's a replacement for the ponds we grew up on in Canada, but the kids want a 
taste of the real thing. They want to play on ice."

PLAN PROMOTES HUNTING IN COAL CANYON; LAND USE: STATE CITES RECREATIONAL 
OPPORTUNITIES. LOCAL ENVIRONMENTALISTS FEAR ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A state Fish and Game Commission plan to promote hunting in Coal Canyon has 
sparked bitter debate between environmentalists and sportsmen over the wildlife 
living in the dry, rugged hills here. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to designate the area an ecological reserve and allow hunting 
with bows and shotguns is supported by local hunters and Fish and Game 
officials, who say it would provide recreational opportunities without 
significantly reducing the wildlife population. The plan is scheduled to come 
before the commission Oct. 7 at its meeting in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the department's mandates is to provide recreational hunting use of 
its lands wherever that activity does not impact the biological resources we 
are protecting," said Bonnie Turner, land acquisition and management 
coordinator for the state Fish and Game Department. "The department has always 
tried to promote hunting and fishing on its lands because there is so little 
opportunity to do that on private lands." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side are local environmentalists and the Orange County Harbors, 
Beaches and Parks Commission, which this week adopted a resolution urging the 
state to disallow hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the need to keep the area open for hikers and nature study groups," 
said Gordon Ruser, a spokesman for the Angeles chapter of the Sierra Club, 
which worked for the county resolution. "Hunting would deter people from going 
there just to look at the plants and the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunting is not specifically prohibited in Coal Canyon now, state officials 
note. But few hunters ever go there because it is relatively unknown and 
difficult to enter. Opponents argue that designating the area an ecological 
reserve open for hunting would bring in a swarm of hunters, attracted by its 
listing as a hunting area in Fish and Game publications. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's advertised in state publications, we would expect the hunting to 
increase," Ruser said. "There are some species there that we feel would be 
jeopardized by the influx of hunting." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy is partially rooted in the way the land was acquired. Owned 
previously by private developers, the 952 acres near the Riverside Freeway in 
the northeast portion of the county was purchased by the state in 1991 with $4 
million in bond money from Prop. 70, the California Wildlife, Coastal and Park 
Land Conservation Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, which was approved in 1988, allowed the acquisition of open 
lands. Those opposed to hunting point out that none of the money came from 
hunting license fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game officials, however, argue that hunting in the reserve is 
consistent with the traditional use of the areas next to it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hunting is a historical activity in this area," said John Anderson, a senior 
biologist with the department. "The reserve is directly adjacent to the 
Cleveland National Forest where hunting is allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had our biologists and plant ecologists on the site and their 
recommendation is that hunting will not have an adverse effect on the wildlife 
(populations) there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bob Hamilton, executive officer of the county Harbors, Beaches and Parks 
Commission, said, "There is concern that in the absence of any evidence of an 
overpopulation of animals, that there is no justification for encouraging or 
allowing hunting."  
</P>
<P>
 The department's original proposal was to allow hunting in the reserve. After 
several anti-hunting comments during a public hearing last month, however, 
Anderson revised the recommendation to allow hunters to kill only smaller 
animals such as rabbits and birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation now under consideration would also prohibit the use of 
pistols and most rifles, limiting hunters to bows and shotguns, which have a 
much shorter range. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game commissioners will take public comment and could make a decision 
Oct. 7.

TRANSIENT QUIZZED IN LAGUNA FIRE; INVESTIGATION: MAN MIGHT BE A SUSPECT OR HAVE 
USEFUL INFORMATION, POLICE SAY. HE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH SETTING THREE RECENT 
FIRES IN FULLERTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A transient charged with setting three fires in Fullerton is being questioned 
in connection with the October, 1993, arson fire that devastated much of Laguna 
Beach, law enforcement sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Martinez, 26, a Mexican national, was arrested Sept. 16 crouching 
alongside a set fire in the 1100 block of North Lemon Street by people who 
rushed to put out the blaze and held him for authorities, said Fullerton city 
spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer Mudrick. 
</P>
<P>
 "After his arrest, he indicated some knowledge of other fires in the county, 
and the case was then referred to the Orange County district attorney's office 
and Orange County Fire (Department) for further investigation," Mudrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Fire Department Capt. Dan Young said authorities immediately 
began to suspect that Martinez might have been involved in other fires because 
of his activities on Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have someone who has started more than one fire, you take a look 
at it," Young said. "Right now, we are working together with the district 
attorney's office to see if we can tie him to the Laguna Beach, the Green River 
fire or any other fires." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources said late Thursday that Martinez might be a suspect in 
the Laguna Beach arson -- the county's worst fire -- or a source for 
information about who might have set the blaze, or might have information 
useful to investigators still trying to solve the arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mudrick refused to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not in our hands now and that's all we can say at this time," 
Mudrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maurice Evans also declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Councilman Robert F. Gentry said he has not given up hope that 
the arsonist who started the Oct. 27, 1993, blaze, which destroyed or damaged 
more than 400 homes and caused an estimated $400 million in damage, someday 
will be brought to justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be one of the most thrilling moments of my life to be able to 
determine we have found a perpetrator of this horrible crime," Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
 One year later, beleaguered residents are still struggling to rebuild their 
lives and homes destroyed in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton, three small fires were set near an apartment building on North 
Lemon Street on Sept. 16. Fire officials put out the first blaze, and people 
working at North Orange County Community College District offices put out the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 College district workers then noticed a third blaze starting up, and 
discovered Martinez as they rushed to extinguish it, Mudrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time they found the man crouched beside the fire watching it," Mudrick 
said. "They grabbed him and held him until the police and fire officials 
arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez had a hunting knife on his person but did not resist arrest, Mudrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is being held at the Orange County Jail.

THE NIXON TAPES; MUSEUM DOCENT RECORDS HISTORY FROM BEHIND LENS OF WNIX VIDEO 
CAMERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If it happens at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace, Jo Lyons has it on 
tape. Er, videotape that is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Yorba Linda resident is the watchful eye behind WNIX, the library's 
official video chronicler of events. A docent volunteer, Lyons has filmed 
everyone from heads of states to Arnold Schwarzenegger; sometimes while 
jostling for position with her hand-held videocam against big league camera 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The networks' cameras look like they weigh 100 pounds, and the guys are big 
too," said Lyons, 56, who is five feet tall. "It can be intimidating when you 
get into the fray. But they treat me like an equal." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the library opened in July, 1990, Lyons has amassed a collection of 80 
two-hour videotapes recording the visits of such notables as Dan Quayle, Jack 
Kemp, Barbara Bush and even Mickey Mouse. The videos, which Lyons edits as 
well, help preserve the library's history and are stored in its archives. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's created an indispensable record of scores of events at the library that 
will certainly be of interest to historians," said Library Director John H. 
Taylor. "Jo has emerged as the (library's) historian and the enforcer of 
historical accuracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons' coverage of Pat Nixon's funeral in 1993 is her most significant 
contribution to the library's video archive. Amid a swarm of TV reporters, 
Lyons maneuvered for her shots, while controlling her personal grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very emotional," said Lyons, the only docent attending the services 
because of limited seating. "I remember being there in person when the Marine 
honor guard brought in the casket to the platform and the six soldiers raised 
it slightly and just held it there -- so steady. You could hear the gasp in the 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives you goose bumps when you see the video," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, when the former President died, Lyons decided against covering the 
international event. Instead, she assembled a tape from other newscasts for the 
library archives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heavy crowds prevent a lot of good shots," said Lyons. "I felt the network 
coverage would probably be better than what I could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Lyons' video work is far from such madding crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's speech by television commentator Bruce Herschensohn, which attracted 
about 100 library guests, is more typical. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons required only a few minutes to set up her camera, with the "WNIX" 
insignia pasted to it. She perched the camera on a tripod, focused, and hit 
record for the address. To complete the segment, Lyons shot Herschensohn's 
book-signing in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 visit of Jihan Sadat, the wife of assassinated Egyptian leader Anwar 
Sadat, is one of Lyons' favorites. Lyons poignantly recalled filming Sadat as 
she stood beside the library's statue of her fallen husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wondered what was going through her mind at the time," said Lyons. "She 
really kept her cool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Sadat was so warm and genuine. She was so approachable, she would listen 
to you and talk. She didn't brush people off." 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatically, Lyons declines to say if other library guests have given WNIX 
the brushoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotapes she compiles are primarily viewed by the library's 124 docents, 
who use them to familiarize themselves with the place's major events. 
Apparently, the most frequently requested videos, which volunteers can check 
out for up to two weeks, are the funeral tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The docents who were unable to attend can watch the tapes," said Norma Jean 
Infante, 60, a volunteer from Anaheim Hills. "They're a wonderful treasure." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her limited camera training, Lyons acknowledges that the entire 
video collection isn't exactly ready for theatrical release. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's quite a few fuzzy tapes," Lyons said. "You can trip on the tripod or 
shake the camera. On some tapes, it looks like an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 The former President, who requested several videos be sent to him when he 
lived in New Jersey, never complained about the quality of her videos. Nixon 
was especially fond of Lyons' tape featuring a room-by-room birthplace tour -- 
all with Nixon's own narration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed hearing my own tour," Nixon wrote to Lyons in a thank-you note. 
</P>
<P>
 Though she filmed him numerous times, Lyons met Nixon only once. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1992, Lyons presented the Yorba Linda native with a dollhouse replica 
of his first home. The miniature, which represented 200 hours of careful labor 
by Lyons, is on display in the library's lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first he didn't say anything because I think he was stunned," Lyons said. 
"He just kept walking around and around. Then, he whispered, 'This is 
wonderful.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, WNIX was there for her dollhouse presentation. It's just someone 
else was behind the lens for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not WNIX," said Lyons. "The camera is."

READERS' IRE SPURS EDITOR'S RESIGNATION AT NGUOI VIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The editor of the Nguoi Viet Daily News, the largest Vietnamese-language daily 
outside of Vietnam, has resigned his position after comments he made prompted 
some readers to call for a boycott of the publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Yen Do, who helped found the Westminster-based paper in 1978, stepped down as 
editor in chief on Monday, but will remain the paper's publisher, a spokesman 
for the paper said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Do, 53, came under fire from some of the readers for defending Co Pham, a 
local doctor and president of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, who favors 
trade with Vietnam. Do dismissed the criticism against Pham, saying it came 
from competing doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Do's comments, which were printed in a New York Times article on Sept. 12, 
enraged many of his paper's readers, who are deeply divided on the issue of the 
United States normalizing relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 200 people demonstrated outside the Nguoi Viet Daily News office on 
Saturday to protest Do's statements and call for his resignation. Hours 
earlier, nearly 1,000 people had demonstrated outside Pham's medical office. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham has become a target of conservatives in the local Vietnamese community 
because he has organized a group of business leaders and investors who are 
leaving today on a trade mission to Vietnam. The group hopes to promote 
"goodwill between the United States and Vietnam," foster ties between American 
entrepreneurs and Vietnamese officials, and explore potential business 
opportunities, according to a brochure on the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Pham nor Do could be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 An itinerary of the trip describes the group's 10-day mission to investigate 
trade opportunities in the Communist-led country. During the trip, the group is 
tentatively scheduled to meet with various heads of state, including President 
Le Duc Anh, General Secretary Do Muoi, Premier Vo Van Kiet, Deputy Premier Phan 
Van Khai and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will travel to Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi, and also meet with 
tourism, banking and manufacturing officials, according to the itinerary. The 
delegation will return Oct. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham has declined to release details of the trip because the business people 
and investors participating fear a backlash.  
</P>
<P>
 The paper's production manager, Nguyen Co, has been appointed to replace Do as 
editor. Nguyen has been with the paper for five years and was instrumental in 
helping to computerize its operations.  
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, he said Do's comments in the New York Times did not reflect the 
views of his paper, adding that it will not take a position on the issue of 
normalizing ties with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a paper we like to express all views," Nguyen said. "We are a forum for 
democratic expression of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the paper serves "a very complicated mixture of people with 
different views and attitudes toward Vietnamese issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen said Do, as publisher, will be in charge of management and policy 
issues but not editorial content of the paper.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; DISTRICT OKS PROGRAM TO HELP 
ADOLESCENTS 
</P>

<P>
 The Capistrano Unified School District board has approved a program that aims 
to help seventh-grade students better navigate adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees on Monday accepted a one-year pilot known as Quest, which will be 
added to the social science curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also covers communications, self-confidence, managing emotions, 
drug avoidance and goal-setting. 
</P>
<P>
 A district administrator said the program is unique because it seeks parental 
involvement in students' homework assignment and school activities. The program 
also focuses on strengthening students' relationships with parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara F. Smith, assistant superintendent of instructional services, said 
that a handbook, which is part of the program, is available for parents to 
check out or buy at the district's cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The book explains the physiological and psychological changes that adolescents 
go through. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said that the Quest curriculum will be covered during eight-week 
segments of social science classes. Teachers have already been trained in the 
Quest curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would almost call it character education," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than take the approach to drug use of "Just Say No," the curriculum 
encourages students to avoid negative peer pressure, and to consider themselves 
in a positive light. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first year of the pilot program, the district plans to consider 
expanding the curriculum to the sixth and eighth grades. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; LAWSUIT SAYS CHEMICALS FROM EX-DUMP SICKEN 
NEIGHBORS

 Two residents of an apartment complex across the street from a 
landfill-turned-golf course are suing the county and others, alleging that 
chemicals from the former dump are making them sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian P. Pedziwiatr and Richard Benenson, residents of Park West Apartments, 
are seeking unspecified damages in the negligence suit filed earlier this week 
in Orange County Superior Court.The suit names the county, the Irvine Co., 
American Golf Inc., Rancho San Joaquin Golf Course, Park West Apartments and 
Irvine Apartment Communities as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents allege that through negligence, chemicals used for such things 
as paint remover and fire extinguishers have been released from the former 
dump. The residents say they have suffered afflictions including headaches, 
rashes, sinus irritation, memory loss, low-grade fever, thyroid problems and 
emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 The county operated the landfill in the early 1960s. The golf course, bordered 
by Michaelson, Culver and University drives and Harvard Avenue, was built in 
the mid-1970s after the landfill was closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy County Counsel Geoffrey Hunt said the old landfill is monitored as 
required by such agencies as the Integrated Waste Management Board and South 
Coast Air Quality Management District, and that he is not aware of any problems 
with the site. ANNA CEKOLA

 More than 1,800 children and teen-agers -- some sightless, others physically 
disabled or underprivileged -- are expected to take part in a hands-on "Sensory 
Safari" Saturday designed to increase their awareness of North American and 
African wildlife. 
</P>

museum-quality animal exhibits. The county Environmental Management Agency, the 
state Fish and Game Department, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Department and a 
taxidermist from Fullerton will provide the exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a hayride at this second annual event, plus souvenirs, a 
lunch and appearances by Disney characters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California chapters of Safari Club International -- a nonprofit

<P>
 Plans for a combination gas station, tuneup shop and carwash were scrubbed by 
the City Council on Tuesday night after nearly 75 residents packed council 
chambers in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Joel Burnstine maintained his project's design would actually reduce 
the amount of noise and nighttime light to neighbors of the 1.7-acre lot on the 
southwest corner of Michelson and Culver drives.There is now a gas station at 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members voted 4-0 against the project, overruling the city 
Planning Commission, which had unanimously approved the project on Aug. 4. 
Councilman Barry J. Hammond abstained from voting, citing potential conflict of 
interest because his business involves the service station industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The council vote came after more than an hour of angry comments from residents 
of nearby condominiums and townhomes who said the proposed business was too 
large for the lot and would increase noise and traffic. City planners 
previously granted Burnstine an exemption from new zoning laws in the 
University Park neighborhood that would have required a four-acre lot for his 
proposed business. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they start that kind of density in Irvine, it's all over," said homeowner 
Joe Patrick. "Once you set that kind of precedent, you cannot stop it." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Greg Smith, who brought the residents' appeal to the council, 
acknowledged that Burnstine had gone to "some fairly incredible lengths" to 
modify his plan to satisfy nearby residents. But residents at the meeting were 
in no mood for compromise, reacting loudly to Burnstine's presentation. RUSS

 An Irvine man apparently fleeing police was struck by two cars and killed 
Wednesday night as he ran across the Santa Ana Freeway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael J. Castenada, 19, ran when police arrived at a gas station on Trabuco 
Road near the freeway after the attendant reported about 10 p.m. that an 
apparently drunk man was loitering and bothering customers, Irvine police Lt. 
Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as he saw the police car, he took off," Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castenada, who lived in an apartment building near the Shell station, dashed 
up the Culver Drive on-ramp and across the northbound lanes of the freeway, 
police said. He was struck by two cars as he crossed the southbound lanes, 
Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drivers were not injured or cited, California Highway Patrol spokeswoman 
Angel Johnson said. KEN ELLINGWOOD

<P>
 The Salvation Army will open its 16th Orange County thrift store here 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have everything," said Maj. Oliver Stenvick, administrator of the 
Salvation Army's Orange County Adult Rehabilitation Center."You never know 
what's going to be put out. It's not predictable like a normal store." 
</P>
<P>
 Books, bar stools, a portable fireplace, TVs, sofas and wine racks are among 
bargains to be found at the new store at 17362 Beach Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 300 people are expected to be lined up for the store's grand opening 
at 10 a.m. Saturday, Stenvick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Store hours will be 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday. The store will 
also be open this Sunday as part of the grand opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrift stores benefit the Adult Rehabilitation Center in Anaheim, which offers 
a six-month residential program for men trying to overcome alcoholism or other 
substance abuse.  
</P>
<P>
 The rehabilitation program, which includes counseling and therapy, serves 
about 400 men a year, with 140 in the program at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not charge," Stenvick said. "Those who come to us have lost all their 
resources through abuse. When they come to us, they need help without having to 
pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Community donations are vital to the survival of the thrift stores and the 
rehabilitation program, Stenvick said. Although the new store is stocked for 
the grand opening, donations of goods and clothing are always needed: "We have 
to scratch all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Stenvick said 30 trucks make pickups at homes and businesses across the 
county. There are also 10 donation trailers in the county, one of them at the 
Huntington Beach store. It will be open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. DEBRA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; JURY CONVICTS PHYSICIAN IN FIRST OF 20 
INSURANCE STING CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Santa Ana physician was convicted Thursday of automobile insurance fraud 
from evidence collected in a wide-ranging sting operation by the Orange County 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury found Dr. David Tran guilty of conspiracy 
to commit insurance fraud, grand theft and three counts of insurance fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Robert S. Pike Jr., said his client will appeal the verdict, which 
could result in his getting up to seven years in prison. His sentencing is 
scheduled for Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran's jury verdict before Judge Jack Ryan was the first conviction of 20 
defendants, including seven physicians, a chiropractor and a licensed physical 
therapist, whose arrests in February stemmed from a district attorney's 
undercover investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 From July, 1992, to December, 1993, the district attorney set up a phony law 
office in Costa Mesa and sent out flyers soliciting personal injury cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Lubinski said Tran Medical Office was one of nine 
separate medical offices that offered the undercover investigators kickbacks 
for business referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubinski said three undercover officers who posed as auto accident victims 
went to Tran, who listened to their complaints and allegedly helped to 
"embellish" them.  
</P>
<P>
 He said Tran billed each patient for four examinations, but actually provided 
only one exam lasting one to three minutes. Tran also billed for large numbers 
of phony physical therapy sessions, he said. "He billed to the tune of $9,000 
for all of this," Lubinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He prepared fraudulent reports and billings and coached undercover officers 
what they should say if they were asked," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Pike argued that a part-time clerical employee in Tran's office, Florita 
Interior of Irvine, had offered the kickbacks and altered Tran's medical 
records without his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubinski said Interior has disappeared, and there is a bench warrant for her 
arrest. LESLIE BERKMAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; 5% WATER RATE HIKE ON TAP FOR RESIDENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents soon will pay more for water. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members on Monday gave finance officials permission to prepare a 
water rate increase of 5% for both flat and per-gallon rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the city's 18,000 water customers will see their flat rate go from $9 
every two months to $9.45. The 93 cents they pay for every 1,000 gallons will 
go up to 98 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the increase, Buena Park will have among the lowest rates in the 
county, Finance Director Greg Beaubien said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital improvement projects and regular maintenance are causing the 
increases, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are digging two new wells that will reduce the city's dependence on 
outside agencies and should save money, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Formal approval of the increase is tentatively scheduled for the Oct. 17 
regular meeting of the council at 6650 Beach Blvd. LESLEY WRIGHT

<P>
 Selling Halloween pumpkins and Christmas trees will be allowed only on certain 
dates under an ordinance tentatively approved by the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also provides that vendors must obtain, in addition to a 
business license, a $75 permit to sell the seasonal items.Pumpkins may be sold 
from Saturday to Oct. 31 and Christmas trees from the day after Thanksgiving to 
Dec. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit groups are exempt from paying for the permit, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community development director Elizabeth Binsack said the ordinance will 
enable the Planning Department to process permit applications on time and apply 
consistent standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The $75 fee, the same amount currently charged, allows the permit holder to 
sell both pumpkins and Christmas trees in the same year.BERT ELJERA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; RESIDENTS PROTEST NOISE FROM RAILROAD TRACKS

<P>
 About 50 residents who live near a set of railroad tracks picketed City Hall 
this week, urging the City Council to pay for a sound wall to protect their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents complained Tuesday that since a second railway line opened in 
January, their lives have been made miserable by train noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Wright, whose home on Northfield Avenue is about 60 feet from the 
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railroad tracks, played a tape recording of trains 
passing her home at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's horrendous," said Wright. "Enough fooling around. I don't want to hear 
about studies anymore. We shouldn't have to live like that. No one should." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials told the protesters that the city will unveil its plan to manage 
the problem at a council meeting Oct. 4. Officials said Tuesday that they view 
train noise as a regional problem and that a solution should include county 
transportation authorities and other affected cities. 
</P>
<P>
 A sound wall for the Northfield Avenue residents could cost $1.5 million to $3 
million to construct, officials said. Mayor Tom Daly has said that the city 
cannot afford to pay for the wall by itself.MARTIN MILLER

 Police arrested four teen-agers Thursday, all believed to be members of an 
Asian gang, in connection with an attempted home-invasion robbery on Aug. 19 in 
Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The four, all Fullerton residents, were not identified because they are 
juveniles, ages 14 to 16. All were sent to Juvenile Hall pending further 
investigation and the filing of charges, said to Fullerton Detective Tom 
Basham. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery took place about 2:30 p.m. when four people, armed with knives and 
a rifle wrapped in a sack, kicked in the door and demanded cash from five 
teen-agers inside, police said. One of the victims was able to call 911, and 
the robbers fled empty-handed, police said. MARK PINSKY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CLERICAL, MAINTENANCE WORKERS GET 1.2% 
RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clerical and maintenance employees received a modest increase under a one-year 
contract the City Council unanimously approved this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1.2% increase is retroactive to Aug. 7 and will benefit eight clerical 
employees and 10 others who work in parks, street and building maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the contract, worked out after three months of negotiations, also provides 
for some reductions in employee benefits, including cutting in half the number 
of hours employees may be paid for jury duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Gerard Goedhart said that employees will be paid for 
only 40 hours of jury duty, instead of 80 hours as before, because "we don't 
want our employees being involved in lengthy trials." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll try to accommodate the legal system, but we don't want to create 
hardships in our organization," Goedhart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The contracts with both the clerical and public services employees run from 
Aug. 1, 1994, to July 30, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Goedhart said that negotiations with the 26-member Police Officers Assn., the 
biggest employee group, will begin in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, clerks and maintenance employees received a 2.4% salary increase in 
a similar one-year contract. BERT ELJERA

LOCAL ELECTIONS / BREA CITY COUNCIL; DEVELOPMENT, BUDGET KEY ISSUES FOR 
CANDIDATES; THE CONTENDERS -- TWO INCUMBENTS AND SIX CHALLENGERS -- ALSO STRESS 
ACCOUNTABILITY AMONG THE TOP OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerns about Brea's financial health, debates about the course of future 
development, and lingering ill will about the handling of the downtown 
redevelopment project are among the major issues in the Nov. 8 City Council 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Three council seats are being sought by two incumbents and six challengers. 
Councilman Carrey J. Nelson, who served during the most rancorous period of the 
50-acre redevelopment project, is not seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates include Mayor Glenn G. Parker, who was elected four years ago 
on a promise to finish the long-delayed downtown redevelopment project, which 
began in 1971. Parker has been in the council majority that has voted to 
acquire downtown property through the use of eminent domain. Construction of 
the new downtown development finally began in June, when ground was broken on a 
22-acre shopping center at Imperial Highway and Brea Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 If reelected, Parker said he would keep a close watch on the municipal budget 
and overall productivity at City Hall. Parker emphasized that he would not 
support cutting street deployment of police officers and firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41-year-old Parker owns Parkglen Community Management Inc., which provides 
management services to homeowner associations. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running for reelection is Councilman Burnie Dunlap, 51, who is the 
director of insurance services at Brea Community Hospital. He was elected to 
the council in November, 1990, and served as mayor in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap said one of the critical issues is finding ways to balance the city 
budget without adversely affecting the quality of life. Solutions, he said, 
include selling city services -- such as police or communication services -- to 
other communities, privatizing certain duties at City Hall and encouraging 
volunteer programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap also said he would encourage affordable housing projects. If more 
people are able to live and work in Brea, he said, traffic problems would be 
reduced and community involvement would be strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the six challengers in the race is Lynn Daucher, 48, who has served on 
the Brea Olinda Unified School District board for the past 13 years. If 
elected, Daucher said she would attempt to bring residents together and achieve 
a consensus about community issues. 
</P>
<P>
 She said people are tired of the bitter controversy surrounding the downtown 
redevelopment and want to regain a sense of calm in the city. It is important 
to finish the revitalization project, she said, because city-owned vacant land 
is draining Brea's financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Daucher said she favors reasonable growth and would preserve the foothills 
ridgeline as a local treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger Sandra Varner Nolte, 55, is a semi-retired businesswoman who works 
as a consultant in the medical and dental fields. Nolte said placing her on the 
council would bolster the leadership of the panel, which she sees as being 
overshadowed by the city manager's office and unresponsive to the needs of 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important for Brea to cultivate a friendlier business climate, Nolte 
said, adding that business people are often treated shabbily unless they are 
politically well-connected. 
</P>
<P>
 Council candidate Marty Simonoff, 44, is a retired captain with the Huntington 
Park Police Department in Los Angeles County. He now works at his family's 
recycling and trash hauling business in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Simonoff said his nearly two decades of public service have given him an 
in-depth knowledge of governmental operations, including financial matters. If 
elected, he would attempt to increase funding for the police and fire 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important for Brea to retain its community values, he said, and not be 
overwhelmed by excessive growth. As much open space as possible should be 
preserved in the foothills, he said, with certain portions of the land set 
aside for organized sports and other recreational uses. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Steven C. Vargas, 32, is an electrical designer with Southern 
California Edison, and the commander of American Legion Post 181 in Brea. He 
said the city's two major issues are fiscal responsibility and public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas accuses Brea officials of not being open and honest with residents and 
of basing the city budget on a list of unknowns, including the level of state 
funding. He also said Brea needs to be more proactive about public safety, and 
more user-friendly to businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Vargas said his technical expertise would be an asset when the 
council reviews complicated projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenger William M. Vega, 38, owns a foreign car service and repair company 
in La Habra. Vega, who unsuccessfully ran for the council two years ago, said 
Brea's biggest problem is a lack of integrity and honesty among city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 He accuses officials of being fiscally irresponsible, unresponsive to 
residents and arbitrary in their decision-making. Vega said the top-heavy city 
management should be trimmed and reorganized, and that privatization and 
volunteerism should be encouraged. Savings could then be passed on to residents 
through reduced utility charges, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vega said he has no qualms about redevelopment if it is accomplished in a 
humane manner. But he objects to what he calls a discriminatory business 
climate in which laws and regulations have been circumvented. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest candidate is William T. Watson, 23, a Cal State Long Beach 
student majoring in marketing, with a minor in political science. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said he wants to preserve Brea's small-town atmosphere by protecting 
the foothills area, encouraging community involvement and slowing down the rate 
of development. The city is in danger of having more retail establishments than 
can be financially supported, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council should increase communication with residents so they will be 
better able to participate in city government, he said.

DOCTORS DEBATE PROSPECTS FOR STATE-RUN HEALTH PLAN; POLITICS: PROPOSITION 186 
IS CHEERED FOR ITS PROMISE OF COVERAGE FROM CRADLE TO GRAVE. BUT CRITIC SAYS IT 
CAN'T WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Two Orange County doctors made emotional pitches for and against Proposition 
186 Thursday, debating whether the bill that would create a state-run health 
insurance program will mean better health care or worse, or even 
life-threatening inefficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the passage of the initiative historically comparable to American 
women winning the right to vote, Dr. Nancy Greep told the audience of about 40 
health care and social activists that a state-run program would help solve the 
problem of spiraling insurance costs and provide critical care to the state's 
underinsured and uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 As medical director of the North Orange County Community Clinic, Greep said 
she often cares for patients whose private insurance companies fail to cover 
critical services. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186 "would allow me to practice medicine again with dignity and 
not in a system that is always closing its doors in our patients' faces," Greep 
said during the conference, which was organized by the Health Care Council of 
Orange County at St. Joseph's Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Cristina Rizza called the proposed program "socialized medicine." She 
warned the audience, which included many senior citizens, that if the state 
takes over the administration of health coverage, the elderly will suffer most 
because of bureaucratic inefficiencies and shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will be sacrificed because you are old and expendable," predicted Rizza, 
co-founder of the Orange County-based Americans for Free Choice in Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 186 would provide cradle-to-grave health insurance for all 31 
million Californians by imposing taxes and through existing government 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 A single state fund administered by an elected health insurance commissioner 
would pay all medical bills, mental health coverage, prescription drugs and 
long-term care, including nursing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizza, who was born and raised in Italy, said its socialized medical system, 
which is plagued by shortages, led to her parents' premature deaths. Her mother 
was turned down for critical medical tests and her father was denied intensive 
care because of long waiting lists, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe you think that couldn't happen in the U.S., but the universe is 
governed by cause and effect, and if you enact the same principle you're going 
to get the same effect," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greep countered that the bill prohibits the rationing of important medical 
services. It also would cap administrative costs at 4% to control bureaucratic 
growth and eliminate waste, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-run program would be offered as an alternative to private health 
insurance. Instead of the premiums now paid by individuals, corporations and 
their workers, the state would collect a 2.5% surtax on all taxable income up 
to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for families. The tax would be 5% at 
higher income levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations would pay a payroll tax of 4.4% to 8.9%, and a $1-per-pack 
cigarette tax would be imposed.  
</P>
<P>
 Supporters claim that, despite the increase in taxes, most Californians would 
end up paying less for health coverage by avoiding insurance premiums and 
deductibles. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Times poll earlier this month, about two-thirds of likely voters 
statewide said they had not heard enough about the measure to form an opinion. 
After the measure was described to voters, the initiative trailed by a wide 
margin, 23% to 63%.

SUIT FILED TO BLOCK NEWPORT COAST TOLLS; COURT: RESIDENTS CLAIM THAT SAN 
JOAQUIN HILLS TOLLWAY AGENCY HAS NO RIGHT TO IMPOSE 50-CENT FEE ON SEGMENT OF 
PUBLIC ROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A group of Newport Beach and Laguna Beach residents has sued the San Joaquin 
Hills Transportation Corridor Agency to block the conversion of a 1.4-mile 
section of Newport Coast Drive to a tollway. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit filed Thursday in Orange County Superior Court, the Newport Coast 
Drive Defense Fund alleges that the agency has no authority to impose a 50-cent 
toll on a road being paid for with property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been fighting for almost two years to keep Newport Coast Drive open 
because we know it's a free public road," said Ilse Lenschow, a 20-year Laguna 
Beach resident who is president of the Coalition of Neighborhood Assns. there. 
</P>
<P>
 Her group contends that affected residents were not properly notified of the 
toll plan and that the road -- built to ease anticipated traffic problems on 
Pacific Coast Highway caused by the Irvine Co.'s Newport Coast development -- 
was funded through a special assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency spokeswoman Lisa Telles declined comment because the agency had not 
been served with a copy of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs want a judge to rule that imposition of a toll on what had been 
a toll-free public road would exceed the agency's authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also wants a court order barring the agency from collecting a toll 
on any portion of six-mile-long Newport Coast Drive and from closing it except 
for brief periods required for construction of a separate San Joaquin Hills 
toll road. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit challenges only the agency's right to impose a toll on Newport 
Coast Drive, not its right to build the San Joaquin Hills Transportation 
Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned 15-mile San Joaquin Hills toll road would extend from MacArthur 
Boulevard at the end of the Corona del Mar Freeway to Interstate 5 near San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The disputed section of Newport Coast Drive runs from MacArthur Boulevard to 
Bonita Canyon Drive. From there, Newport Coast Drive bends south from the 
corridor toward Crystal Cove State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency plans to incorporate the 1.4-mile segment of Newport Coast Drive 
into the northernmost leg of the $1.1-billion tollway, which is projected to be 
completed in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six other lawsuits have been brought in state and federal courts to 
block the larger tollway project. Most of those suits challenge the adequacy of 
environmental studies related to air quality, traffic, noise and wildlife in 
the transportation corridor and the impact of potential development once the 
tollway is built. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Coast Drive Defense Fund suit contends that state and federal laws 
expressly bar the agency from imposing a toll on an existing road and that 
absorbing a section of Newport Coast Drive into the tollway is more akin to 
refurbishing an old road than building a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 The threatened toll would violate federal laws passed to secure federal 
funding for up to 35% of the corridor, according to the lawsuit.SAN JOAQUIN

MAN DIED TRYING TO HURT OFFICERS, POLICE SAY

ORANGE COUNTY HOME GARMENT WORK TARGETED IN CRACKDOWN; LABOR: CONTRACTORS AND 
PRIVATE HOMES ARE RAIDED IN AN EFFORT TO CURB A WIDESPREAD BUT ILLEGAL 
PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Targeting Orange County's vast underground network of home sewing operations, 
labor and welfare fraud inspectors this week are sweeping private residences 
and apparel contractors suspected of giving their employees work to take home. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown is part of a much broader effort by state and federal officials 
to curb abuses of labor and safety laws in Southern California's garment 
industry, which has been growing rapidly in recent years amid retailers' 
demands that clothing orders be filled more quickly. That growth has spurred 
intense competition among garment contractors, some of whom have tried to 
undercut rivals and meet the increased demand by tapping an immigrant community 
hungry for work. 
</P>
<P>
 While apparel work at home has long been prevalent in Los Angeles County and 
to a lesser degree in the San Francisco Bay Area, inspectors say the problem 
has become acute in Orange County. Many hard-pressed immigrants and refugees, 
especially in the county's large Vietnamese community, are sewing at home to 
supplement income from other jobs and, in some cases, welfare payments, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is home work growing?" asked a labor inspector in Orange County who 
specializes in the Vietnamese community. "Employer and employee both benefit 
from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the sweeps taking place this week were not available Thursday. Jose 
Millan, the state's senior deputy labor commissioner in Los Angeles, said about 
40 federal, state and county inspectors are expected to raid more than 80 
garment businesses and private homes, many of them in Orange County but some in 
Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties. They are expected to issue fines 
against contractors totaling more than $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Marianne Blank of the Cross Cultural Community Center in Garden Grove, which 
has helped thousands of Southeast Asian refugees find jobs, said home garment 
work "is just spreading unbelievably." 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, home garment work for pay is illegal. But on top of that, 
inspectors say, those who are sewing, cutting or doing other apparel work at 
home typically are paid only a fraction of the minimum wage and sometimes toil 
under sweatshop conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when clamping down on those practices, state labor officials got an 
unpleasant surprise: In the past year, 18 private homes in Anaheim and Santa 
Ana that were busted for doing illegal garment work produced business licenses 
from those cities, Millan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," Millan said. "They're saying they've got a business license from 
the city, so the business must be legitimate." 
</P>
<P>
 Millan said he recently wrote to officials in Anaheim and Santa Ana asking for 
a list of those who have been issued business licenses for home garment work. 
Neither city has responded to his request, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the business license agencies in Anaheim and Santa Ana said 
permits for home businesses are cleared with the cities' planning departments. 
</P>
<P>
 John Borrego, senior planner at the Anaheim Planning Department, said he was 
not aware that his agency has approved these type of licenses, but added that 
it was not his department's job to screen out garment work. "The only thing we 
do is make sure (home work) complies with the zoning code, and garment work 
isn't specifically prohibited by the ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Department officials in Santa Ana could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 That some people are able to get permits for home garment work is a big 
concern, labor officials say, because that, like the ads for home work found in 
ethnic newspapers, tends to lead people unfamiliar with U.S. laws to believe 
that such work is legal. 
</P>
<P>
 One Westminster apartment that inspectors visited Wednesday afternoon had 
three sewing machines on metal worktables next to the refrigerator. Overhead 
was a fluorescent light, and spools of thread were strewn on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-year-old Vietnamese man who answered the door said a man and woman who 
shared the apartment with him sewed at nights and on weekends to supplement 
their pay from full-time jobs at electronics plants in Los Angeles. The man, 
who said he and his family were on welfare, said he did not do any garment 
work, but has considered it. "I didn't know it was illegal," he said through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Taverner, head of the U.S. Labor Department's wages and hours division 
in Santa Ana, said many of the people doing home garment work are employed by 
contractors and take the extra work home with them. Therefore, as the apparel 
industry has grown, so has home garment work, said Taverner, whose division has 
been involved in the sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statewide survey earlier this year, about 15% of garment sewing companies 
were found to be engaging in illegal home work. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Southern California as a whole, the number of garment workers in Orange 
County has climbed steadily in recent years. The Employment Development 
Department listed 8,700 workers at 511 garment firms in Orange County in the 
first quarter of 1994, the latest figures available. That was up from 7,725 
workers at 470 firms two years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state officials have been trying to crack down on contractors as 
well as manufacturers to solve the home work problem. But in many cases, home 
workers are reluctant to disclose who has given them the work.

THE BIZ / JOHN LIPPMAN: COMPANY TOWN; NEW REEL AT SONY; GUBER SUCCESSOR FACES 
CHALLENGES AT CRITICAL TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sony Pictures Entertainment, always in a high state of anxiety, got a bit more 
anxious Thursday with the announcement that Peter Guber had stepped down as 
chief executive and that many of his duties were being assumed by Alan Levine, 
president and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine, a former high-powered Hollywood lawyer, takes over at a time when Sony 
needs to clarify its corporate strategy and rev up its lagging movie 
production. It is also unclear what role other senior Sony executives -- 
including production chief Mark Canton -- may play in the wake of Levine's 
appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between Levine and Guber is not simply one of style: No one can 
imagine Levine, a member of the Hillcrest Country Club who sometimes comes 
across as a Republican Rotarian from the Midwest, sporting a ponytail, as Guber 
did a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine's role until now has been largely bottom line-oriented: He oversaw the 
recent consolidation of the marketing and distribution departments of Columbia 
and TriStar, which resulted in dozens of layoffs. Although a solid businessman, 
he has virtually no experience on the so-called creative side. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has not been in the business of courting filmmakers," notes one observer. 
</P>
<P>
 That is an about-face from the one of Guber, a former producer who was known 
to be bored with the nuts and bolts of managing a large company. Although Guber 
frequently became involved in picking which films Sony would make, he gave 
virtual autonomy for running daily operations to various division heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the cautious Levine, who has kept himself discreetly in the background to 
the voluble Guber, inherits the job at a time when Sony has curtailed lavish 
spending that once earned it the reputation as the most profligate studio in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, whereas Sony once spent too much, some people today wonder if it's 
spending too little. Few Sony films now have budgets of more than $20 million. 
Worse, the studio lost money last year for the first time, putting pressure to 
keep the spending lid tightly clamped. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony is having another bumpy year. It's only had one successful movie, "Wolf," 
which is expected to gross at least $150 million worldwide, though there are 
high expectations for two upcoming fall releases: "Mary Shelley's 
Frankenstein," starring Robert DeNiro and Helena Bonham-Carter, and "Little 
Women," which stars Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, the production pipeline has slowed so much that 
Sony unit Columbia Pictures had no releases between February and June. The 
television division, though it has solid shows in "Mad About You" on NBC, "The 
Nanny" on CBS and "The Ricki Lake Show" in first-run syndication, lately has 
failed to produce a mega-hit such as "Who's the Boss?" in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Danza is still paying their salaries over there," joked one film 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony has also been on the sidelines when it comes to any of the big strategic 
moves undertaken at other movie studios. 
</P>
<P>
 While Fox launched a highly successful fourth network and Warner Bros. and 
Paramount are duking out rival plans for fifth networks, Sony expanded into 
first-run syndication, a market it not only entered years behind the other 
studios but one that is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, while Sony poured more than $100 million into refurbishing the old 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer lot, meticulously landscaping the plaza outside the 
Thalberg building, other studios invested heavily in launching and upgrading 
cable TV networks such as the USA Network and the Sci-Fi Channel, both joint 
ventures between Paramount and MCA, Fox's F/X basic cable channel and the new 
film channel called Fox Film Studio. Sony's first entry into cable, the Game 
Show Channel, had set Dec. 1 as a launch date, but it is more than a year 
behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first and most important thing (Levine) needs to do is have a strategy," 
observed one Hollywood executive who has dealt with Sony for a long time. "The 
second thing he needs is to have some input and involvement in the core 
business, which Guber never did. Guber always said, 'It's your decision.' He 
was more like a consultant than a chairman." 
</P>
<P>
 With Guber gone, Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Cos. Chairman Canton now 
becomes the top creative executive at the studio. It is well known that Levine, 
47, and Canton, 44, are not close. Moreover, Levine will report to Michael P. 
Schulhof, the New York-based chief executive of Sony Corp. of America. 
Schulhof, a physicist who likes to pilot the Sony corporate jet, also lacks a 
creative background. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Levine, who has spent years as a behind-the-scenes mediator at Sony Pictures, 
undoubtedly recognizes the importance that converging entertainment 
technologies pose to Hollywood. But to have any real impact, says one Hollywood 
executive, Levine is going to have to "roll out new dough. . . . Having enough 
production funds to make 12 to 15 pictures a year and have three succeed is 
just what they've not been doing now." 
</P>
<P>
 Many insiders believe the missing creative link in the upper echelons is Jeff 
Sagansky, the former chief programmer at CBS who joined Sony as an executive 
vice president earlier this month. Sagansky was ostensibly brought aboard by 
Schulhof -- at Guber's recommendation -- to help Sony on strategic maneuvers, 
including a possible sale of a 25% stake in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagansky -- though Sony officials deny it -- is seen by many Hollywood 
executives both inside and outside the company as poised to run the studio one 
day. Although it is unlikely that Sagansky, who now lives in New York, would 
move back to Los Angeles, several high-level executives at the studio expect 
him to eventually become the de facto boss. Peter Guber's Long Road 
</P>
<P>
 GUBER'S CAREER 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Guber, the enigmatic producer-turned-studio chief, left his post 
abruptly Thursday. Here's a look at his 26-year career in the entertainment 
industry: 
</P>
<P>
 * Recruited by Columbia Pictures in 1968 for a job as executive assistant 
while still attending the MBA program at New York University. Rose to studio 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 * Formed Peter Guber's Filmworks in 1976 and, with Neil Bogart, founded 
Casablanca Records. Merged the two companies and became chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Produced first feature film in 1977, "The Deep," which grossed $47.3 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Formed Polygram Pictures in 1980, becoming co-owner and chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sold Polygram in 1983. Joined forces with Jon Peters and formed Guber-Peters 
Entertainment Co., serving as chairman of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 * Produced "Batman" in 1989, which later went on to gross a total of $251.1 
million domestically. 
</P>
<P>
 * Columbia Pictures sold to Sony Corp. in 1989. Sony paid $700 million to 
secure Guber and Peters as co-chairmen of Sony Pictures Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Became sole chairman when Peters left in 1991. * Oversaw nine blockbusters 
that grossed over $100 million and 21 domestic hits grossing over $50 million 
during his five-year stint as studio chief.

CEDARS' $100 BONUS OFFER TO CHOOSE CERTAIN PLANS ILLEGAL, REGULATORS SAY; 
HEALTH CARE: PAYMENTS WERE TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO ENROLL IN SPECIFIC HMOS. 
RIVAL MEDICAL GROUP HAD CONDEMNED ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 State regulators on Thursday said Cedars-Sinai Medical Center must drop a plan 
to pay $100 "enrollment bonuses" to thousands of employees of the Los Angeles 
hospital who agree to enroll in certain medical plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars' bonus offer violates state laws that prohibit health plans from 
offering any "bonus or gratuity" as a way of attracting or keeping members, 
Anita J. Ostroff, senior counsel for the California Department of Corporations, 
said in a letter to officials at Maxicare Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonuses were aimed at certain of Cedars 6,500 employees who are members of 
Maxicare, a Los Angeles-based health maintenance organization, or 
CaliforniaCare, an HMO operated by Blue Cross of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars officials said the goal of the bonus plan was to cut medical costs by 
encouraging the employees to enroll in specific HMO programs and select 
primary-care physicians in two new medical groups managed by Cedars. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars, which has undertaken a major reorganization in the past year, formed 
the new medical groups to enhance its ability to compete for HMO business. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital appears to be trying to build a base for the new groups with its 
own employee group, according to some Cedars doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonus plan angered a rival medical group that currently treats thousands 
of Cedars employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hospital is scrambling now to deliver patients to these new groups, and 
they're doing it in an unethical manner," said Dr. Seymour Levine, chairman of 
Health Source Management Group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be undercut by a powerful institution with lots of money to 
buy patients," Levine said of his independent group. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Health Source official, Dr. Stewart Gleischman, said the paying of a 
$100 bonus "is kind of a Rick Dees approach to medicine," referring to the 
popular Los Angeles radio personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers said Cedars' plan illustrates the bare-knuckles competition 
in health care as doctors and hospitals battle for patients and market share in 
a rapidly consolidating industry. 
</P>
<P>
 While employers use various financial incentives to encourage workers to sign 
up for less costly medical plans, such as HMOs, several industry observers said 
they had never heard of anyone offering an enrollment bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this business for 34 years and it's the first time I've heard 
this one," said John O'Connell, a health care specialist at the Towers Perrin 
consulting firm in Century City. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars "always complies with the applicable laws and regulations," said Cedars 
spokesman Ron Wise, adding that "expert legal counsel advised us in advance 
that our actions were appropriate as an employer." 
</P>
<P>
 Maxicare, which like all HMOs is regulated by the Department of Corporations, 
said it had no role in devising the bonus plan. Spokesman Ed Coughlan said 
Maxicare didn't know about the bonus "until the day before it was to occur." 
Industry observers said many employers offer various inducements to workers to 
get them to switch to less costly HMOs. One common method is to make it more 
costly for an employee to get medical coverage through a traditional 
fee-for-service insurance plan than through an HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true that a $100 bill is a lot flashier way, particularly for the less 
savvy and less educated consumer," said Jeanne Finberg, senior staff attorney 
for the Consumers Union in San Francisco. "It might lead to uninformed 
decisions that might effect employees' choices or mislead them."

COMPANY TOWN; SOME SEE DISNEY'S MAGIC DIMMED WITH PULLOUT FROM VIRGINIA SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE and KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 In abandoning its proposed Virginia site for a bitterly opposed $650-million 
theme park, Walt Disney Co. scored points on Wall Street and among its critics 
in the academic and environmental communities, protecting an image as a 
responsible and savvy company. 
</P>
<P>
 But some observers said Thursday that its sudden about-face may have damaged 
its credibility and demonstrated that it can be whipped, raising questions 
about its prospects for reviving the project at another location. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was unanimity in one respect: The entire crowd of supporters and 
opponents who had passionately tracked the theme park's progress was stunned by 
Disney's announcement late Wednesday that it was backing down in the face of 
protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the critics had been noisy, Disney appeared to have the momentum. Just 
last week, it won the approval of local zoning and transport officials. It was 
certain to secure the backing of supervisors in Prince William County, where 
the park would have been built, about 40 miles west of Washington near two 
historic Civil War battlefields. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Gov. George Allen was such a Disney enthusiast that he marshaled 
support for an unprecedented $163 million in bonds for road improvements the 
project would have required, not to mention auctioning off his Mickey Mouse tie 
at a pro-Disney rally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as June, Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner vowed to Washington 
Post editors that "if people think we will back off, they are mistaken." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney executives reiterated Thursday that the company will proceed with the 
ambitious project at a "less controversial" site, preferably in Virginia. Local 
and state leaders in Virginia and Maryland were scrambling to get to the head 
of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 In its decision, Disney cited the national debate over the park's location and 
impending lawsuits that threatened to delay the scheduled opening in 1998. "It 
has become clear that we could not say when the park would be able to open, or 
even when we could break ground," said Peter S. Rummell, president of Disney 
Design & Development Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents had protested that a Disney park would bring air pollution, traffic 
gridlock, hordes of tourists and ancillary strip malls to the bucolic 
countryside, desecrating the nearby Civil War battlefields of Manassas and Bull 
Run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney's capitulation deflated the Washington area's hopes for an economic 
boon, and business leaders moved quickly Thursday to assure Disney that the 
company is still welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exasperating that a national constituency was developed to undermine 
the destiny of this region . . . " said Charles (Tuck) Nason, chairman of the 
Greater Washington Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Street analysts, however, said they hoped the park will never be 
built, voicing longstanding doubts in the investment community about the wisdom 
of the project. Disney shares were unchanged Thursday at $39.875 in a down 
market.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm real happy that management decided to blow this thing off, and I hope 
they don't try it in some other location. I didn't think they'd make any money 
out of it," said David Londoner, managing director of Wertheim Schroder & Co. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The project was becoming a political burden that the image-based company 
couldn't afford, said Harold Vogel of Merrill Lynch. "It was burning too much 
political capital, and I think it was occupying a lot of their management 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the first time Disney has changed direction on such projects. Under 
Eisner, Disney has considered at least three big projects in Southern 
California that have been scaled back or scrapped: large theme parks in Burbank 
and Long Beach and a $3-billion expansion of Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this case, some warned that Disney's abrupt pullout in the face of the 
opposition in Virginia will come back to haunt the company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney is going to have to hustle to close this public credibility gap," said 
Margaret King, a cultural historian who has worked under contract for Disney. 
"This is going to cause people to re-examine the way they look at the 
corporation and its courage in the face of opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jamie O'Boyle, a historian who has written about Disney's role in 
American culture: "Everybody thought it was full-speed ahead. The cultural 
effects of this for Disney are not good. The message is: Disney can be beaten, 
even when everything seems to be going full-speed ahead. . . . It will be very 
difficult for them to develop outside their own property." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the anti-Disney crowd in Washington was jubilant, gathering at the 
National Trust for Historic Preservation in Washington to declare Disney's 
decision "responsible and patriotic." 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that few events in our whole story as a nation better demonstrate 
the degree to which Americans care about their history than what has happened 
here," said noted historian David McCullough, one of the project's most 
celebrated opponents.

 Downey S&L Plans to Convert to Federal Charter: The thrift, the last major 
savings and loan still operating under state authority, said its board approved 
the formation of a holding company to be named Downey Financial Corp. It said 
directors also approved the conversion of Downey Savings & Loan from a 
California-licensed savings association to a federally chartered institution. 
In a news release, the company said its shareholders will become Downey 
Financial holders and that it plans to list Downey Financial shares on the New 
York and Pacific stock exchanges.Downey said the holding company reorganization 
and conversion are subject to regulatory and corporate approvals. The company 
said it expects to complete the reorganization in January and the federal 
charter conversion shortly thereafter.

 Money Supply Mixed: The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply -- 
M2 and M3 -- were mixed in the week ended Sept. 19, the Federal Reserve Board 
said.M2 fell to a seasonally adjusted $3,594.2 billion from a revised $3,595.3 
billion the previous week. M3 rose to a seasonally adjusted $4.245.1 billion 
from a revised $4.243.3 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, 
fell to a seasonally adjusted $1,151.2 billion from $1,152.5 billion. In 
judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is monitoring money 
supply, the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between 
short- and long-term interest rates.

 Piper Jaffray Again Sued Over Derivatives Losses: The investment company is 
being sued for losses in a mutual fund it manages for Managers Funds of 
Norwalk, Conn. Lawyers for nine investors in Alabama, Kansas, Maryland and 
Florida filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, where the firm 
is based, claiming they were misled about the fund's investment policies and 
its potential volatility. It is the 11th lawsuit to be filed against Piper 
Jaffray Inc. for derivative-related losses.

 Wilson Rescinds Overtime Waiver: The emergency waiver of a state overtime 
requirement had been issued to relieve traffic congestion after the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake. Gov. Pete Wilson asked the Legislature to pass new 
legislation that would permanently repeal the state's daily overtime 
provision.The existing law requires employers to pay workers overtime whenever 
they work more than eight hours in a day. Wilson exempted Southland employers 
from the requirement after the quake as a way to encourage flexible work 
schedules. He said he rescinded the waiver because emergency conditions no 
longer exist in the Southland, but he encouraged lawmakers to permanently 
repeal the requirement to accommodate the needs of both employers and 
employees.

 U.S. Settles Bias Suit With Black Workers: The employees and the Labor 
Department reached a $4-million agreement described as the largest monetary 
settlement of a class-action race-discrimination suit against the federal 
government. The department denied any wrongdoing or liability, saying it 
settled the dispute so it "could move forward with its broad mission of 
employment, training and retraining for the American work force."The agreement 
provides $2.77 million in monetary awards, $300,000 in salary increases and $1 
million for education and training, said attorney Jane Lang of Sprenger & Lang, 
who represented the employees. The settlement applies to between 350 and 400 
employees who claimed they were illegally fired, demoted or denied promotions 
by the department's Employment and Training Administration in 1981 and in 
1983-84, Lang said.

 Investors slipped back into worry mode Thursday as newly bullish reports on 
the economy pumped up interest rate concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields rose across the board, sending the Dow industrials down 23.55 
points to 3,854.63. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers topped winners by 13 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange. But most 
broad stock indexes fell less than the Dow in percentage terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's troubles began with a government report that new-home sales 
surged in August, despite higher mortgage rates. News of an upward revision in 
second-quarter economic growth also spurred selling of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 At the close, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was at 7.84%, a 27-month 
high and up from 7.81% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors fear that faster growth will drive up inflation in the long run, and 
in the short run force the Federal Reserve Board to raise short-term interest 
rates further. On Tuesday, the Fed met to consider another rate hike but 
decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets weren't helped by oil prices Thursday: November crude 
futures hit a six-week high, up 30 cents at $17.98 a barrel, benefiting mostly 
from technical end-of-quarter tradings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Wall Streeters believe that third-quarter corporate earnings reports, 
which will begin to roll out next week, will be strong enough to allow 
investors to overcome rate worries -- as occurred when the market rallied in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market seems to want to focus on economy and earnings," said Hugh 
Johnson, analyst at First Albany Corp. But "every now and then, we're reminded 
that inflation and interest rates are still a problem, and we end up taking a 
giant step backwards." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Transportation stocks led the market lower, as airline shares dove on fare 
war concerns and other issues. The Dow transports index sank 19.32 points to 
1,483.54, the lowest since mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
 AMR, parent of American Airlines, fell 1 3/4 to 50 3/4; Delta lost 1 3/4 to 43 
1/2; USAir dropped 1 to 4, and UAL, parent of United Airlines, slumped 3 3/4 to 
87 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks also weakened. GM lost 7/8 to 46 3/4, Ford sank 1/2 to 27 1/2 
and Chrysler dropped 1 1/8 to 44 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some drug stocks gave ground after rallying early in the week. 
Warner-Lambert lost 1 to 80 1/2, Pfizer fell 1 1/2 to 68 3/4 and Merck eased 
3/8 to 35 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Profit takers hit Alcoa, which slid 1 3/4 to 85 3/4, and Reynolds Metals, 
which fell 1 1/8 to 56 1/2. But many other key industrial issues were higher. 
Steel maker LTV surged 1 3/8 to 21 1/8, Monsanto gained 2 5/8 to 80, Rohm & 
Haas jumped 2 1/4 to 56 3/4, FMC added 1 1/8 to 61 5/8 and Parker-Hannifin 
leaped 1 5/8 to 39 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Supermarket stocks jumped after Safeway reported strong quarterly earnings. 
Safeway rocketed 1 3/8 to 28 7/8, Kroger gained 3/4 to 26 3/8, Vons added 3/8 
to 16 1/4 and A&P was up 1 1/4 to 24 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * CBS tumbled 16 to 320 on further disappointment over its third-place showing 
among the four TV networks for the first week of the new season. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index dropped 47.31 points to 2,717.51, as investors 
continued to respond fearfully to Wednesday's assassination of the ruling 
party's secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. trading of Mexican shares, Telmex sank 1 1/4 to 62. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere among foreign markets, London's FTSE-100 index dove 46.2 points to 
2,992.5 as interest rate fears there mounted. Frankfurt's DAX index also 
tumbled, off 24.53 points at 2,043.58. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index gained 107.52 points to 19,615.12.

 GM Strike Continues: Bargainers were unable to find a compromise that could 
end the potentially crippling strike against General Motors Corp. Dave Yettaw, 
president of United Auto Workers Local 599, said the two sides would meet again 
today. The strike by 11,500 GM workers at the 123-acre Buick City complex in 
Flint, Mich., led to the closing of two plants in Lansing, Mich., on Tuesday, 
the first day of the strike, and threatened to lead to the closings of others. 
Thousands of workers in other GM plants have been told not to report to work 
today or Saturday.

B OF A AND LUCKY BANKING ON EACH OTHER; CONSUMERS: FULL-SERVICE BRANCHES WILL 
BE OPENED IN 100 SUPERMARKETS; 295 OTHER STORES WILL GET ATMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bank of America said Thursday that it will establish banking operations in 
nearly 400 Lucky stores throughout California, creating the largest single 
supermarket branching system in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement with Lucky, B of A said it will put full-service branches 
in 100 supermarkets and place automated teller machines and 24-hour customer 
service hot lines in Lucky's remaining 295 stores in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Supermarket bank branches and ATMs have spread across the nation in recent 
years as both banks and supermarkets recognize the benefits of providing 
convenient services to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Groceries with ATMs generate about 10% to 15% more in sales because customers 
are willing to spend more when they have better access to cash and account 
balances, according to estimates by Dan Raftery, vice president of Willard 
Bishop Consulting, a supermarket consultant in suburban Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Though only a small percentage of supermarket shoppers utilize in-store 
full-service banking operations, there is enough activity to justify the 
operations, Raftery said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives consumers more reasons to shop at Lucky," said John Benner, a 
senior vice president at the chain. "This is a competitive advantage for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lucky-B of A deal is likely to prompt some of Lucky's competitors to 
provide more in-store banking services by courting other banks or by installing 
ATMs in more of their stores, Raftery said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based B of A, California's largest bank, already operates about 
90 full-service branches in stores in nine western states -- including 14 in 
California. Some of those in-store branches are in the stores of Lucky 
competitors such as Vons. 
</P>
<P>
 B of A will maintain branches at current store locations in California but now 
plans to establish most of its future in-store state operations at Lucky 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank said the location of supermarket branches will be a factor in 
determining where it will build new free-standing bank branches. However, 
banking officials said it has not been determined if the expansion will cause 
some existing free-standing branches to close, because it has not yet decided 
which Lucky supermarkets will get full-service branches. 
</P>
<P>
 B of A said it will install Lucky supermarket branches at the rate of about 33 
stores a year over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dublin, Calif.-based Lucky is the state's largest supermarket chain. However, 
Lucky has fewer Southern California stores than Vons and ranks behind it in 
regional market share. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky will fall to third place in the market share race if regulators allow 
Food 4 Less Supermarkets -- operator of Alpha Beta, Boys, Viva and Food 4 Less 
warehouse stores -- to proceed with a planned merger with Ralphs Grocery Co.

ALLSTATE; ALLSTATE BOOSTS ESTIMATED LOSS IN JAN. 17 QUAKE TO $1.3 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Allstate Corp. on Thursday became the latest insurance company to boost its 
estimated losses from the Northridge earthquake, which is proving to be the 
most frustrating as well as the costliest quake in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The company raised its loss estimate from the January quake 37% to $1.3 
billion, from $950 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on this estimate, Allstate, parent of Allstate Insurance Co., the 
nation's largest publicly held property and casualty insurance firm, said its 
1994 earnings will be cut by about $845 million after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate said the revised losses will cut its third-quarter earnings by about 
$228 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company still expects to make a profit in the quarter and in the year, 
helped by fewer auto insurance claims, expense reductions and annuity sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased estimate reflects extensive additional damage discovered as 
rebuilding efforts progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising costs associated with construction and new claims also contributed to 
the higher estimate. Total Allstate claims are now estimated at about 45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been difficult for Allstate and the industry to assess the magnitude 
of this quake because of its unusual and complex nature," Allstate Chief 
Executive Jerry Choate said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate stock closed unchanged at $24.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate is the fourth major insurer to raise its estimated losses in the past 
few weeks -- almost nine months after claims adjusters began climbing through 
the rubble. These continuing financial aftershocks have prompted almost half of 
California's property and casualty insurers to try to raise their prices on 
earthquake policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance companies haven't seen any quake with the relative severity of this 
one," said John Hall, an analyst with Northington Partners in Avon, Conn. "It's 
pretty clear now that the earthquake policy prices may be a little low and 
they'll be going up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 quake was the nation's costliest, with an estimated $7.2 billion 
in total insured damage for the entire insurance industry. Estimates of total 
damage, including non-insured property, range from $13 billion to $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake was unusual because most of the ground motion was vertical rather 
than horizontal, causing buildings to be thrown off their foundations.

USAIR DEFERS PREFERRED DIVIDEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USAir Group Inc., facing large losses and fallout after two major plane 
crashes this year, said Thursday that it will defer its quarterly dividend 
payment, due today, on $358 million of its preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The postponement, less drastic than an outright suspension, defers payments on 
preferred shares held by two of its major investors, British Airways and the 
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. investment group, led by billionaire Warren Buffett. 
</P>
<P>
 British Airways said it is due $25 million in annual dividend payments from 
its near-25% stake in USAir. It said the effect of USAir's decision will be to 
defer quarterly dividend payments on the two classes of stock it holds. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir stock tumbled $1, or 20%, to $4 a share Thursday on the New York Stock 
Exchange. British Airways stock dropped $2 to $55 in late NYSE trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The USAir decision "increases fears that (British Airways) may have to write 
off their investment in USAir," London-based BZW analyst Nick Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir, which did not set a date for when it will pay the dividend, has 
predicted losses of more than $350 million for 1994. Analysts said the 
magnitude of the expected losses was an obvious factor in USAir's decision not 
to make its payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the carrier's financial troubles have been two recent fatal 
crashes. The first occurred in Charlotte, N.C., on July 2, killing 37 people. 
In the second, 132 people died near Pittsburgh on Sept. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir is also involved in protracted talks with its labor unions, seeking ways 
to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The dividend move "is a signal to me that progress in labor talks is not going 
as well as I had hoped," said Glenn Engel, airline analyst for Goldman Sachs & 
Co.

 Chrysler to Add Electric Vehicle Surcharge in California: Chairman Robert J. 
Eaton said that instead of protesting plans by California requiring the sale of 
electric vehicles, the auto maker will add a surcharge to its gasoline-powered 
vehicles to cover the costs of electric cars. Eaton, at a two-day seminar in 
San Gusme, Italy, outlining the company's plans, said a surcharge is the only 
way Chrysler Corp. will be able to sell electric vehicles without losing a 
substantial amount of money.California will require the sale of electric 
vehicles starting in 1998. Specifically, Eaton said Chrysler may sell 
electric-powered vehicles for "a couple of thousand dollars less" than gasoline 
cars. He said the discount will be necessary to attract buyers. Chrysler will 
then add a surcharge on the remaining vehicles sold in California to cover the 
cost of the electric cars.

 Chrysler Boosts Capital Spending Plans: Chairman Robert J. Eaton told 
reporters at a seminar in Italy that the auto maker plans to increase the 
figure to $20 billion between 1994 and 1998. Eaton said capital spending for 
1995-99 will be even higher. In the 1993-97 period, the figure was $17.3 
billion.

 Ford Sales Jump in Japan: Even while it grouses at Japanese auto makers, Ford 
Motor Co. reported that its sales in Japan through August of this year totaled 
8,744 units, up 152% over last year. Ford said it expects its vehicle sales in 
Japan for the full year to be triple the 5,400 cars and trucks it sold there in 
all of 1993. Still, Ford officials say, growth has been hampered by Japanese 
auto makers, who are reluctant to allow their dealers to sell products made by 
Detroit's Big Three.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: SUDDENLY, THOSE BANK CD YIELDS DON'T LOOK BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your corner bank suddenly doesn't look like such a bad place to keep some 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 With stock and bond markets slumping again, and with this week's news of the 
first-ever failure of a money market mutual fund, federally insured bank 
certificates of deposit are gaining new luster with investors and savers. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps, of course, that CD yields are hitting their highest levels since 
mid-1992, as the Federal Reserve Board continues to push interest rates higher 
to brake the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank Rate Monitor newsletter in North Palm Beach, Fla., says the average yield 
on one-year CDs nationwide has jumped from 4.19% to 4.44% just since Aug. 16 -- 
the last time the Fed raised rates. At the start of the year, one-year CDs 
averaged just 3.08%. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are responding to the higher returns: The total of small CDs at 
banks and S&Ls has risen $14 billion over the last few months, to $782 billion 
currently. Until last spring, that sum had been plunging virtually nonstop 
since January, 1990, when it stood at about $1.16 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't just higher yields that are bringing people back to CDs, though. Some 
investors undoubtedly are learning (or relearning) about risk this year. Bond 
mutual funds, in particular, have lost substantial principal value as rising 
interest rates have devalued older bonds in fund portfolios. Investors who 
thought bonds were just CD substitutes now know they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the failure of an institutional money market mutual fund this 
week because of losses on so-called derivative securities should remind 
investors that money funds aren't federally guaranteed like bank CDs. There is 
risk in the funds -- minimal for most, but it's still there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you're looking for the highest -- and safest -- return on your short-term 
savings, here's a rundown of your options today: 
</P>
<P>
 * CDs. For Southern Californians, this is a good time to be CD rate-shopping. 
Bradshaw Financial Network of San Rafael, which tracks yields for The Times, 
says average yields on six-month and one-year CDs among 30 California 
institutions are above national averages. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll typically find the highest CD yields at "thrift and loans" that, unlike 
major banks and S&Ls, tend to be smaller, specialized institutions. Santa 
Barbara-based California Thrift & Loan, for example, now pays 5.34% on a 
one-year CD, well above the 4.64% state average. 
</P>
<P>
 California Thrift mostly makes auto and home equity loans, and doesn't provide 
the full range of "free" services that larger institutions offer consumers, 
says Robert Heavner, executive vice president. That keeps costs lower and 
allows the thrift to pay higher yields to depositors, he says. Like its larger 
competitors, however, it is covered by the same standard federal deposit 
insurance of $100,000 per account name. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest yields, meanwhile, are usually found at the state's biggest banks. 
Wells Fargo's one-year CD yield, for example, is now 4.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 CD shoppers should check the weekly Bradshaw survey that appears each Monday 
in The Times Business section. Note: Even though you'll find attractive yields 
on one-year and longer-term CDs, most financial advisers suggest keeping most 
of your savings in CDs of six months or less -- as long as interest rates are 
still on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Money market mutual funds. If you want an account that pays well, preserves 
your principal and offers immediate access (unlike CDs), money funds still are 
the best choice. The current national average yield on general money funds is 
4.29%, according to fund-tracker IBC/Donoghue. That's up from 2.7% at the start 
of the year, and will continue to rise with market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's failure of a Denver-based money fund, while shocking, shouldn't 
worry most fund investors, experts say. That fund had no small investors in it, 
and it had gone far overboard investing in exotic derivative securities that 
the vast majority of funds don't touch. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, the Denver fund lacked a deep-pocketed parent. More than a 
dozen other money funds would have suffered small principal losses this year 
because of derivatives, but their parent companies (like BankAmerica and Paine 
Webber, to name two) bailed them out. 
</P>
<P>
 The moral: Because most investors don't have the ability to analyze what's in 
a fund portfolio, anyone worried about trouble ought to stick with funds backed 
by major financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. Treasury bills. Many savers forget about Treasuries. They shouldn't. 
The yield on six-month T-bills now is 5.4%, dramatically better than the 3.7% 
national average on six-month CDs. One-year T-bills yield 5.9%. And, unlike 
CDs, T-bill interest is exempt from state income tax. If you've got at least 
$10,000, you can buy a T-bill, and you can buy it direct from Uncle Sam. For 
order forms, call (213) 624-7398. CD Yields Surge 
</P>
<P>
 Average yields on bank certificates of deposit nationwide on Jan. 1, on Aug. 
16 (the date of the last Federal Reserve rate increase) and currently: 
</P>
<P>
 6-month: Jan. 1: 2.78% Aug. 16: 3.53% Now: 3.70% 
</P>
<P>
 1-year: Jan. 1: 3.08% Aug. 16: 4.19% Now: 4.44% 
</P>
<P>
 5-year: Jan. 1: 4.65% Aug. 16: 5.53% Now: 5.75%

Q & A; BILL ELIMINATES BOUNDARIES ON BANKS; LEGISLATION: PRESIDENT SIGNS LAW 
THAT PAVES THE WAY FOR INTERSTATE BANKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE DUGAS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A landmark bill permitting U.S. banks to operate branches across state lines, 
which President Clinton signed into law on Thursday, could have numerous 
implications for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts do not expect dramatic changes because interstate banking, in which 
bank holding companies own banks in other states, is already a fact of life in 
many states. But the law will expand interstate banking to the few states that 
currently do not allow it. And if states go along, the new rules on interstate 
branching will let banks create seamless branch networks. 
</P>
<P>
 That raises some questions for customers. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there any advantages for me? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Consumers who live in a metropolitan area that straddles several states 
will find that interstate branching makes banking easier, experts say. For 
example, a person who lives in New Jersey and works in New York City will be 
able to open an account at a bank near home and conduct all bank business at a 
branch in the city. Right now customers away from home in another state are 
limited to using ATM machines. Be aware, however, that the federal law allows 
states to opt out of interstate branching. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers also will find added convenience. If interstate branching is 
permitted, they will be able go to a branch of their bank in another part of 
the country and conduct bank business with a teller, such as depositing a check 
or getting a money order. 
</P>
<P>
 And the health of banks will be less dependent on any one region if they can 
spread their risks across more states. That will produce a stronger, healthier 
industry that will ultimately benefit consumers and banks alike, some industry 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the law affect the fees my bank charges, or rates on my loans and 
deposits? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The American Bankers Assn. says that interstate branching will result in 
lower overhead expenses, which banks could pass along to consumer in lower 
rates and fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is so optimistic. "There may be some efficiencies, but I'm not 
sure they will be enough to show up in consumers' pocketbooks," says Michelle 
Meier, counsel for government affairs at Consumers Union. "And what 
efficiencies there are could end up going to shareholders. If interstate 
banking results in less competition, banks will have little incentive to pass 
their savings on to consumers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In other words, less competition means less pressure to give me a low rate 
on a loan or a higher rate on a CD? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not necessarily. Industry experts point out that banks will continue to 
have many non-bank competitors, such as finance companies and mutual funds, and 
so it's not in their interest to suddenly start raising loan rates or lowering 
deposit rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, James Barth, finance professor at Auburn University and a former 
economist at the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, says major changes in rates and 
fees are not likely because interstate banking is already so prevalent. 
Multi-state, multibank holding companies now control 70% of the industry's 
assets, compared with just 5% in 1980, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will this mean my small, local bank is gobbled up by one of the industry's 
giants? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's unclear whether this will mark the end of small community banks. It's 
true that the industry is in the midst of a wave of mergers that is likely to 
accelerate under the new law. But community banks are far from extinct. The 
American Bankers Assn. points out that although 49 states already permit some 
form of interstate banking, there are still about 8,000 community banks with 
assets of less than $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 To help safeguard competition, the new law sets some limits on how much money 
any one bank can hold -- no more than 10% of deposits nationwide, or no more 
than 30% in one state. But one bank could still dominate a particular region, 
Meier says. "A lot of concentration is very local," she says. "This won't stop 
a bank from having a huge presence in Cleveland without much competition." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there a danger that the far-flung national bank networks will ignore the 
needs of local communities? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is concern that the creation of huge national bank networks will lead 
to standardization of services that hurts communities with particular needs, 
such as inner-city neighborhoods. "There may be much more lending by the 
numbers, and credit decisions that are made pretty far from a local community," 
says Allen Fishbein, general counsel for the Center for Community Change, a 
nonprofit group based in Washington, D.C. "We may see more cherry-picking, in 
which a bank goes into a new state and buys banks in affluent areas and stays 
away from parts of a state viewed as low-income or slow growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Meier is especially worried about the impact of the law on small-business 
lending, which she says "takes a lot of local decision-making to tailor the 
loan product to meet local needs and the local economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Bankers Assn., however, notes that banks still must comply with 
the Community Reinvestment Act, which requires them to meet the credit needs of 
all the communities in which they do business. And banks are in business to 
make loans, and they will continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When does the law take effect? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are two phases: One year after Clinton signed the bill, interstate 
banking takes effect. As of July 1, 1997, banks will be able to begin merging 
their branch operations around the country, except in states that have opted 
out of interstate branching. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, states can take the initiative to authorize branch mergers within 
their own borders at any time after the bill is signed.

INSURERS' CREDIT-CHECK POLICIES WORRY CRITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HAGGERTY, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance companies are increasingly consulting consumers' credit records when 
deciding whether to issue or renew homeowners insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurers say they need to take the extra step to protect themselves 
against losses. But some regulators and consumer advocates question whether 
there is a link between credit history and insurance risk, and they say the 
practice raises the possibility of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies have been making such checks for years, although 
applicants are unlikely to know about them unless they have been turned down 
for a policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice is drawing increased attention now largely because Allstate 
Insurance Co., one of the nation's largest insurers, stepped up its use of 
credit checks this year. However, a Texas study found that even before Allstate 
made its changes, about 22% of the dollar volume of policies in that state 
involved credit checks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to see it more and more. There seems to be a big push 
for credit reports to be used," said Mary Griffin, insurance counsel in the 
Washington office of Consumers Union, which is concerned about the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any situation involving credit reports, under federal law a consumer 
must be notified if an application is turned down for credit reasons. He or she 
then has a right to a free copy of the credit report and to request that any 
errors in it be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Because insurance is regulated by states rather than the federal government, 
rules governing how insurers can use credit checks vary. 
</P>
<P>
 Allstate and others in the industry have repeatedly cited two trade journal 
articles as evidence that the practice is effective. The articles detail a 
study backed by Equifax, one of the big national credit bureaus, that shows a 
correlation between credit ratings and losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the data we've seen, we think it's a legitimate predictor," said 
State Farm spokesman Jerry Parsons. His company uses the checks only with new 
applicants, not with renewals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, based on the uproar, the company is examining its procedures to set a 
national standard, he said. Procedures for using credit checks are now 
determined locally, he said, adding, "We are certainly looking at what we're 
doing to see how we apply it firm-wide."

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: CAR SEATS DON'T EARN THEIR WINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's a parent to do? For years, we've been told that the safest way to fly 
with small children is to strap them into car seats. Now the results of 
government crash tests raise serious questions about that advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration recently tested various types of safety 
seats to determine how well they protected children from head injuries in 
hazardous situations, such as heavy turbulence or a crash landing. The agency 
found that rear-facing seats, the kind used for infants weighing less than 20 
pounds, protect children from head injuries. That's good news. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency also found that forward-facing seats -- the sort used for 
children weighing between 20 and 40 pounds -- may not prevent serious head 
injury. What makes the finding even more troubling is that the agency found 
that aircraft lap belts don't adequately protect toddlers, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency said that no matter how it was restrained, its toddler-size crash 
dummy suffered worse head injuries than an adult dummy wearing a lap belt. 
</P>
<P>
 The test results indicate serious deficiencies in existing standards for 
safety seats on aircraft. All seats tested met government standards, the agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public may be expecting a level of protection that isn't there," said Van 
Gowty, an FAA engineer involved in the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Transport Assn., the industry group representing the airlines, said it 
was studying the report. Representatives of child safety seat makers were 
either unavailable or had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gowty said most forward-facing safety seats flunked the tests because they are 
incompatible with aircraft lap belts. Safety seats are secured in airliner 
seats by the lap belt. The child is held in the safety seat with a separate 
shoulder harness and hip restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 Lap belts on aircraft do not keep the safety seats stationary, Gowty said. 
Under hazardous conditions, the safety seat may lunge forward, striking the 
back of the seat in front of it. A child in that situation is likely to suffer 
serious head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Toddlers wearing aircraft lap belts are also at risk because heavy turbulence 
may cause them to bend at the waist and hit their heads on the bottom of their 
seats, Gowty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of eight forward-facing safety seats passed the crash test, the report 
shows. Gowty said those seats had a better fit with the aircraft lap belt. The 
seats that protected against serious head injury were the Century 2000 and the 
Evenflo Onestep 402, a discontinued model. 
</P>
<P>
 The seats that did not prevent serious head injury were Kolcraft Dial-a-Fit 
II, Fisher-Price Car Seat, Century 300 STE, Evenflo 7, Aviation Furnishings 
Carechair 2040-1 and Britax, a seat used in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are bound to revive a longstanding controversy over the use of 
safety seats on aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal aviation regulations permit children 2 and younger to travel on a 
parent's lap for free. But child safety advocates have long urged parents to 
buy a ticket for the child and use a car seat. They say it is difficult, if not 
impossible, for a parent to hold a child during severe turbulence or a crash. 
They say the car seat is needed because seat belts on aircraft cannot secure an 
infant. 
</P>
<P>
 For many years, airlines were reluctant to let parents use safety seats. They 
said the seats were bulky and blocked aisles, creating a possible safety 
hazard. But the industry changed its position after a child traveling on his 
mother's lap was killed with 111 other people in a United Airlines crash in 
Sioux City, Iowa, in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In that accident, the force of the crash swept the child from his mother and 
hurled him toward the rear of the plane. The child's mother was among the 
survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Tombrello, executive director of Los Angeles-based Safety Belt Safe 
U.S.A., says the FAA tests show the agency should require that parents use 
rear-facing car seats for infants. The agency and the airline industry have 
resisted such a requirement as too costly for parents who might have to buy 
tickets and airlines that might need to provide safety seats. The FAA has said 
the expense wasn't justified compared to the few lives that would be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA now says it is studying the issue and plans to provide a report to 
Congress by spring on whether child restraints should be required. In the 
meantime, the agency is encouraging airlines to offer discount fares to make it 
less costly for parents to use safety seats for children 2 and younger. 
Southwest Airlines offers a 10% discount on those tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of how to protect older toddlers is trickier. The FAA said it 
plans to devise new standards for safety seat testing and labeling. Safety 
advocates say changes are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple solution could be at hand. The FAA found that if the aircraft lap 
belt was affixed to the seat back 4.5 inches above its usual location, it 
securely held forward-facing child safety seats. "No head contact with the 
forward row seat back occurred during these tests," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 From a technological standpoint, the solution is child's play. Unlike car seat 
belts, lap belts in airliners snap in and out. A second snap-in location on an 
airliner seat would allow flight attendants to adjust the lap belt for 
forward-facing seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even such a simple solution would require a cash-strapped industry 
to spend money to prevent injuries that rarely occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always said that technology isn't the problem," said safety advocate 
Tombrello. "The problem is people not ensuring and demanding (that) technology 
is used." Crash Tests 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration tested eight randomly selected 
forward-facing child safety seats to determine whether they kept toddlers from 
injuring their heads on the seats in front of them during serious turbulence or 
crash conditions. The FAA said serious head injury occurs at a head injury 
computation of 1,000 or higher. The HIC is derived by measuring how fast the 
head accelerates.

COMPANY TOWN; BLOCKBUSTER TOASTS MERGER WITH VIACOM; DEALS: THE $8.4-BILLION 
STOCK SWAP IS APPROVED BY SHAREHOLDERS ON BOTH SIDES.

<P>
 Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. ended a spectacular seven-year run as an 
independent company Thursday with tears, champagne and flashy corporate videos 
at a special stockholders meeting that approved a stock-swap merger with Viacom 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders representing 57.7% of Blockbuster's outstanding stock, including 
its chairman and big stockholder, H. Wayne Huizenga, voted for the $8.4-billion 
merger announced in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal will create a global company with stakes in nearly every major 
segment of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be able to make a movie, put it in our theaters, show it on our 
pay-per-view channel and sell and rent it in our stores. We will also be able 
to publish the book, make the video game and sell it in our stores," Huizenga 
told hundreds of shareholders and Blockbuster employees at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined company will be a major movie maker, book publisher, cable 
service operator, entertainment retailer and theme park operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom's best-known properties include MTV, Paramount Pictures and Simon & 
Schuster. 
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga said the deal is worth about $30 a share to Blockbuster stockholders 
and will give them 52% to 53% of the combined companies' stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster's stock closed down 75 cents at $27.50 on Thursday on the New York 
Stock Exchange, and Viacom Class A shares fell 75 cents to $40.50 on the 
American Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom shareholders also overwhelmingly approved the merger in a separate 
meeting in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster founder Huizenga, who invested $18 million in a 19-store video 
rental chain in 1987 that now operates more than 37,000 video outlets and 600 
music stores worldwide, told shareholders that the firm needed to move into 
other areas of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also said Blockbuster could not hope to duplicate its phenomenal growth 
of the last seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy top Blockbuster executives and managers will stay on after the merger, 
Huizenga said.

EXPERT PREDICTS 2% EMPLOYMENT RISE FOR O.C.; OUTLOOK: CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY'S 
JAMES DOTI WARNS THAT A SLOWDOWN IN NATIONAL RECOVERY COULD AFFECT LOCAL 
HIRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's fledgling economic recovery is in danger of stalling as a 
slowdown in national economic growth discourages hiring by local employers, 
Chapman University President James Doti said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Doti, an economist whose forecasts for the county are widely followed by local 
business planners as they develop their strategies, stuck to his earlier 
prediction of 2% employment growth this year. That's about 22,000 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the pace of job growth could slow to 1.5% by mid-1995 if his 
scenario for the national economy proves accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The increase (in national economic growth) has come to an end. And if it's 
peaking, that means that employment growth (in Orange County) will begin to 
peter out," he said. His message was the most conservative of three forecasts 
heard by 600 local business executives at the Orange County Chamber of Commerce 
& Industry's annual economic outlook conference here. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists from Citicorp Investment Services in New York and First Interstate 
Bank in Los Angeles said they are optimistic about national economic growth -- 
predicting a 3% hike in the gross domestic product -- a key measure of the 
value of goods and services produced nationwide each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Doti said he expects declining defense spending to weaken the national 
recovery. That sluggishness should combine with several local factors, 
including slowed construction activity, to take the edge off Orange County's 
economic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong foreign trade will help keep the county from tumbling back into 
recession, he said. As an important distribution center, the county benefits 
from overall imports to the United States as well as from overall U.S. exports, 
Doti said. 
</P>
<P>
 He bases his projections on information about the national gross domestic 
product, defense spending, imports and exports, and Orange County construction 
values. Reliable data about local production, defense spending and trade is not 
available, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's gross domestic product is the most important of the four 
categories because many Orange County businesses sell their goods and services 
throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Doti was downbeat about the prospects of a growing recovery, a 2% job 
growth for the year would increase Orange County employment to about 1.14 
million jobs and keep it ahead of the rest of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Sanchez, regional economist for First Interstate Bank, said he expects 
statewide employment to increase by 1.5% through 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez said that while California's economy began recovering this year, 
employers are adding just 10,000 new jobs a month -- a third of the rate at 
which the state added jobs from 1983 to 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the slow pace, Sanchez said, "a lot of people aren't convinced that 
this (recovery) is the real deal." The conventional wisdom that California will 
continue to "underperform the U.S. for at least one more year" may be accurate, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 California's recovery seems disappointing because of the rapid growth that 
occurred before 1990, said Jon Goodman, director of the Entrepreneurial Program 
at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "You all have lived through a 40-year boom -- let me assure you, it was a 
binge -- and now you have one hell of a hangover," Goodman told a rapt 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Job growth is the key to recovery, Goodman said, and California is struggling 
to keep employers because new information and communications technologies will 
make it easier for businesses to locate in less expensive areas that are far 
from their markets. 
</P>
<P>
 To compete with less expensive states like Arizona and Utah, California must 
put a renewed emphasis on public education to attract and hold the companies 
that make use of the new technologies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire competitive advantage of the future relies on an educated work 
force. But it's getting harder and harder to staff businesses" in the region 
with well-educated young workers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, those well-educated workers that are available are often more 
knowledgeable about new technologies than their managers, putting a premium on 
the skills of the young and changing relationships within companies. Without 
improved education and major business restructuring to take advantage of 
technical know-how, Goodman warned, "this place is going to look like Detroit." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Kaitz, president of the California Cable Television Assn., said the 
spread of communication technologies such as facsimile machines, cellular 
phones and electronic mail means people have less tolerance for waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a message here for all of us . . . that the information superhighway 
is part of a culture of change," he said. Businesses that are able to take 
advantage of the fundamentally lower cost of instant communications will 
thrive, he said. Economic Growth Levels Off

 The Chapman Leading Indicator Series uses the nation's gross domestic product 
and foreign trade balance, along with local defense and construction spending, 
to forecast Orange County's non-agricultural employment levels. Percentage 
change in county employment and indicator series (figures show change from the

A REAL INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION ; FINANCE: BY PUTTING THEIR PORTFOLIOS WHERE 
THEIR PROGENY ARE, PARENTS CAN CASH IN ON A BIG NATIONAL TREND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe by late September you feel that you've already invested enough in 
"education." You've paid hefty tuition bills and spent more than you want to 
think about on trendy backpacks and binders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts make a compelling argument for really investing in education 
now. By putting your portfolio where your progeny are, you can profit a bit 
from everyone else's back-to-school spending. At the same time, you'll cash in 
on a big national trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The education business in the U.S. is big, is growing, and more importantly 
is changing. In our view, it is this process of change that creates the most 
exciting business and investment opportunities," Baltimore investment banking 
firm Alex. Brown & Sons says in a new research report. 
</P>
<P>
 It notes that the population of school-age children is growing at the fastest 
rate in nearly 30 years. Federal, state and local governments are relaxing 
tight constraints they had on school spending, and schools and parents are 
investing in new technological learning tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeping societal trends will put money in the hands of private companies, 
says Peter Appert, an Alex. Brown analyst in San Francisco. School budgets will 
shift slightly away from salaries and toward "productivity" materials, 
including software, computers and books. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, yuppie parents will shift their spending away from cappuccino 
machines and toward the computer programs that their tots are using in 
elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 So, concludes Appert, don't just buy the programs, buy into the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Wood, an industry analyst for Standard & Poor's, concurs. "The market 
for software that caters specifically to children has experienced significant 
growth in recent years and should continue to grow in the years ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood notes that the top selling CD-ROM multimedia titles all are children's 
games and learning programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood says children's software, in particular, is a highly seasonal business, 
with company performance strongest in the current August-to-January period. In 
spring, schools start placing their orders for next year, so the first quarter 
of the year is slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some educational investment ideas from Appert and Wood. As you peruse 
the list, be willing to wait patiently for bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft Corp. This company is much more than kids' software, of course, as 
it publishes operating and business software for all the major computer 
systems. Nevertheless, Wood labels Microsoft "the most threatening" new kid on 
the kids' software block. 
</P>
<P>
 He says Microsoft will make inroads into kids' products with television 
advertising and selling and free school-based family seminars that Wood likens 
to the "Tupperware" approach to marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Broderbund Software Inc., in San Rafael, Calif., is the largest and 
best-known children's education software producer, with products such as Print 
Shop, Treehouse and the popular Carmen Sandiego series. With new games in 
development, Broderbund is eyeing the nouveau "edutainment" segment of the 
market and could be a good long-term investment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scholastic Corp. This is Appert's personal favorite and not just because his 
4-year-old twin daughters play with some of its programs. This education 
publisher has long had a lock on school book clubs, is a leading publisher of 
children's nonfiction here and in Britain and has made smart alliances with 
Microsoft and Internet to provide CD-ROM and on-line services for 
schoolchildren. Scholastic also owns the currently hot "Magic School Bus" 
series, coming soon to a television near you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sylvan Learning Systems. This company has a different piece of the 
educational pie, as one of the largest tutorial services in North America. The 
firm franchises storefront "learning centers" and is also starting to get in on 
the public school contract market, delivering specialized services to schools 
that buy them directly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvan also is in the first year of a 10-year exclusive contract with 
Educational Testing Service to provide computer-based tests around the world.

O.C. BRIEFLY: HEARING DELAYED ON RECEIVER FOR TEACHERS INVESTMENT FIRM; CIBA 
BUYS PLANE PARTS MAKER 
</P>

 A judge Thursday postponed a hearing expected to decided if a receiver should 
take over Teachers Management & Investment Corp., the troubled Newport Beach 
firm that raised $1 billion from California educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Francisco F. Firmat will rule Monday on 
whether to appoint a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed in August by four teachers alleges that the company is 
insolvent and seeks appointment of a receiver for any remaining assets. The 
teachers also allege that the company lost $100 million through fraud.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 60,000 California teachers invested with TMI, many of them putting 
money into partnerships to buy undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI owners Maurice Shuman and James Martin deny any wrongdoing and say that 
the value of the company's assets declined because of the real estate downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorene Wolf, a senior lawyer with the state Department of Corporations, has 
strongly endorsed Dennis B. Schmucker, a San Diego bankruptcy expert, to be the 
court-appointed receiver for TMI. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Corporations, which is responsible for overseeing the sales 
of securities and limited partnerships in California, spent two years 
investigating complaints about TMI in the mid-1980s but did not take any 
action.

DISNEYLAND'S 31 LAYOFFS ARE FEWER THAN EXPECTED; EMPLOYMENT: LATE-SUMMER AND 
FALL ATTENDANCE AT ANAHEIM PARK REDUCED NEED FOR FURTHER STAFF CUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Disneyland said Thursday that it had laid off 31 clerical workers and 
supervisors -- far fewer than expected -- as part of its response to the lower 
attendance at the theme park during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of layoffs, a fraction of the 9,000-member work force, was lower 
than a division chief's previous estimate, mainly because the park's attendance 
figures started rising by late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to employees July 1, Disney theme park chief Judson Greene said a 
drop in foreign visitors had led to "somewhat soft" business results and 
predicted layoffs of 1% to 2% of the work force -- 90 to 180 employees -- if 
conditions did not improve. 
</P>
<P>
 But business picked up, Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said Thursday, 
and attrition and other factors also played a part in reducing the number of 
layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aim is to do business more efficiently, and in those terms, (the layoff) 
is not as serious as, at one time, we feared it might be," McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 While international tourists stayed away from the park, he said, strong local 
attendance helped make up for the losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really was a very healthy summer and an amazingly healthy fall," he said. 
"The outlook is brighter now. We are more optimistic than we were at the 
beginning of summer because of the turnstiles." 
</P>
<P>
 The park has been offering admission discounts to local residents all year 
with the exception of the peak summer months. About 11.4 million visitors went 
to Disneyland last year, according to industry estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it lacked a major new ride for summer, the park appears to have scored 
with patrons by staging a lavish daily parade based on "The Lion King," the 
company's hit animated feature film. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the park debuts one of its most elaborate rides yet: a new 
adventure ride based on the "Indiana Jones" movies.

CALIFORNIA CENTRAL TRUST BANK APPOINTED TO ADMINISTER FIRST PENSION ACCOUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday appointed California Central Trust Bank 
to administer about $250 million worth of investments remaining in failed First 
Pension Corp., one of Orange County's longest-running pyramid schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Lynne Riddle turned over to the Costa Mesa company, 
known as CalTrust, the chore of managing the accounts for most of First 
Pension's nearly 8,000 clients. 
</P>
<P>
 In about three weeks, CalTrust plans to provide investors with easy access to 
their accounts for the first time since all assets at the Irvine pension 
management firm were frozen in late April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we can get these investors on the road as fast as we can. They've 
been through a tough time," said Roni Renfro, president of CalTrust, a 
limited-service bank with $155.7 million in investments and other assets. 
"We're starting the process. Everything will be housed here by Oct. 17." 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension owners William E. Cooper, Valerie Jensen and Robert E. Lindley 
have pleaded guilty to defrauding investors of $121.5 million in an elaborate 
pyramid scheme through investments in mortgages that did not exist. The three 
are scheduled to be sentenced in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The assets being transferred to CalTrust involve about 7,000 accounts, mostly 
individual retirement accounts invested in stocks, bonds and mutual funds. 
CalTrust will not be administering funds invested in the mortgages that did not 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 CalTrust is receiving records from both First Pension and Summit Trust 
Services of Colorado, the now-failed trust company created by First Pension's 
three owners to handle client money. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors have about 45 days to decide if they want their accounts to remain 
at CalTrust or if they prefer to transfer funds to another pension 
administration company. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Snyder, the court-appointed receiver for Summit, said he is still 
trying to create a distribution plan for the remaining $9 million of the $34 
million in client funds that Summit was supposed to hold.

DOWNEY S&L PLANNING CONVERSION TO FEDERAL CHARTER; FINANCE: CORPORATE 
RESTRUCTURING WILL BE COMPLETED EARLY NEXT YEAR BY LAST MAJOR THRIFT STILL 
UNDER STATE AUTHORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI and HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downey Savings & Loan, the last major thrift still operating under California 
authority, said Thursday it will create a holding company and convert its 
operations to a federal charter. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey, with $3.9 billion in loans and other assets, expects to complete its 
new corporate structure by early next year, issuing shareholders stock in a new 
holding company called Downey Financial Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The charter conversion will leave only 11 thrifts still holding on to state 
charters. The California Department of Savings and Loan was a bustling office 
in the mid-1980s and was responsible for supervising and auditing more than 150 
of the 219 S&Ls then based in the state. But the thrift industry's financial 
debacle of the late '80s -- mainly a result of relaxed investment laws, insider 
fraud and lax supervision -- led to strict federal regulations that overrode 
most state laws, and the agency has now shrunk to just three full-time 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just makes sense to convert to a federal charter," said Stephen W. Prough, 
Downey's president. To keep a state charter while adhering to federal rules was 
too costly, he said. "Every time we file an application and pay a fee, we have 
to do it twice, once with federal regulators and once with the state." 
</P>
<P>
 The conversion and the creation of a holding company will also simplify 
entering new businesses, acquiring other thrifts and buying branches in other 
states. Downey said it has no acquisitions planned. 
</P>

 Last year, directors put the thrift up for sale but decided in November to 
take it off the market and instead boost its growth both internally and through 
purchases of branches and smaller thrifts. Since December, it has increased its 
assets by 11%, mainly by making more loans. 
</P>
<P>
 As a holding company, Downey Financial could also repurchase its own stock, a 
strategy that companies use routinely to increase dividends and boost share 
prices. Though industry analysts speculated that Downey might launch a buy-back 
plan, Thomas Prince, Downey's chief financial officer, said executives have not 
proposed any such action. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first six months of this year, Downey's earnings of $12.2 million were 
well below income of $31.7 million for the same period of 1993. Prince said the 
comparison is misleading, though, because a one-time accounting change in 1993 
gave the S&L a benefit that amounted to nearly the entire difference in profits 
between the two periods. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Downey's stock closed at 
$20.25 a share, up 25 cents.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; TAKING A CLOSER LOOK AT GENIE'S EVERY MOVE; QUALITY 
ANIMATION AND LASER TECHNOLOGY OPEN UP A WHOLE NEW WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES ON 
DISNEY'S 'ALADDIN.' 
</P>

<P>
 If Robin Williams' performance as the Genie in Walt Disney's "Aladdin" was too 
fast and furious for you to keep up with in the theater, try the new 
standard-play laser just released by Walt Disney Home Video ($50). 
</P>
<P>
 It gives you a chance to slow down and replay his transformations so you can 
catch every shape, every move and every joke no matter how quickly they come 
and go. 
</P>
<P>
 In this two-disc THX set, "Aladdin" flies, flails and flings about the room in 
lush, full-bodied color. You can even play the film one frame at a time to get 
at the secrets of marrying traditional animation with computer and paintbrush 
technology. Not to mention the rapid dialogue and vocal tricks of the talented 
cast. 
</P>
<P>
 High-quality animation and top-drawer laser technology were made for each 
other, and this 1992 Oscar-winner offers a sumptuous audio and visual feast. 
The Academy Award-winning score by Alan Menken, Howard Ashman and Tim Rice 
never sounded better. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly delineated chapter stops identify every song, including the 
Oscar-winner "A Whole New World," in a handsomely designed sleeved jacket, with 
charming drawings of the main characters. 
</P>
<P>
 If all this whets your appetite for more, if less elaborately presented, 
Disneyana, you need only turn to the company's "Walt Disney Mini Classics" and 
"Cartoon Classics" laser series. A delightful double bill ($37) serves up 
"Mickey and the Beanstalk" and "The Reluctant Dragon." Other pairings in the 
"Cartoon Classics" series ($25 apiece) offer a double bill "Starring Mickey and 
Minnie and Chip 'n' Dale," which includes 1938's "The Brave Little Tailor" 
among six offerings; another pairing of "Here's Mickey!" with "Here's Pluto!" 
takes in adventures from 1935 ("Mickey's Garden") through the early and 
mid-'40s. 
</P>
<P>
 A dog of an entirely different mien, the TV series "Family Dog" from Amblin 
Entertainment, follows the ill-fated bug-eyed canine through 10 episodes on a 
five-disc set from MCA Universal Home Video ($90). If you blinked and missed 
executive producers Tim Burton/Steven Spielberg/Dennis Klein's quirky take on a 
bizarre little dog's view of family life, you can catch it all at your leisure 
here. Laserbits 
</P>
<P>
 New Movies Just Released: The THX letterboxed edition of "Schindler's List" is 
in stores this week from MCA Universal at $50; the THX limited Collector's 
Edition is scheduled for release on Wednesday at $140.  
</P>
<P>
 "Serial Mom" (HBO/Savoy, $40); "Mother's Boys" (Miramax, $40); "The House of 
Spirits" (LIVE, $40); "Naked Gun 33 1/3" (Paramount, $40); "Farewell My 
Concubine" (Miramax, $40). 
</P>
<P>
 Coming Soon: "Jurassic Park" will come to laser letterboxed and in THX on Oct. 
12 from MCA Universal, $75 (standard play) and $45 (extended play).

TOO SWEET FOR POP?; IN THE AGE OF ALIENATION, FRESH-FACED FRENTE! SEEMS 
BLISSFULLY BACKWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years from now, when filmmakers first begin to mine the early '90s for 
nostalgia-themed movies, the soundtrack album that results will be a loud, 
depressing roar of pain and anger, of grunge and gangsta rap. 
</P>
<P>
 The era will be best remembered in pop music for producing a snarling, 
screaming Hydra of rage and alienation, and, in some cases, outright 
sociopathy. The bulk of popular music today, like it or not, is simply no damn 
fun -- in fact, it's downright scary at times. 
</P>
<P>
 So what to make of the buzz revolving around Frente!, the fresh-faced, 
shiny-happy Australian pop group that appears Sunday at the Coach House? So 
innocent and naive-sounding, the group at times seems blissfully backward; it 
stands out from the pack like Pee-wee Herman in a mosh pit. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon first listening to the group's recently released debut, "Marvin the 
Album," one is taken aback by its simplistic minimalism, its childlike lyrics, 
the goofy sketches in the CD booklet that look like classroom doodlings 
confiscated by an irate teacher, and the picture of the band members screwing 
up their faces as if they just got a whiff of something most unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Angie Hart sounds as if she's 12 years old (she's 22). Often, she's 
backed solely by guitar player Simon Austin, whose playing could most 
charitably be called amateurish. At points, the album sounds like somebody's 
home-made demo tape, or a recording of people serenading friends at a party, 
happily flailing away next to the chips and pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Frente! is without merit or appeal. Hart is an appealingly guileless 
singer who shuns the overdone affectations utilized by many contemporary 
"stylists" in favor of her own, honest, pretty (if unsophisticated) voice. The 
album has an infectiously melodic pop instinct, and the cheery, overall sound 
is particularly fresh and engaging in the gloom-and-doom '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's meant to be pretty stripped back," Austin said in a recent phone 
interview from a motel room in Hawaii. "We concentrate on the lyrics a lot, so 
we want them to be listenable. The way the songs are written, they really had 
to be played the way we play them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Austin, the group's chief songwriter, is a friendly, disarmingly cheerful 
bloke. The band's press photo shows a smiling, gnomish Austin sitting 
Indian-style on a sidewalk, his baseball cap angled trendily backward, even if 
the effect makes him look more boyish than hiply menacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Were he an American, you'd half expect Austin to punctuate sentences with 
"golly gee." As it is, he's prone to laugh giddily at the writer's 
observations, whether or not humor was the intent. Austin, 27, comes off as a 
Jonathan Richman from Down Under, sans the studied infantilism. He doesn't have 
a whole lot to say, but he's undeniably enthusiastic and likable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I wrote my first really bad songs when I was about 15 or 16," he 
said, laughing. "I still write bad songs, but I only submit the best ones, 
hopefully. I think we try to paint pictures of what humans really think of, the 
kind of stories that go on inside of people's heads. We have songs that are 
about every kind of human experience. I guess we're all hopeless, emotional 
romantics who like stuff about love and grief and joy and anger and all that 
sort of stuff. We don't have songs about politics and stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's only partially true. In the Austin-penned "Cuscutlan," he writes, 
"I don't want to die/I'm as innocent as anybody/I don't even know how to spell 
revolutionary." 
</P>
<P>
 Frente! came together five years ago in Melbourne, a spontaneous formation of 
four people, including drummer Alistair Barden and bassist Tim O'Conner, who 
had little in common but the desire to make music. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met at a bar called the Putter's Club, Austin said. "We're all different 
sort of people, we don't really hang out. We all like different music, and 
we're all different ages. Angie and I are pretty close friends, but we all go 
our separate ways when the tours are over. Al is 29, and is a jazz player, 
really. Tim is 31, and he's a punky kind of guy. Angie and I have our own 
things we really like. With that push and pull, you arrive at Frente!, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While most groups just starting to pull from the pack spend many idle moments 
fretting over career direction and the next marketing ploy, Austin seemed 
genuinely unconcerned where he was headed in the biz, adopting a "just glad to 
be here" attitude that seems to sum up the Frente! philosophy succinctly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most important thing is to continue surprising ourselves and 
write a lot of songs that hopefully are good. Career-wise, we don't think about 
it a lot, because in a band, everything you get is a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 * Frente! appears at 8 p.m. Sunday at the Coach House, 33157 Camino 
Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. The Lemmings open, tickets are $15.

MIGHTY DUCKS / '94-'95 PREVIEW; LOOKING FOR A NET GAIN; THE MIGHTY DUCKS HOPE 
THEIR OFFENSE GETS A JOLT FROM PAUL KARIYA, BUT THE PRESENCE THE 19-YEAR-OLD 
ROOKIE BRINGS TO THE SECOND-YEAR TEAM TRANSCENDS MERE GOAL-SCORING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day the Mighty Ducks used their first-ever draft pick on a smallish 
playmaker from the University of Maine, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner 
watched as a smiling, boyish Paul Kariya pulled the Duck sweater over his shirt 
and tie and jet-black hair. And as he watched, standing almost alone, Eisner 
actually said out loud to no one in particular, "Perfect. Perfect. Perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner had seen no more than a glimpse of the skill, speed, creativity and 
intuition that have made Kariya the Ducks' best player from the moment the 
19-year-old rookie stepped on the ice with them in early September. What Eisner 
saw, with a corporate eye practiced in assessing the powerful appeal of 
idealized youth, was a boy who exuded genuineness, intelligence and modesty, 
mingled with the air of a talent yet to be fully seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya is the All-American kid who isn't American at all. He is Canadian, and 
his hair, along with the shape of his eyes and structure of his face, hints at 
his Japanese and Scottish heritage -- his father, Tetsuhiko, was born in an 
internment camp in Canada during World War II, a difficult chapter of family 
history that Kariya says is rarely spoken about. All together, it is a 
combination that makes Kariya a powerfully appealing image of the increasingly 
multiethnic face of society. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also one hell of a hockey player -- an edge-of-your seat hockey player 
who is already the second-most watchable one in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just has that knack . . . You start to expect something when he's on the 
ice," Duck Coach Ron Wilson said. "It's like a baseball game, in a way. When 
Frank Thomas comes to bat, you expect something, whether it's a great strikeout 
by the pitcher or a home run. It's like that when you play against Wayne 
Gretzky. You wait for his shift because when he's on the ice, something could 
happen at any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who saw Kariya play with the Ducks during the exhibition season knows 
what Wilson means. There are the metal-to-a-magnet passes, the uncanny eye for 
the open man, and the rousing breakaway chances that the crowd is already 
learning to sense even as they unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 So often, Kariya tries something so clever it challenges one's ability to 
describe it. A backhand pass between his legs, a spin to find room to thread a 
pass. In an exhibition game against Boston in San Diego, he created a breakaway 
by dashing to the blue line and lifting Ray Bourque's stick just enough to let 
a pass slide under, then chased down the puck for what proved to be no more 
than a missed breakaway opportunity, but a spectacular one. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't surprise me in anything he does, because he's done it at every 
level," Duck General Manager Jack Ferreira said. "I sure enjoy seeing it, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 The three teams that passed on Kariya before the Ducks took him fourth in 1993 
should be second-guessing themselves already. Back then, he was a skillful 
young forward whose size left some scouts wondering if he could make it in the 
body-crunching world of the NHL. He had just won an NCAA Division I 
championship at Maine and become the first freshman to win the Hobey Baker 
award, given to the best U.S. college hockey player -- though that has never 
been a guarantee of professional success. But in the year that followed, Kariya 
has grown a bit more solid at 5 feet 10 and truthfully, about 165 pounds -- a 
size not really that rare in the NHL. More important, he proved on a 
silver-medal winning Canadian Olympic team and gold-medal World Championships 
team that his skill, cleverness and elusiveness more than make up for his 
stature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Paul play in the Olympics and World Championships, and even then you 
knew this was not a fluke or a couple of good games," said Duck center Stephan 
Lebeau, who is 10 pounds heavier but an inch or so shorter than Kariya. "I knew 
he was good, but he's even better than I thought he was. And I knew he was 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt this guy is going to do things in this league. He's going to 
be fun to watch. He surprises opponents all the time -- even sometimes his own 
teammates. His passing ability is something to see." 
</P>
<P>
 NHL players aren't given to hyping rookie prospects, but they have seen enough 
of Kariya to know he is special. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel him, where he is," said Anatoli Semenov, who centers the line 
with Kariya on the left wing and another rookie, Valeri Karpov, on the right. 
"Paul, you know, he's unbelievable player, I think. He's very talented." 
</P>
<P>
 Center Bob Corkum says "there are not very many guys who have been in the 
league a long time who are as good as Paul is right now," and Lebeau, asked who 
Kariya resembles in the NHL, can think of no more than two players. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to say Gretzky right away, that's for sure. They're the same type of 
hockey player," Lebeau said. "If he's going to put up the same numbers as 
Gretzky, that's another question, but who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 And besides Gretzky? Lebeau pauses, thinks. "Maybe Doug Gilmour, a little 
bit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The comparisons to Gretzky are not really comparisons, not in the sense that 
anyone is predicting Kariya will become hockey's all-time leading scorer or 
acknowledged as the greatest to play the game. They are more an attempt to 
describe how Kariya plays, a style that is in obvious homage to Gretzky -- 
right down to the fact, Wilson needles, that Kariya can be a bit lazy getting 
back on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya gave every indication during the exhibition season that he will be a 
point-a-game type player, even as a rookie. Some experts even see him finishing 
in the top 15 in the league in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kariya's career and Gretzky's clearly are not on parallels. Kariya will 
turn 20 on Oct. 16. The year Gretzky turned 20, he won the second of his eight 
consecutive NHL scoring titles, notching 109 assists in a 164-point season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area that will have to be monitored and kept under control is 
expectations relative to points," said Shawn Walsh, who was Kariya's coach at 
Maine. "It's still an expansion team. I think once they move to the upper 
echelon of teams, he'll be a terrific point-producer. He may not produce like 
that right away." 
</P>
<P>
 But Gretzky-like? 
</P>
<P>
 "Gretzky is in a league by himself," said Glen Sather, Gretzky's longtime 
coach in Edmonton and general manager of the Canadian team Kariya played for at 
the World Championships this summer. "I don't think anybody compares to Wayne. 
Wayne's the most superior hockey player we'll see in our lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul Kariya is a very gifted player. He sees the ice, the way all great 
players do. He has great instincts, good work habits, he's dedicated and 
sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he'll be a great player in this league. That takes time to 
prove. He's a rookie. He'll have good nights and bad nights. He's not going to 
step into this league and dominate right away . . . I'm sure Paul Kariya is 
embarrassed if anybody tries to compare him to Wayne." 
</P>
<P>
 As Kariya has said, "To be mentioned in the same breath as Wayne Gretzky is a 
tremendous honor, but to me Wayne Gretzky is untouchable. Incomparable. He 
should be left alone on a pedestal." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when Kariya sets up behind the net, he is using the advantages of that 
protected position in a way virtually created by Gretzky. When he makes a 
no-look pass or kicks the puck off his skates up to his stick, much the same. 
Even when he swirls behind the play, cheating into position for a breakout 
pass, it is like Gretzky. So much of what Kariya does, in fact, was directly 
inspired by the young Gretzky, who Kariya watched hour upon hour on videotapes 
as a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It began extremely early, and I think he identified with him because he was 
smaller in stature than most players," said Sharon Kariya, Paul's mother. "To 
this day, when he comes home from school or wherever he's been, he puts on 
tapes of Wayne Gretzky. We've got all the Canada Cup games and Gretzky's own 
personal tapes. He's always watched them over and over. Possibly by the time he 
started playing junior hockey, he started watching other people too, to learn 
from them, but Gretzky continued to be his model." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, a lonely voice growing up in North Vancouver, British Columbia, 
cheered for the Edmonton Oiler dynasty. The day Gretzky was traded to Los 
Angeles, his mother picked up 13-year-old Paul at school and tried to break it 
to him gently. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't believe it, he absolutely could not believe it," Sharon Kariya 
said. "I said, 'Paul, I think Wayne Gretzky is going to be traded from 
Edmonton.' He said, 'No, he's not.' And I said, 'Well, I think we'll hear 
something about it on the news tonight.' He was absolutely flabbergasted." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the Kings replaced the Oilers as Kariya's favorite team and he 
never reconsidered until the day he became a Duck. He waited a year before he 
put on the Duck uniform for real -- mostly because he wanted to play for Canada 
in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he remembered one time Wayne Gretzky saying he regretted not being 
able to participate in the Olympics," Sharon Kariya said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the ice, Kariya is full of flash and boldness and risk. Off it, he says, 
with his typical half-suppressed smile, "I'm a very conservative person." 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived at training camp addressing the 39-year-old Wilson as "Mr. Wilson," 
until he was invited -- begged, teased and implored -- to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 When he decided to use a sliver of his three-year, $6.5-million contract to 
buy his first car, "something safe" was all he had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon and T.K., as Paul's father is called, have a family philosophy that one 
should do one's best to contribute, and do it quietly. They try to be diligent 
that no matter what accolades their five children receive, they are treated as 
equals at home. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilson and Ferreira had dinner at the Kariya home a few months after the 
draft, it was Paul who got up to clear the table at his mother's prompting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single time I come home, the big thing is I have to make up my bed," 
Kariya said, laughing. "I wake up every morning and my mom says, 'Did you make 
up your bed?' I come home, and I don't get treated special, probably the 
opposite. It brings you down to earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson nods his approval. "That's what makes Paul so different," he said, 
pausing for effect. "He's normal." 
</P>
<P>
 That unassuming nature has been an asset every time Kariya has walked into a 
dressing room for the first time -- with his junior hockey team in Penticton, 
B.C., at Maine, the Olympics, the World Championships and now with the Ducks. 
Every time, there have been skeptics, and every time, he has won them over. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Paul has an ability to be soft-spoken and so respectful that he 
commands respect because people recognize he's not brash and cocky," said Tom 
Renney, the Canadian Olympic coach. "He's a young man here to do business." 
</P>
<P>
 The true moment of acceptance usually comes very early, and usually on the 
ice. (Few things are more endearing than putting the puck on a player's stick 
when he's wide open in front of the net.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Montgomery, a college teammate now with the Montreal Canadiens, still 
remembers the first time he discovered Kariya's sixth sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time we played together, I was open for a pass, and I've always 
been in the habit of shouting to let people know I'm there," said Montgomery, 
one of Kariya's closest friends. "Just as I started to yell, the pass came. We 
got back to the bench and he said, 'I know you're there. You don't have to 
yell. It just lets the opposition know you're there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When Kariya arrived at Maine, Montgomery says, "the amazing thing was how 
smart he was and how mature he was." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was being offered all kinds of money by junior teams, but he came to the 
University of Maine. He knew what he wanted out of life. If you don't know him, 
people are going to think he's a little reserved or standoffish. He's not, he's 
just always analyzing the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Ladouceur, the 12-year veteran who is the Ducks' captain, has noticed 
how Kariya blends in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's bending over backward to stay out of the limelight," Ladouceur 
said. "The last thing he's tried to do is flaunt things, like his money. It 
would be one thing if he showed up here on the first day in a big 
Mercedes-Benz, but he's taken the shuttle from the Disneyland Hotel just like 
everybody else. He's come in and tried to gradually acclimate, to see what's 
going on. He really doesn't say a lot. He's taking everything day by day, kind 
of reading the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 What Kariya does on the ice is sometimes so imaginative -- and sometimes so 
unimaginable until he does it -- that people wonder about the connection 
between this thoughtful, respectful young man and the impulsive, instinctual 
game he plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pushes the envelope in terms of his creativity. That's fun to watch," 
Wilson said. "That's probably where he feels the most comfortable, on the ice. 
That's where he shows you his real personality." 
</P>
<P>
 He plays with an exuberance that draws almost every eye in the building, and 
even as she tries to set aside a mother's pride, Sharon Kariya knows it has 
always been that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a little child doing his skating lessons, you just zoomed in to him" she 
said. "It was electrifying because you could just tell he so enjoyed doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The people who know Kariya best say his game is the product of an extremely 
analytical mind, one that anticipates actions and reactions, points and 
counterpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as he is very spontaneous, very creative and imaginative, that in 
itself is part of his game plan," said Renney, the Canadian Olympic coach. 
</P>
<P>
 A split-second improvisation can have a polished look, almost as if he's done 
it before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's something he's already seen, already done many times in his 
mind, maybe 10, maybe 50 times," Montgomery said. "When he does it, it looks 
new, but it isn't new to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what he does the night before a game is he lies down and listens to 
soft music. It's a mental thing, and he wouldn't really have to even listen to 
the tape, he knows it by heart. He gets into a deep concentration and sees 
himself making plays and trying new moves." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya still thinks through situations at night before he goes to sleep, and 
as he sits through long plane flights. The tape, though, is history, worn out 
by constant playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Off the ice, when you're sleeping in bed, it helps to visualize things," he 
said. "Then when I'm on the ice, it allows me to do things without thinking. 
Otherwise you're constantly doing your thinking on the ice instead of reacting 
and letting it flow." 
</P>
<P>
 The same disciplined, logical mind has made every important decision in 
Kariya's life seem drawn-out and deliberate. The business major in him 
considered the Ducks' contract offers with such a poker face it unsettled as 
veteran a negotiator as Ferreira, who suddenly wasn't sure what Kariya would do 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya took weeks to decide if he would return to Maine for the fall semester 
before the Olympics, weeks to decide if he would go back to Maine or start 
negotiating with the Ducks after the Olympics, and day upon nerve-racking day 
-- for the Ducks -- to decide if he would accept their last offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's never in a rush to make a decision," Montgomery said. "He analyzes the 
pros and cons. Maybe people should learn from that, because every decision he's 
made has been the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a decision is made, though, his creativity transforms even coaches and 
teammates into spectators, and anyone who has been around him long has a 
favorite Kariya move. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most amazing thing I've seen him do, he was coming across the blue line 
and he faked a drop pass to me," Montgomery said. "I thought it was coming, 
then he takes a stride and taps it back with his skate and up to his stick and 
takes a shot right off. It's just the things he can do with the puck and his 
skates that amaze me." 
</P>
<P>
 The one that draws raves is the 360-degree spin-a-rama, a move Kariya keeps 
under wraps until the right moment appears. 
</P>
<P>
 Renney remembers, "there was one I saw where he came from the right boards, 
through the neutral zone, across the red line all the way to the left wing 
boards, threw the puck in front of him and did a 360 as the defenseman went to 
play his body. Paul put the puck through the defenseman's legs and then Paul is 
alone behind the defensemen who by that time is on his knees. Paul picked it up 
behind him, all alone in front of the net." 
</P>
<P>
 On the ice after practice or in his room watching tape, Kariya is constantly 
toying with and trying to perfect his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got that ability to be creative in looking at himself and specifically 
identify areas where he can improve himself," said Walsh, the Maine coach. 
"It's rare in the '90s to have terrific players who keep from getting 
satisfied." Having an ability to improve your game off the ice is important 
when you grow up in temperate North Vancouver, not exactly the land of frozen 
ponds and unlimited ice access. So much of what Kariya has learned has been off 
a TV screen, or imagined in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll go into the back yard and practice shooting the puck, then he'll come 
in and stick-handle on the rec room floor," Sharon Kariya said. "He spends a 
lot of time doing that. (Younger brothers) Steven and Martin play a lot with 
Paul and they're always trying new things. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't really mattered whether he's playing golf, playing tennis or 
swimming. He studies the sport and works very diligently at improving in the 
sport. My husband would work with the children when they learned to do the 
butterfly or the breaststroke, and they'd do it (in the rec room) before they 
went into the pool." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Olympics, where Canada lost the gold medal to Sweden in a shootout 
when Kariya missed the final penalty shot, breakaways became one of his little 
obsessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, my breakaways need a lot of work," he said, overstating the case 
against himself. "You always try to constantly improve. You have to analyze 
your game and see where you get your scoring chances. I seem to get one 
breakaway a game. It's just recognizing what you need to do. It's seeing where 
the goalie is in the net, seeing what's open. I always have a move in the back 
of my mind, but you take what the goalie gives you." 
</P>
<P>
 His other projects have been more unusual. A left-handed shooter, he has 
worked on a right-handed wraparound shot so he can score from either side of 
the net without having to use his backhand. He's also honing a right-handed 
one-time shot to use when the pass is coming to that side of his body. And 
one-timing the puck -- shooting off the pass in one swift motion without 
stopping the puck -- is so difficult there are plenty of NHL players who can't 
do it on their natural shooting side. 
</P>
<P>
 In another drill, he works to knock down waist-high passes with his stick, a 
skill that is useful to control the puck on breakaway chances. What is his 
success rate? 70%? 80%? What you want, Kariya says quietly, is 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice thing is, he's a perfectionist in striving to improve," said Walsh, 
the Maine coach. "He's not a perfectionist who gets caught up or overly 
negative if perfection doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The perfect perfectionist. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect.

MIKE PENNER: MIGHTY DUCKS / '94-'95 PREVIEW; THIS GREAT GAME BEST SERVED ON 
ICE, NOT THE ROCKS 
</P>

 "I see great things in hockey. It's our game -- the North American game. It 
will take our people indoors, fill them with sausage and beer, give them a 
larger physical stoicism. Tend to relieve us from being a nervous, dyspeptic 
set. Repair these broken noses, and be a blessing to us. . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Walt Whitman never really said that. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he had, old Walt's words would have never seen the light of some 
windy, droning, 18 1/2-hour PBS documentary titled, simply, grandly, "Hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey is too unpretentious for that. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walt would have loved hockey, had he lived a century later. How could he 
not? The game is a poet's delight -- a daiquiri-blend concoction of the rhythm 
and flow of soccer, the smash-mouth violence of football and the fast-breaking 
go-to-the-hole energy of basketball. All the things that make the world go 
'round. And not a rain delay in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for a brain delay, which is the only 
thing that could possibly stop hockey in its blade tracks, as has been the dark 
threat in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wee Gary Bettman and his Napoleon complex have hogged far too many headlines 
lately, climbing up that stepladder to reach the microphone and rail against 
the players for wanting to be paid like professional athletes, circa 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the players wouldn't agree to artificially stifling their earning power 
after 75 years of having the owners quite naturally stifle it for them, well, 
Wee Gary was going to stamp his foot and order the NHL season to hold its 
breath until the faces of everyone who truly cares about the sport -- you, me, 
Wayne Gretzky -- turned blue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, we continue to wait for the puck to drop. That's all that 
should happen this weekend. Put the puck in play, put the players in play. 
</P>
<P>
 Because, to paraphrase Walt again, we see great things in hockey this season, 
given half a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paul Kariya. Will he be able to play up to half the hype -- which, to date, 
has pegged him as equal parts Gretzky, Gandhi, Tom Cruise, Merlin the Magician 
and John, Paul, George and Ringo? 
</P>
<P>
 * Barry Melrose. He appeared grim and uptight through much of his rookie turn 
as a playoff analyst for ESPN last spring. Will the look remain the same as he 
realizes Rick Tocchet's on the trainer's table, Luc Robitaille's in Pittsburgh 
and no one's left to take pucks from Gretzky and aim them toward the net? 
</P>
<P>
 * The New York Rangers. For 54 years, they prayed for a savior and got the 
devil, Mike Keenan, instead. Did they sell their souls for one chance to roll 
the Stanley Cup down the steps of Penn Station? Is Colin Campbell the right man 
at the absolute worst possible time? Where will any of us be in the year 2048? 
</P>
<P>
 * Mike Keenan. How long will it take for hockey's Billy Martin to burn all his 
bridges in St. Louis, too, to say nothing about The Arch? 
</P>
<P>
 * The San Jose Sharks. They were the success story of last season's playoffs, 
they just added Viktor Kozlov to their burgeoning Russian Red Light Army and 
they seemed poised to step up into the Western Conference's ruling class in 
just their fourth year. Then, their unflappable goaltender, Arturs Irbe, has 
his left hand chomped by his pet Labrador. How will the team respond to the 
first recorded case of dog biting Shark? 
</P>
<P>
 * The Detroit Red Wings. If they are really only a goaltender away from the 
Stanley Cup, who says that goaltender's name is Mike Vernon? 
</P>
<P>
 * Pavel Bure. With Mario Lemieux back on the shelf and Gretzky soon to turn 
34, can a diminutive right winger from Moscow playing in British Columbia win 
the hearts and minds of the American megastar-craving masses? 
</P>
<P>
 * The New Jersey Devils. Can they win the Stanley Cup? And if they do, will we 
need to consult the engraving on the side of the trophy before we can play 
"Name Five New Jersey Devils"? 
</P>
<P>
 * Brett Hull. St. Louis is a city of nearly 400,000 people, 34th largest in 
the United States. But is it big enough for Hull and Keenan, at least through 
next June? 
</P>
<P>
 * The Philadelphia Flyers. Bobby Clarke is back. Ron Hextall is back. The 
Flyers are calling this their throwback season, but to where? How about 
1988-89, the last time Philadelphia qualified for the NHL playoffs? 
</P>
<P>
 * Luc Robitaille. If he is truly going to pick up the slack left behind by 
Lemieux, will somebody in Pittsburgh inform him that goals scored during the 
playoffs count, too? 
</P>
<P>
 * Sergei Fedorov. Is this the year we finally get the spelling right? That's 
two O's in Fedorov. As in "G-O-O-A-L!" 
</P>
<P>
 * The Buffalo Sabres. If they could ever assemble all their injury-prone 
players -- Pat Lafontaine, Alexander Mogilny, Craig Simpson -- on the ice and 
in uniform at the same time, wouldn't Buffalo be a much happier place in late 
January? 
</P>
<P>
 * The Mighty Ducks. With Karpov, Semenov, Shtalenkov and Tverdovsky in the 
fold, do they now have enough to stave ov San Jose's cosmonauts in the race for 
the Western Conference playoffs? Has ex-Canadien, ex-Sabre, ex-Devil, ex-Maple 
Leaf, ex-Canuck and ex-Islander Tom Kurvers finally found a purple and green 
place he can call home? Will Ron Wilson implement a fine system for any player 
using the words "sophomore" and "jinx" in the same sentence? Even with Kariya, 
how does a second-year NHL team improve on 33 victories and the same amount of 
road wins -- 19 -- as the Penguins had in 1993-94? 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, we don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 As I said before, we are waiting for the puck to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Any day now will be just fine.

MIGHTY DUCKS / '94-'95 PREVIEW; DUCKS HOPE NEW FACES ENHANCE OVERALL PICTURE; 
ANALYSIS: TALENTED ROOKIES KARIYA AND KARPOV RAISE EXPECTATIONS. BUT HOW WILL 
THEY MIX WITH VETERANS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody expected enough of the Mighty Ducks in their first season. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, will everybody expect too much? 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson's band of fringe players and unproven talents banned the 
E-word to fend off the bad karma of expansion last season, then shared an NHL 
record with Florida for most victories by a first-year team (33). 
</P>
<P>
 They also finished with 71 points -- 10 points out of the playoffs, and five 
ahead of the Kings -- and swept the two-game season series with the eventual 
Stanley Cup champion New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that sterling rookies Paul Kariya and Valeri Karpov have arrived, along 
with help for a dismal power play from Tom Kurvers, it's tempting to imagine 
they'll be much better. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at the talent out there, and we're making passes we would not 
normally make last year," said defenseman Bobby Dollas. "I can't say we'll win 
the Stanley Cup or even make the playoffs. We're still building. But I look 
around the dressing room, and compared to last year's team, we've got a lot of 
talent." 
</P>
<P>
 The test will be whether the Ducks can mix in added skill and confidence 
without losing last season's disciplined work ethic -- which was the key to 
their season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't fear our work ethic will slacken at all," Wilson said. "We have young 
people who will add spark when the old guys are getting gray in the beard." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest question during the exhibition season was simply when the season 
would start. Making the playoffs might be the season's goal, but General 
Manager Jack Ferreira had another -- acknowledging NHL labor tension with a bit 
of gallows humor -- "To play 84 games." 
</P>
<P>
 Year 2 is sometimes a dicey season for expansion teams. Instead of improving, 
10 of 19 have gotten worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in something called the sophomore jinx," Wilson said. "Half 
the teams have done better their second year, half have done worse. It's like 
flipping a coin, half will be heads and half will be tails." 
</P>
<P>
 The Winnipeg Jets, who joined the league from the World Hockey Assn. in 1979, 
were 19 points worse in their second season. The biggest improvement was by the 
New York Islanders, who joined the league in 1972 and improved by 26 points 
their second season. Of course, it wasn't hard to get better. They were 12-60-6 
in their first season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've improved our team. I think we should be better," Wilson said. 
"But that's not taking into account that other teams will be better too." 
</P>
<P>
 A closer look at the personnel: FORWARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Left wing Kariya, right wing Karpov and center Anatoli Semenov transform the 
offense -- make that the first line -- from ugly duckling to swan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya appears ready to contend with Quebec's Peter Forsberg for the Calder 
Trophy as rookie of the year, and Karpov's maturity at 23 prepares him for a 
solid first year. Semenov was the Ducks' best player last season before left 
wing Stu Grimson's accidental check dislocated his elbow and limited him to 20 
of the last 55 games. If the sometimes delicate Semenov, 32, stays healthy, his 
rookie linemates could lift him to his best season since coming to the NHL in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the play of Karpov and rookie right wing John Lilley that convinced 
management they could afford to trade right wing Terry Yake -- the team's 
leading scorer in the first season with 52 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the forwards -- who unlike the first line won't be allowed to 
slack off on defense -- are being challenged to prove what they did last season 
was no fluke. It will also be crucial for them to maintain the grinding play 
and willingness to go into the corners personified by former captain Troy 
Loney, who was traded to the New York Islanders for Kurvers in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Bob Corkum fell a point shy of leading the team in scoring with 51 
points -- 41 more points than his previous best -- when he severed a tendon in 
his foot late in the season. With his big shot, solid two-way play and a more 
confident approach, he is penciled in as the second-line center. The Ducks are 
very high on him -- although like others around the NHL, they're waiting to see 
if he has a second 20-goal season to make up their minds. Corkum shrugs: "If 
I'm not getting respect, I might be open more." 
</P>
<P>
 Right wing Joe Sacco is one of the 15 Ducks whose opportunity to play resulted 
in career highs last season. More important than his 37-point total was his 
red-hot 14-goal second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Stephan Lebeau's 80-point season in Montreal two seasons ago makes him 
the Duck with the best career high, but he didn't hit his stride in 22 games 
after being traded to the Ducks last season and will probably start the season 
as the third-line center. 
</P>
<P>
 Left wing Garry Valk can add scoring, and right wings Todd Ewen and Grimson 
add punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: Kariya and Karpov are big-time talents, but only Hartford, Tampa 
Bay and Ottawa scored fewer goals than Ducks last season. DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' success last season was almost entirely the result of solid, 
disciplined defense, with huge contributions from a stable of grinding forwards 
and terrific goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
 That Bobby Dollas was plus-20 on an expansion team last season is an 
astounding statistic. That he's playing to increase his leverage in hopes of 
doubling his bargain-basement $275,000 salary should add a bit of interest to 
his season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurvers adds more offense than defense, as does rookie Oleg Tverdovsky, the 
second overall pick in June who will be brought along slowly, especially after 
missing most of the exhibition season with a groin injury. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sean Hill and Bill Houlder both elsewhere after summer trades, Wilson 
should have fewer postgame interviews when he's left steaming about defensemen 
getting caught up-ice -- but he also lost 66 points of scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 The defensive workload falls to Dollas, veteran Ladouceur and Don McSween. 
David Williams and Robert Dirk are solid defensive blueliners. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: The fact no Duck defenseman should overlook is that the four 
defenseman who had negative plus-minuses last season -- Houlder, Hill, Mark 
Ferner and Anatoli Fedotov -- are no longer in Anaheim. GOALTENDING 
</P>
<P>
 Only eight teams in the NHL had goals-against averages under 3.00 and save 
percentages over .900 last season, and the Mighty Ducks were one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 They did it with a tag-team effort from Guy Hebert, Ron Tugnutt and Mikhail 
Shtalenkov. But when Hebert won the coaches' confidence, Tugnutt was traded and 
Hebert emerged as a front-line NHL goalie, winning a career-best 20 games and 
notching two shutouts. His goals-against average (2.83), save-percentage (.907) 
and games played (52) were also career highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's words aside, Hebert is the No. 1 goalie going into the season -- 
although Wilson has proved he will go with whomever's playing better at the 
moment, as he did last season by unseating Hebert briefly in favor of 
Shtalenkov. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wilson as cognizant as he is of the travel demands on a West Coast team, 
both goalies will play. Shtalenkov should be a first-rate backup -- and if 
Hebert falters, he'll push him. Though Shtalenkov appeared in only 10 games, 
his numbers were sterling -- a 2.65 goals-against average and a .909 
save-percentage with a 3-4-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: Wilson will say 1-A and 1-B half a dozen times, but Hebert will 
prove his net worth again. SPECIAL TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya transforms both the power-play and the penalty-killing teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The power play was worst in the NHL last season and was so ineffective that at 
times it was hard to tell which team had the man advantage. Having Kurvers 
playing one of the points also helps, and 1994 first-round pick Tverdovsky 
might step in at the other, though he'll be brought along slowly after missing 
most of the exhibition season with a groin injury. The biggest differences, 
though, will result from the playmaking of Kariya and a healthy Semenov and the 
finishing touch of Karpov. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty-killers did diligent work last season, and ranked sixth in the 
league, and it will take work not to slip. The difference this season should be 
in shorthanded goals. The Ducks had nine all last season. With his open-ice 
speed and anticipation, Kariya could approach that many by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottom line: Power play will be better, still not stellar, but the real 
excitement will come with Kariya killing penalties. Player Profiles

stay-at-home defenseman. Won the Ducks' plus-minus title with a plus 20. Set 
career highs for games played (77), goals (nine) and points (20). Previous 
bests came with Detroit in 1990-91.

 Solid, dependable forward last season. Set career highs in points (34), goals, 
assists, games played and penalty minutes. Missed first eight games with 
sprained knee, then played 74 of the next 76 games. Had two two-goal games and 
had three assists in a Nov. 3 game against Dallas.

 Duck leader and eighth in the NHL in penalty minutes with a whopping 272 last 
season. Epitomized team's grinding, physical style of play. Also found time to 
score nine goals with nine assists -- both career highs. Expected to again be 
tough guy along with Stu Grimson.

 Will begin the season with San Diego. Had played only a handful of NHL games 
in stints with Buffalo and Washington before last season. Played 50 games and 
had eight points, both career highs, for the Ducks. First game with the Ducks 
was his first in the NHL since 1990-91.

 Stepped quickly into his role as the team enforcer, piling up 199 penalty 
minutes in 77 games. Worked well with Todd Ewen, the team's other tough guy, 
making it difficult for teams to rough up the expansion Ducks. No radical 
departures in his style expected this season.

 Hasn't played a game yet, but he's already the most celebrated Duck in the 
team's short history. Turns 20 Oct. 16. Expected to add tremendous offensive

 Veteran of the Russian Olympic team and Traktor Chelyabinsk of the Russian 
Elite League. Had 30 points in 32 games for Traktor before joining Olympic team

 The Ducks' first-round pick (second overall) in the 1994 draft. Was ranked as

MIGHTY DUCKS / '94-'95 PREVIEW; AND NOW FOR THE SEQUEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their inaugural National Hockey League season, the Mighty Ducks were one of 
the most successful expansion franchises, both on the ice and at the box 
office. But after an off-season of working to improve the lineup, they'll now 
try to get to the next level -- the playoffs. Three Key New Faces 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Paul Kariya is the player the Ducks hope to build around, but they 
acquired several others in an effort to improve weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Valeri Karpov: Right wing 
</P>
<P>
 Signed by the Ducks July 11 after playing for the Russian Olympic team. 
Expected to boost the team's scoring potential with his creative offensive 
play. Had 30 points in 32 games with Traktor Chelyabinsk last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kurvers: Defenseman 
</P>
<P>
 Acquired from the New York Islanders for Troy Loney on June 29. It's hoped he 
can bolster the Ducks' power play, the league's weakest last season. He's an 
offensive-minded defenseman who had 40 points in 1993-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Oleg Tverdovsky, Defenseman 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' first-round pick (second overall) in the 1994 draft. He could be an 
offensive force on the power play and certainly will add size and speed to the 
defense. Only 18, he had 19 points for Krylja Sovetov Moscow last season.

MIGHTY DUCKS / '94-'95 PREVIEW; OWNERS, PLAYERS IN LABOR STANDOFF 
</P>

 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman announced last week that the regular season 
would not begin unless a new collective bargaining agreement is reached. As of 
Thursday's deadline for this section, there was no such agreement and Bettman 
was expected to postpone the season's opening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks are scheduled to begin the 1994-95 season Saturday on the 
road against the Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's developments included an offer by the players to sign a pledge not 
to strike if the games and contract talks continued.  
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a better way to spread the wealth among the 26 teams. The league 
and the NHL Players Assn. are at odds on how best to accomplish this. The 
league wants the players to bear some responsibility, perhaps including a cap 
on player salaries. Players are opposed to any plan they believe restricts 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Bettman, representing NHL owners, and Bob Goodenow, executive director 
of the NHLPA, haven't been able to bridge the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides also met Monday and Tuesday for a total of 15 hours, but were no 
closer to an agreement than when they began talking. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few days, a dark cloud of pessimism has gathered at training camp 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibition games have ended with players lining up to shake hands in a show of 
solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's waiver draft was postponed indefinitely by Bettman. Under league 
rules, it must be conducted within seven days of the start of the season. It 
will be rescheduled when the starting date is certain. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, when Bettman made the announcement regarding the start of the 
regular season, he denied the players would be locked out. But it's simply a 
matter of semantics. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Goodenow, in a letter to players, said he believes an agreement 
is impossible by Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Players, who have been without a contract since Sept. 15, 1993, say they are 
willing to play under the same conditions as last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman and the owners are concerned that the players would strike at the end 
of the season, wiping out the playoffs in much the same manner as the baseball 
players' strike forced cancellation of the World Series.

MIGHTY DUCKS / '94-'95 PREVIEW; PRIME EXAMPLE; LADOUCEUR'S HARD WORK COMMANDS 
RESPECT FROM TEAMMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Around and around they go, performing hockey's version of wind sprints as 
another practice draws to a close. A dozen young men in one group skate five 
swift laps around the ice while another dozen wait their turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Always near the front of his pack, Mighty Duck defenseman Randy Ladouceur 
leaves many others with younger, faster legs far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter the drill, it's always the same routine for Ladouceur, 34. He 
doesn't know how to do things differently. He's a model of consistency, a 
walking, talking how-to video for young players trying to make their mark in 
the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no secret to it, Ladouceur insists. Every last bit of success he has 
had in a career that spans 823 NHL games over 12 seasons can be attributed to 
plain old hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, it dawned on him that the way to staying productive was to 
simply outwork, outhustle everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hardly a novel approach. But it has helped keep Ladouceur at the top of 
his game, one of the league's steadiest, most dependable defensemen in the last 
12 seasons. Now it also serves to reinforce his role as the undisputed leader, 
the captain of the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great leader, an experienced veteran," center Bob Corkum said. "In my 
opinion, and I don't want to put words in the coaches' mouths, but he was our 
most outstanding defenseman last year. In my eyes, he's the perfect example of 
a captain." 
</P>
<P>
 Said defenseman Bobby Dollas: "They made a good choice for captain. He's not 
flashy, just a stay-at-home, steady Eddie." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what other qualities Ladouceur brings to the Ducks, goaltender Guy 
Hebert said, "Age." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused, laughed and added: "No, no, no. I'm just kidding. He has a world of 
experience. He helped out a great deal last year because not a lot of guys had 
NHL experience. He gave us that guidance when we'd be up, 2-1, 3-2, going into 
the third period last year. 'Laddy' is a great choice for captain." 
</P>
<P>
 Ladouceur has never been considered a star defenseman, probably because he has 
never been much of a scorer, never been a tough guy. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's always been there for the Detroit Red Wings, Hartford Whalers and now 
the Ducks, defending the net and leading by example. If you don't notice his 
play, it's probably not your fault. He has been an invisible hero more often 
than not. 
</P>
<P>
 When it seemed his career might wind to a close in Hartford, that he might go 
into coaching after another season or two, the Ducks selected him in the 
1993-94 expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The move rekindled Ladouceur's spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great out here," he said days after signing a two-year contract 
extension that will pay him about $600,000 this season. "It's been a great 
experience for me. It's been a lot of fun. I was in Hartford seven years and I 
enjoyed it there. We owned a home there, so I was a little disappointed to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Now) I couldn't be happier. I got the chance to play a few more years for a 
great organization. They've treated us first class from the start. I'm really 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 12th NHL season, at 33, Ladouceur played a career-high 81 games with 
the expansion Ducks, scoring one goal with nine assists. He sure didn't play 
like a man ready to step into a suit and direct the action from behind a bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal goal was to play as long as I could," he said. "As long as I 
stayed fairly healthy, as long as I was feeling good and having fun, I was 
going to continue to play." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in Hartford, Ladouceur seriously considered coaching, speaking at 
length with Brian Burke, former Whaler general manager and now NHL senior vice 
president and director of hockey operations. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed like a natural route. 
</P>
<P>
 "As it turned out, I got picked up in the expansion draft and Burke was out of 
Hartford (in the summer of 1993)," Ladouceur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Southern California sunshine and Disney's millions could be reason 
enough to keep playing. But neither was in evidence inside the Ducks' frigid 
practice rink in Anaheim recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks had just flown in that morning from an exhibition game in Denver and 
were trying to shake the weariness from their bones. The coaching staff wanted 
a solid 90-minute workout and Ladouceur was determined to make sure the players 
complied. 
</P>
<P>
 He whipped himself around the ice, hollering encouragement, needling when 
appropriate and generally providing the push his teammates needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, someone asked where his constant devotion to hard work comes from. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a certain extent it comes with maturity," Ladouceur said. "Everybody (in 
the NHL), when they played in the minors or in juniors, was a star. There came 
a point in my career where I realized I'm by far not the best guy out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized I could work harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were around me when I signed in 1979 and said I'd still be playing, I 
would have said, 'You're crazy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He played with Reggie Leach in Detroit, and Reggie's son, Jamie, in Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 He also played against Duck Coach Ron Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played against him?" Wilson cracked. "Did I? I'm not that old. I've always 
looked up to Randy Ladouceur." 
</P>
<P>
 At 39, Wilson is only five years older than Ladouceur. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might be as old as the coaches, I don't know," Corkum said, breaking into 
a smile. "You tend to listen to a veteran like Randy. He tells you things, not 
to knock you, but to help you better yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hebert: "Down deep, we all know if we worked as hard as he does then 
maybe we'd play 13 years in this league." 
</P>
<P>
 Ladouceur's roots are humble, shared by so many NHL players, including the 
game's greatest names. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladouceur's road to the NHL cut through the snowy Ontario, Canada, 
countryside, bouncing along with other youngsters with cold noses in a school 
bus rented by his father, Roger. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad (who died in 1991) was probably my biggest influence as far as 
instilling work ethic," Ladouceur said. "He gave me the opportunity to play. He 
used to tote our team around to play in tournaments. He exposed me to hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would rent an old, rickety school bus. We'd throw all our gear in the back 
and our traveling team would play in all the small towns (in Ontario). It's the 
same story for three-quarters of the guys in here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ladouceur has been able to transform that spark of passion into a lengthy 
career, distancing himself from so many others. He acknowledges his good 
fortunes and gives special thanks to John Barrett and Reed Larson for taking 
him under their wing when he was breaking in with Detroit in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went out of their way to help me," Ladouceur said. "It made a world of 
difference, whether it was a ride to the rink or whatever. . . . the little 
things that made the transition that much easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Years passed and Ladouceur began to help younger players. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hartford, they called him 'Papa Bear' and named him captain early in the 
1991-92 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going up the road on my way home one day," former Hartford Coach Jim 
Roberts once said. "I saw Laddy with one of the kids helping him get a car." 
</P>
<P>
 When he came to the Ducks, he knew the team needed to unify quickly if it was 
to amount to anything. The only player he knew was forward Terry Yake, a 
teammate in Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, everybody was forced into the same situation," Ladouceur said. 
"Nobody knew anybody. There were no cliques or anything. We all came together 
for support. Somebody found a good furniture store. That was a big deal. 
Everyone was learning things together." 
</P>
<P>
 On the ice, the Ducks looked to Ladouceur and Troy Loney for support and 
leadership. Loney, the 1993-94 captain, was traded to the New York Islanders 
this summer and Ladouceur is now the unquestioned leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always hear his voice," Hebert said. "He's always talking, settling you 
down. He was the key to the seasons some of the younger players had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laddy was the key to all that."

MIGHTY DUCKS / '94-'95 PREVIEW; FERREIRA NOT HAPPY WITH HOCKEY'S NEW BOTTOM 
LINE; BUSINESS: NEVERTHELESS, ANAHEIM GENERAL MANAGER OPENED DISNEY'S 
POCKETBOOK TO SIGN TOP PICKS BEFORE TRAINING CAMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's tough to be a visionary when your office doesn't have a window, but Jack 
Ferreira manages to persevere. 
</P>
<P>
 In his second season as the Mighty Duck general manager, Ferreira directs the 
present and plots the future from The Pond's basement. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the hall, last office on the right. 
</P>
<P>
 From his command post, Ferreira contemplates all the great issues of the NHL 
in the 1990s -- a new collective-bargaining agreement, trades, money, draft 
picks, money, scouting, money, European imports, money, making the playoffs, 
and, of course, money. 
</P>
<P>
 Like professional baseball, basketball and football, the business of hockey 
now seems to be all business. These days Ferreira sees money as the central 
issue to more and more aspects of his job. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't please him. 
</P>
<P>
 He made that clear in a recent interview that touched on subjects ranging from 
skyrocketing salaries to the rise of street hockey in Southern California to 
the Ducks' off-season signings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest thing about this camp is that I haven't had any calls from 
agents," he said, only partly kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack, Paul Kariya's agent on line 1. Says he wants $6.5 million over three 
seasons.  
</P>
<P>
 Jack, Oleg Tverdovsky's agent on line 2. Says he wants $4.2 million over three 
seasons.  
</P>
<P>
 Jack, Nikolai Tsulygin's agent on line 3. Jack, Valeri Karpov's agent on line 
4. Wait, don't they have the same agent?  
</P>
<P>
 Jack? Jack?  
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira managed to sign all his top draft picks, before camp opened Sept. 4. 
By the looks of things, the Ducks are vastly improved offensively, thanks in 
large part to youngsters such as Kariya. Ferreira is pleased with the team's 
progress, hoping it has advanced far enough to make the playoffs this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But during training camp, a dark cloud -- a possible lockout by owners -- was 
hanging over management, fans and players, who have been without a collective 
bargaining agreement since Sept. 15, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all got to learn a lesson from baseball," Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a keen sense that without a World Series for the first time since 
1904, the time is right for hockey to cultivate new followers. This is 
particularly true in Orange County, where it's tough to miss new converts. They 
filled The Pond last season. And they're often clogging the middle of your 
streets, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came around the corner in my housing development (recently) and two 
different groups of kids were playing street hockey games," Ferreira said. 
"There was one group with skates on and one group without. I roar laughing when 
I see kids playing hockey on a basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you go to a game, it's hard not to get hooked." 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side, a protracted lockout could prove ruinous. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira believes salaries, particularly for rookies, are out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stars are always going to get paid," he said. "It's the middle guys who 
are going to get hurt. Economics becomes the determining factor. All the best 
players aren't in the league. You can't afford to keep middle of the road guys. 
You have to keep bringing in new guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our problems is entry-level salaries. There is a pyramid structure of 
salaries. If this continues all the first- and second-year guys are going to be 
at the top. And I'm not sure that's right." 
</P>
<P>
 Few NHL GMs have had to wrestle with rookie salaries the way Ferreira has had 
to recently. The Kariya talks spanned 14 months and the money eventually paid 
to the Ducks' top draft pick in 1993 was staggering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never looked it as a 14-month holdout," Ferreira said. "We encouraged him 
to go to the Olympics. We wanted him to go back to school for the first 
semester. Really, it was only the three or four months since the World 
Championships (which ended in early May) that we were negotiating. The first 
offer we made was after the Olympics. It was rejected and I wasn't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "The frustrating times were after we made our final offer. Down deep I could 
not imagine him turning it down." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Ferreira's second go-round as the GM of an expansion franchise. He got 
the San Jose Sharks up and running before he was ousted in a front-office 
battle after the first season. He had left a job as the Minnesota North Stars 
GM to join the Sharks in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 There were great lessons to be learned from the San Jose experience. Knowing 
the pratfalls a first-year team can suffer made the Ducks stronger -- 
literally. 
</P>
<P>
 Their first season, the Sharks went 17-55-5; the Ducks were 33-46-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's different is the size of the guys we have here," Ferreira said. "It 
gave us an identity right away. It allowed us not to get pushed around. It 
helped us win 19 games on the road. We had an older team, a real character 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to get guys who we thought were heart players. We tried to stay away 
from the moaners and groaners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to get guys who were ready for a jump up. (Bob) Corkum was in that 
category. Garry Valk was a good, late addition. Guy (Hebert) was ready to take 
off. I thought (Mikhail) Shtalenkov was the best goalie in the minors the year 
I saw him (in Milwaukee in 1992-93)." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, San Jose had a brilliant run in its third season, beating heavily 
favored Detroit in the opening round of the playoffs before falling to Toronto 
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't looking for someone to clap me on the back," he said. "I was happy 
to see it. I was happy to see them (the players he brought to San Jose) have 
success." 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of large contracts given Kariya and Tverdovsky, the Ducks 
have done business like the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially there was a perception, particularly among veteran Canadian hockey 
writers, that the Ducks, with all of Disney's millions, would be able to buy a 
Stanley Cup in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The lengthy battle to sign Kariya apparently has halted such talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira finds it mildly amusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll never see us trying to lock up every free agent there is," he said. 
"Disney doesn't operate that way. Eventually it may get to the point where 
maybe there's one guy who can make the difference in winning the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to an agent once and he said, 'Disney is making all this money on 
The Lion King.' I said, 'Well, Disney is a $7-billion company. They could buy 
the NHL if they wanted to.' Just because we can doesn't mean we should be so 
foolish." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira spends a great deal of time making sure nobody gets the impression 
that he's foolish. He's a student of other sports, of other general managers. 
He calls former Minnesota Twin and now Chicago Cub GM Andy MacPhail his idol, 
admires San Diego Charger GM Bobby Beathard and has read all he can about Red 
Auerbach. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended the Rams' 1994 draft and, in addition to learning that it would 
have been better to simply take Trent Dilfer and avoid the ridicule, he came 
away enriched. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he realized the NFL runs its draft for maximum media exposure. Second, 
he saw how involved the Ram coaching staff was in the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 "(In the NFL draft) each team is in their local city," Ferreira said. "We 
would certainly get more coverage if we handled it the way the NFL does it. 
There's so much more hype to the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the way the Rams do things, it's similar. They're talking to 
scouts, rating players, looking to get the best athletes. The way they evaluate 
the players is different in football, too. Because there is so much more film 
and video, their coaches have more input rating players. Hockey doesn't film 
that much. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Coach) Ron Wilson never saw Tverdovsky until he got here. You try to give 
the coach a mental picture of what a player can do, what he's like on the ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming to the West Coast, to sunshine in December instead of snow drifts, has 
forced Ferreira to do business differently, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to get up and put on a pair of shorts and go into the back yard 
with a cup of coffee and read the paper," he said. "I wasn't kidding the other 
day (at Kariya's first press conference) that that was the first time I'd worn 
a tie all summer." 
</P>
<P>
 He can live with that.

MIGHTY DUCKS / '94-'95 PREVIEW; RUSSIAN CONNECTION; FOR THREE YOUNG DUCKS, 
OFF-ICE ADJUSTMENTS ARE THE TOUGHEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Some of the most demanding practices Valeri Karpov has faced in the NHL were 
conducted at the dining room table of his still-bare Irvine apartment, with his 
sticks propped in a corner near the front door and his other equipment lying 
outside on the patio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine I'm a real estate broker, and you come in and tell me what you want," 
said Dimitri Agratchev, a Walt Disney Co. translator and tutor. "How can I help 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have any house?" Karpov asked in a slightly halting voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Agratchev: "What do you do? For a living? What is your job?" 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov: "I work for hockey team, Anaheim?" 
</P>
<P>
 Agratchev: "You work for a hockey team? You are a player? Oh, wonderful! I 
have many houses for you. Are you looking to buy or rent? 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov: "Rent. I need three bedrooms, with a yard for my son?" 
</P>
<P>
 Agratchev: "How much would you like to pay? 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov: "As little as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Agratchev: "That is not always good. . . . Would you be prepared to go a 
little higher for a place ideal for a child with a big yard and a swimming 
pool?" 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov: "OK. Good deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Agratchev: "How important is a swimming pool?" 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov: "Very." 
</P>
<P>
 Agratchev: "Important?" 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov: "Very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Agratchev: "Can you live without a swimming pool?" 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov: "Better with a swimming pool." 
</P>
<P>
 A swimming pool is not a necessity in Chelyabinsk, the industrial city Karpov 
is from in the Ural mountains. It's known as the place where Siberia begins. A 
dishwasher and a "meek-row-wave" are other items Karpov wanted to have ready 
before his wife and 1-year-old son arrived this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov's world-class hockey ability has brought him to a new life in Anaheim 
at 23, along with two other rookies from the former Soviet Union. Nikolai 
Tsulygin, 19, is from Ufa in the autonomous Russian republic of Bashkiria, home 
to a huge oil refinery around which much of the life of the town revolves, and 
Oleg Tverdovsky, who holds a Russian passport but is from Donetsk, a mining 
town in the coal fields of economically strapped Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Life is harder and more bleak in their cities than in the more cosmopolitan 
and European cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg. If not for hockey, Tsulygin 
would probably have followed his mother and father into the road-building 
industry, for which he has a technical degree. Tverdovsky, asked what he might 
be doing, only beams. "I cannot really imagine life without hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 To discuss what is different about their new world is to begin a conversation 
that would never end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything," Karpov says simply, with a shrug and a smile. Here, there are 
bank machines at almost any corner or convenience store, ready to spew forth 
money. "How convenient," Karpov notes in Russian. In all of Moscow, there may 
be three, he says. Here, there are cellular phones available in every stereo 
store -- a definite threat to any budget -- and an endless array of hockey 
highlight tapes and video games. How do you say video game in Russian? Karpov 
shrugs the shrug again and laughs. "Nintendo." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as fortunate as they feel to be playing hockey and making a living 
beyond their imagination in North America, the young Russian players are 
sensitive to the sort of post-Cold War American superiority they sometimes feel 
is a personal put-down. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the sort of thing we have to deal with, that people sometimes dismiss 
Russia as a backward country," Tverdovsky said. "Sometimes they hear us speak 
Russian in a store someplace, and they look at you in a different way as if you 
come from this really different and backward place. While it is true that 
Russia and the economy, in particular, are in decline, I feel that it has 
nothing to do with people as individuals and it's very unfair to treat people 
in that way." 
</P>
<P>
 They also notice the way people sometimes speak to them as if they are not 
very intelligent at best and children at worst -- even though they know more 
English than those who look down their noses at them do Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get away from that, one needs to learn English," Tverdovsky says simply in 
Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian players are no longer an anomaly in the NHL. The Ducks' Anatoli 
Semenov, 32, is a five-year veteran and Vancouver's Pavel Bure, 23, is one of 
the league's biggest stars. But the adjustment to a new language and culture is 
still difficult for the new players who arrive -- and one some players make 
more quickly than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov, who is four or five years older than the other Russian rookies and 
players who played for Russia in the Olympics at Lillehammer, has had no 
trouble stepping on the ice, where he is on a line with rookie Paul Kariya and 
Semenov. And though he knew only the Cyrillic alphabet when he arrived in 
California this summer, he has now passed his written and driving exams to 
acquire his driver's license after several attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky is the youngest of the Russian rookies and, at 18, is here without 
any family, unlike the others, who are both married. But he has a playful, 
outgoing personality and -- knowing where he was headed -- he took English in 
high school, where he made almost all 5s, the equivalent of a near straight-A 
student. He is given to concluding translated interviews with a startling, only 
slightly accented comment, such as, "Next time we interview in English." 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky's big accomplishment so far was passing the written test for his 
license on the first attempt -- something many native English speakers fail to 
do. But the driving test? 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes certain skills that are not the way people drive on the road," he 
said through Agratchev. "They want you to keep turning your head, like on a 
swivel. And go very slowly and keep looking at the speedometer." 
</P>
<P>
 Tsulygin, a gangly youth whose slouched shoulders suggest an adolescent 
awkwardness, negotiated a contract that would allow him to return to Russia 
this season, and has been assigned to the Central Red Army team. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning home is not always an appealing option. Tverdovsky, who was born in 
Ukraine but chose Russian citizenship in order to play with the more 
competitive Russian national teams, hopes to live here permanently, bringing 
his parents and 9-year-old sister with him. 
</P>
<P>
 After signing a three-year, $4.2-million contract this summer, he must be wary 
of reports of extortion attempts by Russian organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, he is aware that it is a concern, and if he goes back he will go to the 
Ukraine," Agratchev said. "He will not go to Moscow and spend time in Moscow 
because there he feels is not very safe. It is not as if you are guaranteed as 
soon as you come to Moscow you will be hit or something, but certainly it is 
not very safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Agratchev, a former professor and high-level simultaneous interpreter, works 
for Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner as an international business 
development adviser. He tutored Karpov and Tsulygin extensively during the 
summer, and has helped Tverdovsky at the draft and when he arrived shortly 
before training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 He has taught them English from a text designed for practical living, from 
"Making Wise Purchases in the Grocery Store" to "Housing for the Family." 
</P>
<P>
 One chapter they can skip is Unit 8: "Finding a Job." 
</P>
<P>
 On the ice, the players rely on the universal language of the game, where a 
stick tapped sharply on the ice is calling for a pass, and a defensive pair 
learn intuitively which defender will take the man and which will chase down 
the puck. 
</P>
<P>
 New drills can be a challenge, which is why Coach Ron Wilson looks to see 
where the young Russian players are before starting a drill at a spot in the 
line well in front of them, giving them a chance to watch and imitate. Wilson 
was in Vancouver when Bure arrived speaking little English, and his attitude is 
that the players have no option but to immerse. He will not learn any Russian 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know a word except, 'Nyet,' he said, and then added a teasing 
reference to his U.S. team's victory over Russia in the World Championships 
last spring. "Whenever they're getting too big, I just say, 'USA 3, Russia 1.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest challenges are the everyday ones, like understanding the American 
banking system. Karpov's joke is that the best Russian bank is "in a stocking 
at home." Buying a car is difficult, too, with the option to lease and the 
confusing absence of a hard-and-fast price (imagine the palpitations of a car 
salesman's heart when he realizes he has a young millionaire who barely knows 
the language on his lot). 
</P>
<P>
 There are embarrassing moments, too, like the time when Tverdovsky saw a young 
woman in a store who had in her hand the exact item he was searching for. He 
pointed and tried to tell her he wanted something "like" that, only to have the 
girl think he was telling her he "liked" her. 
</P>
<P>
 Their feelings about life at home in Russia are mixed, because the political 
upheaval has brought both good changes and bad. Tverdovsky, who knew little of 
the Russian Orthodox church as a child, now wears a gold crucifix on a chain 
around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was little in the old Communist days, I knew very little about it," he 
said in Russian. "These were not things people talk about or things people did. 
I know I was christened, baptized in a church. Yes, I feel it is an important 
part of life to go to church. It makes you feel good to go." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter the economic difficulties or the brutalities of the old regime, 
these players have been proud to play for Russian national and junior national 
teams and hope to do so again, even if most of their time is spent in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it matters a great deal. It's very important (that we are) 
Russian," Tverdovsky said in Russian. "I think to anybody the country where a 
person was born and raised, it's a great honor and privilege to represent that

 "I think he'll get a lot more opportunities, and an opportunity to get a 
better education certainly, than at home," Karpov said through Agratchev. "He 
will be able to adapt much better to normal American life -- much better than 
his parents. He will in many ways probably grow up to be American. I'm saying 
that because I know some other Russian kids who came over who were even older 
who are like Americans now. My wife and I will try to do our best to make him 
learn the Russian language and not ignore the place we are from." Foreign Farm

 Bird of Quintain -- Several words were dropped from a review Thursday of "Bird 
of Quintain" at California Repertory Theatre in Long Beach.As a result, a line 
of criticism referred to the wrong scene. It should have read: "the last scene 
between Amelia, Putnam and Quintain should be re-thought. It defies logic, in 
spite of its fantasy form, and weakens the powerful finale."
