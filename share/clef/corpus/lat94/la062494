 The only disaster that hasn't befallen L.A.: The employee newsletter sent to 
the Woodland Hills office of Fireman's Fund announced that the company's 
wedding insurance policy has been "broadened to include tantrums by Mother 
Nature that preempt a wedding party with blizzard, quake, hurricane, cyclone, 
tornado, typhoon, tidal wave, wind storm or" -- and this is the one that caught 
our eye -- "erupting lava." 
</P>
<P>
 What's Fireman's Fund trying to do -- tempt the gods here? Next thing you know 
there'll be smoke issuing from the top of Mt. Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On second thought: We're surprised the wedding insurance policy doesn't also 
cover postponement because of an attack of killer bees.

<P>
 Press releases we never finish: "Driven by the President's national 
performance review," began this bulletin from Edwards Air Force Base, "the 
continuing defense drawdown will require the Air Force Flight Test Center to 
accelerate and expand previously planned civilian reductions." 
</P>
<P>
 So far there seems no drawdown of Pentagon doublespeak. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Talk about big drawdowns: The city of Long Beach seems to have temporarily 
closed it borders, according to an otherwise friendly sign at one branch of its 
Convention and Visitors Council. Wonder if Signal Hill or Lakewood have heard 
anything? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Reminds us of that bumper sticker, "Play an Accordion -- Go to Jail": Rhino 
Records, known for its offbeat releases, sent out a detailed questionnaire to 
industry writers as part of an effort to update and compartmentalize its 
mailing list.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a contributing writer for 'Polka Today,' for instance, we may not 
be able to justify sending you our pricey Otis Redding box," Rhino said, "but 
we might like to send you 'On Yo' Feet: The History of '70s Polka.' " It 
continues: "Sorry, literalists, don't ask us to send this title to you -- we 
just made it up!" Gee, and that's one of our few areas of expertise, too.

 Connecting to L.A.: Name the recent TV movie that portrayed a one-time North 
Hollywoodian. Count yourself an honorary NoHo resident if you said "Amelia 
Earhart: The Final Flight," the story of the aviator who disappeared in 1937. 
Jim Mullen, the mordant wit who writes Entertainment Weekly's Hot Sheet column, 
summed up her final voyage this way:

<P>
 "Proof that it's not only men who won't ask for directions." miscelLAny:

<P>
 It was the scene of the most collisions in L.A. County -- and proud of it! But 
no more will the area west of the corner of Colorado and Ocean avenues in Santa 
Monica have that distinction. The bumper car ride on the Santa Monica Pier has 
been shut down.

HOW TO BREAK THE CYCLE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE; MORE THAN LAWS, AND LAW 
ENFORCEMENT, WILL BE NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spousal abuse, especially of women, has deep roots in history and culture. The 
famous and seemingly innocuous phrase "rule of thumb" is said to spring from 
the old English common law that allowed a man to beat his wife with a rod no 
thicker than his thumb. Sure, the legal concept of women as chattel is now, 
fortunately, dead and physical abuse of a mate in the United States is a crime 
-- a misdemeanor or felony depending on the circumstances. But the problem, the 
abuse, continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to enforce existing laws leave much to be desired. And even when laws 
are enforced, the task of fighting spousal abuse can often be complicated by 
the unique cultural, social, economic and personal web that can ensnare a man 
and a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 All too often the question arises: Why does a person stay in an abusive 
relationship? Or people secretly wonder if she (or he) "deserved it." 
</P>
<P>
 THE MISCONCEPTIONS: Such questions reflect how the deeply rooted beliefs about 
dominance and violence color our view of marriage and relationships. No one is 
immune from misconception -- not judges, police, prosecutors or legislators, 
regardless of gender. That much is clearly illustrated in the controversy over 
how the system handled past incidents of spousal abuse by former football star 
O. J. Simpson, who now stands accused of murdering his ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and a male friend of hers.  
</P>
<P>
 In view of the massive publicity in the Simpson case it may come as a bit of a 
surprise that California is a leader in both enforcing laws against spousal 
abuse and prosecuting violators. The state's stalking laws, for example, allow 
police to arrest on the basis of threats or proximity rather than waiting until 
the known batterer again harms -- or kills -- the object of his rage. In Los 
Angeles, $23 of the $39 cost of a marriage license goes, aptly, to services and 
compensation for battering victims. Police are trained in domestic violence 
issues and since 1986 have been mandated to arrest violent batterers without 
the support or even encouragement of the victim if injury is evident. In Los 
Angeles County, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, who is in charge of the Simpson 
murder prosecution, has a career-long record of concern for domestic violence 
law enforcement. He did not come to this issue for the first time last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A primary barrier to more forceful prosecution is the sheer volume of 
complaints. The 20,000 cases of domestic violence handled by the city 
attorney's office each year is second in number only to drunk driving cases. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW PROPOSALS: It took the grisly death of Nicole Simpson to focus attention 
on worthy domestic violence proposals that had been stalled in the state 
Legislature. These include Assemblyman John Burton's (D-San Francisco) bill for 
minimum sentencing and mandated counseling of batterers, another by 
Assemblywoman Hilda L. Solis (D-El Monte) to create a state registry of known 
offenders and one from Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos) to mandate training 
in domestic violence issues for judges. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law alone is not enough. Breaking the cycle of domestic violence is 
also a task for family, church, schools, friends, neighbors and the media. We 
all must actively educate against abuse and work to provide support for victims 
seeking escape from violent relationships. In addition, support services must 
be available in various languages and contexts so that they are accessible to 
Southern California's many communities.  
</P>
<P>
 Attacking the problem of spousal abuse with laws is, in one sense, the easy 
part. In order to change the environment that breeds such abuse, the daily 
mixed messages sent about what love means -- what men want, what women want and 
what men and women expect from each other -- must change. That will require a 
societal effort that no mere piece of legislation can address.

PARIS TRIES TO MITIGATE A DISGRACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foreign troops are going to the aid of Rwanda -- finally. After months of 
unchecked killing and international posturing, France is taking the lead; but 
is that the good news or the bad? 
</P>
<P>
 With the blessings of the talky and inept U.N. Security Council, France is 
sending in a 2,500-person force that includes marines and Foreign Legion 
paratroopers. Its ambitious goal is to protect the Tutsi minority from further 
massacres without itself getting bogged down in the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutsi rebels are scarcely grateful. They claim France provided arms, advisers 
and cash to Rwanda's army, which is dominated by Hutus, opponents of the Tutsis 
in the internecine conflict. Those weapons, the rebels believe, allowed 
government troops to massacre Tutsi civilians after a suspicious plane crash 
killed Rwanda's Hutu president in April. That makes France the enemy, and 
complicates the mission. That France is neutral after the body count has 
surpassed 200,000 is of no solace to Tutsis who have lost entire families. 
</P>
<P>
 French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told a Paris newspaper, "It is no longer 
the time to stand by and deplore the massacres with folded arms." Paris has a 
point, because that's exactly what the rest of the West is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Most African nations too -- with the notable exceptions of Ghana and Senegal 
-- have failed to respond to Rwanda's plight, even though U.N. Secretary 
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has pleaded with African leaders. Several 
promised troops but most of these later begged off, saying they have problems 
at home or can't afford it or offering some other excuse. Others are truly 
willing but not able because their troops are poorly equipped. They need help 
from wealthier nations, including the United States. Why the continued, morally 
miasmal delay? 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa, though it has its own problems, at least committed a field 
hospital to Rwanda. And President Nelson Mandela rightly scolded other heads of 
state at a recent Organization of African Unity session. Rwanda, Mandela said, 
is the shame of the continent. Rwanda, it can also be said, is the shame of the 
world.

COOLING OFF -- HEADING FOR PERMAFROST?; UCLA'S NEW ECONOMIC FORECAST SEES 
DANGER TO CALIFORNIA IN ANY FURTHER INTEREST RATE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Be it Mother Nature, the end of the Cold War, the Federal Reserve or jittery 
currency traders, forces well beyond the control of Californians are conspiring 
against a smooth economic recovery for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 First there was the devastating Northridge earthquake, then continuing defense 
cuts and rising interest rates and now an unexpectedly vulnerable U.S. dollar 
on foreign exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's startling plunge this week reignited inflation fears and is 
generating new uncertainty about interest rates. Rising rates already have 
weakened California's fledgling recovery, according to the latest report by the 
UCLA Business Forecasting Project. Mortgages and other loans have become more 
costly since February, a period in which the Fed raised short-term interest 
rates four times. (The Times opposed the last increase.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's preemptive strikes to head off inflation and to cool growth 
nationwide by raising rates have had the unintended consequence of retarding 
California's recovery. The higher rates depressed residential building in the 
state during the first quarter of 1994, according to UCLA. Home sales have 
suffered. Earthquake rebuilding is behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite California's slowness to move out of recession, the nation will have a 
"very good year" with inflation in check, according to UCLA. Fed Chairman Alan 
Greenspan echoed the forecast, declaring that the outlook for the economy "is 
as bright as it has been in decades" and that inflationary pressure is 
negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he refused this week to answer questions about the dollar, which 
plunged through the key psychological barrier of 100 yen briefly Tuesday amid 
the lack of overt action by U.S. monetary authorities to defend the currency. 
Greenspan would say only that he and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen "have 
been following developments very closely because we cannot be indifferent to 
major movements in our currency." The comments helped to quell unsettled 
financial markets, and the dollar, though still volatile, has recovered a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the dollar stabilizes, the Fed will be under pressure to raise rates 
again when its policy-making Open Market Committee meets early next month. 
There is little evidence otherwise of the need for another rate boost. The 
Fed's new beige book of regional economic activity reported more moderate 
economic expansion, with growth crimped in some areas because of higher 
mortgage rates. The interest rate hikes apparently have worked to slow down the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma posed by the dollar aptly demonstrates a potential downside of 
global financial markets to the U.S. economy. A world economy offers immense 
opportunities, but the adjustments can be jarring -- seemingly beyond U.S. 
control and certainly beyond California's.

UTILITIES AND COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power heartily concurs with your June 
12 editorial, "Powerful New Idea for Electric Power," which urged the 
California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to proceed judiciously in 
determining how to advance its admirable goal of introducing competition into 
the electric utility industry while, at the same time, safeguarding important 
public policies embedded in the existing regulatory framework. 
</P>
<P>
 While the DWP, which serves all of Los Angeles, is overseen by the mayor and 
City Council, not the CPUC, we believe the CPUC's proposed deregulation of the 
electric utility industry will ultimately have a profound effect on all of our 
1.3 million customers. The CPUC's proposal would permit large industrial 
customers to choose their supplier of electricity in the open marketplace 
beginning in 1996, with commercial customers following in 1998 and residential 
customers in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the Arab oil embargoes in the 1970s, California's electric utilities 
were strongly encouraged by state and federal policies to "get off" oil and 
natural gas and build new out-of-state coal-fired generation, which would 
reduce air pollution in the Los Angeles Basin. After Los Angeles joined with 
Utah municipalities to build the large coal-fired Intermountain Generation 
Station in Utah, long-term supplies of natural gas were made available to 
electric utilities. Ironically, independent power producers using combined 
cycle natural gas generation are now poised to compete with us and other 
California utilities, promising our very large customers cheaper rates under 
the CPUC's proposed deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 These large customers make up a very large part of utility sales. In Los 
Angeles our largest 100 customers account for 25% of DWP's revenue. If these 
sales are lost to independent power producers who build new and cheaper natural 
gas generation, the fixed cost of the city's existing coal generation will have 
to be spread to remaining customers, thereby driving their rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies the major dilemma facing the CPUC as it wrestles with how to 
implement deregulation, because it is the residential customers who may be 
saddled with higher rates to offset the revenues lost from large customers.

 As a former high school teacher in the San Fernando Valley, I must take 
exception to the June 8 article "Study Finds Johnny Can't Write Too Well." 
</P>
<P>
 The students I taught were very competent writers.Ninth-graders I found to be 
proficient in the narrative form, although lacking somewhat in mechanics; and I 
found 12th-graders to be more than competent in the persuasive form. 
</P>
<P>
 I will admit, students do seem to spend an inordinate amount of time in front 
of the tube instead of the book but to blatantly label all students, or even a 
majority of students, as poor writers, is a fallacy as far as this reader is 
concerned.

<TEXT>
<P>
 On June 14 I got up and as usual, turned on the radio. Jack Jones was singing, 
"Dear Heart," one of Henry Mancini's compositions that I, a professional 
singer, included in my repertoire. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening for a while, I decided to send Henry Mancini a letter. I 
hadheard that he was ill and I wanted to wish him well and let him know how I 
admired him and his music. I had had the pleasure of meeting him and Ginny, his 
lovely wife, at many parties where I had entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I sat down, wrote the letter and mailed it. A few minutes later, I got in 
my car, turned on the radio and again "Dear Heart" was playing -- this time, it 
was a big orchestra conducted by the maestro himself. Suddenly, the announcer 
said, "Mr. Mancini passed away." Tears rolled down my cheeks and I sobbed 
quietly, asking myself, "Why didn't I write that letter some time ago?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is gone, but his music will always be there. Rest in peace, "Dear 
Heart."

 * In the early 1960s, when some other little girls were twisting to Little Eva 
and Bobby Vee records, I was holed up in my room wearing out my Henry Mancini 
albums. While I suppose I missed out on an important phase of adolescent 
socialization, I am just as certain I learned a great deal about life from 
Mancini's witty and dramatic scores. 
</P>
<P>
 The themes from "Hatari," "Experiment in Terror," "The Days of Wine and Roses" 
and "Two for the Road" continue to inform me about romance, devotion, adventure 
and sorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew then what I know now: Henry Mancini helped make film the greatest art 
form of this century.

ROBERT VOSPER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was wonderful to read the fine editorial (May 30) about Robert Vosper, the 
recently deceased UCLA librarian. When as a newly discharged GI in 1946 I 
decided to use the GI bill to get a college education, I chose UCLA and to 
augment the GI benefit program, I got a job as a page in the reserve book 
room.I did not know it at that time but my lifelong profession had been chosen 
for me. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, when Lawrence Clark Powell was university librarian, there was a 
friendly, warm man whom everyone called Bob as acquisitions librarian. It is no 
wonder that with such examples I chose librarianship. I have been fortunate 
enough to work on both the East Coast and the West Coast and in many types of 
libraries, and have never regretted, indeed, have gloried in my choice and the 
wonderful, exciting life it has afforded me. 
</P>
<P>
 With the electronic information highway hypnotically flashing before us, I 
hope there are Bob Vospers and Larry Powells that take the time to talk to and, 
by example, to guide young novices along the way.

PERSPECTIVES ON THE SIMPSON CASE; WHAT O. J.'S LETTER DIDN'T SAY; IT'S LARGELY 
SELF-CENTERED AND SELF-FORGIVING, WITH HARDLY A REFERENCE TO WHAT OTHERS HAVE 
SUFFERED IN THESE MURDERS.

By STANTON PEELE, Stanton Peele, a psychologist, is the author of Diseasing of 
America (Free Press, 1989) and co-author of Love and Addiction (NAL/Dutton, 
1987). He lives in Morristown, N.J.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When O. J. Simpson's "to whom it may concern" letter was read on television 
after he went on the lam, his supporters were relieved to hear his denial that 
he'd killed his former wife, Nicole. Others, however, noted that the letter 
expressed no sympathy for her family. (It did express empathy for the family of 
the other victim, Ronald Lyle Goldman.) 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it was odd that, if O. J. believed some stranger had murdered Nicole, he 
expressed no curiosity about the actual killer or killers. Nor did he exhort 
the police to locate them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deficiencies in O. J.'s letter go considerably deeper than omitting 
sympathy for his wife's family and interest in her killers. The letter is 
strangely lacking in any feeling for Nicole. O. J. only mentions her in 
connection with himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere does Simpson express despair over the death of the woman he claimed to 
love. He seems not to appreciate that her existence is ended. His concern about 
Nicole in the letter is only that people misunderstood their relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson seems much more concerned not to overlook his friends, teammates and 
golfing buddies (22 of whom he mentions by name). And it can only be considered 
tacky that he addresses his new amour in this letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although O. J. mentions his two children, he seems to have a hard time 
identifying with their emotional loss. He does not reflect on the fact that 
they will not have a mother, nor perhaps a father. His only expression of 
paternal care is to ask the press to leave his children alone.  
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's main preoccupation is to claim that any stories about marital 
difficulties between Nicole and him were exaggerated or made up by the press. 
Simpson twice in this brief letter indicates that the conflict between them was 
"no more than what every long-term relationship experiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he and Nicole were divorced. And it was she who reported to police 
that O. J. had beaten and threatened to kill her. But O. J. dismisses "all this 
press talk about a rocky relationship." He also claims that the press "totally 
made up" the information implicating him in the murder of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 If this were so, Simpson would seem to have the resources to set the record 
straight. He is a popular figure who elicits much sympathy. He can hire the 
best lawyers and experts to fortify his position. But O. J. does not seem 
inclined to set the public straight on a factual level.  
</P>
<P>
 He also claims that the only reason he pleaded no contest to wife abuse in 
1989 was that he "was advised it would end the press hype." 
</P>
<P>
 O. J. Simpson seems incapable of accepting responsibility for his behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The portrait of Simpson as a man who recognizes only feelings that directly 
impact him and blames other people for his problems is disturbing. Worse, O. J. 
consistently portrays himself as the victim. He laments that he had "done most 
of the right things, so why do I end up like this?" 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Simpson blames Nicole for his problems. He says: "All her 
friends will confirm that I have been totally loving . . . ." (He began the 
letter by claiming, "If we had a problem, it's because I loved her so much.") 
</P>
<P>
 Most chillingly, Simpson asserts, "At times I have felt like a battered 
husband or boyfriend." Is this sense of injury an all-purpose excuse?  
</P>
<P>
 Some legal commentators suspect that O. J.'s defense could shift from the 
claim that he didn't kill the victims to one of temporary insanity or 
irresistible impulse. His letter already reflects the detachment and 
self-absorption that such a defense would be built on.

STREAMLINING PRODUCT-LIABILITY SUITS; LAW: A BILL IN CONGRESS WOULD SUPPORT 
MANUFACTURERS AND REAL VICTIMS, NOT FEE-HUNGRY LAWYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. SAMUELSON, Robert J. Samuelson writes about economic issues from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 70% of manufactured products are sold outside the state where they're 
made. If interstate commerce means anything, this fact alone warrants a 
national product-liability law to govern accidents and dangerous products. 
Instead, companies can be sued under a bewildering array of state laws. In 
1992, there were an estimated 40,000 such suits. Congress may now curb this 
chaos by adopting a national law. It's about time. The Carter Administration 
first suggested national standards in 1978. Despite repeated efforts, nothing 
has happened since. This reflects the power of the lawyers' lobby and Congress' 
reluctance to tinker with "victims' " rights. What has been preserved is a 
system whose main beneficiaries are the lawyers who live off it.  
</P>
<P>
 Good laws should be clear (people should know what's legal), operate quickly 
(victims should get rapid relief) and not impose excessive costs. Our 
product-liability laws fail all these tests. They are vague; no one knows who's 
responsible for an accident. They operate slowly; it typically takes 2 1/2 
years for cases to come to trial. They are expensive; nearly half of total 
costs go to lawyers on both sides. And legal uncertainty has unintended 
economic side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 The general-aviation industry once made 13,000 light aircraft annually. High 
liability costs -- often caused by suits involving older planes -- are one 
reason that production is now fewer than 1,000 annually. Some big chemical 
companies (Dow, DuPont) won't supply raw materials for some medical devices. 
"The cost of responding to litigation . . . even in frivolous suits" was simply 
too high, the Health Industry Manufacturers Assn. recently told Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, there have been many unsafe products: the Dalkon shield, 
asbestos insulation and the Bjork-Shiley heart valve, to name a few. 
Product-liability law not only compensates victims but also deters dangerous 
products. It raises the cost of making them. But we cannot live in a risk-free 
society. Our laws should not excessively burden companies that behave 
responsibly or, indeed, are hardly connected to an accident at all.  
</P>
<P>
 Victims' rights have expanded enormously, and there is no need to reduce them 
sharply. Until the 1960s, companies were generally liable only if they had been 
negligent in making or selling their products. Since then, most state courts 
have embraced "strict liability," which compensates victims if products are 
deemed "defective," regardless of whether companies were negligent. And courts 
have increasingly applied "joint and several liability"; this means that almost 
any company involved with a product can, in theory, be held responsible for all 
damages.  
</P>
<P>
 Damages come in three forms: economic (loss of wages, hospital bills, etc.), 
pain and suffering and punitive. Big jury awards usually involve punitive 
damages and pain and suffering. The congressional proposals would restrict some 
recoveries. Under the Senate bill: * Companies wouldn't pay any damages if 
accidents involving their products were caused by alcohol or drug use.  
</P>
<P>
 * Drug and medical-device companies would be spared punitive damages (but not 
economic damages or pain and suffering) if their products had been approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration -- provided the companies didn't deceive the 
FDA.  
</P>
<P>
 * Manufacturers of industrial machinery couldn't be sued for accidents once 
machines were more than 25 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 These limits are reasonable. Why should a responsible company pay for an 
irresponsible drunk? Why should a drug company face punitive damages if it 
complied with federal safety regulations? Why should manufacturers be liable 
for machines that should have been scrapped?  
</P>
<P>
 More than 95% of product-liability suits are settled before trial. But the 
possibility of large jury awards and the high cost of litigation encourage 
weaker suits and higher settlements. It can often cost more to litigate than to 
settle. Unfortunately, the congressional bills do not include the genuine 
remedy for this problem: a modified "English rule." Losers would pay legal 
fees; losing attorneys would pay if they accepted cases on a contingency-fee 
basis.  
</P>
<P>
 Our whole civil-justice system is warped. There are a million tort cases filed 
annually in state courts. Businesses sue each other with wild abandon. Lawyers 
constantly discover or invent new areas of litigation. Our laws need to be more 
narrowly drawn. More mechanisms of self-discipline -- like the English rule -- 
need to be adopted. Product liability is only a small part of this larger 
problem; but it is a good place to begin repairs.

'NO MAN IN THIS COUNTRY . . . IS ABOVE THE LAW'; CLINTON: THE THREAT OF A FLOOD 
OF SUITS IS CONTRIVED TO SAVE HIM EMBARRASSMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE T. CONWAY III, George T. Conway III is a lawyer in New York City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The case of Paula Corbin Jones vs. William Jefferson Clinton is unique in many 
ways, but will be unique in at least one way that matters to the law. It 
appears that the President's high-powered lawyers -- with the assistance of the 
Justice Department and at the behest of the White House counsel -- will argue 
that he is, at least temporarily, immune from suit.  
</P>
<P>
 But this argument requires a huge stretch of the law. If it is the best 
defense he can find, Clinton will need all the legal firepower he can get. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two types of immunity for public officials from civil lawsuits. The 
first is "qualified immunity." Clinton is probably entitled to that here, as he 
is claimed to have harassed Jones, a state employee, while acting as governor 
of Arkansas. Qualified immunity won't do for Clinton and his lawyers, however, 
because it's just that -- qualified. It is unavailable to defendants who knew 
or should have known that they were doing something unlawful. To find out 
whether qualified immunity applies requires depositions and a trial, the very 
things Clinton wants to avoid. Qualified immunity won't keep the Jones case off 
Court TV. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Clinton's lawyers are looking for a legal "home run" ball: some 
kind of absolute immunity that derives from Clinton's position as President. In 
the 1982 case of Nixon vs. Fitzgerald, a bitterly divided Supreme Court 
recognized an "absolute presidential immunity from damages liability for acts 
within the 'outer perimeter' of (the President's) official responsibility." Yet 
even this is not enough to help Clinton. His alleged acts in the Jones case 
fall far outside his official duties -- they took place before he was even 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
 So where does that leave Clinton? With a raw policy argument, unsupported by 
history or precedent. The historical materials are probably inconclusive, 
although one member of the Constitutional Convention observed that "far from 
being above the laws," the President "is amenable to them in his private 
character as a citizen." So Clinton's best hope lies in arguing that the 
reasoning of the Nixon case justifies the immunity he needs in the Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't. The Nixon decision reasoned that, if faced with potential 
civil liability for official action, the President might "hesitate to exercise 
(his) discretion in a way 'injuriously (affecting) particular individuals' " -- 
that he might behave timidly in carrying out his official duties if he could be 
sued for trying to carry them out. This danger is heightened by the sheer 
breadth of presidential duties and the effect of executive-branch decisions on 
countless people every day. As Nixon's lawyers argued, "any modern President 
comes into tangential contact with literally thousands of minor matters that 
reach his desk precisely because they have become controversial." Each could 
mean a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 This reasoning doesn't help Clinton. It was compelling in the Nixon case for 
the very reason it is irrelevant in the Jones case: The first involved 
official, presidential acts; the second doesn't. A President's unofficial or 
non-presidential actions do not affect millions of people. The public has no 
interest in whether the President acts boldly or timidly in his personal 
affairs. And potential liability for non-presidential acts surely isn't going 
to intimidate presidents from carrying out their duties, particularly since 
presidents do enjoy absolute immunity for presidential acts.  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, despite Clinton's lawyers' efforts to paint a picture of 
proliferating process servers swarming across the White House lawn, the threat 
of a litigation boom involving personal conduct of presidents is contrived: 
Whatever else may be said of it, the Jones case is indisputably a historical 
anomaly. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's argument for immunity must boil down to an argument that the burden 
of a single case, involving simple allegations about an encounter lasting but a 
few minutes, threatens to paralyze the presidency and that the case should 
accordingly be delayed until he leaves office. This argument is also contrived: 
It is political embarrassment, not the burden of litigation, from which Clinton 
wants to be relieved. The litigation burden simply isn't that great, if the 
judge exercises proper control over it. Clinton's deposition, for example, 
could reasonably be restricted to a few hours or a day; the case is that 
simple. Sitting presidents have given depositions before in criminal cases -- 
Clinton gave one to a special prosecutor in the Whitewater investigation 
recently.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Clinton's immunity argument is unacceptable because it would place 
presidents above the law. It would enable a President to take out a mortgage on 
a summer home, refuse to make payments and yet be immune from foreclosure for 
four or eight years. A President who owned a recreational speedboat could run 
someone over and postpone a suit by the victim's family, who would be left 
without redress for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 This smacks of the privilege of a sovereign or an autocrat -- not a president 
of a democratic republic. A passage from a brief submitted by then-Rep. Albert 
Gore Jr. and other members of Congress in the Nixon case explains why Clinton's 
argument must fail: 
</P>
<P>
 "No man in this country is so high that he is above the law. No officer of the 
law may set that law at defiance with impunity. All officers of the government, 
from the highest to the lowest, are creatures of the law and are bound to obey 
it. . . . Incumbency does not relieve the President of the routine legal 
obligations that confine all citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 In a case involving his private conduct, a President should be treated like 
any private citizen. The rule of law requires no more -- and no less.

PERSPECTIVES ON THE SIMPSON CASE; A SHAM INDICTMENT PROCESS; THE GRAND JURY WAS 
MEANT TO BE A BUFFER BETWEEN PEOPLE AND STATE. THE D.A. IS USING IT TO GAIN 
UNFAIR ADVANTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MEIR J. WESTREICH, Meir J. Westreich is a civil-rights lawyer in Glendale. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past week, a grand jury has been considering whether to issue an 
indictment agains O.J. Simpson, based on evidence from the Los Angeles County 
District Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's consider what the jury is probably not being told by the D.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand juries originally had a special role in our criminal-justice system. In 
the Bill of Rights, they receive special mention in the Fifth Amendment, 
separate from the right to trial by a 12-person petit jury. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand jury was intended to guarantee that a panel of private citizens would 
stand between the power of the state -- police, prosecutor and judge -- and the 
individual in criminal prosecutions. Thus, under our federal system, no person 
can be charged with a felony without a grand jury first voting to indict the 
suspect based on a finding of probable cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the state has an alternative procedure. The state can first 
charge a person without a grand jury. But then the state must hold a 
preliminary hearing within a very short period of time to determine probable 
cause. This is the procedure that was used to arrest and charge Simpson. His 
preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's use of the grand jury in the Simpson case is a 
distortion of everything for which it was intended. In truth, the district 
attorney is using the grand jury as a tool of the prosecution, to obtain 
special advantages for the trial before a petit jury. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point the grand jury has no power to perform its essential function, 
to serve as a buffer between the individual and the state before charges are 
filed. The charges are already filed, and no matter what the grand jury does, 
the D.A. will still proceed with the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore the grand jury proceedings are meaningless. The grand jury is being 
exploited in a way unintended by our Constitution. The district attorney is 
conducting one-sided depositions without attorneys for the defense being 
present or participating or being able to take any depositions themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the grand jury should be true to their great and ancient tradition 
as an independent body. They should tell the district attorney that, since he 
has chosen to proceed without submitting first to the constitutional 
protections of a grand jury, that he should proceed with the preliminary 
hearing, which is the appropriate protection for such unilateral action. 
</P>
<P>
 What we are seeing here is a sham indictment process -- the D.A. pretending 
that the grand jury's decision will have some meaning, when the real purpose is 
to obtain hidden and unfair tactical advantages from a one-sided process that 
was never intended for that purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury's very existence is intended to give private citizens the power 
to rein in the state when it uses its laws and authority for improper or 
unintended purposes. The grand jury has the power to simply say "no" to the 
district attorney -- and should do so. 
</P>
<P>
 By doing so, the grand jury would not be freeing Simpson or preventing the 
state from prosecuting him. It would simply be making the statement that the 
government must follow both the letter and spirit of our laws and our 
Constitution.

MY TURN: OC HIGH STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; BREAK-IN SHATTERS ILLUSION OF SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER CHIEN, Jennifer Chien is a junior at University High School in 
Irvine, where this article first appeared in the student newspaper, the Sword 
and Shield. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a chilly day last year, someone tried to break into our house. We came home 
to find slashed window screens and a small, triangular hole in our window, with 
jagged cracks and broken bits of glass. 
</P>
<P>
 When a policeman arrived, he told us that we needed more protection, more than 
the wooden bars we put in the window frames, more than the locks that prevented 
the windows from being opened. The policeman said he has motion sensors on his 
windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear was my first reaction. Overwhelming, uncontrollable fear. What if the 
burglars had gotten into our house? What if they had stolen our valuables?  
</P>
<P>
 But worst of all, what if they hadn't been scared off by our entrance? What if 
they had killed us for the crime of returning to our own home in the middle of 
their heist? A million "what if's" sprang to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 My fear was rapidly replaced by anger. How could someone do this to us? What 
had we ever done wrong; who had we ever hurt to deserve something like this?  
</P>
<P>
 The answer was simple: Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 We had done nothing wrong, but it did not matter. Crime attacks anyone and 
everyone. I was furious at some unknown person for destroying the peace, the 
sanctity that had always existed in our house. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I realized that the safety had always been an illusion, now shattered by 
reality. In the end, I was left with a feeling of helplessness. Why me? These 
two words ran constantly through my mind. There was nothing that I or anyone 
else could do to prevent people from attacking my house. There was nothing I 
could do to recapture the reassurance that I was protected in my house -- 
untouchable and secure. There was nothing I could do at all; I couldn't run, 
and I couldn't hide from something that I could neither see nor fight. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember when my father talked about getting the wooden bars for our window 
tracks and the chains for our doors. At the time, I had laughed at his 
paranoia. I can laugh no more; I can no longer fool myself into believing that 
robbery is something that will happen to someone else, but not me, never me. 
Maybe the motion sensors are a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 It is scary that even in one of the safest cities in the country, people must 
still live with the fear that plagues the rest of the nation. No one is safe 
anymore. There is no place in America where crime has not become a part of 
life. This isn't to frighten people into lives of anxiety and apprehension. I 
didn't write this article for pity or sympathy. I wrote it because everyone 
should know, like I do now, that crime can attack anyone. Even you.

INTO THE NIGHT: RSVP; A WHOLE LOT OF BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

 The Scene: The gala pre-opening of B.B. King's Blues Club at Universal 
Citywalk, which will open in mid-July. Co-sponsor, Northwest Airlines, flew in 
an impressive lot of musical talent as well as a heap of southern barbecue from 
King's original club in Memphis. The evening was a benefit, raising at least 
$20,000 for the T.J. Martell Foundation, which funds research on leukemia, 
cancer and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The Setting: A parking lot at Universal Citywalk in the shadow of the 
yet-to-be completed club was transformed into a bit of back-yard Tennessee with 
barn siding, magnolia trees and redwood picnic tables. Only those who received 
a press release fully appreciated the "more than 7,000 square feet of green 
grass sod" underfoot. Wonder who decided grass was a novelty item in Southern 
California? 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues: The Memphis Horns, Rufus Thomas, Mavis Staples, Sam Moore, Billy 
Preston, Diane Schuur and others joined King and his guitar "Lucille" for a 
miniature blues festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Isaac Hayes, Harry Anderson, Priscilla Presley, Clyde Avant 
(he'll be emcee at the club) and 12-year-old harmonica prodigy Brody Buster 
were among the more than 1,000 guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Statements: Willowy blondes in baggy flowered dresses, leathery 
blondes in black spandex. Many in baseball caps -- Hollywood's take on Southern 
comfort. The gentlemen of the record industry turned out in force, with a 
forest of gray pony tails. Nothing could top the sport coats inspired by jungle 
animals, outer space and Elvis. It's nice to see men take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: It takes a brave Yankee to bite into a fried dill pickle from Memphis. 
But they really aren't bad. The rest of the airdrop included hush puppies, 
fried catfish, heavenly BBQ beef and sweet potato pie. Beverages were served in 
Mason jars, which meant you could quite accidentally drink a quart of white 
Zinfandel if you weren't careful. The iced tea and lemonade were the sellout 
libations. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: Veteran Memphis blues man Rufus Thomas, kicking back with the 
audience: "I'm so glad I was here. Gigantic! Awesome! I wish it would never 
end. It's about time for California, for music in general, and especially the 
blues. Now's the time to set out and get something good for ya, good to ya and 
just plain good."

INK: HEAVY HYPE, SLOW BUZZ FOR GILMORE BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Paul D. Colford is a columnist for 
Newsday. His column is published Fridays. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most new books reach store shelves without so much as an ad or media interview 
to herald their arrival. These books have to make their own way in the 
marketplace, needing good reviews or satisfied word of mouth among readers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the opposite end of the marketing spectrum are the Big Books of Michael 
Crichton, Robert Ludlum and other brand names that go on sale in tall stacks 
supported by plentiful advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikal Gilmore's "Shot in the Heart" occupies its own niche. The new book, 
written by a Los Angeles-based contributing editor to Rolling Stone, is 
positioned by Doubleday as a work of art and became one of the more widely 
anticipated releases in publishing circles because the marketing started three 
years before the book was published. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore's grim exploration of the family history that foretold the violent 
life of his brother Gary Gilmore, the murderer who was executed amid a media 
circus in Utah in 1977, has been painstakingly rolled out by Doubleday since 
1991 when the publisher signed the author. 
</P>
<P>
 After Doubleday topped all competitors by agreeing to pay a reported $700,000 
for the hardcover (and the paperback, which sister company Bantam will publish 
later), filmmaker Alan Pakula bought the screen rights, and the author proposal 
that had stirred such excitement was reprinted by Granta, the British literary 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1993, six months before the original publication date, 
Doubleday sought to amplify the buzz by handing out an attractively boxed and 
revised edition of Gilmore's proposal at the annual convention of the American 
Booksellers Assn. This "special booksellers' preview," a keepsake that surely 
cost thousands of dollars to produce, opened with a letter from Doubleday 
editor in chief David Gernert, who recalled that the proposal had "knocked us 
out, and we immediately realized the best way to launch the book was to share 
it with all of you." 
</P>
<P>
 At the 1994 booksellers convention held last month, Doubleday continued to 
beat the drums, this time distributing a 24-page "companion" to "Shot in the 
Heart" designed to stimulate discussion among book groups. The booklet, which 
repeats the haunting book-cover portrait of the Gilmore family taken about 
1950, is being sold in select stores for 50 cents a copy. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after such an impressive buildup, publication this month has 
generated outstanding reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Intense suffering, it's been noted, can be the source of fine works of art," 
reviewer Dan Cryer wrote in Newsday. "That is surely true in this case . . . a 
stunning, heartbreaking family memoir. This is a book born out of despair and 
completed in triumph." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Washington Post, crime writer Ann Rule praised it as "perhaps the most 
fascinating book I have read in many years." National Public Radio's "Fresh 
Air," considered a book buyer's magnet by the publishing industry, interviewed 
Gilmore for much of a recent hour. 
</P>
<P>
 And the payoff? 
</P>
<P>
 "Shot in the Heart," which is No. 8 on this week's Newsday bestseller list, 
reflecting strong sales in the New York area, has been slow to catch on 
nationally, especially considering the critics' raves. It was No. 255 Thursday 
on USA Today's list of top-selling books in the country, dropping from No. 233 
last week. A lengthy piece about Gilmore scheduled to air on ABC's "20 / 20" 
last Friday was postponed for O. J. Simpson coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be that a book so personal and challenging as this one will take 
longer to meet Doubleday's lofty expectations. It could also be that a book so 
downbeat, as all the critics describe it, is misplaced amid the carefree days 
of summer. Or that Norman Mailer exhausted readers' curiosity about the Gilmore 
saga with "The Executioner's Song" in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 With 120,000 copies now in print, Gernert said this week that Doubleday's 
strategy has been to highlight Gilmore's fine writing to distinguish "Shot in 
the Heart" from the true-crime genre. Although "it is extremely difficult in 
this marketplace to sell anything original and unique," Gernert added, the book 
is selling better each week. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Racks: Gay-oriented publications devote much of their new issues to 
stories pegged to the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising in Greenwich 
Village, which spawned the gay-rights movement. The July / August edition of 
Out contains a pullout map of the Village and environs that pinpoints where gay 
life percolated from 1969 to 1971. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of the literary novelist is examined in the New Yorker (June 
27-July 4 double issue) by reporter James Stewart, who profiles his friend 
James Wilcox. Although Wilcox has had six laudably received comic novels 
published in the past 12 years, he earned $25,000 in 1992 and $14,000 last 
year. The advance for his next book, to be published in a year or so by 
Hyperion, was $10,000.

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; 'SHOTS, THE CRYING AND THE SCREAMING'; THE MASSACRE AT 
EL MOZOTE, BY MARK DANNER (VINTAGE; $12, PAPER; 304 PAGES) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I first read about the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team in Mark 
Danner's otherwise horrifying book, "The Massacre at El Mozote," I found myself 
heartened by the very notion of its existence. 
</P>
<P>
 The team consists of scientific experts who specialize in bringing murderers 
to justice by literally digging up evidence of war atrocities, and they've done 
their work throughout Central and South America and as far afield as Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 But as I read Danner's account of what happened in the Salvadoran village of 
El Mozote in 1981, my heart began to break. The Argentine forensic experts 
uncovered evidence of mass murder that took the lives of nearly 700 men, women 
and children in El Mozote and the surrounding hamlets; many of the victims died 
only after enduring rape and torture at the hands of the Salvadoran army. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the forensic team, for example, dug up the skeleton of a child, 
identified only as No. 59, and an orange plastic horse that had once belonged 
to the tiny victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ordinarily, we could use this for identification," the anthropologist 
observes. "I mean, even after 11 years, any mother would recognize this as her 
kid's, you know? But here, they killed all the mothers, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Danner's work, which first appeared in the New Yorker, is a taut construction 
of investigative reporting, political analysis and a curious, sometimes almost 
rhapsodic description of the lives (and deaths) of the innocents unlucky enough 
to find themselves in El Mozote on the day the men in camouflage uniforms 
appeared in the village. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a strangely poetic quality, for instance, in the testimony of one 
Salvadoran man who describes how government troops swept through the zona rosa 
-- or free-fire zone -- where El Mozote was located in an effort to round up 
and execute the suspected guerrillas whose names appeared on the death lists 
that their officers carried. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had lists from Perquin south to Arambala," the man told Danner, reciting 
the villages on the road to El Mozote. "But farther down there were no lists. 
Farther down, they killed everything down to the ground. Farther down was 
scorched earth." 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, as Danner shows us, were simply in the wrong place at the wrong 
time -- a vast battlefield in the civil war that has ravaged El Salvador for 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of El Mozote were struggling to keep their balance in the middle 
of the perilously shifting ground of a brutal war," Danner explains, "working 
hard to remain on friendly terms with the soldiers while fearing to alienate 
the guerrillas." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ronald Reagan Administration, Danner writes, had "vowed . . . to 'draw the 
line' in El Salvador against communist subversion in the hemisphere." 
Salvadoran army and police units, armed and trained by the United States, were 
sent into the countryside not only to engage the guerrillas in battle, but also 
to terrorize the campesinos into loyalty to the government. At El Mozote, as in 
Vietnam, they sought to save the village by destroying it. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrative in "The Massacre at El Mozote" is a spare 161 pages, and a good 
deal of reportage is devoted to the decade-long effort of both the United 
States and El Salvador to cover up the killings and discredit the early reports 
of the crime. The rest of the book consists of the documentation that Danner 
has assembled to convince us that the massacre took place as he says it did -- 
CIA reports, diplomatic memoranda, death lists and eyewitness accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "All morning, you could hear the shots, the crying and the screaming," recalls 
one woman who was among the few survivors. "If only you could have heard that 
enormous screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, thanks to the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team -- and thanks, 
especially, to the work of Danner in "The Massacre at El Mozote" -- the screams 
of the victims can be heard anew. As a result, El Mozote, like My Lai, has 
become a code word for the very worst excesses of humankind at war with itself.

DON'T BLAME BOY SCOUTS FOR THE ACTS OF ONE UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Boy Scout leader and former Scout, I appreciate the mostly positive 
article about Doug Allen and his career in Scouting ("Leader of the Pack," May 
10). It's a bizarre world in which an institution that used to be mocked for 
standing for a saccharine, overeager goodness is now portrayed by some as 
practically the embodiment of hatred and evil. Boy Scouting hasn't changed 
much, but the world around it surely has. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to comment on the article's assertion that the religious right has 
somehow infiltrated and changed Boy Scouting in recent years. Most Cub Scout 
and Boy Scout local units are now, and always have been, sponsored by churches 
as a wholesome activity for their male youth. Any PTA, Lions Club, ad hoc 
parents organization or similar group of responsible adults may also organize 
or "charter" a Cub Scout or Boy Scout unit -- and many do. They will be 
enthusiastically welcomed, trained and assisted in their efforts by other Scout 
leaders, also volunteers. The church or civic organization chooses its Scout 
leaders and membership. The sponsoring organization sets the religious tone, if 
any. There is wide variety in how this is handled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boy Scouts of America is a loose umbrella organization that encourages 
religious belief in a non-sectarian way but leaves it to local units to set 
their own standards. The Anaheim Hills boys ousted from Cub Scouts would have 
been tolerated in most Scout units, even most church-sponsored ones. The Cub 
Scout unit that ousted the boys exercised poor judgment, I believe, but they 
acted within their rights to set a religious standard for their membership. The 
Boy Scouts of America went to court, I believe, not to compel anyone to profess 
a belief in God, but to protect the right of its local sponsoring organizations 
to set their own standards. That's what diversity used to mean.

RESPECTING PEOPLE WITH ALZHEIMER'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I admire someone like Charlene Folcarerelli ("Living with Alzheimer's," May 
18) very much because she took her husband's diagnosis as a challenge and 
continued to treat him as an individual. But even she has not been able to 
resist the implication that her husband had become a category rather than a 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Folcarerelli got her cue from Carl W. Cotman, director of UCI's brain 
aging and Alzheimer's research unit. He is quoted as saying, "We still don't 
understand what it is that allows them to do that (italics mine)." I know it is 
far easier to say "they" or "them" when referring to persons who have been 
diagnosed as suffering from Alzheimer's, but such usage just makes it that much 
easier to regard such person as firmly fixed in a category rather than as being 
individuals with different capacities. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice of categorizing individuals medically is just as iniquitous as 
categorizing them racially or ethnically.

MOVIE REVIEW; A TRUE-TO-LIFE SHOT OF THE O.K. CORRAL; 'WYATT EARP' IS ON TARGET 
HISTORICALLY, BUT FORCES ITS HAND EMOTIONALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Impressive but uninviting, "Wyatt Earp" is easier to admire from a distance 
than pull up a chair and enjoy close-up. A self-conscious attempt at epic 
filmmaking that feels orchestrated as much as directed, it has noticeable 
virtues but chooses not to wear them lightly. And at three hours plus, it 
finally encourages audiences to feel as trail weary and exhausted as any of its 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Lawrence Kasdan (who co-wrote the script with Dan Gordon), "Wyatt 
Earp" uses the tale of that straight-shooting frontier marshal, the prime mover 
of the celebrated gunfight at the O.K. Corral, as a way to examine the panorama 
of the American West from the Civil War years to the turn of the century. And 
with Kevin Costner in the sturdy title role, Kasdan has the right man to help 
him do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Costner, whose own mammoth "Dances With Wolves" started the most recent trend 
in elephantine Westerns, is doing what most modern actors avoid, and that is 
growing and improving within a fairly narrow range. By doing a variation of the 
kind of innate heroism that characterized John Wayne, he carries "Wyatt Earp" 
on his shoulders, and if that finally proves too much of a burden, the blame is 
not his. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Kasdan, whose best-remembered films remain his first two, "Body Heat" 
and "The Big Chill," has ventured into the West before; his 1985 "Silverado" 
almost killed the genre's revival before it began. "Wyatt Earp" is more 
satisfying, partly because its reported $60-million budget allowed for 
something like a hundred speaking parts and 92 different sets, including 10 
distinctive saloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it is always diverting to see loving re-creations of everything from 
the laying of railroad track to the skinning of buffalo, all carefully 
photographed by Owen Roizman, in some ways this overly schematic pictorialism 
is evidence of where "Wyatt Earp" goes wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 For while it is hard to deny a film its ambition, "Wyatt Earp" is forever 
trying too hard; its excessive determination to be seen as a classic is too 
earnest and obvious to be successful. Especially since Kasdan, though clearly a 
student of the genre in general and the films of John Ford in particular, has 
to make do without the innate feeling for the iconography and emotional potency 
of the West that made both "Dances With Wolves" and Clint Eastwood's 
"Unforgiven" so successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that Tombstone, Ariz., gunfight (which historians pinpoint as having 
really taken place at a less euphonious location at the other end of the block) 
is what most people associate with Earp, Kasdan opens his picture with a brief 
pre-corral sequence. It is the morning of the battle and the marshal is 
drinking coffee in one of those saloons, waiting to be joined by brothers 
Virgil (Michael Madsen) and Morgan (Linden Ashby) and best friend Doc Holliday 
(Dennis Quaid). 
</P>
<P>
 For the idea of family, the notion, repeatedly articulated by Earp patriarch 
Nicholas (Gene Hackman) that "nothing counts so much as blood; the rest are 
just strangers," is taken totally to heart by the five Earp brothers. They may 
form romantic liaisons or even marry, but it is the brothers who come first, 
and Wyatt who is first among equals. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced as an Iowa teen-ager attempting to flee the cornfields and enlist 
on the Union side in the Civil War, Wyatt is next tracked to a rough frontier 
town in Wyoming, where the duality of his nature is exposed. As played by 
Costner, Wyatt in his early 20s is half-boy, half-killer, someone shyly awkward 
who can turn hard and relentless when he has to. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Gordon-Kasdan script, what tipped the balance in Wyatt's 
personality was the outcome of his romance with hometown sweetheart Urilla 
Sutherland (Annabeth Gish). Post-Urilla, he was different, "a cold man, God 
forgive you," as an acquaintance puts it, whose implacable, unbending approach 
to law enforcement accompanied him and his brothers from Wichita to Dodge City 
to Tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Costner can convincingly play both sides of the equation, the 
sheepish, grinning suitor as well as the careworn, emotionally blocked marshal 
who dresses all in black and barks at miscreants, "I'm Wyatt Earp -- it all 
ends now." Also worth seeing are Dennis Quaid, who lost 43 pounds to amusingly 
portray the tubercular gambler Doc Holliday, and Joanna Going, of TV's "Going 
to Extremes," who plays Josie Marcus, a later love of the marshal's. 
</P>
<P>
 That "Wyatt Earp" takes pains to accurately identify Marcus as Jewish, or to 
cast European-born Isabella Rossellini as Holliday's Hungarian paramour, Big 
Nose Kate, is an indication of the film's interest in historical accuracy. In 
fact, of the almost numberless pictures made about Earp and Tombstone (of which 
John Ford's "My Darling Clementine" remains the best), this is probably the 
most true to life. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite all these things to admire, "Wyatt Earp" offers little to get 
excited about. Partly it is the film's habit of pushing too hard, of forcing 
its emotional moments, and partly it is the glum, morose way Kasdan has 
envisioned Wyatt's story as a kind of Greek tragedy with boots on. Though 
superior to the recent Kurt Russell/Val Kilmer "Tombstone," it could do with 
some of that movie's sense of fun. Not exactly a failure, "Wyatt Earp" is more 
accurately described as simply not the picture it wants so hard to be. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13 for "strong gunfights, some language and sensuality." 
Times guidelines: Its gunfights are intense but sporadic.

 NEA Budget Faces Cut: The House of Representatives voted Thursday 222-204 to 
reduce the National Endowment for the Arts' budget by 2%, a measure that still 
faces Senate action. The vote came after a raucous debate in which Republicans 
accused the endowment of distributing taxpayers' dollars to some artists who -- 
in the words of Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) -- are "porno freaks," 
while Democrats accused Republicans of favoring censorship. NEA opponents 
failed to eliminate the endowment's $171-million budget as they had originally 
proposed. The fight marked a renewal of what has become an annual debate over 
the endowment, which is now headed by actress Jane Alexander.

honorary chairman. The sculpture, for which Stone served as the likeness of the 
mother, will be sold for about $5,000, with 300 copies of the piece available 
for sale at a later date.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; DANNY ELFMAN, BOINGO DON'T CLOWN AROUND AT WHISKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clowns of Death are Boingo without the Oingo, which isn't as quirky as 
that sounds. Bandleader Danny Elfman revealed this latest version of Oingo 
Boingo at the Whisky on Wednesday, shed of its horn section, and took his music 
in a surprising straight-ahead rock groove. 
</P>
<P>
 The band prefers the shortened Boingo moniker now, and the Clowns of Death 
name on the marquee was merely a jokey disguise for this rare club gig, the 
first of two nights at the Whisky. Elfman returned the band to the venue that 
helped launch its career a dozen years ago to perform music from the new Boingo 
album, the group's first collection of new material in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the old hysterical songs would have been out of place alongside 
Elfman's newer work, which travels through dramatic pop, funk, grungy(!) rock 
and acoustic balladry with a newfound control. Gone was most of the irritating, 
forced strangeness of the dark days of the late '80s. During the song "Change," 
Elfman even let his Beatles influences show, with sharp psychedelics from 
guitarist Steve Bartek and a steady Ringo-beat from drummer Johnny (Vatos) 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 At more than two hours, Wednesday's show was a bit long. But Elfman didn't 
seem to notice. This break from successful movie soundtrack work ("Batman") and 
back into odd pop left him wearing a relaxed, even serene grin through most of 
it. STEVE APPLEFORD

MOVIE REVIEW; 'UNIFORM': WHEN ACTING BECOMES REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A good idea is hard to find -- particularly in the movies. "A Man in Uniform" 
has a pretty terrific one: Henry Adler (Tom McCamus), a mousy bank clerk and 
sometime actor, gets a role as a brutal cop in a TV series and allows the role 
to take over his personal life. He wears his police duds at home and on the 
streets, where he's accepted by real officers and baited and cajoled by 
unknowing citizens. He takes part in a robbery and drug bust, all the while 
detaching more and more cleanly from what paltry reality he once possessed. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the film, which was written and directed by David Wellington, plays 
out in long slow shadowy passages where we're supposed to enter into Henry's 
fugue state. The problem is that Henry -- whose cop name is Flanagan -- is a 
blank; his fixations and emotional contradictions, such as his passive demeanor 
and livid temper, are too clinical to engage us. Wellington thinks that by 
training his camera on Henry's closed-off mug he'll open up his mind for us, 
but it doesn't happen.  
</P>
<P>
 The filmmaker's model is undoubtedly Scorsese's "Taxi Driver," to which it 
owes a large debt, but that film was raw where this one is freeze-dried. When 
Henry talks to himself menacingly in a mirror or speaks to an actress playing a 
prostitute (Brigitte Bako) about the "scum" in the city, he's not palpably 
scary the way De Niro's Travis Bickle was. McCamus is a capable actor, but he's 
given very little to work with. He's playing a strenuous cipher. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the film watchable is the way it portrays the creepy, powerful 
feeling a weak man can acquire wearing a police uniform. Henry is a Method 
actor in the extreme: He lets the Method take over his matter. And there are a 
few sequences, such as the one where he comes upon a scene of police brutality 
and stands there fixated -- simultaneously fascinated and sickened -- that have 
real power. "A Man in Uniform" is best when it's not trying to hook us with 
fancy life-imitates-art philosophizing and just gets into Henry's uneasy 
mimicry. The film brings out the pathology in play acting.

JAZZ REVIEW; STIMULATING SET FROM WATSON, HORIZON BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ensemble playing in jazz doesn't have the cachet that it once did, not in 
these days of upfront soloists with rhythm sections. Bobby Watson and Horizon, 
who opened at the Jazz Bakery Wednesday night in one of the venue's rare, 
full-week bookings, represent a welcome exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Watson's alto saxophone was clearly Horizon's ignition point, the 
well-rehearsed and symbiotically interactive ensemble provided plenty of sparks 
of their own. Watching, connecting, making eye contact with one another, 
exchanging smiles of enthusiasm as they shared a riff or made an unexpected 
change of emphasis, the players -- Terell Stafford on trumpet, Edward Simon on 
piano, Essiet Okon Essiet on bass and Victor Lewis on drums -- communicated an 
audience-enveloping joy in the sheer process of making music. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the set was drawn from Horizon's current Columbia album, "Midwest 
Shuffle." It was probing, adventurous jazz, sprinkled with traces of hard bop, 
free improvisation and, surprisingly, the cool melodism of the Art Farmer/ 
Benny Golson groups. But Horizon's sudden shifts of meter, their outbursts of 
feral rhythms tempered by soaring, lyrical lines and spontaneous riffing, were 
uniquely original. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's soloing was equally compelling. Initially precise, it was almost 
geometric in its careful melodic delineation. As the evening continued -- and 
especially during a stunning, nonstop improvisation -- a wilder, more 
passionate element emerged, ripping aside the earlier precision with 
accelerating, Dionysian energies. At 41, he has become an eminently watchable 
player, and an artist whose music is still evolving. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson wisely abandoned the microphones almost immediately. The Jazz Bakery is 
one of several rooms with appropriate acoustics for unamplified jazz. Too bad 
that more musicians don't avail themselves of the opportunity to perform with 
the direct and easy openness of natural sound. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bobby Watson and Horizon at the Jazz Bakery, 3221 Hutchinson Ave., Culver 
City. (310) 271-9039. $20 admission. Doors open at 8 p.m., set begins at 8:30 
p.m., through Saturday. DON HECKMAN

ALBUM REVIEW

<TEXT>
<P>
 *** GONZALO RUBALCABA,"Rapsodia" Blue Note Pianist Rubalcaba plugs in for 
this, his fifth U.S. release (the second with his quartet), and the results 
range from brilliant to only mildly engaging. A major departure from his 
earlier trio recordings and the wonderful, preceding release, "Suite 4 Y 20," 
"Rapsodia" finds the Cuban national employing electric and acoustic keyboards 
as well as the computer programming of added member Mario Garcia in a 
collection that delivers a big, almost orchestral sound while emphasizing its 
leader's compositional might. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, the tunes here follow circular paths, advancing through rhythmic and 
emotional variations with all the congruity of a good short story. "Circuito 
II" is a winding road that opens with the pianist's involved solo figures, then 
progresses through a splashy synthesizer-trumpet theme decorated with 
Rubalcaba's racy lines and some Philip Glass-like repetition before Reynaldo 
Melian's trumpet fanfare signals its close. "Tributo" also takes on 
journey-like airs, moving through Weather Report-inspired electronics, a riff 
that recalls "Milestones" and a Middle Eastern dance passage. 
</P>
<P>
 At worst, the synthesizer wash gives such tunes as "Rapsodia Cubana" the 
ill-tasting flavor of later, Spanish-influenced editions of Chick Corea's 
Return to Forever band, as the keyboardist's playing takes on some of Corea's 
aimless spirit. "Chancletera," with its bright, electric exclamations, suffers 
the same problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, Rubalcaba's acoustic work, less dense than on the 
previous recordings, retains its gymnastic qualities, full of flips and 
impressive stunts broken by moments of grace. He demonstrates an inviting 
spareness on "Santo Canto," its simple, nursery-rhyme lines pinned by Felipe 
Cabrera's electric bass. On the disc's only non-Rubalcaba piece, Charlie 
Parker's "Moose the Mooche," the pianist and trumpeter Melian take advantage of 
the blistering pace to weave long, wonderfully involved lines above drummer 
Julio Barreto's insistent ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at the fastest of tempos, the quartet is tight and finely tuned. Though 
"Rapsodia" is an uneven effort, it showcases a sterling quartet, and its 
leader's demanding, though developing, sense of composition. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good, recommended) and four stars (excellent). BILL KOHLHAASE

SCREENING ROOM: 'ROOSTERS,' COMPELLING 'BROTHER' AT AFI FEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the key AFI Film Festival offerings not already reviewed during the 
opening weekend at the Monica 4-Plex are Robert M. Young's flawed but admirably 
venturesome "Roosters" (Saturday at 3:50 and 9:40 p.m.) and Mariano Barroso's 
absorbing, stylish suspense drama "My Soul Brother" (Saturday at 9:10 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 "Roosters," written by Milcha Sanchez-Scott, is an instance of the right 
material in the wrong medium. It's a highly theatrical allegory with numerous 
verbal flights of poetic fancy that cries for the proscenium. The story's 
ultra-realistic setting, a modest dwelling in the sun-parched rural Southwest, 
keeps reminding us that people don't talk that way in real life. (On screen it 
probably would have worked better filmed against stylized sets.) 
</P>
<P>
 At heart it's a power struggle, illuminating what it means to be a man, 
between a young Chicano (Danny Nucci) and his father (Edward James Olmos), who 
has just finished a seven-year stretch for manslaughter. Olmos wants to 
immediately resume cockfighting, which got him into trouble in the first place, 
but his son is searching for a way out toward a better life.  
</P>
<P>
 In the "My Soul Brother's" succinct prologue, shot in black-and-white, a young 
woman, Julia (Lydia Bosch), jilts Toni (Juanjo Puigcorse) for his brother 
Carlos (Carlos Hipolito); 10 years pass, and we find Julia, a flight attendant, 
and Carlos, an insurance salesman with a bright future, living happily 
together. Out of the blue, Toni, a virile, reckless type, shows up to turn 
their lives upside down.  
</P>
<P>
 Barroso, an AFI, USC and Sundance alumnus, begins in a low key and, as Toni 
insinuates himself into his younger brother's life, masterfully revs up the 
tension so slowly you barely notice. This Spanish film proceeds with assured 
psychological validity: You understand why Julia can be both attracted to and 
repelled by the uninhibited Toni, so compellingly played by Puigcorse -- and 
why Carlos is so vulnerable to his elder brother's manipulations.

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; 'LIST' VIDEO LOOKING TO BEAT THE FALL RUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 MCA/Universal has surprised the industry by announcing that "Schindler's 
List," Steven Spielberg's Oscar-winning Holocaust drama, is coming to video on 
Aug. 17 and as a rental rather than to the sales market. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry speculation had been that the movie, which won seven Oscars -- 
including best picture and best director -- would come out late in the year and 
possibly at a price geared to the sales market, probably around $30.  
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Kairey, MCA/Universal's senior vice president of sales and marketing, 
said the decision was largely based on the film's current high awareness among 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Academy Award exposure and the movie doing so well in theaters, it 
seemed best to put it out this summer, when it's more in people's minds," he 
said of the movie, which has grossed more than $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also less competition in mid-August -- generally a rather slow period 
for video releases -- than late in the year, when many of the big summer movies 
make their debuts. "The market is a lot more crowded in the fall, so the movie 
wouldn't get as much attention," Kairey said. "It makes more sense to market it 
in the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List," which runs three hours and 17 minutes, will be on two 
cassettes, in both standard and letter-boxed versions. There will also be a 
limited edition (about 100,000 copies) of a collector's set, including the 
cassettes, a paperback novel, a soundtrack CD and a book of stills, priced at 
$140.  
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List" will be released on laser Sept. 21, at $45 for the basic 
version and $140 for the collector's edition. 
</P>
<P>
 Videobits 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's smartest marketing move with the four Johnny Carson videos was 
releasing them several weeks before Father's Day. Last Sunday, quite a few 
fathers undoubtedly were gifted with one or more of the tapes that highlight 
Carson's "Tonight Show" years. 
</P>
<P>
 A Disney spokesperson reported that by the end of this week 1.5 million 
cassettes will have been sold -- a hefty figure for this kind of non-theatrical 
collection. The spokesperson also said no one tape was significantly outselling 
the others and that the four-video set was selling as well as any single tape. 
</P>
<P>
 A director's cut of "A Streetcar Named Desire," with about three extra minutes 
sprinkled into the 1951 drama, comes out July 6 (Warner, $40). Though it 
doesn't sound like much, this footage does illuminate the action and add 
voltage to what was already an electrifying drama, starring Marlon Brando as 
Stanley Kowalski and Vivien Leigh in her Oscar-winning performance as Blanche 
DuBois. 
</P>
<P>
 Some video retailers are taking advantage of the focus on O.J. Simpson during 
the past two weeks by showcasing his best-known movies -- the first two "Naked 
Gun" comedies. You'd think that with his arrest on two murder counts so fresh 
in everyone's mind, it would be hard to watch him in something so frivolous, 
but fans are still renting them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week there was a misprint of the title of a 1977 Gerard Depardieu drama 
just out on World Artists. The correct title is "This Sweet Sickness." 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest 
</P>
<P>
 New York Ranger fans are giddy about their hockey team winning its first NHL 
championship in 54 years last week. Those who are still in a celebrating mood 
on July 6 will welcome ABC's rush-released video, "1994 Stanley Cup Champions: 
New York Rangers," for $20. The tape's most appealing feature: interviews with 
players from that last championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 Elvis Presley fans tired of all the muckraking about their idol might like 
"Elvis: His Life and Times," a 90-minute BBC documentary from the late '80s. 
There are no revelations, just an old-fashioned, totally upbeat tribute, 
including footage from movies, shows and interviews. For $30 from Raycom, (704) 
378-4488. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Tombstone" (Hollywood). The umpteenth retelling -- and arguably the best -- 
of the O.K. Corral gunfight, with Wyatt Earp (Kurt Russell), Doc Holliday (Val 
Kilmer) and the Earp Brothers (Sam Elliott and Bill Paxton) taking on the bad 
guys. Kilmer's witty, charismatic Holliday steals the show, contrasting nicely 
with Russell's dour Earp. Despite some occasionally sloppy plotting, basically 
a gritty, very good -- and very violent -- Western. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geronimo: An American Legend" (Columbia TriStar). Army officers on the trail 
of the Apache renegade. Wes Studi is first-rate as Geronimo, but you don't get 
enough of him since the focus is more on the Army officers (Jason Patric, Gene 
Hackman and Matt Damon). Directed by Walter Hill, this even-handed tale niftily 
steers clear of old Western stereotypes.  
</P>
<P>
 "Six Degrees of Separation" (MGM/UA). A glib, gay con man (Will Smith, TV's 
"Fresh Prince of Bel-Air") targets a snooty Manhattan couple (Donald Sutherland 
and Stockard Channing) pretending to be Sidney Poitier's son. Based on John 
Guare's play, this sophisticated comedy/drama is a sharply satirical jab at the 
pretentious upper class. At times, though, it's annoying listening to these 
unsavory phonies. Still, the acting is excellent, particularly Channing, who 
got a best actress Oscar nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gunmen" (LIVE). Covers familiar territory, with good guys (Mario Van Peebles 
and Christopher Lambert) battling drug barons in South America. This one, 
though, has an added kick because of the imaginative casting -- Patrick Stewart 
and Denis Leary as the bad guys. An expensive-looking B-movie adventure 
boasting some action sequences expertly staged by director Deran Sarafian. 
FILMS ON VIDEO 
</P>
<P>
 Recent films coming out on video: PolyGram's "Four Weddings and a Funeral,"

STAGEBEAT: ENGAGING CAST IN AN UNWIELDY 'ROOM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the current Theatre 40 production, the director and actors lounge 
comfortably about A. R. Gurney's "The Dining Room," unaware of the occasional 
discomfort of their guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The action transpires in a formal dining room -- an architectural luxury as 
anachronistic as the Eastern Seaboard WASP about whom Gurney writes with such 
intimate authority.The cast has the task of playing literally dozens of WASPs 
interacting over the course of decades.  
</P>
<P>
 David Rose directs with a touch of travesty that tends to squelch the laughs 
in this elegant but dated comedy of manners. When the actors portray children, 
Rose gives them free rein to be cloyingly cute, pigeon-toed moppets. When they 
play the elderly, they are lavishly creaky and doddering. Dialects, when 
assumed, are stilted. (At intervals, one actor even breaks into inexplicably 
Yiddish cadences. Go figure.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's an engaging ensemble that does a yeoman's service in a difficult 
play. The cast includes Jay Bell, Marcus Smythe, Jeff Harlan, Suzanne Goddard 
and Barbara Keegan. The evening this reviewer attended, Lori Thimsen filled in 
for cast member Cecelia Riddett, who was called away on a family emergency. 
Thimsen had only a couple of days to prepare for her role, yet fitted snugly 
into the flow of the play, turning in a performance as polished as any. Who 
said that all drama was on stage? 
</P>

STAGEBEAT: 'MINOR DEMONS' A POWERFUL AND DISTURBING OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the kind of momentary lapse that could happen to anyone. But in the 
exacting, inflexible code of law enforcement, small-town police chief Vince 
DelGatto's failure to read a killer his rights before questioning has put the 
entire case in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the defense lawyer who discovers the chief's mistake is 
his childhood buddy, Deke Winters, torn between his loyalty to Vince and his 
obligation to his client. 
</P>
<P>
 The age-old dramatic clash of lifelong friends turned fierce antagonists gets 
an effective contemporary spin in Bruce Graham's powerful and disturbing drama 
"Minor Demons" at the Alliance Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly a play with ample fuel for heated debate on the issue of 
defendants' rights at the expense of society's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 But Graham and director Louis Esposito wisely keep the focus on human 
repercussions rather than legal arguments, and the first-rate performances 
engage even when the story borders on the formulaic. 
</P>
<P>
 As Vince, the blue-collar police chief in way over his head, Blaise 
Messinger's performance aches with sympathetic good intentions undone by his 
own incompetence. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Sapienza's Deke is no saint, either -- a one-time hot-shot attorney 
recently returned to his hometown to clean up his life, the baggage of cocaine 
addiction and a failed marriage obviously weigh heavily. As he tries to stake 
out a morally tenable position, he realizes that if he starts lying now to 
protect Vince, the downward spiral will only start all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnie Starkey plays the teen-age murderer with chilling sociopathic disregard 
for the brutality of his crime, and Petrea Burchard brings an agreeable 
understated naturalism to Vince's concerned wife. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no pat answers in this drama -- only a disquieting challenge to 
wrestle with complicated questions. As Deke's exasperated lawyer girlfriend 
(Cheri Caspari) sums it up, "Democracy makes people think -- and they don't 
want to." * " Minor Demons ," Alliance Theatre, 3204 W . Magnolia Blvd., 
Burbank . Thursdays - Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends July 23. $15. (213) 660-8587. 
Running time: 2 hours, 10 minutes. 'Macbeth' Staging Scores Big Points 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Geer's sure-footed staging pulls no punches in "Macbeth," one of 
Shakespeare's more gruesome but ennobling tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
 Rendering the drama's complex interplay between fate and human ambition with 
all the eerie supernatural trappings that could easily teeter into corniness 
(but don't), the production scores big points for its fidelity to Shakespeare's 
broad historical sweep and penetrating insight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum outdoor amphitheater's natural canyon 
backdrop unfolds majestically behind Matthew C. Jacobs' castle set, and proves 
integral to the staging (especially when the forest rises up in keeping with 
the witches' prophecy). 
</P>
<P>
 In the reviewed performance, alternate Barbara March took over the role of 
Lady Macbeth from director Geer with admirable clarity in her heartless pursuit 
of power at any cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Allard (who shares the title role with George McDaniel during the run) is 
a towering presence as the unscrupulous Thane who murders his king and best 
friend to attain the Scottish crown. 
</P>
<P>
 An initially taciturn, almost inscrutable Macbeth, Allard unpeels his "darkest 
desires" in carefully controlled layers. Ultimately wracked by guilt over the 
bloodshed needed to maintain his power but too greedy to let go, he stands 
alone, cut off from his own humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there's a central mystery to the tyrant that Allard never fully unravels. 
Monster that he is, Macbeth nevertheless voices some of the most eloquent 
speeches ever penned (like his "Out, out, brief candle!" upon learning of his 
wife's death). With little to suggest this oratory skill in Allard's overall 
portrayal, such dialogue rings a tad out of character -- are we dealing with a 
closet poet-warrior or has this inspiration erupted from his supremely solitary 
footing in the world? There's no clear answer, but wherever it comes from, this 
language still rivets the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Macbeth ," Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, 1419 N. Topanga Canyon Blvd., 
Topanga . Sundays, 8 p.m. through June 26, Sundays at 7:30 p.m. from July 3, 
Friday s at 8 p.m. July 8, 15, and 22. Ends Sept. 18. $12. (310) 455-2322. 
Running time: 2 hours, 15 minutes. 'The Brat!' a Campy, Overblown Comedy 
</P>
<P>
 After a famous punk-rocker blows his brains out, his strung-out widow, 
grabbing for the only remaining fragment of their doomed love, tracks down and 
throws herself at the unwilling recipient of his transplanted heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, execution doesn't live up to flashy high-concept in "The 
Brat!," a black comedy by Michael Sargent, who also appears as the Sid 
Vicious-inspired guitarist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my function in life to outrage people," sneers Sargent's Mike X, echoing 
the punk movement's take-no-prisoners assault on social stagnation in the late 
1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 If only this play at the Cast Theatre could do the same for the '90s. Sadly, 
Sargent and director Roxanne Rogers settle instead for campy, overblown parody 
in which even the performers smirk at their own characters (never a good idea). 
</P>
<P>
 As Stephanie White, the pregnant addict wife ("I'm doing drugs for two now"), 
Julie Summer comes across as a high-volume cross between Nancy Spungeon and 
Courtney Love. Other rock scene caricatures include a Nina Hagen-esque 
chanteuse (Shawna Casey) with a braided, "acid milk-maid" look, and an 
unscrupulous manager (Lee Arenberg) modeled after Sex Pistols puppetmeister 
Malcolm McLaren. 
</P>
<P>
 But so what? These characters add nothing more than momentary chuckles of 
recognition. Only in the final scene, when Stephanie's teen-age son (Sargent) 
seeks out the jailbird owner of his father's heart (Tyrone Granderson Jones) do 
we get anything approaching a genuine conversation -- too little, too late for 
an already spoiled "Brat!" * "The Brat!" Cast Theatre, 800 N. El Centro Ave., 
Hollywood. Fridays, Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends July 24. $15. (213) 
462-0265. Running time: 1 hour, 20 minutes. PHILIP BRANDES

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; LEARNING TO ACCEPT LIFESTYLE

 Saturday marks the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, the independence 
day of the gay and lesbian civil rights movement. Nationwide, June has been 
designated Gay and Lesbian Awareness Month.  
</P>
<P>
 In New York, gays, lesbians and bisexuals have been celebrating the occasion 
with Stonewall 25 festivities and the Gay Games all week. In West Hollywood, 
the 24th annual Gay Pride Parade on June 12 drew a crowd of a quarter of a 
million supporters. Additionally, schools and organizations have been taking on 
educating the public about gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) has written a domestic 
partnership bill that would grant unmarried couples -- from gays to senior 
citizens -- family hospital visitation rights, conservatorship and will 
procedures like those of married couples. In sheer numbers, the bill affects 
mostly unmarried heterosexual couples, but concerns gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 Has the San Fernando Valley area become more accepting of its 
gay/lesbian/bisexual community? 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz:  
</P>
<P>
 "I think all around people are becoming more informed as more people come out 
of the closet and they realize that gay and lesbian people work and eat just 
like everyone else. Rather, they just have a different sexual orientation that 
doesn't impact the quality of person that they are. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's hard to point out specific changes; attitudes change slowly and 
attitudes can't be legislated. Attitudes change due to personal experience. As 
more people know someone who is gay or lesbian now, they know that it doesn't 
matter, that they are people just like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Gill, director of the Gay And Lesbian Awareness Commission of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District: 
</P>
<P>
 "Some San Fernando Valley high schools have had some problems (with gay 
bashing), but we've certainly made some headway at other schools. We do need to 
continue education, and that's just it: education for diversity. . . . We 
intend to go out and continue talking to parents and staff and being as 
supportive as we can. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do a lot of staff development, which means I would go out and share with 
the teachers about what gay and lesbian youth face and it's a subject that 
sometimes they don't feel comfortable with. . . . And what we would like to do 
(next year) is to work with the new parent unit through the LAUSD . . . and 
make a brochure representing all seven of the commissions (each for a minority 
group)." 
</P>
<P>
 Adele Starr, president of the Los Angeles chapter of Parents and Friends of 
Lesbians and Gays (P-FLAG) and the mother of five children, one of whom is gay: 
 
</P>
<P>
 "About half of our members are from the San Fernando Valley. . . . I would say 
the Valley is very representative of Los Angeles County in that there are many 
families that have gay and lesbian sons and daughters. . . . I've been involved 
for many, many years and there was a time when the media wouldn't use the word 
'gay,' but it is very heartwarming that the media does cover gays and lesbians 
today.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel. . . . I've had 
several calls from middle schools and high schools from distraught parents 
whose children were picked on for being suspected of being gay: verbal 
harassment and, in one case, a boy was actually hurt. . . . I would appeal to 
these parents to teach their children that it's un-American to be hostile, to 
verbally or physically harass anyone. I think we should teach our children to 
respect diversity."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; BOLIVIA, SOUTH KOREA CAN'T PRODUCE A GOAL;

 It took 17 games for the World Cup to produce the dreaded scoreless tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia and South Korea, both yet to win a game in their World Cup history, 
Thursday night played that 0-0 tie.That it took so long for one to occur 
underscores the offensive flavor of much of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team went into a defensive shell, either. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea had two late scoring chances denied after Bolivian defender Luis 
Cristaldo was ejected with seven minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bolivians enjoyed the better play. Sloppy finishing and South Korea's 
disciplined defense kept them scoreless. South Korea's speedy forwards used 
counterattacks to try to force mistakes in Bolivia's shaky defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koreans, who tied 2-2 with Spain, might sneak into the second round for 
the first time if they can tie defending champion Germany on Monday. Bolivia 
needs a victory over Spain the same day to have any chance of advancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivia was missing striker Marco Etcheverry, starting a two-game suspension 
after being sent off for kicking Lothar Matthaeus in a 1-0 opening loss to 
Germany. And Cristaldo was sidelined with two yellow card warnings, the second 
in the 83rd minute forcing Bolivia to play shorthanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalie Carlos Trucco made several strong saves to preserve the tie, including 
one on Ha Seok-ju in extra time.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: IS THE FUND INDUSTRY TOYING WITH ITS INTEGRITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As competition in the mutual fund business grows increasingly intense, more 
players in the industry appear willing to sacrifice integrity in the name of 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 For a $2-trillion business built on public confidence, this trend is 
disheartening at best and downright dangerous at worst. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, the industry's drift has been apparent in allegations of 
insider trading by fund managers, unsavory fund sales practices at banks and 
the use of high-risk securities in normally conservative money market funds. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the latest blow to public confidence in the funds, someone at industry 
titan Fidelity Investments decided last Friday to send newspapers Thursday's 
prices for most Fidelity funds because the Friday data wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ensuing public humiliation suffered by Fidelity this week, as it was 
forced to 'fess up to its intentional mistake, the firm has emphasized that 
nobody bought or sold a fund direct from Fidelity at the wrong price. 
</P>
<P>
 Though newspapers last Saturday unknowingly listed Thursday prices for about 
150 of Fidelity's 208 funds, the firm says transactions effected Friday were 
made at the correct prices, which Fidelity got after it met newspaper deadlines 
with the wrong data early Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't change the fact that most Fidelity shareholders were lied to, 
in varying degrees, if they looked at their fund prices in newspapers last 
weekend. For most funds, the difference between the true and incorrect price 
was less than 1%, but a wrong number is a wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified Fidelity employee who made the decision to go with incorrect 
prices should simply have listed them as "not available." That would be 
standard Fidelity procedure, said Jane Jamieson, senior vice president at the 
Boston-based company. "This was an error in judgment on our part," she said. 
"We have taken several steps to ensure that it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity's mistake and most of the fund industry's self-administered black 
eyes this year have one thing in common: They could have been prevented if the 
employees involved were playing by the rules -- either the fund companies' 
internal rules or the "prudent man" rule that is supposed to govern the 
investment of money entrusted by the public to allegedly professional money 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that it can become very tempting to bend or break the rules in 
the name of staying "competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Take Fidelity's case: Someone there had to make a fast decision when a 
software problem resulted in botched fund prices last Friday, shortly before 
the company was due to report the day's data to newspapers. Had Fidelity 
provided no prices for most of its funds, it would have appeared to be having a 
problem that wasn't shared by other fund companies (which, of course, was 
true). 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, investors who compare fund prices and performance by using weekend 
newspapers would have had little data on Fidelity funds, perhaps costing 
Fidelity some new investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity won't say what motivated the employee who made the decision, but it's 
hard to imagine that the issue of competition wasn't involved somewhere along 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way, competitive pressures have figured prominently in the 
brouhaha over sales of funds by banks. State regulators charged earlier this 
year that many conservative bank customers who were buying fund shares from 
bank salespeople had no clue about the risk and weren't being adequately 
educated by the salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many mutual fund companies that had partnered with the banks insisted they 
could do little to control the transactions beyond providing "clear" warnings 
of risk in fund literature -- which, unfortunately, we know that many eager 
fund buyers don't read or comprehend thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some regulators argued that a bank lobby was no place to sell uninsured mutual 
funds and that the uninformed customer today would be a litigious customer 
tomorrow, when his or her fund shares suddenly lost a big chunk of their value 
in a market downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But as burgeoning fund companies battle for market share, creating new funds 
at a blistering and unprecedented pace, the risk of taking on the uninformed 
customer has been outweighed by the near-term profit potential -- in the form 
of management fees and commissions on new money. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a pattern here, and it's changing the whole dynamic of the business," 
worries one former fund executive who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, some growing pains in this now-gigantic industry were unavoidable. 
The bigger the business gets, the greater the potential for problems, either 
within formerly small and relatively easily managed organizations or at the 
fringe, with the entry of so many new fund players. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business is so large now that you're naturally going to have some stupid 
people doing stupid things," says Kathryn McGrath, a Washington lawyer who 
oversaw the fund business for the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 What she worries more about, McGrath says, is the potential for a large 
contingent of the industry to lose its traditional tendency toward 
overcautiousness, a quality that helped keep the business remarkably clean for 
most of the last 50 years -- unlike the banking, brokerage and S&L businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that the fund industry was good and scared," McGrath says. 
"They'd call the SEC before they'd do anything" that might appear at all 
questionable. Now, she says, the risk is that too many funds "feel as if 
they're too smart." 
</P>
<P>
 The great danger is that public confidence in the funds may be slipping, a 
victim of so much recent bad publicity. And in the financial services business, 
confidence ultimately is all there is between prosperity and ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this overstating the case? Most fund executives would probably say so. "I 
don't believe there is an erosion of public confidence in this industry," says 
Matt Fink, head of the Investment Company Institute, the funds' chief trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 He argues that the industry continues to police itself well, this year's 
controversies notwithstanding. Moreover, several fund companies' recent 
decisions to cover money market fund losses caused by so-called derivative 
securities demonstrate the industry's commitment to keeping public confidence, 
Fink and others say. 
</P>
<P>
 But fund shareholders might ask a more basic question: Why were normally 
conservative money market funds investing in derivative securities in the first 
place? The answer, naturally, has to do with performance and the need to stay 
competitive -- perhaps too competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's Corp., which rates the quality of 200 money market funds, 
this week announced that it may downgrade the AAA rating of BankAmerica's 
Pacific Horizon Government fund, depending on the fund's ability to reduce its 
exposure to derivative securities in the portfolio. In May, BofA spent $17.4 
million to cover derivative-induced losses in one of its other money funds. 
</P>
<P>
 S&P analyst Sandy Bragg says money funds have felt compelled to cross into the 
risky territory of derivatives to try for an edge over competitors. "The 
environment they've been in is such that getting a few extra basis points in 
yield means a lot" in marketing a fund, Bragg says. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, those few extra points are costing some fund players dearly, 
financially and image-wise. An early warning for the entire industry? Margin of 
Error

TECHNOLOGY ISSUES BATTERED AS DOW SINKS 25.68 POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services

<TEXT>
<P>
 A rout in technology issues pushed Wall Street lower Thursday, leading 
analysts and traders to worry that the entire market may be poised for a deeper 
selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 However, bonds and the dollar were steady while commodity prices continued to 
tumble, taking a key inflation index lower for the fourth straight day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had shed 103 points in three sessions 
before recovering 16.80 points Wednesday, closed down 25.68 at 3,699.09. In the 
broader market, declining issues swamped advancers by about 2 to 1 on the New 
York Stock Exchange, where 256.48 million shares were traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes, which are heavily weighted in technology stocks, moved 
sharply lower. Most of Thursday's carnage was in the Nasdaq composite index, 
which fell 11.89 to 700.85, a level not seen since last July, when it ended at 
700.24. 
</P>
<P>
 Other market indexes lost ground as well. The NYSE composite index fell 1.68 
to 248.29. The Standard & Poor's 500 index fell 3.46 to 449.63. 
</P>
<P>
 James Schroeder, market analyst at MMS International in Chicago, said 
Thursday's losses were frightening because technology stocks "had previously 
provided important leadership." The loss of that leadership "doesn't present a 
very pretty picture," Schroeder said, especially in view of current concerns 
about the flagging dollar and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The selloff of technology issues was sparked by downgradings by some 
influential analysts. SoundView Financial Group analyst Michael Karfopoulos 
lowered his short-term outlook on Cisco Systems Inc. to "hold" from "buy." He 
said the computer networking company lost a contract to provide computer 
routing services to Wal-Mart Stores because of aggressive competition in the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sentiment was positive in the bond market as attention shifted to 
economic fundamentals now that the foreign exchange markets were calmer. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury yield remained unchanged from Wednesday's close at 7.40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other securities rose nearly a quarter of a point after recovering from a 
modest dip when the government Thursday issued a better-than-expected durable 
goods report for May. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said factory orders for big-ticket items rose 0.9% in 
May, led by a big jump in aircraft and defense goods. Many economists had been 
expecting an increase closer to 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some traders took profits from the price run-up that occurred 
Wednesday, said Kevin Flanagan, money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 The dip did not last long, however, and prices remained steady or slightly 
above Wednesday's level as traders saw the dollar was holding ground and 
commodity prices continued to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar ended mixed and little changed in quiet trading Thursday as the 
currency market took a breather from the volatility that pushed the U.S. 
currency to a postwar low against the Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar was quoted in late trading at 101.25 Japanese yen, up 
from 100.95 on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell against the German mark after comments by Bundesbank officials 
raised doubts about whether the German central bank would help rescue the U.S. 
currency if it were to slump further. The dollar finished at 1.603 marks, down 
from 1.605. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, beneficial rains across the Midwest continued to pressure grain 
prices, pushing the Commodity Research Bureau's index of 21 commodities down 
0.46 point to 230.41. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cisco was the most active stock in Nasdaq trading, dropping 2 1/2 to 21 and 
pushing down other computer networking stocks, such as Wellfleet 
Communications, down 1 5/8 to 21 1/4, and Chipcom Corp., down 1 1/2 to 32 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks took another blow when Montgomery Securities lowered its 
estimates of current-quarter earnings for disk drive companies. Seagate 
Technology fell 1 1/4 to 19, and Quantum Corp. fell 1 1/8 to 11 3/4. Conner 
Peripherals fell 5/8 to 11 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Apple Computer fell 1 to 25 1/4, Microsoft fell 1 3/8 to 50 1/8 and Oracle 
System fell 1 15/16 to 34 5/8. Lotus Development, which said late Monday that 
its second-quarter earnings will be disappointing, fell 2 11/16 to 33 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM fell 1 1/8 to 60 7/8, and Hewlett-Packard lost 1 1/2 to 76 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * General Electric led the action on the Big Board and rose 1/2 to 46 1/4. 
Conseco Inc. offered by buy Kemper Corp. for $67 per share in cash and stock, 
topping a $60-per-share cash offer made by GE Capital Corp, a GE unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Conseco rose 1/2 to 51. Kemper rose 3 3/8 to 62 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eastman Kodak rose 3/4 to 47 1/2. Sanofi of France said it will purchase the 
prescription drug activities of Kodak's Sterling-Winthrop Inc. unit for $1.68 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, stocks ended sharply higher in Tokyo, with the Nikkei 
225-share average closing up 458.89 points, or 2.23%, to 21,040.21, above the 
psychologically important 21,000 level. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average ended at 2,022.10, up 27.68 
points, while in London, the Financial Times 100-share average was down 18 
points at 2942.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index dropped 14.70 points to 2,242.93.

 GM Electric Cars Arrive for Volunteer Test Drives: To the tune of "Little 
Deuce Coupe," eight sporty, two-seat, General Motors Corp. electric vehicles 
rolled into the parking lot of a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power 
maintenance facility for testing by 80 Southland drivers, beginning the first 
week in July. The DWP and Southern California Edison Co. will loan the Impact 
IVs over the next six months to commuters chosen from among 10,000 volunteers 
in the Los Angeles area. GM representatives said the company has other 
"parallel" electric vehicle programs in progress and that no specific vehicle 
has been chosen to meet the 1998 deadline to introduce zero-emission cars in 
California showrooms.

 RESORT SPORT: Maybe the guests haven't caught it, but employees at the Dana 
Point Resort have soccer fever. After all, the U.S. World Cup team is staying 
there. . . . The hotel's employees have had their own soccer team for years, 
playing against employees of other local hotels like the neighboring 
Ritz-Carlton. But the U.S. team's success has pumped renewed interest in the 
employees' team. "This has become major stuff," says hotel spokeswoman Penny 
Elia. 
</P>
<P>
 USE YOUR NOODLE: What was on the menu for the U.S. soccer team after they 
pulled off one of the biggest upsets in World Cup history Wednesday? . . . 
Pasta. And lots of it. The hotel's executive chef Peter Striffolino says team 
members consumed 25 pounds of pasta and 30 pounds of roast beef after beating 
Colombia 2-1. Laughs Striffolino: "I'd say these guys have a pretty healthy 
appetite." . . . The team's regular diet: Lots of vegetables, carbohydrates, 
nothing spicy. Wednesday night they indulged with chocolate mousse cake. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE'S BEEN THERE: Los Angeles Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay, who's handling 
the early stages of the O.J. Simpson case, has faced her share of courtroom 
stereotyping. McKay is a 1971 UC Irvine graduate, majoring in history before 
moving on to Hastings Law School. . . . Not long ago she was featured in a UC 
Irvine publication, and told the writer that her first case as a lawyer was in 
landlord-tenant court in New York City: "I walked up to the table and the judge 
asked me, 'Where's your lawyer?' "

 WASHINGTON ROHR: Illegal immigrants know they have no ally in Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). His latest bill is aimed at keeping them from 
sharing in the American tax dollar. His latest would bar illegal immigrants 
from receiving federal aid such as disaster relief loans or legal assistance. . 
. . "American taxpayers are spending billions," he says. "This nonsense has got 
to stop."

 NEAR SALE: Going, going . . . Well, it's not exactly gone. But the town of 
Gorman, on the market for $13.6 million, may be sold shortly. A Valley 
investment company, according to realtor Glen Beer, has made a very serious 
offer, although he declined to name the firm. . . . But others may still have a 
shot. Beer said the potential buyer has no interest in a ranch and one of the 
town's businesses.

 SAUGUS STAR: Listeners to KLOS-FM's (95.5) "Mark and Brian" program Thursday 
morning got a chance to hear something the Saugus High student body didn't -- 
Brad Bjelke's graduation speech. Bjelke was denied valedictorian honors because 
the school felt the competition was unhealthy, but KLOS took up his cause (B1). 
. . . "It was quick, to the point, with meaningful thoughts about life," said 
co-host Mark Thompson.

 SUMMER: School is out and sweat is in. What's a hot Valley person to do? Well, 
for starters, there's always the beach (above), which isn't that far away. But 
that's not all. From museums to music, there are plenty of ways to fill summer 
days and nights. See the special summertime section of Valley Life!

 NO WIN FOR WI: Pebble Beach has a new victim, and his name is Charlie Wi. Wi, 
22, of North Hills, lost his match in the 83rd State Amateur Championship at 
the historic Monterey Peninsula course. Wi, who won the event in 1990, couldn't 
escape the sand -- five bunkers in 15 holes -- and failed for the second year 
in a row to make it past the second round. . . . "I never really got anything 
going," he said (C10). 
</P>
<P>
 GOING SPANISH: Today's a big day for Disney's Latino fans. As announced 
earlier in the week, Buena Vista Home Video Inc., a Disney subsidiary, will 
release 10 Spanish language titles, including "Beauty and the Beast" and "The 
Sword in the Stone." . . . "There's a huge Hispanic market," said spokesman 
Steven Feldstein, "and it makes good sense to provide something in their native 
language." Michael Arkush

 HEAT WAVE: If seemed a bit warm Thursday (B1), think of the folks in Bullhead 
City, Ariz., where it reached 119 degrees. Ventura County never gets that hot, 
but our June has been more sunny than usual. So far, 18 out of 23 days here 
have been clear and sunny, said Rae Strange of Pacific Weather Analysis. . . . 
June gets a bad rap, he said. "There are June days that are gloomy. But it 
often has days that are clear all day long instead of the July and August 
pattern of morning fog with afternoon clearing." Record Highs 
</P>

 Highest temperatures recorded in Ventura County cities since 1948:

 ARTS PATRONS: As the chief fund-raiser for the Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand 
Oaks, Richard Johnson has a golden rule: Never write anyone off as a potential 
donor. His policy has paid off -- again. . . . Councilwoman Elois Zeanah, one 
of the sharpest critics of the arts center's size, cost and design, has pledged 
$12,500 to its endowment. With $12,500 in matching funds from her husband's 
employer, it's the largest gift from a council member. She's asked that the 
donation subsidize local talent: "I have always supported a community 
performing arts center for local groups." 
</P>
<P>
 A MOUNTAIN VISION: Chumash elder Semu Huaute has a dream. . . . He wants to 
build a Chumash village on six acres in upper Ojai. It's not far from the place 
in the mountains where Huaute was born 85 years ago. . . . At the Ojai 
Foundation on Saturday afternoon, Huaute said he will share Chumash legends and 
insights as a medicine man. It will be part of a fund-raiser for Un-At-Kah 
Tasen, a nonprofit group creating an intertribal education and healing center.

 RUBBER DUCKS: After weeks of hype, the Ventura County Symphony pulled the plug 
on its rubber duck fund-raiser (B1). The plan: dump 10,000 ducks in a canal 
near the Santa Clara River. People could adopt a duck for five bucks. And the 
first lucky duck to cross the finish line would bring the winner a new car. . . 
. But other charitable organizations squawked that the symphony was breaking 
the law by not saying "no purchase required." The D. A.'s office called to 
break the bad news.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: EX-LEGISLATOR NOLAN MAY BE A CROOK, BUT HE'S NOT A GAMBLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

 THE BIG HOUSE: Former Assemblyman Pat Nolan -- known around the Dublin federal 
prison grounds as inmate No. 06833-097 -- is looking pretty smart these days 
for copping a guilty plea rather than face the uncertainty of a jury verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 As you'll recall, Nolan was to stand trial with state Sen. Frank Hill 
(R-Whittier) on political corruption charges for accepting payments from an 
undercover FBI agent who was ostensibly seeking favorable legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill decided to fight the charges in court -- and, last week, lost -- while 
Nolan cut his liabilities early in February by agreeing to a 33-month prison 
sentence. Now he can rest assured that the gamble paid off, while his colleague 
faces the possibility of six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, the Glendale Republican is apparently well on his way to 
achieving one of the goals he set for himself while incarcerated: He's lost 20 
pounds from his burly frame. He's also reportedly received a promotion in his 
job assignment and now drives a street sweeper through the prison complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan may be gone from the Legislature, but he hasn't been forgotten. Current 
lawmakers keep in touch. And the other day, Nolan ran into his old adversary, 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), who was visiting one of his 
law firm's clients at the prison. Reports are that they exchanged curt 
pleasantries in a not-so-friendly tone. 
</P>

<P>
 CSUN BOUND?: With speculation being one of the Capitol's top sports, folks are 
wondering what state Sen. Gary Hart (D-Santa Barbara) intends for a career next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, who said he will not run again, hoping to spend more time with his 
family, is well regarded as a longtime advocate for education, so most people 
expect he will sign up with a respected institution after his term ends in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the possibilities mentioned is a post with Cal State Northridge, which 
reportedly floated the idea of recruiting Hart as an adviser. Bruce Erickson, 
CSUN's director of public relations, did not rule out casual or exploratory 
contact with the senator. But such a proposal never reached the university 
president's office, Erickson said, "and it definitely would have come to this 
level if there was any serious discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Hart, he said he is not entertaining offers, at least not until 
September, largely because he wants to avoid getting caught up in a conflict of 
interest should an important vote affecting prospective suitors arise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've basically put all considerations of future employment off until after 
the legislative session is over," Hart said. Regarding CSUN, the senator was 
tight-lipped: "I don't want to comment on whether they've contacted me."

 AHEAD OF THE HYPE: Even before the tragic death of Nicole Simpson brought new 
attention to the problem of domestic violence, legislative approaches to 
detecting and preventing spousal abuse were in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North Hollywood) 
ushered through a law that requires hospitals and clinics to set up programs 
for identifying victims of domestic violence. Beginning in September, the 
statute also requires doctors, nurses and other health professionals to be 
trained to help recognize such abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, who joined numerous lawmakers at a press conference this week to 
trumpet the need for more legislation, says 89% of doctors surveyed feel 
uncomfortable questioning patients about injuries resulting from spousal abuse. 
"All they are treating is the symptoms and not the problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Friedman said, more progress is needed, particularly in the 
San Fernando Valley, where there is currently no long-term transitional housing 
available for battered women. 
</P>

 FLIP-FLOP: Refreshed from a spiritual sojourn in South Dakota, where he 
accompanied his Canadian wife as she rediscovered her Sioux roots, a rested 
state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) is settling back into the Capitol 
routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some other wanna-bes recovering from losses in the June primary, Hayden 
is said to be upbeat after his failed gubernatorial nomination bid. He is 
gearing up to challenge the governor and Legislature over the state budget 
deficit and is on the lookout for new state government "scandals" to unveil. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Hayden takes credit for spurring a $1.6-million refund that 
GTE California Inc. decided to give its customers in a flip-flop that followed 
an outcry from the senator's office. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing from unhappy customers, Hayden wrote a letter to GTE, taking the 
company to task for retroactively billing customers extra fees for calls made 
on Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. It seems that someone at GTE had 
mistakenly given customers the discounted holiday rate, and the company was 
trying to collect the regular fees after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistake was especially costly to GTE because the day of celebration was 
Jan. 17, the day of the Northridge quake. Phone volume was high, as people made 
calls to see if family and friends were OK. 
</P>
<P>
 But Larry Cox, state manager of public affairs for GTE, said Hayden is 
misguided if he thinks his letter -- which pointed to apparent violations of 
Public Utilities Commission rules -- prompted the company to change its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had customers call us up and say, 'You didn't charge us enough on those 
toll calls,' " Cox said. "We took our cue from the customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Happens all the time. 
</P>

<P>
 WHACK, WHACK: Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) isn't the only legislator 
to have been inspired by a swat on the behind as a young man. 
</P>
<P>
 Count among his soul mates freshman Assemblyman James Rogan, the Glendale 
Republican who won Pat Nolan's old seat in a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogan explained why he signed on as a co-author to Conroy's controversial bill 
to subject youthful graffiti vandals to as many as 10 paddle strokes. As a 
teen, Rogan -- like Conroy -- was on the receiving end of a paddling that made 
him a believer in its value as a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting caught in the school bathroom with a cigarette, Rogan recalled, 
"I got that swat and it had an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 A former judge in Glendale Municipal Court, Rogan is frustrated with 
traditional graffiti-fighting tools. "Franklin Roosevelt said 60 years ago, 
'Try something. If it doesn't work, try something again.' What we've been doing 
isn't working."

NEWSWIRE: TRAIL BLAZERS PICK CARLESIMO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 P.J. Carlesimo, who transformed Seton Hall from a college basketball also-ran 
into a Big East powerhouse, was named coach of the Portland Trail Blazers on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlesimo, 45, reportedly will be paid $1.5 million a year in the five-year 
deal, making him one of the highest-paid coaches in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not something that I applied for," Carlesimo said. "This was just 
something that came to me as a dream. It was a very easy decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlesimo replaces Rick Adelman, who was fired after 5 1/2 seasons with the 
club. The new coach inherits an aging team that was eliminated in the first 
round of the playoffs the last two years after making it to the NBA finals in 
1990 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlesimo brings a reputation as a likable man off the court but intense and 
sometimes confrontational with his players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the biggest difference is I'm dealing with men now," he said. "My 
style needs to be improved for the dialogue that I'm going to have with these 
guys. But I don't think that's going to be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlesimo had a 212-166 record in 12 years as Seton Hall's coach. He led the 
Pirates to the NCAA championship game in 1989, losing to Michigan, 80-79 in 
overtime. He also coached at New Hampshire and Wagner. College Basketball 
</P>
<P>
 A Cincinnati judge sentenced former Louisville basketball player Troy Smith to 
five to 25 years in prison Thursday for killing his girlfriend during an 
argument. Police said Kelly Dwyer, 20, the mother of Smith's infant son, 
suffered severe head injuries when Smith threw her to the floor Feb. 18 in 
their Cincinnati apartment. She died later that day without regaining 
consciousness. Smith played for the Cardinals from 1989 to 1993. Auto Racing 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation that former world champion Nigel Mansell will return to Formula 
One racing increased with reports that he has signed a $1-million deal with the 
Williams-Renault team. 
</P>
<P>
 English newspapers said the British driver will test-drive for Williams at the 
Brands Hatch circuit on Tuesday, then travel to Magny-Cours to drive in the 
French Grand Prix on July 3. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Williams confirmed that the team would be testing at Brands 
Hatch, but would not reveal the names of the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 A report in the London Times said that Williams' engine supplier, Renault, 
pushed for the deal to entice Mansell from the Indy car circuit, where he 
drives for the Newman-Haas team. 
</P>
<P>
 Mansell, who left Formula One after winning the world title for Williams in 
1992, is preparing for his next Indy car race this weekend in Portland, Ore. 
The reigning Indy car champion is under contract for the rest of the season to 
Newman-Haas.

DANA PARSONS: WORLD CUP FEVER HAS YET TO KICK IN FOR THIS SPORTS FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Longtime readers of this column know I am nothing if not hip. You can't name 
the last time a major social trend escaped my attention, unless you want to be 
a stickler and count slam dancing. The occasional half-baked idea may slip past 
me, but when it comes to keeping up with what's really happening, I'm plugged 
in, baby. 
</P>
<P>
 But along comes something called the World Cup and suddenly people of many 
colors and languages are wildly cheering and gaily laughing and hugging and 
weeping with joy . . . and that's just here in The Times' cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on here? Norwegians and Italians and Bolivians and Cameroonians 
are all going nuts over a game where the final score is always 1-0. Surely 
there's more to this game than I'm seeing. Surely I can muster interest in a 
sport where one of the competitors is named Oyvind Leonhardsen. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel like there's a big parade going on, and I'm being left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Average Americans are excited about soccer. I didn't think it was possible to 
have a sport where they keep score that I wouldn't like (I'll even watch 
bowling on TV), but soccer sorely tests that. I know I'm missing something, but 
what? From what I can tell, soccer looks like hockey with teeth -- and I love 
hockey -- so why can't I get excited like everyone else? 
</P>
<P>
 My detachment wouldn't matter if our doughty American lads hadn't knocked off 
mighty Colombia this week in a triumph that apparently rivaled that of the 
colonists over the redcoats for its sheer historic consequence. This is the 
victory, according to the news accounts, that is going to catapult soccer in 
America to unheard-of levels of popularity. To underscore the magnitude of the 
upset, a Colombian newspaper headlined "What pain, what grief" after the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 So if the Colombians are experiencing pain and grief, I as a loyal American 
should be experiencing pride and glee. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, I feel nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Never have I felt more out of touch with my fellow Americans. I, too, wanted 
to jump up and down and hug the first stranger I met after we beat Colombia, 
but the feeling just wasn't there. How could the United States beating Colombia 
in anything be a cause for celebration? 
</P>
<P>
 We've been hearing for years that soccer was going to replace baseball as the 
national pastime, but I long ago put that in the same category as going metric. 
During my solitary travels in recent years, I've even pulled up to a park once 
or twice and watched kids playing soccer, until their moms began eyeing me 
nervously and I had to mosey along. 
</P>
<P>
 The game looks like a lot of fun for 8-year-olds. They can run toward one end 
of a big field and then turn around and run the other way and fall down if they 
want to. They don't have the pressure that goes with hitting a baseball or 
catching a football, and that's good. 
</P>
<P>
 So, I understand children's enjoyment of the game. But adults watching on TV? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to get in the swing of things, I browsed news reports of this week's 
World Cup action. One writer described Colombia's play in its loss to the 
United States with phrases like "spooky gutlessness" and "eerie incompetence" 
and "cosmic dreadfulness." 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to note that Colombia "went down limply, reeling, writhing and 
fainting in coils." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, there are some subplots going on that are eluding me. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of my indifference, I'll concede, stems from ignorance of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sentence from another press account about the World Cup: "Rushfeldt 
won his only other cap in a warm-up friendly against Sweden earlier this 
month." 
</P>
<P>
 I have no idea what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I was more than a little interested to learn that the Colombia coach 
is a professor of dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
 What little I do know about soccer originated with Pele. (Aside: I thought he 
was marvelous in "Victory," a movie several years ago starring Sylvester 
Stallone in which Nazi prisoners play a soccer match against the guards.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, soccer superstars apparently become known by single names only. First 
there was Pele and, more recently, Maradona from Argentina. Maybe that's why 
the sport hasn't caught fire in America. It's hard to conjure up an image of an 
international superstar named "Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 It's still early in World Cup competition. Maybe the sheer onslaught of the 
coverage will win me over and I'll become a soccer fanatic. Or, at least a fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I'll come to appreciate a header and the nuances of a corner kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but I doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring on the World Series.

COUNTY BAKES WHILE RESIDENTS LOOK FOR RELIEF; WEATHER: THE SWELTERING 
CONDITIONS PUSH TEMPERATURES TO THE 90S IN SOME AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ventura County residents swarmed to beaches, pools and any place with air 
conditioning Thursday as temperatures hit the 90s in some cities -- an unusual 
June pattern expected to continue through the weekend, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hot hot hot hot hot hot hot!" shrieked Allison Shore, 4, her bare feet 
dancing across scalding asphalt at Simi Valley's Rancho Simi Community Park, 
where temperatures peaked in the mid-90s. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweltering temperatures, meteorologists said, are the result of a major 
high-pressure system centered over Southern California that they have been 
tracking for days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very intense right now," said Erwin Prater, a meteorologist for 
WeatherData Inc. which forecasts for The Times. "It's really related to the 
heat that the rest of the country has been experiencing this last week." 
</P>
<P>
 The warm weather will continue at least until Sunday, when a break in the 
weather pattern will bring only slightly cooler temperatures, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, residents across the county sought refuge from the blistering 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Buenaventura State Beach, 25-year-old Shane Sparks of Camarillo 
sprawled out on a towel alongside a couple of his friends and soaked up the 
early afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Relishing a cool breeze that rolled in from the ocean, Sparks said he and his 
friends knew by early morning Thursday that it would be a good day to hit the 
beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "At about 8:30 it started getting really hot," Sparks said. "We had to pull 
the shades and put the A.C. (air conditioning) on to stay asleep." 
</P>
<P>
 "By 9 o'clock in the morning we knew we were going to be out here," added 
Spark's tanning buddy, Michael Hoobs, 27, also of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologist Scott Entrekin of the National Weather Service's Oxnard office 
said the strong high pressure system had settled almost directly over Southern 
California, and that it covered most of the southwestern United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's temperatures, which reached highs of 93 in Ojai and 92 in Thousand 
Oaks, did not set any records, Prater said. Temperatures in Oxnard reached a 
high of only 77 along the coast, and in Ventura the high was 78. Oxnard and 
Ventura are typically cooler than the inland valleys because of their proximity 
to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-March, Santa Ana winds brought even warmer temperatures to some parts 
of the county than the highs reached Thursday, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 But forecasters agreed that Thursday was definitely among the hottest days so 
far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As temperatures climbed in Thousand Oaks and Westlake, residents took cover. 
Lunchtime crowds ducked under umbrella-shaded tables and workers laboring 
outside tried to plan their tasks around the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything you have to do with exposure to the sun, you like to finish by 
mid-morning if possible," said Jack Koval, a grounds supervisor for the Conejo 
Park and Recreation District, who was cooling off beneath a cluster of trees in 
Triunfo Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Grooming baseball fields, which requires direct exposure to the sun, is 
suitable work for early morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But tasks such as tree-pruning and sprinkler repair are best saved for the 
hottest part of the day, he said, because leafy branches provide shade from the 
sun and irrigation work allows for a good soaking. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, busloads of sweating children disgorged themselves onto a 
sidewalk that shimmered through waves of heat and headed for swim-time at the 
Rancho Simi Community Pool. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within an hour of the Olympic-sized pool's opening, about 240 children were 
already splashing, diving and screaming in the water, said cashier Rick Riley, 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened the doors, they all gasped, 'Finally!' " said Riley, sweating at 
the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 Across town, baking in the basket of a cherry picker 30 feet above the ground, 
Ricardo Grajeda screwed a big red plastic W onto the front of the new Edwards 
10 Cinemas. 
</P>
<P>
 Grajeda said he had spent most of the day there, with only a straw hat and 
mirrored shades to keep the sun off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a warm, warm day," he said over the whine of his electric screwdriver. 
"A couple of beers right now would cool me down."

STATE PANEL RECOMMENDS EXTENSION FOR BAILARD; LANDFILLS: COMMITTEE VOTES TO 
ALLOW THE DUMP TO OPERATE UNTIL 1997. ADVISERS TO INTEGRATED WASTE MANAGEMENT 
BOARD HEAR HOURS OF COMPLAINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bailard Landfill inched closer to remaining open until 1997 on Thursday as a 
committee of a state waste management board voted unanimously to recommend 
extending the dump's permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-member Permitting and Enforcement Committee of the California 
Integrated Waste Management Board reached its decision after listening to more 
than three hours of complaints about Bailard's permeating stench, an incessant 
barrage of sea gull droppings, and a variety of health problems related to the 
223-acre landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot invite people to our home because of that stench," said John 
Christiansen, who lives in the River Ridge development near the dump. "They 
(sea gulls) sit on our roof and defecate." 
</P>
<P>
 The full six-member board will meet in Sacramento on Wednesday to decide the 
dump's longevity. The board's staff has already recommended to extend the life 
of the 34-year-old landfill, which was originally scheduled to close last 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors voted 4 to 1 in March to keep the dump 
open until 1997 or until it reaches its maximum capacity of 3.15 billion tons. 
The board favored keeping the dump open, over the objections of speakers 
including the nuns of Sister Servants of Mary, whose convent sits only 500 feet 
from the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they have no other place to dump the 1,000 tons of trash 
produced in western Ventura County daily. They decided to extend the permit 
after a proposal to open a new dump in Weldon Canyon near Ojai was defeated 
following an eight-year fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn of Oxnard, who voted against the extension, helped 
orchestrate the opposition to the landfill at Thursday's hearing before the 
state committee. About 40 residents voiced complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Flynn considered the hearing to be a step forward because committee 
members agreed to make sure the dump closes in 1997, he was disappointed by 
what he considered a lack of respect for the public's opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people have spoken, and the bureaucracy has failed to listen," said 
Flynn, who plans to fly to Sacramento for Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who live near the Bailard landfill argued that three more years is 
intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went into my back yard the other day, and the entire top of my barbecue was 
covered with sea gull droppings," said Daniel Lechliter of north Oxnard. 
"Obviously that is not a very healthy cooking environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the speakers were opposed to the extension, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Baggerly, an opponent of the proposed Weldon Canyon landfill, said, 
"The extension of the Bailard Landfill will provide the cities and Ventura 
County additional time to implement their recycling and green waste programs." 
She also said it would allow the county to finish studying the idea of hauling 
trash outside of the county for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tila Estrada, an Oxnard real estate sales agent, said she contracted a case of 
valley fever and attributes it to dust coming from the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a rash all over my body," she said. "I thought I was going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard High School, which is scheduled to relocate near the landfill, had 
experienced landfill-related odor and sea gull problems at their previous site. 
Principal Bill Thrasher now expects the problem to get worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be difficult in our classrooms," Thrasher said. "Due to the 
odor, we'll have to keep our windows closed." 
</P>
<P>
 After weighing public comments, a report from one of their inspectors, and the 
county's environmental documents, the committee followed the recommendation of 
their staff by voting for the extension. Committee members, however, expressed 
surprise at how little Ventura County had done to look for alternative sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're getting down to no capacity and no game plan in that area," said board

LOBBYING TRIP LEAVES SUPERVISORS DISCOURAGED; BUDGET: STATE CUTS WOULD COST THE 
COUNTY NEARLY TWICE AS MUCH AS FORECAST. THE LOSS WOULD COME ON TOP OF A 
$16-MILLION SHORTFALL ALREADY PROJECTED. 
</P>

<P>
 A lobbying trip to Sacramento left Ventura County leaders more discouraged 
than ever about state cuts that could strip as much as $10 million from the 
county budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably yesterday's meeting with our legislators was the most depressing 
that we have ever had," Supervisor Vicky Howard said Thursday after a one-day 
trip to the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look at their situation and feel that they are worse off than we are. 
They will take funds wherever they can get them." 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, the Legislature has scaled back some of its most severe 
proposals and spared Ventura and other counties from painful cuts. This year's 
trip, however, brought news that Gov. Pete Wilson's latest cost-cutting 
initiatives would cost the county nearly twice as much as earlier forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 That $10-million loss would come on top of a $16-million shortfall county 
leaders have already projected for the coming year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the problem, Ventura is one of five counties statewide affected by 
three of the governor's newly proposed cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Under his plan, the state would seize more property tax revenues, take money 
back from county hospitals, and grab federal funds that counties use for human 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have become what we call a 'three strikes, you're out' county," Howard 
told her fellow board members. 
</P>
<P>
 The only glimmer of hope, she added, is a legislative effort aimed at limiting 
the damage done to any one county. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and Senate Speaker Pro Tem 
Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), seemed interested in the proposal that would 
affect Ventura, Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Mateo and San Luis Obispo 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators were less receptive to complaints that the brunt of the budget 
cuts fall on counties, not on city governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a clear acknowledgment that what was happening wasn't right, but 
there was also the acknowledgment that it's easier to hurt the county than the 
cities," said Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who was part of Wednesday's lobbying 
trip. "The cities have a louder voice and (they) just don't want to deal with 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 But county cuts could begin affecting city residents, said Supervisor Susan 
Lacey. 
</P>
<P>
 "The folks who are not going to get services are folks who live in cities. At 
some point, this isn't going to work anymore," she said. "If you live in a 
city, the number of people we could end up actually laying off could really 
hurt the economy. It's going to hurt the economy of the cities, not just the 
county." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the supervisors asked its department heads to prepare 
budgets that reflect an 8% cut or an 18% cut, if law enforcement agencies were 
left untouched. In a daylong hearing Thursday, they began learning how agencies 
would suffer under another round of cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal Regulation Director Kathy Jenks stressed that her staff is already 
stretched thin. Recently, one animal regulation officer had to deal with 
roosters from a Piru cock fight, injured seals on the beach and a horse on the 
highway all in the same afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Resource Management Director Thomas Berg said one option might be closing a 
county office in Simi Valley that allows east county residents to process 
permits without driving to Ventura. The proposal that produced glares from 
several supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Agricultural Commissioner Earl McPhail offered to have his staff take over 
custodial duties for his department rather than cut personnel. "We're willing 
to empty our own trash, vacuum our own floors, clean our own bathrooms," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several department managers complained of the internal fees they must pay 
other county agencies for cleaning, data processing and other tasks. The board 
agreed to address these agencies in their budget hearing Tuesday afternoon.

COUNCILMAN URGES SALES TAX FUNDS GO TO OPEN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Ventura County leaders consider today whether to pursue a half-cent 
transportation sales tax, Ventura Councilman Steve Bennett is urging the Board 
of Supervisors to change the proposal so that half the money would go toward 
preserving open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Transportation Commission is expected to decide today 
whether to ask the supervisors to place a tax measure on the November ballot. 
The measure would increase the sales tax from 7 1/4 cents to 7 3/4 cents, 
raising more than $500 million over 20 years for highways, city streets and 
public transit in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 If the commission agrees to go forward, the measure would face a series of 
hurdles before it could be placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the supervisors' support, the measure would need approval from 
a majority of the county's 10 cities -- or at least enough cities to constitute 
a majority of the county's population. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to the supervisors, Bennett said the proposal would be more likely 
to pass if voters were assured that transportation improvements would not lead 
to rampant development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people view transportation taxes as encouraging urban sprawl," Bennett 
said. "This is a classic way to neutralize that natural opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Stephens, a transportation planner for the commission, said splitting 
the funds would not leave enough revenue to pay for much-needed transportation 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with a full half cent for transportation, it's difficult for us to pull 
together all the projects we need to meet transportation and air quality 
issues," Stephens said. "So cutting that in half obviously would be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bennett, who says his proposal has the support of a range of environmental 
groups, said transportation leaders should be willing to compromise to gain 
approval for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should work together on this," Bennett said. "Half a loaf is better than 
no loaf at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn, who serves as an alternate on the Transportation 
Commission, said the best solution may be to place both options on the ballot 
and let voters decide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should rule out greenbelts as a possibility," Flynn said. 
"We should let the voters chose whether they want to spend all the money on 
transportation or part of it on greenbelts, or not raise taxes at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Bennett's plan gains enough support to win a place on the November 
ballot, it may not pass legal muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Special state legislation is required to grant counties the right to increase 
sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 A blanket law allows for sales tax measures throughout the state for 
transportation, but no such law exists for measures dealing with environmental 
preservation, said Penny Bohannon, the county's liaison with the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said that if his proposal received voter approval, the Legislature 
could then be asked to pass the legislation needed to collect the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo, who serves on the Transportation 
Commission, said voters will not be willing to support a sales tax increase in 
November, period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue here isn't what the money will be spent on," said Schillo, who is 
running for the Board of Supervisors in November. "The issue is that people 
don't want to pay more taxes."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MAN SENTENCED IN MORTGAGE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tarzana tax preparer has been sentenced to five years' probation for his 
role in a $7.6-million mortgage fraud scheme that involved the purchase of 
expensive houses in Ventura and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Arend, 62, who pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud, was also 
ordered to pay $10,000 in restitution, Assistant U.S. Atty. Peter Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 The restitution is "a drop in the bucket, compared to the total losses in this 
case," Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arend was a tax preparer for Navtej Kohli, 35, of Malibu, and Charles Myers, 
49, of Camarillo, who orchestrated the complicated scheme, Spivack said. The 
two pleaded guilty in February and will be sentenced July 21, Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohli and Myers managed to cheat banks and homeowners out of millions of 
dollars with the help of fraudulent escrow companies and fake buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohli and Myers would approach owners who were selling residences worth 
$500,000 or more and offer to buy the property, Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with two others who also plead guilty in the case, Kohli and Myers 
would prepare documents that actually listed the buyer as another person -- a 
fake buyer who was paid $5,000 to $10,000 by Kohli and Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 The escrow papers would also inflate the sale price of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a paper sell only and the real seller never sees any of the documents," 
Spivack said. "It's created solely to fool the banks." 
</P>
<P>
 Arend, who could have received 60 years in prison for his role in the scheme, 
received a light sentence in exchange for his early cooperation and his 
agreement to testify against Kohli and Myers, Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohli pleaded guilty in February to one count of conspiracy and 10 counts of 
mail fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 He could be sentenced to up to 305 years prison but will probably receive six 
to 10 years, Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and seven counts of mail 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 He also faces up to 305 years in prison but will probably receive between six 
and 10 years. JOCELYN Y. STEWART

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CONDORS MOVING INTO POPULATED AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cousins of the California condors that were moved from the Sespe Condor 
Sanctuary in Ventura County to a more remote site have succumbed to the same 
attraction as the Sespe birds: they are too curious to stay away from populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologists stationed in Ventura said this week 
that some of the five birds released at Lion Canyon in Santa Barbara County 
have begun roosting near the small community of New Cuyuma. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists have begun hazing the birds to urge them away from the tiny rural 
community and back to the vast expanse of open mountains and plains in the Lion 
Canyon area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're expanding their range slowly from that (Lion Canyon) site," service 
biologist Chris Barr said Thursday. "We're trying to encourage these birds to 
cover as much ground as they can to encourage them to forage farther." 
</P>
<P>
 Barr and a team of other Fish and Wildlife Service biologists monitor the 
existing five vultures daily, leaving carcasses every few nights to feed the 
young birds. So far, they have ventured as far as 25 miles from where they were 
released, Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the first eight condors released into the Sespe had to be captured and 
moved to Santa Barbara County after four others died in a series of accidents 
when they clashed with civilized areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But biologists also reported more successes with the program to reintroduce 
the near extinct bird. 
</P>
<P>
 The captive breeding program produced the biggest crop of California condor 
chicks ever since the program began in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen of 21 eggs at zoos in Los Angeles and San Diego and a third site in 
Idaho hatched into healthy young birds during the first four months of the 1994 
breeding season, Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 As many of 10 of the chicks will be released this December into the Lion 
Canyon area where five young birds already are based, Barr said.  
</P>
<P>
 Lion Canyon is about 60 miles northwest of the Sespe Condor Sanctuary near 
Fillmore, where the first two California condors bred in captivity were 
reintroduced into the wild in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really excited to have anywhere between seven and 10 releasable birds 
this year," Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we can expect more and more in future years." 
</P>
<P>
 The 15 chicks born this year at the Los Angeles Zoo, the San Diego Wild Animal 
Park and the World Center for Birds of Prey in Idaho have increased the number 
of California condors to 90. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, just 27 of the vultures were left alive from thousands that roamed 
the skies of North America in past decades. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNTY OFFICERS REACH OUT TO SPECIAL 
ATHLETES 
</P>

<P>
 As part of a statewide effort to raise money for the Special Olympics Summer 
Games, 140 Ventura County law enforcement officials ran Thursday in a 
torch-carrying procession from the Santa Barbara County line to Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade-like caravan was the local portion of an endeavor that started on 
June 13 with law enforcement officers in Sacramento. The relay will end today 
in Los Angeles, when runners carry the torch into UCLA's Drake Stadium for the 
opening ceremonies of the games. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special ceremony Thursday at Ventura City Hall, county officials 
recognized the efforts of the county's law enforcement officers, who took turns 
carrying the torch in the 48-mile cross-county relay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County portion of the run actually started Wednesday afternoon at 
Bates Road near the Santa Barbara County line. The torch was picked up Thursday 
at Emma Wood State Beach north of Ventura, and the run continued to Ventura 
City Hall, and from there went to Oxnard and the Pacific Coast Highway, and on 
to the Los Angeles County line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has participated in the games since 1968, when California first 
began taking part in the nationwide competition. The games give developmentally 
disabled children and adults a chance to compete in sports such as swimming, 
gymnastics, track and field, softball and bowling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The games give them the opportunity to be the best they can be," said Carol 
Newsham, area director for the Special Olympics in Ventura County. "It improves 
their self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-eight Ventura County athletes were chosen from among 700 competitors who 
sought spots on the team, Newsham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic ability wasn't the sole criterion for choosing team members, Newsham 
said. Coaches also considered the athletes' attitudes, willingness to work hard 
and compassion for their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's run was the culmination of the officers' yearlong efforts to 
contribute to the games, Newsham said. Throughout the year, officers sold 
T-shirts and held special events such as "Tip-A-Cop," where officers worked as 
waiters in local restaurants and donated their tips to the program. 
Collectively, the fund-raising efforts raised more than $3,500 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Agencies participating in Thursday's run included the district attorney's 
office, Ventura Police Department, the county Sheriff's Department, California 
Highway Patrol, Oxnard Police Department, the county's Corrections Services 
Agency and Camarillo State Hospital Security Police. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Siemens, an investigator with the district attorney's office, who 
participated in the run on Wednesday and Thursday, was taking part for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy (participating) because it is a recognition of their (special 
athlete's) efforts," Siemens said, after completing his run. "Things that we 
take for granted, they have to struggle to achieve." CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN IS FOUND GUILTY IN SLAYING, ROBBERY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury convicted an Oxnard man Thursday of second-degree murder 
and robbery in connection with a shooting near Channel Islands Harbor last 
September and a robbery of a grocery store several weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Garcia, 23, faces a mandatory prison sentence of 15 years to life in 
the death of Wayne Mansir, 24, of Mandalay Bay in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 He also faces up to five more years in prison for using a firearm in the Sept. 
29 slaying, as well as up to 12 additional years for robbing the Smith's Food & 
Drug Center in Oxnard 10 days before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison said Garcia would be eligible for parole 
in about 21 years if he receives the maximum sentences for the convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison had asked for a conviction of first-degree murder during his opening 
statements in the trial, but said Thursday that he is pleased with the verdict 
returned by the jury, which heard about three weeks of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "After talking to the jury and hearing how they reasoned through the facts of 
the case, I think they did a very conscientious job," Ellison said. "I think 
it's a very good verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Richard E. Holly had claimed that Garcia shot Mansir in 
self-defense. Authorities say Garcia showed up at Mansir's family home and 
pumped several bullets into the victim. The two had been friends, but Holly 
said they argued over proceeds from the Smith's robbery -- which totaled 
$187,000 -- and Mansir's physical abuse of Garcia's wife and child, hours 
before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly also told the jury that Mansir had a gun when he was shot, although 
police never found a weapon. Authorities also never found any of the loot from 
the robbery, and Garcia refused to say what happened to it when he testified 
during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison has said some of the money was spent on visits to a Hollywood strip 
club, limousine rides and other entertainment. DWAYNE BRAY

 A 70-year-old Camarillo woman was killed when she stepped behind a friend's 
car as it was backing up and was knocked down and dragged 10 feet before the 
vehicle came to a stop on top of her, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Michael was killed Wednesday evening when her friend, Ann Dosick, 79, 
both of Camarillo's Leisure Village, was backing up her car in front of 
Michael's home in the 2600 block of Leisure Village No. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Dosick had come to Michael's residence to pick her up for an evening function 
they were to attend together, Ventura County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also said it is not known why Michael walked behind the moving car.

DEPLORING RACISM

 The recent fire at the Stanford home in Oak View reminds residents that there 
is a strong perception of racism in the Ojai Valley. Although officials now say 
it was not arson, this incident brought the issue to the fore once again. 
</P>
<P>
 The League of Women Voters of Ventura County deplores hate in all forms. We 
have extended our condolences to the Stanfords, and herein express our concern 
to any person who has experienced racially motivated harassment. We call upon 
all public, civic, professional, service and church organizations and officials 
to make it clear that the Ojai Valley will not allow any violation of personal 
or civil rights.

PRAISING PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was glad to read about the success of the Simi Valley Police Department's 
bicycle patrol detail (June 10). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, while still employed as a Simi Valley police officer, I approached 
Lt. Neal Rein about the possibility of starting a bicycle patrol detail in the 
city. Lt. Rein supported the program, and I went to work on putting a plan 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked City Council members Judy Mikels and Bill Davis to support my project. 
Both did so willingly. I was told, however, that the city did not have the 
money to fund the project at that time. My projected cost was about $1,200 per 
officer. I waited patiently for the bicycle detail to be funded, but it never 
was.  
</P>
<P>
 I applaud the new chief of police and the City Council for going ahead with 
the project. I'm sure the city will see the benefit of police officers on 
bicycles just as many other cities across the nation have. It's just too bad 
Simi Valley is so far behind the other departments in instituting new ideas and 
trying new products. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish the officers assigned to the detail all the best. Just be careful out 
there.

EXAMINE PRIORITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The failure of Measure Z in Port Hueneme and the subsequent talk of a 
utilities tax raise some issues that need to be addressed.  
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Hamilton, one of the Founding Fathers of American conservatism, said 
that "taxes are the price we pay for civilization." I firmly believe that it is 
not so much that people object to paying taxes as they object to the way the 
government spends the taxes it collects. The good people who worked so 
diligently on the campaign and the great majority of voters who supported the 
measure bear this out. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, we must ask how we got to the point where public safety is tossed 
into the political arena to be booted about like a football. Admittedly, Port 
Hueneme -- like the rest of California -- has been forced to endure severe 
cutbacks in revenue. It is at times such as these that budgetary decisions 
become most critical.  
</P>
<P>
 Can we really afford to pay our city manager more than Los Angeles pays its 
mayor? Do we really need a full-time, fully staffed Planning Department in a 
city that's 98% built out? Ought we to be placing a higher priority on 
landscape maintenance than on building maintenance? Should we continue to fight 
our citizens with the pursuit of otherwise avoidable lawsuits, the loss of any 
one of which would bankrupt the city? 
</P>
<P>
 For the sake of argument, let us propose a different scenario. Let us imagine 
a government that agrees with the majority of its citizens and puts public 
safety right at the top of its priorities. Then let us suppose, with the police 
budget taken care of, that this government then goes to the voters and asks for 
new taxes to pay for legal fees to pursue litigation rather than reach an 
out-of-court settlement. I wonder how many votes they would get then. 
</P>
<P>
 Times of great difficulty are also times of great opportunity. Now is the time 
to re-examine our priorities. Now is the time to seek out new directions. Now 
is the time to begin the journey from where we are to where we ought to be. 
With clear hands and sharp pencils, we can build a future that works for 
everyone.

NEEDED: A DRAG STRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to address a growing problem in Ventura County and perhaps 
provide some ideas for a workable solution. The problem is illegal street 
racing.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time this activity goes on unnoticed in the late night and early 
morning hours at secret locations throughout Ventura County. Unfortunately, we 
read only of such events after there is a tragic fatality. Often the victim is 
"an innocent bystander or a motorist in "the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the interest of public safety, we could provide a safe, supervised, 
accessible facility for such events. Ventura County needs a drag strip. 
</P>
<P>
 We must realize as long as there are motor vehicles in a country that thrives 
on competition, the will to "be a winner" and "to be the best at anything we 
do," there will always be contests of acceleration -- legal or illegal. Drag 
racing started as soon as the second horseless carriage was built. 
</P>
<P>
 This program could be beneficial to our community. For example, an average of 
300 to more than 1,000 paying participants and spectators attend various small 
tracks throughout California every weekend. As a city or county-owned facility, 
the revenue collected would go directly into our local economy, as well as 
creating jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the only options legal racers in this county have nearby are Los 
Angeles County Raceway, which is 75 miles away, or in Palmdale or Bakersfield 
raceway (100 miles). Let's not forget Big Willie Robonson's Brotherhood Raceway 
on Terminal Island in Long Beach (70 miles). Yes, Brotherhood Raceway is 
working. With the help of L.A. Mayor Richard Riordan and the L.A. Harbor 
Commission, the City Council members realized this was an excellent program to 
get racing off the streets, and get LAPD officers working on real crime issues 
instead of chasing down good kids with fast cars and bikes. Plus, at $10 a head 
(to race or watch), that's a sizable amount of money to operate and even make a 
small profit for the city of Long Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 We need a program like that in Ventura County.

IMMIGRATION GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In reading your June 4 story on the Border Patrol's arrest of 320 illegal 
immigrants in Ventura County, I was struck by Border Patrol Agent Mike Malloy's 
characterization of the apprehended law breakers: "There weren't tears, 
resistance or crying. A lot of joking and kidding, actually.They know what the 
game is -- it's something they knew when they entered this country." 
</P>
<P>
 We as a nation should be ashamed of ourselves, because we have failed so 
miserably to control our borders that illegal immigration has indeed become a 
game to the thousands who illegally enter this country each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal immigrants perceive the remote possibility of apprehension and 
deportation as an inconvenience more than anything else, a momentary hassle 
worth enduring in exchange for the siren song of free education, medical care 
and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to get tough on illegal immigration and regain control of our borders, 
if only to convince those who flout the laws of this nation that doing so is no 
laughing matter.

DAILY DISCRIMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When most of us hear the term discrimination, we think of racial 
discrimination. Few of us consider or are even aware of the many forms of 
discrimination that nearly every one of us faces every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many citizens endure discrimination daily from the U.S. Postal Service. We all 
pay 29 cents for a stamp, but some of us have to walk half a block to our 
mailbox. Newer neighborhoods are likely to have locked mailboxes (Las Posas 
North), while some neighborhoods -- even though the mailbox is four houses down 
the road -- are the old-fashioned unlocked variety (Mission Oaks). It seems 
that only the oldest neighborhoods still rate door-to-door mail delivery 
service (Barry Street), yet we are all charged the same amount for postal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic discrimination is very evident in our schools. Many high school 
seniors skipped the prom this year because the $1,000-plus costs are just too 
much for their family's budget. Many girls will not try out for the 
cheerleading or drill teams because of the $500-and-up costs of uniforms and 
related expenses. Athletic teams are not asked to pay for their uniforms. Why 
are the support groups required to do so? 
</P>
<P>
 Students who come from low-income families are expected to pay for supplies 
for numerous special class projects, which affect their grade. This trend in 
demanding expensive projects seems to be increasing rapidly. Teachers, even in 
grammar school, ask their students to pay for supplies to be used in learning 
exercises. Many students who qualify for the free lunch programs refuse to use 
it. They would rather go hungry than face the stigma attached to receiving the 
free meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Discrimination is a part of our daily lives.

SOBER GRADUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Graduation day is drawing near for thousands of high school seniors in Ventura 
County. For seniors and underclassmen alike, it is time for great celebration. 
Unfortunately, end-of-the-school-year celebrations, such as graduation, often 
result in drunk-driving accidents. As we look to these upcoming graduation 
ceremonies with pride and pleasure, we must remember to take the time to remind 
our graduates to have a safe and sober evening. It is also important to make 
sure that our children are aware of the lifelong consequences that result from 
driving under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, according to the California Highway Patrol, 66 kids, all at the age 
of 18, died as a result of alcohol-related accidents. Twenty-nine of these kids 
were passengers in the car. That is an almost 50-50 split between the number of 
deaths for drivers and passengers. So whether you are the driver or the 
passenger, the odds are not in your favor. Drinking and driving is not a game, 
and it's a sure bet you're going to lose if you try to play. 
</P>
<P>
 As your state representative, I know it is my job to fight for tougher 
sentences for those who choose to drive drunk. As a father of five children and 
grandfather of four, I know it is my personal responsibility to educate my 
family on the damaging effects of this irresponsible behavior. Let's all make a 
conscious effort to make 1994's graduation a safe and sober evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations to the graduating class of 1994, and also to the parents of 
these bright individuals, for the hard work and determination it takes to 
receive a high school diploma. A special thank you as well, to all of the 
individuals across California who are helping to sponsor Grad Night activities 
for the youth in our communities. My hat is off to all of you for making a 
difference.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; NEIGHBOR TAKES DIM VIEW OF SCHOOL 
GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glancing toward his back yard, Newbury Park resident Arthur Minazzoli spied a 
curious sight: a bunch of guys milling about, looking suspiciously like 
engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 He wandered out to talk to them and learned they were planning to build a 
$1.7-million assembly room just 20 feet from his property line, on the campus 
of Cypress Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 Minazzoli was furious -- especially when he discovered that the building would 
rise two stories high, blocking his view of the school's athletic fields and 
the soft, distant ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had little recourse. 
</P>
<P>
 State law grants school districts the right to build classroom-related 
facilities without consulting neighbors, city planners or council members. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mayor Alex Fiore told Minazzoli, the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
"can build anything they want, anywhere they want and paint it any color they 
want." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials used that right to begin work on Cypress 
Elementary's multipurpose room, for use as a cafeteria and auditorium. Parents 
raised funds for the project through jog-a-thons and other events, and 
architects spent two years designing the annex, said Assistant Supt. Sarah 
Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers placed the multipurpose room near Minazzoli's back yard lot because 
that site offered easy sewer and utility hookups and could be efficiently 
supervised, Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't put a building like that way out back on our athletic field, 
because the entire school will use it for lunch," Hart said. "It has to be part 
of the campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school district did not consult city planners, the building will 
follow all Thousand Oaks design codes and safety standards, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 That explanation did not, however, satisfy Minazzoli or his neighbor, Dean 
Weissman. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's council meeting, the two protested angrily, telling city leaders 
they had received no notification of the school district's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very concerned (with) this kind of a surprise," Weissman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart acknowledged that school officials did not specifically notify residents 
of the construction plans. But every neighbor received frequent invitations to 
attend fund-raisers for the Cypress Elementary multipurpose room, she said, and 
should have been aware of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the grading is under way. The annex should be completed by next 
spring -- to Minazzoli's dismay. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my back yard, we can see the surrounding hills, the park," he said. "Now 
it's going to be a big block wall." STEPHANIE SIMON

 I would not disagree with those who say that maybe people want another trash 
dump in Ventura County.But the tactics of two of the signature gatherers I saw 
lead me to believe that there has been some distortion about the purpose of the 
Weldon Canyon petition drive. 
</P>
<P>
 I go in and out of the Oxnard post office daily and to my knowledge, the topic 
of a dump was never mentioned, only concerns about recycling. Then, in front of 
Walmart, I saw the same thing being done: One lady mentioned the dump, and the 
petition gatherer changed the subject to a recycling idea.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; STUDENT, 17, KILLED IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shane Umberger, 17, a popular Moorpark High School student, died in a traffic 
accident in Northern California on his way home from a rock concert, his 
mother, Carol Kelley, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane died after his friend fell asleep while driving and the car went off the 
road near Yreka, rolling several times before stopping, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane was pronounced dead at 6:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 His friend, Josh Thompson, also of Moorpark, was only slightly injured in the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said neither of the boys was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were returning from a Grateful Dead concert in Oregon.  
</P>
<P>
 Shane's mother, who was in New York City, said that her watch stopped at 6:25 
a.m. that same morning. Her son knew his death was imminent, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just believe there was some spiritual power at work," she said. "I was 
talking with his friends and it just seems like there are a million things that 
show he knew."  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Kelley said, her son had asked her to call him "Angel." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was just another funny thing kids do, but now I can see he was 
telling me something," Kelley said by phone from Kentucky where Shane is being 
buried. "He just knew it was going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her son, who sang and played guitar for the local alternative rock 
band Sorrow's End, removed all the music posters from his room and put up a 
picture he had drawn over his bed of an angel playing guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently changed his phone answering machine to say, "Don't call me here 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Kelley said, the last song that the Grateful Dead sang at the concert was 
"Knocking at Heaven's Door." 
</P>
<P>
 The family planned a memorial service for 7 p.m. Thursday at Arroyo Vista 
Community Park in Moorpark. SCOTT HADLY

CITY'S BUILDING SLUMP MAY MEAN LAYOFFS; MOORPARK: SO SLOW IS DEVELOPMENT THAT 
PLANNERS HAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO OTHER DEPARTMENTS. AND NOW OFFICIALS HAVE TO 
CONSIDER LETTING SOME GO. 
</P>

 Moorpark, the town that once was one of California's fastest-growing cities, 
is seeing so few new homes built these days that city officials are considering 
laying off members of the planning department. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark is still the second fastest-growing city in Ventura County. But a 
four-year building slump has forced officials to assign city planners to work 
in other departments. Some are drawing up parking ordinances, or purchasing 
park benches, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city managers assure there is no lack of work for the employees, they 
said they are sorely lacking in new development fees that subsidized the 
planning department. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the planning department recoups the cost of its employees by 
charging developers fees for staff time to review building permits. Moorpark 
issued so many permits in the 1980s -- about 1,900 in 1986 alone -- that the 
city accumulated a $2-million surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 But since 1990, the city has issued only about 440 permits. As a result, the 
city's planning department -- with its full- and part-time staff of 16 
planners, code enforcement officers and administrative assistants -- has had to 
use the surplus to cover expenses. The surplus has shrunk to less than $150,000 
and the city now faces the possibility of wiping out the surplus altogether, 
said Assistant City Manager Richard Hare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Layoffs are always a last resort, but we haven't had any big new developments 
to process," Hare said. "Something has to give."  
</P>
<P>
 Rough estimates by city staff show that fees for permits and other revenue 
collected by the department account for only about 25% of the department's 
existing budget, said Mayor Paul Lawrason. But Lawrason is confident that the 
city can avoid layoffs by shifting some planning department employees to other 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be an interim fix," said Lawrason. "In a small city like ours, 
employees have to get used to doing things that don't exactly fit their job 
description. With increasing development, we'll likely need them again, but a 
shift isn't all bad because they'll get cross-training, making them more 
versatile." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Scott Montgomery said layoffs should be considered, no matter 
how uncomfortable the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're faced with the age-old problem of our expenses exceeding revenues, and 
we're going to have to make some tough decisions," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the possibility of layoffs looms large because no new developments 
are likely to be built in the next year or two, members of the city's planning 
staff offered no comment on the possible changes in their department.  
</P>
<P>
 Eloise Brown, a former City Council member and a frequent critic of city 
spending, said that if the personnel are not needed for planning then they 
should be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not really planning, it shouldn't be performed by a planner," she 
said. "Maybe it should be the police department writing new ordinances on 
parking or a purchasing agent who buys our park benches." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is reviewing the budget this week, and Lawrason said the 
council is likely to make a decision on budget cuts at its 7 p.m. Wednesday 
meeting at City Hall.

PLANS FOR MULTIPLEXES NEXT TO THOUSAND OAKS ARTS PLAZA OFFERED; ENTERTAINMENT: 
TWO CINEMA CHAINS HAVE APPROACHED OFFICIALS ON BUILDING UP TO 18 SCREENS ON THE 
FORMER JUNGLELAND SITE. THE CITY IS AWAITING MORE DETAILS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Envisioning an entertainment mecca where the Jungleland zoo once stood, 
executives from two cinema chains have approached Thousand Oaks with 
preliminary proposals to build up to 18 screens next to the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Both General Cinema and Pacific Theaters have expressed interest in opening 
multiplexes on the eastern 11 acres of the former Jungleland site, a slice of 
city-owned property that has been set aside for private development. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials briefly discussed the plans this week but put the matter on 
hold while they await details. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do consider the Civic Arts Plaza an 'A' location for a theater," said Jay 
Swerdlow, executive vice president for Pacific Theaters. "We would want to 
build a theater in keeping with the upscale Thousand Oaks neighborhood . . . a 
state-of-the-art theater in every way." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has dangled the 11-acre site before potential developers for years -- 
even printing a brochure advertising "unique, centrally located property." 
</P>
<P>
 With eight acres of perfectly flat land, a sloping knoll by the freeway, 
readily available utility hookups, and just one oak tree, the eastern portion 
of Jungleland looks ready for development. 
</P>
<P>
 But the cinema proposals represent the first serious interest since 1991, when 
Lowe Developers of Los Angeles failed to find financing for its plan to build a 
232-suite hotel, office and commercial space, and eight-screen theater on the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 In this latest bid, both General Cinema and Pacific Theaters "have indicated 
they would try to do a layout of their proposal so we can see what they have in 
mind," said Ed Johnduff, the city's liaison with prospective developers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the blueprints materialize, however, some residents who have 
studied the site's potential are concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 An advisory committee of 107 residents ranked movie theaters fourth on its 
wish list for the Jungleland site -- below boutique shops, restaurants and 
office space, and tied with museums. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also agreed that any development next to the Civic Arts Plaza 
should be "people-oriented" and "pedestrian friendly," with broad appeal to woo 
families, singles and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing art galleries and specialty shops as possible features, some residents 
urged "an aesthetic, touchy-feely approach . . . an appeal to the spirit and 
the mind and the heart," committee member David Carpenter recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than a movie theater where you park, dash in, see the movie and dash 
out, we would like to have an attraction that would encourage people to stay 
and walk around," Carpenter said, proposing a festive town plaza with street 
performers and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the philosophical divide, several council members said they would 
worry about traffic and parking if a huge cinema opened next to the Civic Arts 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza's two theaters can seat a combined 2,200 spectators, but 
the nearby garage holds only 735 cars. To deal with overflow parking, city 
officials have suggested opening the undeveloped 11-acre site to theater-goers. 
If a cinema swallows up that space, the city would have to find extra parking 
spots elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Such issues would be considered in future planning sessions if the theater 
executives go ahead with their proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern: whether Thousand Oaks can absorb a dozen or more new screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Janss Mall developers are planning to replace a faded, two-screen 
cinema with a plush nine-screen Mann Theater. Sketches of the proposed 
Seventh-day Adventist shopping mall in Newbury Park also include a multiplex. 
</P>
<P>
 And Pacific Theaters has received city approval to build a 10-screen cinema 
off Borchard Road, also in Newbury Park. That project, which also includes a 
senior housing center, office buildings and restaurants, has been on hold for 
nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the delays in building the Newbury Park complex, Pacific Theaters 
executive Swerdlow said he is interested in pursuing up to 14 screens on the 
Civic Arts Plaza site, which would enjoy high visibility and freeway access. He 
cautioned, however, that plans remain "very preliminary." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 General Cinema's vision of a Jungleland multiplex is equally sketchy. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's attorney, Bob Rosenthal, would not comment for the record. But 
in a letter to the city last month, he wrote that his clients "are very 
interested" in building 10 to 18 screens, as "the Civic Center site appears to 
be an excellent location for an entertainment type of use." 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the layout, a multiplex and parking garage could still leave room 
for at least one restaurant on the private side of the Jungleland lot -- 
something theater director Tom Mitze would like. 
</P>
<P>
 "Restaurants are a natural complement for a performing arts facility -- they 
help each other," Mitze said. "The most often asked question at the box office, 
after 'How much?' and 'Where are my seats?' is 'Where can we eat?' "

RESIDENCY VERIFICATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The DMV and INS recently linked up by computer to verify the legal residency 
status of people applying for their first-time driver's license or 
identification card. This cooperation by the agencies is costing the taxpayers 
$1.1 million.There's only one catch: renewals cannot be traced. Would this 
feature have added another $1.1 million to the deal? 
</P>
<P>
 I've never understood how an illegal immigrant could obtain a driver's 
license, or any other state funded service for that matter. Now I know. Lack of 
simple cooperation and common sense. I guess we expect too much from our state 
and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't it make better sense to spend the money for additional border patrol 
to eliminate the infiltration of illegal immigrants before they brave the lines 
at the local DMV? 
</P>
<P>
 I've been driving in California for seven years and have never been stopped. I 
think those odds are pretty good. Don't you?

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; ITALY'S WIN OVER NORWAY IS ANYTHING BUT 
ROUTINE; GROUP E: A MAN SHORT, AND WITHOUT NO. 1 GOALKEEPER, ITALIANS HANG ON 
FOR 1-0 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 The 1994 World Cup took yet another bizarre turn Thursday when Italy defeated 
Norway, 1-0, in front of 74,624 at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was expected. The manner in which it was achieved was not. 
Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The first time Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca touched the ball, he 
was out of the penalty box and was tossed out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When Italian Coach Arrigo Sacchi sent reserve keeper Luca Marchegiani on in 
place of Pagliuca, somebody else had to come off. 
</P>
<P>
 -- To the surprise of many in the stadium and to the utter astonishment of the 
Italian media, Sacchi chose Roberto Baggio, the world player of the year in 
1993 and the player who was to lead Italy to glory in USA '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 20 minutes had gone and Italy was down to 10 men. It got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Franco Baresi, once regarded as the best sweeper in the world, was injured 
only minutes into the second half and limped off the field, his World Cup 
participation possibly ended. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Later in the second half, Paolo Maldini, among the best left backs in 
soccer today, also was injured and was sidelined for about four minutes. That 
meant Italy was playing nine against 11. 
</P>
<P>
 And still the Italians won, making a 69th-minute goal by Dino Baggio (no 
relation to Roberto) stand up for the final 20 minutes despite increasingly 
dangerous offensive forays by the Norwegians. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Italy, Ireland and Norway have each won a game in Group E and 
share the top spot with three points each. Mexico, which plays Ireland in 
Orlando today, is still looking for its first point. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a peculiar day all around at Giants Stadium, where a World Cup face 
lift and new grass field have turned it into an altogether satisfactory soccer 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, Sacchi once again juggled his starting lineup. The coach has 
been criticized repeatedly by the Italian media and the fans for confusing 
players by constantly using different lineups and formations. It has not 
stopped him from tinkering with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Sacchi made three changes from the team that lost to Ireland, 
1-0, also at the Meadowlands. He dropped defender Mauro Tassotti, injured 
midfielder Alberico Evani and midfielder Roberto Donadoni and brought in 
defender Antonio Benarrivo, midfielder Nicola Berti and forward Pierluigi 
Casiraghi. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Norway Coach Egil Olsen appeared quite satisfied with the team that 
had beaten Mexico, 1-0, at Washington and made only a single change. He dropped 
midfielder Jahn Ivar Jakobsen and replaced him with forward Sigurd Rushfeldt. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the changes seemed to have the slightest bit of impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuseppe Signori kicked off to Roberto Baggio and the game immediately settled 
into a familiar pattern, with Norway defending and Italy attacking. The 
Norwegians are capable of absorbing tremendous pressure without cracking and 
the Italians got more and more frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the 21st minute, came the surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Oyvind Leonhardsen broke free up the middle and bore down on the goal with 
only Pagliuca to beat during a rare Norwegian counterattack. The goalkeeper 
rushed out of his net and, indeed, out of his penalty area and tried to tackle 
Leonhardsen just as he tried to chip the ball over him. 
</P>
<P>
 Up went Pagliuca's arm to block the ball and Germany referee Heinz Hellmut 
Krug immediately produced his red card. Pagliuca had handled the ball outside 
the area and had to be sent off. There was no choice involved. 
</P>
<P>
 On came Marchegiani, who turned in a respectable performance, and then, to the 
raised eyebrows of almost everyone, off came Roberto Baggio. 
</P>
<P>
 "The substitution of Roberto Baggio was a difficult decision to make," Sacchi 
told the Associated Press. "But it was good for him and the team because I 
needed nine players who could run a lot. And I did not want to tire him too 
much. He can be decisive against Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Down to 10 men for the better part of 70 minutes, Italy actually played quite 
well, with Demitrio Albertini orchestrating matters in midfield and Signori, 
Casiraghi and Berti causing Norway all sorts of headaches when they went on the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, with the crowd beginning to wonder if it was going to witness the 
first 0-0 game of World Cup '94, the long-awaited goal came. 
</P>
<P>
 A foul by the inexperienced Alf Inge Haland, Norway's right back, led to a 
free kick from Signori. The ball curled into the box, Dino Baggio forced his 
way between two defenders and headed home a splendid goal over the outstretched 
arms of Erik Thorstvedt, who until then had produced a flawless performance in 
the nets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norsemen attacked in numbers for the final 20 minutes, even bringing 
Kjetil Rekdal, who scored against Mexico, into the game with slightly less than 
10 minutes to go, but it was to no avail.

ANOTHER DAY OF SURPRISES CLAIMS MANY; WIMBLEDON: NO. 3 EDBERG AND NO. 5 COURIER 
ARE MOST PROMINENT UPSET VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Swede-turned-Londoner Stefan Edberg arrived at Wimbledon with a No. 3 seeding 
and the memories of two Wimbledon championships. He didn't figure he'd be going 
home Thursday . . . to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's where Edberg will be, at home and at a loss to explain how he was 
beaten by 113th-ranked Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark, 6-7 (8-6), 6-7 (8-6), 6-2, 
6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, he wasn't the only seeded player departing the premises 
prematurely. American Jim Courier, a finalist last year and seeded fifth this 
time around, dropped his second-round match to France's Guy Forget, 3-6, 6-3, 
3-6, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget, a virtual no-show on the tour because of a knee injury, had seen his 
world ranking drop to 1,130. Had it not been for a ruling that allows an 
injured player to keep his protected ranking -- in Forget's case, 24th -- the 
Frenchman would have been back home in Neuchatel, Switzerland, channel surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he bounced Courier, who has never been entirely comfortable playing 
on grass. But this? 
</P>
<P>
 "I told (Forget), if I have to lose to somebody and give them my bonus point, 
I'd just as soon as him have them," Courier said. "He played well. He deserved 
to win." 
</P>
<P>
 But the daily upset binge didn't stop with Edberg and Courier. Eleventh-seeded 
Petr Korda of the Czech Republic lost to Germany's Markus Zoecke, 4-6, 6-7 
(7-5), 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. Zoecke was ranked 104th. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Katarina Maleeva of Bulgaria, seeded 16th in the women's draw, 
dropped her match to Indonesia's Yayuk Basuki, 5-7, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeats sent the Wimbledon seeding committee running for partial cover, 
especially since the sport's most prestigious tournament has now lost three men 
seeded among the top five -- Edberg, Courier and No. 2 Michael Stich -- and its 
No. 1 woman, the supposedly invincible Steffi Graf. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been worse. No. 8 Sergi Bruguera of Spain, winner of the last 
two French Open tournaments, needed nearly 4 1/2 hours to beat Australian 
Patrick Rafter, 7-6 (7-4), 3-6, 4-6, 7-5, 13-11. Rafter, ranked 21st, is no 
pushover. Then again, no one compares him to Rod Laver, either. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what Wimbledon has been reduced to: a grassy free-for-all. Edberg, 
Courier, Maleeva gone on Thursday. Stich, No. 8 Natalia Zvereva, No. 12 Anke 
Huber, No. 14 Marc Rosset and No. 16 Arnaud Boetsch on Wednesday. Graf on 
Tuesday. Cedric Pioline, seeded No. 15, and, on the women's side, No. 15 Sabine 
Hack, were both ousted on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, if you can string a racket and know the difference between ad court 
and Margaret Court you can win this thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it has changed this year," Edberg said of the upsets galore. 
"Whether it is going to start a trend, I cannot tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 With another day of unlikely losses, the totals stand as follows: among seeded 
players, seven men and five women are history. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to be this way. For instance, Edberg's game -- big on serve 
and volley -- was considered good enough to get him to at least the 
quarterfinals, if not the semifinals. He hadn't lost to an unseeded player 
since 1986, hadn't failed to reach the third round since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 None of that mattered Thursday. For only the third time in his career, Edberg 
took a two-set lead and somehow lost in five sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to say -- I had my chances," Edberg said with something of 
a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 It is becoming a common theme during Wimbledon's Week 1. Opportunities lost. 
Just ask Courier, Graf and the rest of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg led in the fourth set, 2-0, but botched the next game and that was 
that. Carlsen, ranked as low as 1,036 three years ago, took advantage of the 
opening and never glanced back, except for one brief, late moment. That's when 
the Swedish star fought off four match points to hold serve and close the gap 
to 4-5 in the third set. 
</P>
<P>
 So much for valiant comebacks. Edberg couldn't win a point in the next game 
and left the court looking for his car keys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fought for every point out there," Edberg said. "I didn't take my chances. 
That's the story." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it didn't hurt Carlsen's chances that Edberg wasn't much of a 
serving threat. He used to have one, especially a second serve that did all 
sorts of wonderful things. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Thursday. Carlsen recorded 14 aces, Edberg two. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he lost a little bit of his concentration and I got into the match in 
the third set and won that very big," said Carlsen, who was playing in only his 
sixth Grand Slam event. "Then in the fourth set he was pretty tired. He had 
some chances to win that one." 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was Carlsen's first against a seeded player in a Grand Slam event, 
and only his eighth overall. As if it matters these days at Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory by Forget was another matter altogether. An elite player before 
his injury, Forget underwent knee surgery last September and played only a few 
matches before making his way to Wimbledon under protected status. He beat Doug 
Flach in the first round and then found himself matched against Courier. By 
ranking, it was the worst mismatch in history: No. 7 vs. No. 1,130. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what to expect," Forget said. "When I came in here, I had a few 
wins and I looked at Wimbledon just trying to win one match. When I saw the 
draw, I thought, 'It's a tough one but you never know . . . just try to play 
your best.' I knew I could have lost and I could fly home tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Forget admitted what almost everyone in the stands had already figured 
at match's beginning.

MIKE DOWNEY: ELS IS THE NEW KING OF HIS ARENA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Downey's California: 
</P>
<P>
 -- He mops his brow with a golf towel. He flips the soggy towel to the 
gallery. He demonstrates his tee stance one last time. He wiggles his hips. He 
leaves the U.S. Open in a white shirt, white slacks and white jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladies and gentlemen, Els has left the arena! 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Chokelyn." 
</P>
<P>
 A Spike Lee joint. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tonya Harding, wrestling manager: 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on! Whip his butt! Here, whack his knee with this! Pow! That's it! Wham! 
Gouge his eyes out! Good! OK, circle him, circle him! Now attack! Let's go! 
What is this -- wrestling or ice dancing! Mix it up! Do something! Anything! 
Pretend your shoelace is broken! Get him! OK, somebody get me this guy's hotel 
room number! Man! Do I gotta do everything around here?" 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bulletin: 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-foot-tall goalkeeper joins native Nigeria soccer team! Retires from NBA 
championship team! Film at 11! 
</P>
<P>
 -- Orange hair? Orange beard? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, but I still say American soccer player Alexi Lalas looks like Woody 
Allen disguised as El Presidente in the movie "Bananas." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prediction, 1996: 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously motivated Colombian basketball team 102, totally surprised U.S. 
Dream Team 101. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Question: Why did the Bay Area go after both Darryl Strawberry and the L.A. 
Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: They hoped to get 16 games out of each of them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No, no, no, I seriously doubt Ken Griffey Jr. will hit 162 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Houston Rockets are to championship basketball what Tom Arnold is to 
Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Seen that TV exercise commercial? Chris Evert walks really funny. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wyatt Earp never walked that funny and he wore chaps all day. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Remember when I said nobody could beat Steffi Graf? Uh, never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Did you know that if actress Halle Berry married Los Angeles sportscaster 
Gary Apple and then divorced him to marry Dodger shortstop Eddie Pye that she 
would then be Halle Berry Apple Pye? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Jordan, designated misser: 
</P>
<P>
 No home runs, one triple in three months. For a 6-foot-6, 200-pound baseball 
batter, he ain't exactly Mr. Power, is he? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Laker shake-up: 
</P>
<P>
 Later today, sources tell me, the Lakers will promote Mitch Kupchak to Grand 
Chief Executive General Manager and Jerry West to High Exalted Numero Uno Head 
Honcho General Manager. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Man walks on moon. Nixon resigns office. Communism ends. Berlin Wall falls. 
</P>
<P>
 The really impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland wins pennant? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only three things make me nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 One, the threat of nuclear war. Two, the state of the global economy. Three, 
Andre Rison's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Some people frown on Fox TV's proposed NFL announcing team of Pat 
Summerall, John Madden and Heather Locklear, but not me. 
</P>
<P>
 -- I looked up moron in the dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
 It said: "(noun) 1. Adult with the intelligence of a child. 2. Stupid person. 
3. Person who cheers for O.J. Simpson's car." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Speaking of morons: 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, "Forrest Gump" is 6-6, 242 pounds by his 16th birthday. In the 
film, "Forrest Gump" is Tom Hanks. I love Hollywood more than life itself. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Coming this Christmas: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hakeem Olajuwon Story," starring Wesley Snipes. "Babe Ruth II," with 
Woody Harrelson. "Martina," starring Holly Hunter. "Jimmy Johnson and Jerry 
Jones," with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito. 
</P>
<P>
 -- USA-Romania this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 If you Romanians now fear our great soccer superpower and wish to back out, we 
will understand. 
</P>
<P>
 -- By the way, is soccer fever in Romania called Romaniamania? 
</P>
<P>
 -- More later on that report about the Minnesota Timberwolves moving to 
Cameroon.

MORNING BRIEFING: COACH SAID 'SIT ON IT,' AND HE DID 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenny Smith of the NBA champion Houston Rockets said that in the first 
organized basketball game he played, his team was leading by a point with a few 
seconds to play when the coach told him to sit on the ball and run out the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listening to everything he said, I literally sat on the ball, not knowing the 
meaning of the term," Smith said. "I sat on the ball, but the clock ran out and 
we won the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he was 8 years old at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Rockets: It has been reported that Houston had never won a major 
professional championship in any sport until the Rockets beat the New York 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sort of. The Houston Oilers won American Football League championships 
in 1960 and 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the major league record for grounding into the most 
double plays in a season? 
</P>
<P>
 Infamous: Tennis Magazine France recently conducted a survey of 65 top male 
pros asking them to rate their peers in various categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the winners were Stefan Edberg, best sportsman; Michael Chang, most 
intelligent; Ivan Lendl, most professional -- and Austria's Horst Skoff, 
biggest cheat. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of Skoff's alleged cheating were not provided. 
</P>
<P>
 No big deal: The Detroit Tigers share the major league record with the 1941 
New York Yankees for hitting at least one home run in 25 consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Trammell of the Tigers isn't impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I don't see what the record really means," he said. "I think 
it's a meaningless record. What's it worth if you (finish) in last place?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey beggars: NBC's Conan O'Brien: "The New York Rangers are celebrating 
their victory by traveling around the city carrying the Stanley Cup. And out of 
habit, many New Yorkers are throwing change in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Make-up call: In a recent Morning Briefing item from the Washington Post, 
Baltimore Oriole owner Peter Angelos criticized Manager Johnny Oates, saying 
among other things that Oates was "not a very good manager." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has since apologized in a letter to Oates, saying his remarks were 
taken out of context and were made while the Orioles were losing a one-sided 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding update: Tonya Harding has agreed to appear as a feisty waitress in an 
independent filmmaker's movie about a woman running from the mob. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding will play Gina, a waitress who accidentally receives a cache of money 
from the mob in "Breakaway."

 Trivia answer: Jim Rice of the Boston Red Sox, with 36 in 1984.

 P.J. Carlesimo, who transformed Seton Hall from a college basketball also-ran 
into a Big East Conference powerhouse, was named coach of the Portland Trail 
Blazers on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlesimo, 45, reportedly will be paid $1.5 million a year in the five-year 
deal, making him one of the highest-paid coaches in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not something that I applied for," Carlesimo said. "This was just 
something that came to me as a dream. It was a very easy decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlesimo replaces Rick Adelman, who was fired after 5 1/2 seasons with the 
club. The new coach inherits an aging team that was eliminated in the first 
round of the playoffs the last two years after making it to the NBA finals in 
1990 and 1992. College Basketball

BASEBALL ROUNDUP; WITT DOESN'T GET CALL, MISSES PERFECT GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It won't say so in the record book, but as far as Bobby Witt is concerned, he 
pitched a perfect game in beating the Kansas City Royals Thursday at Oakland, 
4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt (5-7) had a perfect game until Greg Gagne beat out an infield hit with 
one out in the sixth. Gagne grounded to first baseman Troy Neel, who threw to 
Witt covering the bag. Umpire Gary Cederstrom called Gagne safe on a close 
play, although TV replays appeared to show that Witt and the ball beat Gagne to 
the bag. Witt did not allow another hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly believe when I looked down, I saw my foot hit the bag, then 
Gagne's foot hit," said Witt, who tied a career high with 14 strikeouts. He did 
not walk a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, by the replays, the man is out at first," Witt said. "I think 
(Cederstrom) missed the call. But there's nothing I can do about it now, and I 
can't speak out about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Witt was in control throughout and showed no signs of fatigue. He struck out 
six of the last seven batters, striking out the side in the eighth and two 
batters in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Umpire crew chief Drew Coble would not allow media access to Cederstrom, but 
he did make a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called it the way he saw it, and we have no further comment," Coble said. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's took a 1-0 lead in the first when Stan Javier doubled to right with 
one out, took third on Brent Gates' infield single and scored on Ruben Sierra's 
grounder. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth, Rickey Henderson was hit by David Cone's pitch with two out and 
Javier followed with a home run to left.  
</P>
<P>
 Chicago White Sox 13, Seattle 2 -- Ozzie Guillen hit a three-run homer, his 
first homer since last July, and tied a career high with four RBIs at Seattle. 
Lance Johnson drove in five runs and Julio Franco homered, drove in three runs 
and scored three times for the White Sox, who won their third game in a row 
after losing 12 of 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 7, San Francisco 5 -- Not even a four-homer game at Riverfront 
Stadium could end the San Francisco Giants' slump or their bad luck. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants have lost five in a row and 12 of 14 to fall 12 games under .500 
and 6 1/2 games out of first in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams hit two solo homers, Barry Bonds hit a solo shot and Steve 
Scarsone hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Chuck McElroy to make the score 
7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants ended the game with their best pitcher injured again. Bill Swift 
(8-5), the Cy Young Award runner-up last season, re-injured muscles in his 
right side -- the same injury that sidelined him for two weeks earlier this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift left the game after giving up Hal Morris' bases-loaded double, which 
made it 4-1 with two out in the fourth. He had hurt his side three batters 
earlier while making a throw to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Cubs 9, Florida 3 -- Mike Morgan, just off the disabled list, pitched 
six strong innings at Joe Robbie Stadium and won for the first time since Sept. 
20, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan (1-7), who had lost nine consecutive decisions, yielded two runs and 
seven hits.

LASTER HELPS U.S. DEFEAT MEXICO IN WATER POLO'S ALAMO CUP 
</P>

 Jeremy Laster was told Wednesday night he would be playing with the U.S. 
national team at the Alamo Cup. On Thursday, he made the most of his 
opportunity, scoring four goals and adding three assists in a 14-1 victory over 
Mexico at Corona del Mar High. 
</P>
<P>
 Laster, a San Clemente High graduate who helped Stanford win the NCAA title 
last fall, had been assigned to play with the U.S. B team in the tournament. 
However, Chris Humbert, the United States' leading scorer at the Barcelona 
Olympics, won't be finished with his professional team in Italy until 
Wednesday, so Laster was his late replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after he entered the match as a reserve, Laster made his presence felt. 
Two minutes into the second quarter, he took a long pass from goalkeeper Dan 
Hackett, walked the ball in and scored to give the U.S. a 4-0 lead. Three 
minutes later, he took another pass from Hackett and scored again. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, Mexico's defense was lagging, and Laster easily outswam his 
pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt myself getting open on the counter," said Laster, who also 
blocked a shot and had two steals. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Rich Corso said he was pleased with how the defense is developing. 
Mexico is one of the weaker teams in the tournament, but the U.S. totally took 
it out of the game. Mexico had more turnovers (21) than shots (15). The U.S. 
had 16 steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can establish our defense, with our end-to-end speed, we feel we can 
get out there on the fast break," Corso said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took most of the first quarter to establish the break. The match was 
scoreless until Kirk Everist scored the first of his six goals with 46 seconds 
left in the quarter. Everist scored on a breakaway after a pass from Hackett, 
one of three assists for the Irvine High graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team, which took 33 shots, built its lead to 10-0 before Mexico's 
Raul Hernandez scored a man-up goal with 3:54 remaining. Alex Asta scored 
twice, Mike Burke, a San Clemente High graduate, had a goal and an assist, and 
Eriks Krumins, a Newport Harbor graduate, scored once. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, which has won each of the previous two Alamo Cup 
tournaments, finishes pool play today at 11:45 a.m. against Japan and 8 p.m. 
against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 The first series of four games starts at 8 a.m. today; the second slate starts 
at 4:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba beat Japan, 19-5, earlier Thursday. Australia defeated Canada, 17-7, and 
Hungary beat the U.S. B team, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time Olympian and former UC Irvine standout Mike Evans, who retired from 
competition after the 1992 Games, scored three goals for the U.S. B team.

RESERVE'S GOAL SAVES BULLFROGS; ROLLER HOCKEY: ARSENAULT'S SCORE IS THE 
DIFFERENCE AS ANAHEIM HOLDS OFF SAN JOSE, 7-6. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Bullfrogs got something they didn't see much of last season -- a challenge 
-- and the defending league champions had just enough to squeak by San Jose, 
7-6, Thursday at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Shayne Arsenault scored with 5 minutes 8 seconds remaining to give the 
Bullfrogs the insurance goal they needed. San Jose rallied from a four-goal, 
fourth-quarter deficit and made the Bullfrogs sweat for their Roller Hockey 
International victory in front of an announced crowd of 9,281. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shayne is a godsend right now," Bullfrogs Coach Grant Sonier said. "His goal 
was huge." 
</P>
<P>
 Arsenault started in place of last season's playoff most valuable player, 
Bobby McKillop. McKillop, recovering from a sprained right knee, was ready for 
action Thursday, but Sonier wanted to rest him for Saturday's game at San Diego 
and Sunday's game against the Blades at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries claimed two more Bullfrogs players Thursday. Leading scorer Victor 
Gervais suffered a mild concussion nine minutes into the game, and defenseman 
Yuri Krivokhija suffered a shoulder injury in the third quarter. Neither 
returned to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victor didn't know where he was after he got hit," Sonier said. According to 
Sonier, Krivokhija suffered a bruised rotator cuff. He and Gervais might miss 
both games this weekend, Sonier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's victory was not secured until Kevin Kerr won a faceoff deep in the 
Bullfrogs' zone with 1.5 seconds remaining, and the puck slid harmlessly into 
the left corner untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 7-6, the Rhinos pulled goalie Grant Sjerven in the final minute and 
had an excellent opportunity with 40 seconds remaining. Guy Gadowski had an 
open net, but his rebound shot sailed over the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Steve Beadle got his stick on that one," Sonier said. "San Jose plays 
a similar style to us and they're a very good hockey team." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Woolf had two goals and three assists to lead the Rhinos (3-1-1), who 
entered the game in second place in the Pacific Division behind the Bullfrogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad McCaughey had three goals and an assist and Jim Brown had two goals for 
the Bullfrogs (5-0), who built a 6-2 lead after three quarters. Goalie Rob 
Laurie had 37 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers captain Mark Messier, owner of the Tampa Bay Tritons, took 
the Stanley Cup trophy to Expo Hall in Tampa Bay on Wednesday for viewing and 
so fans could pose for photographs with it. . . . Shortly after acquiring Carl 
LeBlanc in a trade with Atlanta for Colin Ward, the Bullfrogs traded LeBlanc 
Sunday to San Jose for a 1995 third-round draft pick, Bullfrogs Coach Grant 
Sonier said. The Bullfrogs signed forward Rick Judson to take Ward's roster 
spot. "Rick is extremely strong with the puck and will add to our offense," 
Sonier said. . . . The Bullfrogs have back-to-back games this weekend, playing 
at San Diego Saturday and at the Forum against the Los Angeles Blades Sunday. 
The Bullfrogs return to The Pond of Anaheim July 29 to play Portland.

WOODS ADVANCES IN STATE AMATEUR GOLF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Tiger Woods of Cypress defeated San Diego's Kevin Riley on Thursday at Pebble 
Beach Golf Links to advance to today's quarterfinals of the California Golf 
Assn.'s six-day State Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 18, who was 2-under par in his 3-and-2 victory over Riley, will play 
Todd Andrews, 22, of Solana Beach this morning, with the winner advancing to 
the afternoon's semifinals.The scheduled 36-hole finale will be played 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-time USGA Junior Champion, Woods has played Pebble Beach 8 under in 
his two matches and the second stroke-play qualifying round. Andrews was even 
par in his 1-up victory over 1993 Northern California Golf Assn. player of the 
year Randy Haag. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Woods, a senior-to-be at San Jose State, continued his par-breaking ways 
with a 6-and-4 victory over Yorba Linda's Chris Berry. Woods made four birdies 
(Nos. 2-4-12-14) and was 3 under for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 That performance came after shooting 69-73 -- 142 to claim medalist laurels. 
Woods was 1 under in Wednesday's first-round, 8-and-6 victory over Jamey 
Forsyth. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Woods, 22, will play Helendale's Mark Johnson, 38, the oldest surviving 
player. Johnson played 3-under par in his 4-and-3 victory over 1990 champion 
Charlie Wi. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other upper-bracket quarterfinal, Solana Beach's 21-year-old Tim Hart 
will play Rocklin's Steve Burdick, 20. Hart had to go 22 holes before defeating 
Elk Grove's Jeff Gilchrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdick, who Wednesday beat defending champion Casey Boyns, was 1 under in his 
3-and-2 victory over 1982 champion Gary Vanier. 
</P>
<P>
 The second match in the lower bracket will pit 21-year-old Kevin Marsh of 
Goleta against Ed Cuff, 32, of Temecula. Marsh was 1 under in his 3-and-2 
victory over Roger Tambellini. Cuff played even-par golf while nipping David 
Hutchens of Whittier with a birdie on the 19th hole.

TOP-SEEDED BLESZYNSKI ADVANCES, WILL PLAY HER FORMER SCHOOLMATE; JUNIOR TENNIS: 
THIRD-ROUND MATCH SLATED AGAINST UNSEEDED ROMY MEHLMAN, WHO WAS TEAM CAPTAIN AT 
HARVARD-WESTLAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Top-seeded Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks has breezed through the first two 
rounds of the Southern California Junior Sectional tournament in girls' 
18-and-under singles. 
</P>
<P>
 As she prepares for today's round of 16, Bleszynski could use bitterness to 
give her a competitive edge.  
</P>
<P>
 After all, her opponent -- Romy Mehlman -- was one of several players who 
voted to deny Bleszynski the chance to play tennis for Harvard-Westlake High 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But today will be no grudge match, Bleszynski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're friends at school," she said. "I guess it'll be a friendly match." 
</P>
<P>
 And if Mehlman, who beat Mary-Kate Callaghan of Los Angeles, 6-4, 6-2, 
Thursday, pushes Bleszynski? "Then it won't be as friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski and Mehlman, both seniors at Harvard-Westlake last year, were at 
odds last fall. Bleszynski wanted to play for the school team, on which Mehlman 
was the captain. Bleszynski, one of the top 16 players in the United States in 
her age group, said she could only practice with the team once or twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines said that wasn't enough of a commitment, and they went ahead 
and won a Southern Section championship without her. Bleszynski said she has no 
hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was (Mehlman's) fault," Bleszynski said. "That was a while 
ago and they won CIF without me. I wasn't really upset about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski, who has lots of pals on the junior circuit, has grown accustomed 
to graciously defeating her friends. She plans to add unseeded Mehlman of 
Beverly Hills to that group after the two play at 10:30 a.m. at the Los 
Caballeros Sports Village. 
</P>
<P>
 In other girls' 18 singles matches, second-seeded Krissy Hamilton of Agoura 
Hills defeated Hanna Brummett of Cardiff, 6-2, 6-1. Unseeded Monique Allegre of 
Camarillo defeated No. 8 Torey Pratt of Rancho Santa Fe, 6-4, 6-7, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In boys' 18 singles, second-seeded Derek Pope of Ojai routed Bret Hankey of 
Huntington Beach, 6-1, 6-1, and third-seeded Philip Tseng of Los Angeles and 
Harvard-Westlake High beat Jonathan Gilula of La Jolla, 6-3, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' 16 singles, No. 5 Jessica Kessler (Studio City) defeated Kerry 
Giardino (Palos Verdes), 4-6, 6-4, 6-4; No. 6 Kirsten Gross (Calabasas) 
outlasted Michelle Bray (Laguna Beach), 7-6 (10-8), 3-6, 6-2; and No. 7 Brandis 
Braverman (Encino) beat Shera Wiegler (Bell Canyon), 6-4, 6-1. Each advanced to 
the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 In boys' 16 singles, No. 3 Dylan Mann (Canoga Park) advanced to the 
quarterfinals with a 6-0, 6-2 victory over Matthew Snowdon (Los Angeles).

TENNIS / DANA HADDAD; WITH BIG GUNS OUT OF THE COUNTRY, AREA JUNIORS MOVE UP IN 
SECTIONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The bullies have taken their tennis to faraway lands this week. Now maybe 
somebody else will get a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the area's top players, particularly in the 16-and-under division, 
will miss the Southern California Sectional championships at the Los Caballeros 
Sports Village in Fountain Valley this week because they are competing for the 
U.S. Junior National team in international events. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the chief benefactors is Dylan Mann of Canoga Park. Southern 
California's top four ranked players in the division -- Kevin Kim of Fullerton, 
Bob and Mike Bryan of Camarillo and Geoff Abrams of Newport Beach -- are 
competing this week in France, so Mann has moved up from seventh to third. 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' 16 singles, Jessica Kessler of Studio City and Kirsten Gross of 
Calabasas jump up the ladder because No. 1 Erin Boisclair of Agoura and No. 4 
Sophia Managadze of Glendale are out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler and Gross each advance two spots to fifth and seventh in the seedings, 
but the maneuvering means little to Kessler. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm at the mental level I should be, it really wouldn't matter if Erin was 
in town or Sophie was in town," Kessler said. "I mentally have to be at a 
certain level." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, however, said the absence of Boisclair, who is in France with the 
national team, and Managadze, playing for her native Georgia in the former 
Soviet Union, will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think there's an opportunity," she said. "I know the people and 
I know their game. It would be a chance for a good win." 
</P>
<P>
 That's an understatement. A victory in the sectional -- the most important 
juniors tournament of the year in Southern California -- would probably bring a 
top-10 seeding in the girls' 16s national tournament in San Diego in July. 
There are 17 sections in the country, and the Southern California section is 
among the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross admits she would prefer avoiding Boisclair and Managadze. She has not 
beaten either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Erin being gone really helps," she said. "She's my friend, but I'm glad she's 
gone. And I told her that." 
</P>
<P>
 Opportunity also knocks for Derek Pope of Ojai and former Harvard-Westlake 
player Philip Tseng in boys' 18s. Second-seeded Carlos Sarmiento, a Newport 
Beach resident, cannot enter the sectional because of citizenship problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope is now seeded second behind Jakub Pietrowski of Huntington Beach, his 
doubles partner. Tseng is third. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finals after finals? Most area players will postpone their celebrations if 
they win at the sectional, because they are missing school tests that they must 
take next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who carries a 3.8 grade-point average at Calabasas High, missed her 
European history exam Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "But my teacher's pretty cool," she said. "He's not going to make me take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Final exams in Spanish and math at Beverly Hills High await Kessler, who took 
a biology test seven days early last week because of the tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea how I did," she said. "I definitely could have used an extra 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hillman, the tournament director, said approximately 10% of all 
participants in the sectional were still in school earlier this week. To try to 
minimize conflicts, he scheduled 900 matches in last weekend's qualifying for 
the main draw that started Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pichardo wins: Rita Maria Pichardo captured the women's open championship of 
the first tournament she entered since defecting from Cuba on June 12. 
Pichardo, 24, defeated University of San Diego's Dina Birch, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, at 
Fallbrook Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Pichardo, now living in Glendale, was the No. 1 women's player in Cuba. She 
was playing a professional satellite tournament in Mexico with the Cuban 
National team last October when she fled the country.

NO MORE MR. NICE GUY: LADIN TO BECOME OFFENSIVE; SENIOR GOLF: DEFENDING 
CHAMPION, NOW TWO SHOTS OFF THE LEAD, VOWS TO GO FOR BROKE AFTER SHOOTING 75 IN 
CAUTIOUS ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 What is this, football? Hockey? Maybe whatever passes for pro basketball these 
days? 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Ladin of Westlake Village had just finished the second round of the State 
Senior Amateur Championship when he began tossing around words like aggressive 
and attack , terms not typically associated with the genteel game of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Ladin said he played defensively and promised it wouldn't happen 
again. Today, he attacks -- even if he dies trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Friday) I either shoot 68 or 86," Ladin said. "I'm cutting every corner. I'm 
going for it." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't have far to go. Ladin, the defending State Senior champion, fired a 
three-over-par 75 at Poppy Hills Golf Course on Thursday to remain two shots 
off the lead with one round to go in the 54-hole stroke-play event. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin is tied for fifth with four others at 148. First-round leader James 
McMurtrey of Danville, a semifinalist in the 1993 U.S. Senior Amateur, shot 75 
to retain the top spot at 146. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin tees off in the second-to-last foursome today at 7:50 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Wagner of Camarillo and Jerome Chirpich of Granada Hills also made the 
36-hole cut. The 70-man field was trimmed to the low 24, plus ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladin, one of the longer hitters in the field, failed to gain ground on any of 
Poppy Hills' four par-fives. In fact, he didn't even make par, finishing with a 
birdie and three bogeys. He three-putted the par-five 18th from 18 feet for 
bogey, to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definite birdie holes too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He accomplished his primary goal, though. Ladin, 61, is well within range to 
defend his title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to stay close in case something happens," Ladin said. "These 
are amateurs, not professionals. Sometimes they whack a few into the woods, and 
if somebody's breathing down their neck, they can lose one or two strokes 
pretty fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner and Chirpich, who each finished at 155, rallied considerably to make 
the cut. Wagner, 60, fired a second-round 75 and Chirpich, 57, shot 74. Both 
made it by a whisker, finishing in a five-way tie for 24th place. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Patterson of Camarillo wasn't as fortunate. Patterson shot 76 in the first 
round, but when he missed a four-footer to double-bogey the 18th Thursday, he 
dropped his putter in disgust and disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he had a premonition. He finished with an 80 and missed the cut by one 
shot at 156. 
</P>
<P>
 "It blew me right out of it," said Patterson, who also bogeyed No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the leaders blow up today? Ladin predicted that a round of 70 or 71 would 
again bring him a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in the lead and the pressure's on, you think differently," he 
said of the leaders. "You start to think, 'Don't hit it here,' or 'Don't hit it 
there.' 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't play the way that got you there in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 A mistake he won't make again.

IT'S NO DAY AT BEACH FOR ERRATIC WI; GOLF: HE LOSES IN STATE AMATEUR, 4 AND 3, 
AFTER SPENDING MUCH OF MATCH-PLAY ROUND SCRAMBLING OUT OF THE SAND.

 How did it go for Charlie Wi at the Pebble Beach Golf Links on Thursday? 
</P>
<P>
 A clue: The stick he got the most use from was a rake. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it's called Pebble Beach, but Wi spent way too much time in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Wi fell behind early and was eliminated in the match-play round 
of 16 at the 83rd State Amateur Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, a Westlake High graduate who lives in North Hills, was asked after the 
round if there was a turning point in his lopsided 4-and-3 loss to Mark Johnson 
of Helendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Cracked Wi: "The first tee." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Wi won the first hole. Thereafter, though, Johnson hammered him. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was three under par when Wi conceded the match on the 15th green.  
</P>
<P>
 It marked the second consecutive year that Wi, the 1990 State champion and a 
five-time match-play participant in the event, could not advance beyond the 
second round of match play. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no turning point," Wi said. "I just played bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Wi spent most of the morning with a wedge in his hands, trying to dig himself 
out of trouble and save par. He found five bunkers. His ball found the fairway 
and green on the same hole all of three times. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, it was uphill most of the way against Johnson, the Southern 
California Golf Assn. Mid-Amateur champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 39, might have spotted the 22-year-old Wi a few years, but experience 
worked in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson jumped into the lead for good on the sixth hole, a 516-yard par five 
with an elevated green. Unable to see the green or flagstick from the fairway, 
he lined himself up with a small stake in the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little orange stake," Johnson said. "No, I think it was a red 
stake." 
</P>
<P>
 It resulted in a red number, for certain. Johnson drilled his second shot, a 
two-iron, to within six feet and made the putt for an eagle -- no small feat on 
the fabled course's No. 2 handicap hole. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 13th hole, however, that really drove a stake in Wi's hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 With Johnson 2-up, Wi had a great chance at gaining ground on the 13th, a 
392-yard par four. Wi's drive found the fairway and Johnson's landed in a 
bunker to the left. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, the door open, hit first . . . and yanked his iron shot well left of the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a stupid shot," said Wi, who attempted to fade the ball toward 
the flagstick and produced the opposite result. "As many times as I've played 
here and I still do dumb stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Wi was dumbfounded by what followed. Johnson hit the bunker shot of the day, a 
laser-beam four-iron that stopped six feet from the hole. Johnson made the 
birdie putt to move 3-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson hit 13 of 15 greens and was on the fringe of another. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting the 12-foot birdie putt Wi conceded on No. 15 and the three 
consecutive sudden-death playoff holes that Johnson birdied Wednesday in 
defeating Joey Ferrari of Lodi, he has played his last 18 holes a staggering 
seven under par. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, on the other hand, hit only seven of 15 greens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really got anything going," Wi said. 
</P>
<P>
 And just like that, he was gone.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; BOLIVIANS THROWING A FIT OVER SCORELESS 
TIE; GROUP C: ROUGH GAME AGAINST SOUTH KOREA ENDS WITH ANGRY SOUTH AMERICANS 
CRITICIZING OFFICIALS AND CRYING CONSPIRACY.

 Goals? Who needs goals? 
</P>
<P>
 Not the World Cup game between South Korea and Bolivia on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not when it involved crime and punishment, violence and vitriol, and a good 
old fashioned conspiracy theory. 
</P>
<P>
 The two gangs that couldn't shoot straight ended the game with this World 
Cup's first scoreless tie, probably knocking both from the tournament after the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
 That there was no winner figures in a game between countries that have yet to 
win a World Cup game in 15 combined tries. 
</P>
<P>
 What didn't figure was that it would be so much fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 54,456 at sold-out Foxboro Stadium, South Korea and Bolivia spent much 
of the evening fighting, with shin kicks and headlocks and bear hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was only 23 minutes old when a player from each team was taken off on 
a stretcher . . . at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Referee Leslie Mottram, a teacher from Scotland, responded with card tricks, 
handing out six yellows and one red. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the yellows went to star Bolivian midfielder Julio Baldivieso, his 
second yellow card of the tournament, causing an automatic suspension for the 
next game. 
</P>
<P>
 The red card and one-game suspension went to Bolivian midfielder Luis 
Cristaldo in the 83rd minute. 
</P>
<P>
 With forward Marco Etcheverry suspended for one more game because of a red 
card in the opener against Germany, the Bolivians will play their final 
first-round match against Spain on Monday without three of its best players. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which has totally convinced them that FIFA, soccer's governing body, 
wants them eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fine that we have to play Spain and South Korea and Germany," Cristaldo 
said through an interpreter. "But now we have to play FIFA and the referees. 
</P>
<P>
 "FIFA is only fair to the bigger guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Cristaldo was surprisingly expelled when given a red card instead of a yellow 
after tackling Kim Pan-keun from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown to him or the crowd or even the statisticians, it was his second 
caution of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after a postgame meeting with FIFA did the Bolivian team realize 
Cristaldo had been cautioned in the 24th minute for arguing with Mottram. 
</P>
<P>
 Not knowing why he had been ejected, Cristaldo argued even more after the red 
card. He went chest to chest with Mottram before finally being restrained by 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't understand where the card had come from, I told the referee I 
thought he was very unjust," Cristaldo said. "I don't think he understood me, 
but I told him anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Cristaldo left, the Bolivians became even angrier. Not only were they 
forced to play the final eight scoreboard minutes with only 10 players, they 
had to survive a surprising nine minutes of extra time before the game ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra time is accumulated for injuries and other stoppages. It is kept only on 
a referee's watch and is used up at the end of each half. 
</P>
<P>
 Many felt there had not been nine minutes of extra time accumulated in the 
entire game . 
</P>
<P>
 During that extra time, the Koreans nearly repeated the late heroics of their 
opener against Spain, in which they scored two goals in the final five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mottram had waited long enough, they probably would have. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Joo-sung missed wide left. Ha Seok-ju's shot was knocked left by 
goalkeeper Carlos Trucco. Ko Jeong-woon kicked a shot directly at Trucco. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, the South Koreans had finally tied the Bolivians with 20 shots 
each. But they could not untie the score. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game finally ended, several South Koreans collapsed in exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolivians trudged off the field in anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, things have always been made hard for Bolivia, and now is 
nothing different," said Guido Luayza Mariaca, president of the Bolivian Soccer 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if FIFA would rather have big-money teams from Spain and Germany 
advance from his group, Mariaca said, "You could say that." 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter handed a FIFA official a similar question for Bolivian Coach 
Xavier Azkargorta in the FIFA-controlled postgame press conference, the 
official refused to ask the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we have to pay somebody to let us win," said one Bolivian official. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Koreans, who have little chance in their final first-round game 
against Germany even with all of their best players, were appropriately somber. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have won," said Coach Kim Ho. "I wish our players had played 
calmly. I wish they had not rushed." 
</P>
<P>
 So does the U.S. team. It was pointed toward a second-round meeting with the 
winner of this game. Providing, of course, there was a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 And you thought this game made the Bolivians mad.

<P>
 Although his coach and the Moroccan players he frustrated last Sunday insist 
Belgian goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme is at the top of his game, Preud'homme 
begs to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the evidence -- a shutout that included several saves both teams 
deemed world class -- he says his best days are behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good period begins at 26, 27. At least for me, it was like that," said 
Preud'homme, who estimated that a keeper loses some of his reflexes and 
quickness in his mid-30s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not better than I was five years ago. I am 35. How can I be better?"

 Does the U.S. victory over Colombia compare to the U.S.'s hockey victory over 
the Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympics? 
</P>
<P>
 Not according to ABC's Al Michaels, who punctuated that 1980 game with: "Do 
you believe in miracles? Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the year, because of the Cold War and everything else surrounding 
that game, there's never been anything to compare it, and there never will be," 
Michaels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Will his call ever fit another event? 
</P>

 "I've retired it," he said. LARRY STEWART

 German journalists Peter Stracke and Lars Becker will be sharing a lap-top 
computer for the rest of the World Cup after Stracke's was stolen Wednesday 
from the press venue next to the Pontiac Silverdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Stracke and Becker work for Germany's Sports Information Services, which they 
hailed as the world's largest sporting news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Stracke said his computer was stolen from inside a briefcase at the venue 
while he was attending Wednesday's game between Romania and Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 For convenience, many journalists leave their computers at the main press 
center during games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've covered three Olympics and the World Cup in Italy, and I've never seen 
this," Stracke said. "I go all over the world and never see or hear anything 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to America. 
</P>
<P>
 So who gets first dibs on the remaining computer? 
</P>
<P>
 "Before each match, we will fight for it," Becker said. CHRIS DUFRESNE

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; COLOMBIA'S PLAY: 'COSMIC 
DREADFULNESS' 
</P>

<P>
 I would draw to your attention the curious incident of the Colombians at the 
Rose Bowl. The Colombians did nothing at the Rose Bowl.That was the curious 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia, favorites to win the World Cup, were beaten, 2-1, by the United 
States in one of the great upsets of World Cup history. The United States, it 
was widely predicted, would be the first hosts to fail to reach the second 
round. Now an advance is assured, but Colombia are surely out of the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And they went down in a performance of almost spooky gutlessness, of almost 
eerie incompetence. It was a performance of cosmic dreadfulness; and this from 
the team that beat Argentina, 5-0, in Buenos Aires last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As the game marched on, and the United States were given the freedom of the 
pitch, the Colombians kept their heads down. There was no player with clenched 
fists urging them goalward, no furious demands for defiance. There were no 
players yelling at teammates. There were no players exorcising frustrations in 
bad tackles. The Colombians accepted it all with a bizarre limpness. 
</P>
<P>
 (World Cup USA Chairman Alan) Rothenberg, and everyone else involved in this 
tournament, has a reason to go down on his knees in gratitude to the 
Colombians. Something took the heart and soul out of them. Any side can get 
beaten, any time, that is football's great beauty; but Colombia went down 
limply, reeling, writhing and fainting in coils.

 Although the financial dispute between Cameroon's players on one side and the 
country's soccer federation and government on the other has not been resolved, 
the Indomitable Lions' captain, Stephen Tataw, said after a practice Thursday 
that they will play today's game in Palo Alto against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were not going to play the game tomorrow, we would not have been here 
training," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He then reprimanded the media, claiming that the strike threat reported after 
Wednesday's practice in Moraga, Calif., was their invention. He was informed 
that Cameroon's goalkeeper, Joseph-Antoine Bell, had approached reporters 
before the practice and, without prompting, announced that the players were 
considering a strike, but Tataw was in no mood for a discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us concentrate on Brazil," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the country's sports minister arrived with $500,000 Wednesday to 
pay the players, they complained that they were still owed more. Another 
$400,000 reportedly is en route. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon's government is asking citizens to contribute to a fund, Coup de 
Coeur -- Touch of the Heart -- to pay the Indomitable Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the country is experiencing a financial crisis, Peter Essoka, who 
is covering the World Cup for Cameroon Radio-TV, said thousands of people have 
given. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all they can afford is 10 cents, they are giving 10 cents," he said. "That 
is how much pride they have in the Indomitable Lions. If the team does not win, 
of course, the people might ask for their money back." RANDY HARVEY

 The increased media attention lavished on the U.S. team since Wednesday's 
victory over Colombia has been a mixed blessing.While the players and coaches 
welcome the coverage, they are bemused by the sudden crowd on the bandwagon.

 Assistant coach Steve Sampson said he listened to the radio on his way to 
practice Thursday and heard some new programming.

 "It was a station that never, ever talks about soccer," he said. "They played

 The British papers all took their hats off to the United States' victory over 
Colombia, which finished after 2 a.m. Thursday in London. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having toiled in anonymity for years," wrote Michael Hart in the London 
Evening Standard from Pasadena, "Tony Meola and the United States football team 
finally galloped into view with all the thunder and bravado that John Wayne 
once brought to the silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their 2-1 win over Colombia -- tipped by many as potential winners -- ranks 
among the great shocks in World Cup history and is a result as memorable as 
(the) U.S.A.'s 1-0 win over the mighty England team in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short term, it almost certainly ensures (the) U.S.A.'s place in the 
second round and means Colombia's continuing nightmare will probably end with 
an early return home. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the longer term, of course, it establishes U.S. credentials as an emerging 
football power, just as they are attempting to launch a new professional 
league."

 Bogota's El Espectador newspaper reported on its front page that Colombia, "in 
one of its worst presentations ever," lost to the United States and is 
practically eliminated from the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Correspondent Esperanza Palacio Molina wrote from Los Angeles: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is nothing more, nothing less, than a problem of personality.Or a state 
of confusion. Colombia got its wires crossed. It is as if they knew how to play 
soccer in Spanish and upon arriving in the United States, they had to translate 
to English. And that left them fried. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia showed none of what it showed in the eliminations. Not talent, nor 
touch, nor happiness, nor soccer. Nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the front-page headline "Colombia's illusion died in the United States," 
El Tiempo's Victor Rosas reported from Los Angeles: "It is total failure and 
pain! Everyone -- players, coaches, fans and journalists -- we all ended up 
bitterly watching as an illusion unraveled. It is sad to watch a soccer team 
fall apart, to be impotent witnesses to a debacle, to observe while that hope 
called the Colombian National Team finished confused about its role, not 
knowing what it was playing, without a hint of that class that not long ago 
turned it into a national pride."

 Drivers should be prepared to run into a sobriety checkpoint somewhere in the 
city beginning at 9 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who are not disclosing the location, warn that some traffic may be 
delayed while drivers are checked for signs of drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers randomly stop about every 10th car, according to Sheryn Mauerhan of 
the department's traffic bureau. Those who fail the field sobriety test, which 
primarily tests balance and coherence, will be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The checkpoint program, funded by a grant from the California Office of 
Traffic Safety, conducts these random checks on a monthly basis. LESLEY WRIGHT

WHETHER IN A SUPPORT GROUP, THERAPY OR CHURCH, PEOPLE SEEK COMFORT IN ANONYMOUS 
CONFESSION. BUT WHEN THERE IS NO BINDING PROMISE TO KEEP YOUR CONFIDENCES, IT 
MIGHT BE WISE TO THINK TWICE BEFORE BARING . . . ; THE SECRETS OF YOUR SOUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Alcoholics Anonymous. Gamblers Anonymous. Cocaine Anonymous. The very names 
suggest shelter from the harsh judgments of society, safe places to confess 
ugly secrets and release the darkest demons of the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they do it in a free-form support group, a therapist's office, a 
church or some New Age talk center, people seek comfort -- and perhaps 
sanctuary -- in anonymous confession. 
</P>
<P>
 If only it were that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 For if those confessions involve a past crime or a future threat, and if the 
listener is not sworn by law or ethic to remain silent, the shield of anonymity 
can suddenly vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be easier. Doctors, clergy, psychoanalysts and family did most 
counseling and the rules were clear: They were bound in silence, particularly 
about dark truths of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But now there are all sorts of places to vent and confide, and just about 
anybody can claim to be a qualified listener -- no training or affiliation 
required. The rules of what may or must not be disclosed have become confusing. 
Even the Mafia's code of silence seems forgotten -- never mind the private 
lives of princes and presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 With aggressive prosecutors, insurance companies and computerized credit 
bureaus chasing personal data, it has never been more difficult to determine 
where is it safe to speak candidly. 
</P>
<P>
 For while confession might be good for the soul, it may be bad for a legal 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Cox, now on trial for murder in a New York City suburb, found this out 
the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Cox broke into his childhood home in affluent Larchmont and took a 
large kitchen knife into his parents' former bedroom. He had never met the 
couple sleeping there -- both doctors -- but he stabbed them 26 times. Later he 
would say that in his drunken rage, he thought he was attacking his mother and 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost five years the crime went unsolved despite vigorous investigation 
-- police went so far as to consult a psychic about who might have done it. But 
the cops couldn't crack the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Cox, 26, joined Alcoholics Anonymous. Among other things, the 12-step 
program required him to take a moral inventory and confess his alcohol-induced 
sins to God and to another human being. When he admitted committing the 
murders, one of several AA members present leaked the story to police. Cox was 
arrested and ultimately pleaded temporary insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Cox's lawyer tried to block AA members from testifying, saying 
Cox's conversations with them were "privileged communications" like those 
between a lawyer and client, a cleric and penitent or a husband and wife. The 
judge disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Cox had told his gruesome story to at least five fellow AA members who 
kept his confidence and who testified in court only after they were subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear of getting caught was why (Cox) stopped his education and why he was 
doing carpentry now," testified one, who identified himself only as Mr. A. "He 
said he didn't want to go to jail about it, but he felt his secret was safe at 
AA." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there are no legal requirements for members of groups such as 
Alcoholics Anonymous -- either to protect one another's confidentiality or to 
disclose criminal intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no absolute rules," says a 14-year veteran of AA in Los Angeles. 
"There are principles, and one is that what is said is confidential. But you 
can't be excommunicated or anything for violating that rule. And people do." 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of confidentiality, he explains, is meant to protect AA members 
from embarrassment, humiliation and public censure, and it is intended to 
liberate them to speak freely. But it's not inviolate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't put in there to protect people from the law," he says, although he 
has heard numerous confessions to crimes from petty theft to burglary to 
drunken driving. "It's always a matter of individual conscience what you ought 
to do when you hear such things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During a formal, one-on-one session with a certified therapist there would be 
no choice: The therapist is required by law and ethical codes not to breach the 
confidence. California and most other states make exceptions only if the 
patient might physically harm a third party or if the patient reports child 
abuse or, starting in 1995, abuse of an elderly person. 
</P>
<P>
 (An exception was made by a judge in the case against Erik and Lyle Menendez. 
Tape-recorded notes of sessions in which the brothers allegedly admitted 
murdering their wealthy parents were introduced as evidence because the 
psychologist believed that they were threatening him and others during those 
sessions.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had patients tell me they've killed people and kept it to myself," says 
Dr. James Beck, a Harvard psychiatry professor who wrote "Confidentiality vs. 
the Duty to Protect." "I've heard it all." 
</P>
<P>
 A mental patient once admitted to Beck that he had pushed an innocent 
bystander into the path of a subway train. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't turn him in," Beck says. "But whenever I'm in New York, you can bet 
I don't stand very close to the tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, Beck focuses on methods to help patients who are endangering 
others' lives. For example, the book explains how a therapist should counsel 
patients with AIDS who refuse to tell their partners about the disease. Or, how 
a therapist might advise a colleague who confesses to having an affair with a 
patient. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main point is the therapist should try not to think first about his or 
her professional duty to warn the victim, but rather about the clinical 
questions like how to talk to the patient about it so that they will go to 
authorities on their own," Beck says. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of Cocaine Anonymous in Los Angeles balked when he heard about 
privileges that are extended to psychotherapists but not to peer counselors 
such as members of CA. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just points out another middle-class hypocrisy -- money buys privacy," 
he says. "If you have the money, you can have the protection. A lot of people 
in CA can't afford a fancy shrink." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In California, this "law of privilege" between therapist and patient extends 
beyond the patient's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Susan Forward, a psychologist who counseled Nicole Brown Simpson prior to 
her divorce from O.J. Simpson, says she didn't realize that those counseling 
sessions should have remained private. Forward told KCBS-TV that Nicole 
Simpson, who was murdered last week, said her ex-husband threatened to kill her 
if she tried to leave him for another man. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would say to her things like, 'If I can't have you, nobody can,' " Forward 
told the TV reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward later apologized for revealing those conversations. "I was really 
totally convinced that the privilege ended with Nicole's death," she told a 
Times reporter last week after she was vilified by her colleagues. "My entire 
motivation for talking about this was to sound a wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Forward talked about the violation on CNN: "The problem with the 
privilege is there are so many different aspects of it and so many different 
times that it can be changed and waived . . . that I'm sort of uncertain, at 
this moment." 
</P>
<P>
 But a member of the American Psychological Assn. said the rules are quite 
simple: You don't publicly talk about a person unless they explicitly give 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The therapist who treated poet Anne Sexton set off a bruising controversy 
after her death when he turned over 300 tapes of her therapy sessions to a 
biographer. The therapist and Sexton's daughters argued that Sexton was a 
"confessional" poet who spent her whole life writing about her personal misery 
so people could learn from it. Sexton's therapist apparently spent $100,000 
successfully defending his decision to an outraged psychiatric Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason traditional therapists have long worried about the erosion of 
confidentiality is their fear that their profession is being mucked up by 
charlatans who call themselves "counselors." (Although the problem of 
therapists talking patients' problems around town is an old one: even Freud was 
known for gossiping about his patients.) 
</P>
<P>
 "You open the papers here and you see all these groups that are advertising 
all kinds of 'counseling,' " says Dr. Renee Binder, a psychiatry professor at 
UC San Francisco. "You can take off your clothes together and confess sins and 
call it therapy. People remember coming out of the womb and try to undo this 
traumatic event and call it therapy. People get together and scream and call it 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are not a member of a profession do not adhere to professional 
standards," Binder adds. "Let the buyer beware." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet traditionalists like Binder, who chairs the American Psychiatric Assn.'s 
committee on confidentiality, say they have even more reason to worry these 
days about the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethical concerns around the cases of Cox and Sexton and even Nicole Brown 
Simpson are aberrant. Many more people are affected by the current trend of 
insurance companies trying to pry information out of therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Third parties are asking for access to all kinds of information about a 
patient as condition of paying bills," Binder says. 
</P>
<P>
 A patient may be described as depressed, she says, and the insurers will ask 
to see the therapists' notes to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do they need to know someone is homosexual? No. Do they need to know somebody 
is taking medication. Not really. (But) that may all be in the notes," Binder 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An institution that has been most effective in keeping confidences has been 
the Catholic Church. While other denominations have developed individual 
guidelines about the privacy of confession, Catholics view it as a sacrament 
and therefore confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what is said, a priest must remain mum, according to Canons 889 and 
890 of church law. In a few states secular law concurs and does not demand that 
priests turn in even child abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. John Young, a priest and psychiatrist, says that doesn't mean the 
confessor is off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before a priest can legitimately absolve you, he can be quite demanding and 
say 'Go turn yourself in,' " says Young, a forensic psychiatrist at a maximum 
security mental hospital in New Haven, Conn. "There is no obligation to let a 
person get away with it. The penitent must show firm purpose to deal with what 
he or she did." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Second Vatican Council, most parishes have done away with anonymous 
confessional boxes and more frequently use "reconciliation rooms" for 
confession. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a vexing and troublesome problem for priests to hear confessions about 
laws being broken," Young says. "But it's important not to have knee-jerk 
reporting, but to be able to say, 'We have to do something about this.' Which 
is just what a good therapist says."

BEHIND THE WHEEL: ROOKIE OF THE YEAR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been almost a decade since Honda birthed Acura, the first Japanese car 
that wasn't a dinky toy with a cardboard interior. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Toyota followed with Lexus, all velvet power and squeaky leather. Then Nissan 
gave us the expansive, expensive Infiniti. Two years ago, Mazda declared its 
desire for a luxury car by announcing there would be Amati. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, with executives chosen, Orange County offices occupied and prototypes 
built, economies sickened and Amati died from an overdose of negative 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
 But, wait. This is the age of recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazda has revived the cadaver of Amati, revised its cars and is selling the 
luxury-sedan-that-never-was as the lively Mazda Millenia. 
</P>
<P>
 With it comes a poser that would have loomed large had Amati made it to 
market: What edge can a new entrant offer the luxury line that isn't delivered 
by existing stalwarts -- Lexus ES300, Acura Legend, Infiniti J30, the smaller 
BMWs and entry level Mercedes-Benzes? Or some Volvos and Audis? 
</P>
<P>
 Price, believes Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
 And because it will not be setting up dealerships to service a new division, 
and thanks to savings from needing only one executive bureaucracy, Mazda has 
started its near-luxury line at $25,995. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds good. It's even a hard argument for shopping Mazda before looking at 
the ES300, Legend and J30, glossy sedans with equipment and performance close 
to Millenia -- but costing $4,000, $8,000 and $10,000 more. 
</P>
<P>
 BMW and Mercedes, however, have heritage and status as the discriminating 
purchase. Bimmer's 325 and MB's C-Class have been earning more industry honors 
than Whitney Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Ergo , no matter price differentials, lovers of German cruisers are unlikely 
to be tempted by an untried Japanese sedan. Yet this affordable rookie could 
well pluck leaves from the laurels of Lexus, Infiniti and Acura. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Millenia -- which refers to periods of great celebration, not a 1,000-year 
warranty -- is an appealing front-drive sedan reflecting Mazda's awareness of a 
field brimming with very fine cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic model is up to speed on standard niceties and the inventory reaches 
from here to Hofu: Included for $25,995 are dual air bags, automatic 
transmission, anti-lock brakes, automatic air, alloy wheels, power driver's 
seat, tilt steering, power windows and lock, cruise control and an alarm 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Second in line is something called the Millenia with Leather. Seriously. And, 
yes, it has a leather interior. It is further separated from the foundation car 
by a moon roof and a $28,300 sticker. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars share a 170-horsepower V-6, which other reviewers have found wanting 
and whimpering. 
</P>
<P>
 Our test vehicle was the Mazda with the mostest, the $31,400 Millenia S, which 
leaves few options unturned and has a supercharged Miller-cycle V-6 pumping 210 
horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
 There were Millers who created tourers, funeral cars and some very good 
theater. Mazda's Miller is American engineer Ralph Miller, who has developed a 
system of improving fuel efficiency and power of small engines without 
increasing displacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone whose auto mechanical skills are stretched by working credit card 
buttons at a self-service gas station may skip the next two paragraphs. 
</P>
<P>
 (In Miller engines, intake valve closing is delayed until the piston has 
completed 20% of its compression stroke. This reduces the compression ratio and 
allows the fuel-air mix to cool. Optimum combustion is achieved more by thermal 
efficiency than cylinder volume. 
</P>
<P>
 (To this mechanical process, Mazda adds a compressor that rams cool air into 
the intakes at 28.5 pounds per square inch. The result is a 2.3 liter V-6 in 
the Millenia S that produces 30% more horsepower and torque than the larger, 
2.5 liter V-6 in the base model.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mazda, of course, delights in the oddball. It uses a rotary engine in its RX7 
and is the only manufacturer of cars that go thrruuuum . Meanwhile, the general 
public remains largely indifferent to revolving engine technology. 
</P>
<P>
 It follows that many may question motoring by Miller. The trick engine 
certainly ups the cost of the Millenia S. Yet it is married to a power-sapping 
automatic -- the only available transmission -- and doesn't accelerate quicker 
than the Legend LS or BMW 325i. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miller-Millenia's top speed could offer bragging rights. But who has the 
right combination of open road and iron nerves to run at 142 m.p.h. -- then the 
brass to claim it's a bigger yuk than driving a Lexus GS300 at 134 m.p.h? 
</P>
<P>
 Styling of this spiffiest Mazda, however, is in a cool class of its own. Looks 
are several seasons ahead of its time and $15,000 ahead of its price range. The 
exterior shows sculpted lines of glass and steel that are gently overstated for 
unmistakable distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 For quality of build, Mazda dismantled dozens of competitors' cars and 
researched better benchmarks for silence and stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Tolerance levels were attacked by supercomputers until spaces between body 
panels are 3.5 millimeters, narrower than the 5-millimeter separations of 
Mercedes. A 5,200-ton press stamped one sheet of steel into one rear frame and 
door fenders for increased rigidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Smooth insides of rolling curves are marred by jarring touches. Radio volume, 
for example, is controlled by a huge, sloppy knob that requires endless 
rotation before din and silence are altered. 
</P>
<P>
 Cup holders are dash-mounted but low. They block the cigarette lighter for 
nonsmokers who might need the outlet for a cellular phone or radar detector. So 
it's joe or a call to voice mail on the morning commute, not both. 
</P>
<P>
 Multi-link suspension and speed-sensitive steering make Millenia's handling 
disciplined and trustworthy. The ride has been dialed to a Sealy Posturepedic 
midpoint that allows relaxed vigilance. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, this is an elegant car priced to be a serious contender. With a 
little more power here, with a realignment there, it could become a champion. 
Even in this millennium. 1995 Mazda Millenia S 
</P>
<P>
 The Good: Rock-bottom pricing with high-value features. World-class styling. 
Meticulous construction and quality fit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bad: Miller-cycle benefits not worth trouble. Mazda needs to sweat little 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ugly: What this car could do to Asian rivals. 1995 Mazda Millenia S

AROUND TOWN: STILL HOOFING IT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The curtain opens and out prance the precision-perfect Rockettes. Red and 
silver sequins glitter on their midriff-baring costumes. Red feathers sprout 
from their sparkly red top hats. 
</P>
<P>
 From her orchestra seat, "Flip" (don't call me Florence) Manne, 73, watches 
each eye-high kick. Fifty years ago, she was doing those kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 We're at the Orange County Performing Arts Center for "The Great Radio City 
Music Hall Spectacular," a traveling celebration of the fabled troupe's 60th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockettes strut to "If They Could See Me Now." How apt. Manne is recalling 
that, in her day, "We did a little Quaker number once and there was a little 
bump in the middle. They got all kinds of phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the show, chatting backstage with Rockette Lori Mello, Manne had asked 
if the girls still have the same Radio City Music Hall dressing rooms. Yes, 
Mello assured her, and newly painted -- "They look like Maalox." 
</P>
<P>
 Mello's black-and-silver costume relies on the magic of Velcro. "I wonder how 
you ladies ever did it, with snaps and zippers," she told Manne, who replied: 
"Buttons!" 
</P>
<P>
 There have been other changes. In the '40s, when the Music Hall was SRO, the 
36 Rockettes were part of a permanent family that included an in-house 
orchestra. A live show with every movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's Rockettes are part-timers, widely scattered and pursuing outside 
careers. Mello lives in the San Fernando Valley. At Christmas and Easter, they 
perform as one at the Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1939, Flip Butterfield, a small-town New Englander just out of high school, 
hit Manhattan with stars in her eyes and a month's worth of prepaid dance 
lessons. When money ran out, she took a club job wherever she found it -- 
Boston, Jacksonville, Denver, Faye's Theater in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 There, dancers shared the bill with a trio of strippers. When the censors 
showed up, "that meant the act was cut and we'd have to throw our costumes on 
and go running down." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1941, New York's Roxy beckoned her at $25 a week. Dancers were part of a 
variety act that included Larry Adler on harmonica and the Step Brothers. When 
tenor Dennis Day was the guest for a Hawaiian show, Flip was tapped to place a 
lei around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 She hula-ed onstage, had her big moment and danced back into line, where the 
girl next to her whispered, "You've got your bedroom slippers on." 
</P>
<P>
 Off-duty, Flip would head for a local gym, where an aging ex-boxer stretched 
her legs "so that my kicks would be good enough" for the Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But her Roxy supervisor was no fool. "She always made sure we were rehearsing 
the day they had the auditions for the Music Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a week off, she tried out -- and made it. The big time -- $65 a week. A 
Rockette's day started with wake-up rehearsals and ended about 11 p.m., after 
the fourth show. "We always had a couple of girls who would pass out opening 
day after the routine, but you'd get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Each new movie meant a new show. The Rockettes prayed for long-run films like 
"Random Harvest" and "Mrs. Miniver." 
</P>
<P>
 To the public, they epitomized glamour, these long-legged look-alikes in their 
fabulous costumes. On that block-wide stage, they strutted and kicked as wooden 
soldiers, penguins, even Christmas trees. Manne says: "You'd have to tell your 
parents where you were. They couldn't find you otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 When their Rockette days ended, few became stars. Most just wed the boy next 
door or opened a dance studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Flip, "a women's libber since I was born," wanted a career, not a husband. She 
never felt exploited, but admits: "I think I might now, with some of the things 
they put on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Her career plans derailed when she met a young drummer named Sheldon Manne at 
a party. He'd brought a date, but "he took the other girl home and came back." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten months later, they married. She remained a Rockette until war's end, when 
he got out of the service. Then she went with her husband as he played on the 
road -- across the United States with Stan Kenton, to Cuba with Woody Herman. 
When Shelly played New York, Flip would fill in at the Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 She treasures her memories of one-night band gigs, cheap hotels, America from 
a bus window. Of June Christy, Zoot Sims, Shorty Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 Road-weary, the Mannes moved to Los Angeles in 1951. He was to become a 
world-famous jazz drummer and host at a Hollywood celebrity hangout, Shelly's 
Manne Hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Widowed in 1984, Flip lives in the adobe house in Sunland where, on two-plus 
acres, the Mannes trained American Saddlebreds. 
</P>
<P>
 You might spot her at a San Fernando Valley dance studio, practicing tap. 
She's packed on a few pounds since her Rockette days. She's up from 115 to 120. 
These Owls Are Not Spotted 
</P>
<P>
 Under a nascent moon, our band of owl-watchers, flashlights and binoculars in 
hand, treks down the road to Tara. 
</P>
<P>
 Tara? Well, OK, we're in Calabasas. But this tree-lined road on the campus of 
Soka University of America is the one Scarlett trod in "Gone With the Wind." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not Yankees on our minds. It's those elusive owls. "As the sun sets, they 
start flying around," says Robert Flippin, a volunteer docent for these 
now-and-again university-hosted outings. 
</P>
<P>
 Nighttime is dinner time for owls, which nest in the tall eucalyptuses and 
oaks, then swoop down on the verdant fields of this mountain retreat to grab 
rodents and other prey. 
</P>
<P>
 Before setting out, we're shown an owl film, from which we learn that there 
are 130 species worldwide, most of them monogamous, and that an owl's right ear 
is designed to pick up sounds from below; its left, those from above. 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes in the field, we have our first sighting, an owl of debatable 
parentage in flight. Soon, a barn owl swoops high overhead, dropping a feather. 
But this is not Disneyland and no glow-in-the-dark eyes meet ours. 
</P>
<P>
 Reva Kern of Oak Park was hoping for something a bit more "up close and 
personal" with an owl. Still, like most, she and husband Harvey are glad 
they've come. It sounded "sort of kind of romantic," he says, "and the price 
(free) was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone has spotted a coyote; oops, it's a German Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 But a truly exciting event is unfolding. The curious gather, flashlight beams 
playing on the ground. A great-horned owl, perhaps? No -- a contact lens, 
dropped by owl-watcher Mary Alderman, a vet-to-be from Van Nuys. Miraculously, 
it is found. 
</P>
<P>
 We number about 80, in four groups. Docent Steve Cook's group listens, rapt, 
to his tape of owl hoots. If the owls are listening, they're not answering. 
</P>
<P>
 Long minutes pass. The owls are out there, Flippin insists, even if not "as 
plentiful as sea gulls at the beach." But owl-watching is an inexact science. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, he muses, he should have brought bait. Once, he went so far as to 
fashion an artificial mouse, with wiener body, raisin eyes and spaghetti tail. 
Didn't fool those wise old birds.

 Ten years ago, a visit to many zoos meant viewing animals behind bars. Today's 
zoo visitor is more likely to step into a real habitat, says wildlife expert 
Linda Koebner. "Instead of watching a cageful of monkeys, you might be immersed 
in a tropical rain forest -- in addition to the monkeys, you'll also see all 
the plant and animal species that coexist. You'll feel the moisture and hear 
the sounds." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the new zoo, and Koebner has captured the transformation in "Zoo Book: 
The Evolution of Wildlife Conservation Centers" (Forge Books, 1994), a richly 
illustrated volume written in cooperation with the Assn. of Zoos and Aquariums. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an in-depth look at the modern zoo and how it evolved from ancient royal 
collections of exotic animals through traveling menageries to early permanent 
zoos, which were small collections of animals in barred cages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zoos have become keepers of animals in a very different way than they once 
were," said Koebner, in Los Angeles recently to promote the book.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1970s brought a change in environmental awareness, she says, as human 
overpopulation and other factors destroyed wildlife habitat at such a rate that 
zoos began to realize they could no longer count on an endless supply of 
animals from the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the picture is being reversed. Under an international Species Survival 
Plan, accredited zoos are organizing their collections by species and breeding 
them in captivity to be returned to native habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the popularity of zoos, "As I go around and speak with people, it's 
almost like a secret that I'm letting out -- that zoos are really there for 
conservation and education," Koebner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Wallace, the Los Angeles Zoo's curator of education, gets the same 
reaction. "When I tell people I work in education at the zoo, most people think 
I teach the animals," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, she heads a staff of five and more than 500 docents offering a 
versatile program ranging from short workshops to weeklong camps for everyone 
from preschoolers to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Next on the preschool agenda is "Splish-Splash," an introduction to polar 
bears. For more information about zoo education, call (213) 666-4650, Ext. 5.

 Junk Mail: If you want to curb the flow of the estimated 677 uninvited sales 
pitches that will invade your home and office this year, the second edition of 
"Stop Junk Mail Forever" is now available. Editor and environmental activist 
Marc Eisenson acknowledges the title is optimistic, but says you can make a few 
inroads into your mountain of unsolicited mail. 
</P>
<P>
 To order, send $3 to Good Advice Press, Box 78, Elizaville, N.Y., 12523.

 Cooling It: There are many ways to stay cool this summer without turning on 
the air-conditioning, says the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. It 
has compiled 16 ways to stay comfortable -- ranging from planting shade trees 
to insulating ceilings -- in a new free booklet that also includes typical 
costs for each technique and the estimated energy savings. The idea, says 
Dennis Whitney, DWP's engineer of conservation and planning, is to help 
customers lower their electric bills. The "Stay Cool" booklet can be ordered at 
(800) 827-5397. . . . And another eco tip for summer is a new way to keep ice 
cream from melting in the sun by letting the sun cool it. The first 
solar-powered refrigerated vending cart recently made its debut in Washington, 
D.C. Conceived by New York industrial designer Amelia Amon, the pushcart has 
four 30-watt solar panels that spread like an umbrella above the vendor's head, 
storing enough electricity to maintain approximately 500 Popsicles even when 
the outdoor temperature pushes 90 degrees.

<P>
 If it's Saturday morning in Los Angeles, there will be a garage sale nearby. 
Front yards piled with furniture, books, clothes and toys are as basic to the 
Southern California weekend landscape as real estate agents' open houses. 
</P>
<P>
 And no matter how junky the front-yard merchandise looks, customers will 
materialize, on foot, by bicycle and in cars. 
</P>
<P>
 It's part of a national phenomenon, says Monica Rix Paxson, a Chicago writer 
who has researched garage sales and checked them out all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxson discovered that when it came to knowing how to put on a garage sale, 
"People are reinventing the wheel all over the place. Almost everybody attempts 
a garage sale at one time or the other, but when they try to organize it they 
start from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 So Paxson and her sister, Diana Rix, put together "The Complete Garage Sale 
Kit" (Sourcebooks Inc., 1994). "Our objectives are to make having a garage sale 
profitable, easy and fun," Paxson says.  
</P>
<P>
 The book deals with every aspect of a garage sale, from setting a date (always 
a weekend) to getting rid of unsold items (call a charitable group that picks 
up). And the appendix offers checklists for every phase of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are work sheets, sample maps and flyers, and forms for receipts, 
bills of sale, and every possible sign and tag. "It's a workbook," Paxson says. 
"We've included ideas from marketing, advertising, design and display that work 
for small businesses, because that's what a garage sale is." 
</P>
<P>
 Although word of mouth can be effective, a classified ad in the local paper 
can pay off handsomely, says another expert, Les Schmeltz, who has written "The 
Backyard Money Machine" (Book World Services, 1993). If the major newspaper is 
too expensive, he says, check the neighborhood papers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to date, time and place (don't include your phone number -- 
dealers may start calling immediately), the ad needs to have a hook that will 
lure people to the sale. Paxson's workbook offers tips for ads ("The Mother of 
All Garage Sales," "Reformed Pack Rat Cleans Out") and phrases psychologists 
have found persuasive ("Do You Love Treasure?"). 
</P>
<P>
 She is also interested in the sociological reasons busy adults devote a 
perfectly good Saturday morning to poking through someone else's unwanted 
dishes and broken TV sets. On one level, she says, garage sales represent "a 
projection of peoples' hunting instincts." 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, one of her basic garage-sale laws is "the more, the better." 
Unlike department store shoppers, garage sale customers find their thrill in 
finding the unexpected treasure, so quantity and variety are essential. 
</P>
<P>
 Collecting items for a garage sale is harder than it sounds and most people 
are too haphazard about it, Paxson says. "If there is one general mistake 
people make, it's in waiting until the last minute to throw a garage sale 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 She suggests ridding the house and its closets of anything you haven't used in 
the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because you can't possibly anticipate what people will want (she cites the 
shopper who bought a half-used tube of ointment), don't waste energy debating 
what might sell -- just pitch in everything, remembering that garage sales 
attract collectors of every stripe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were always surprised when we sold out odd things like construction 
materials, old doors, the odd box of ceiling tiles or the single roll of 
wallpaper," she says. In other words, almost anything will sell if it is priced 
appropriately. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxson sets a benchmark price of 20% to 30% of replacement retail value for 
most merchandise and much lower for clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmeltz recommends asking 25% to 30% of the replacement retail value. 
Children's clothing in good condition can bring an even higher price, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But these are only guidelines and the fallback position is to just ask 
yourself what price seems reasonable. Paxson and Schmeltz recommend items be 
priced in advance to save time at the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Never guarantee items, Paxson warns, and be careful not to mistakenly sell a 
valuable antique. Don't sell limited editions, grandma's table, Aunt Emily's 
costume jewelry or your father's stamp collection without getting an appraisal, 
unless you want to offer a bigger bargain than anyone expects. "If you are not 
an expert, consult someone who is," Paxson says.  
</P>
<P>
 A little caution is important, says Margo Dennis of Consignment Cottage on 
Larchmont. Having handled estate sales since 1976, she is convinced that Los 
Angeles is the "garage-sale center of the country," partly because people are 
moving continuously. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her list of preventive tips includes placing good items in a secure place 
(theft can be a problem), having enough people to help you and never letting 
anyone inside your house. "In fact," she says, "you should keep the shades and 
draperies pulled so no one can see inside." With valuable items, she says, have 
a bottom-line price and be comfortable about saying no if the bid goes lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Other basic garage sale wisdom: 
</P>
<P>
 * Involve as many people as possible. Ask your neighbors to participate and 
think about having a block sale. This means more merchandise, the key way to 
attract customers.  
</P>
<P>
 * Not everyone reads the classifieds. Put advance flyers in grocery stores, 
churches, Laundromats, libraries, schools, health clubs or gyms and bowling 
alleys. Tape signs on your car doors for a rolling advertisement, and don't 
worry about making a fool of yourself. This is just good marketing.  
</P>
<P>
 * A little time spent cleaning up items will pay off in profits. Kitchen 
utensils are good sellers, but only if they have been scoured. Launder clothes 
and linens, and polish whatever is supposed to shine. Test electrical 
appliances and tag them "It Works" or "It Doesn't Work." As you arrange 
displays, keep similar items together. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although clothing gets a bad rap as a garage sale item, that's because it 
usually isn't properly displayed. Putting it on hangers on racks or 
clotheslines can overcome peoples' reluctance to dig through piles of clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Get rid of toys by letting your kids run their own toy sale booth. Promote 
it with signs on playgrounds and recreational centers.  
</P>
<P>
 * Even though you have prices on items, understand that dickering is part of a 
garage sale. If you're too sensitive for this, post signs that say "Prices Firm 
as Marked." 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider a refreshment stand. Offer free coffee, or sell coffee, lemonade or 
iced tea, along with cookies and brownies. It makes the sale more fun as well 
as more profitable.  
</P>
<P>
 * Bored, fractious children distract parents from looking and buying. To keep 
their parents browsing, occupy children by setting off an area with colored 
chalk or crayons and a big roll of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 * If there's any possibility the family dog may cause a problem, board it out 
for the day. A dog barking or growling in the background does not encourage 
carefree shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 * Name tags that identify your garage sale helpers and cashier make the 
atmosphere friendlier. If customer traffic is light, move around and straighten 
the tables. "There is nothing stranger than being the only shopper at a sale 
where a bunch of people are sitting behind tables, staring at your every move," 
Paxson says. 
</P>
<P>
 And how much money can you hope to make? "The quality of your stuff can make a 
difference," Paxson says, "but it isn't unusual for a sale to take in between 
$800 and $1,200." There Are Limits 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are too good at having garage sales. In recent years they have 
become a recessionary business with many entrepreneurs whose front lawns and 
driveways are perpetually stacked with secondhand (and sometimes new) 
merchandise.  
</P>
<P>
 This has resulted in a surge of ordinances as many cities -- including 
Burbank, Inglewood, Santa Monica and West Hollywood -- try to prevent yard 
sales from becoming ongoing flea markets. Some cities require permits for a 
nominal fee. Although the City of Los Angeles has drafted an ordinance that 
would limit residential garage sales to two a year, it has not yet come before 
the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Los Angeles code enforcement officers follow informal 
guidelines for residential zones that allow for "occasional" sales to dispose 
of items that are legitimate household discards. No permit is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Three or more garage sales a year is considered a business and can be subject 
to prosecution on zoning violations, a City Council spokeswoman says. "If you 
feel your neighbor is not getting rid of discards but is basically running a 
business, you can register a complaint, and Building and Safety will send out 
an inspector for a judgment call," she says.

 Yo, couch potatoes. You're out of excuses not to use those exercise bikes, 
treadmills and stair climbers. HeartBeat Corp. in Stamford, Conn., has come up 
with an idea that eliminates the boredom . 
</P>
<P>
 The HeartBeat Personal Trainer is a new concept from the Sega Genesis video 
game system that hooks up to any home-exercise equipment, new or old, and keeps 
you playing while pedaling. A sensor measures your heart rate and controls the 
pace on a television or monitor. If you go too slow, Outback Joey the kangaroo 
acts sluggish and may get stung by a scorpion. Go too fast, and Joey moves at 
an uncontrollable speed and sweats a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The game is fun, and fairly easy to operate, even for computer-game novices. 
Two control pads dictate Joey's movement. One makes him go right or left; the 
other, jump or kick. 
</P>
<P>
 HeartBeat Personal Trainer costs $299.95, including the control deck, all 
components and the Outback Joey tape. If you already have a Sega Genesis 
control deck, you can buy the other components and tape by ordering the 
Catalyst at $199.95. Due out this fall are three new games: golf, hockey and a 
sci-fi adventure. To order, call (800) FUN-PLUS. Hungry? Stick Your Pen Under 
Your Nose 
</P>
<P>
 If you've had it with diet shakes, you may want to try ThinPen, a weight-loss 
product based on aroma technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The ThinPen is a set of three small pens in different colors and aromas: 
banana, peppermint and green apple. One pen should be used each day in 
rotation; sniff it about 15 minutes before meals or any time you feel hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alan R. Hirsch, neurological director of the Smell & Taste Treatment and 
Research Foundation in Chicago, developed the ThinPen after several studies. 
"We have discovered that one can fool the brain into thinking you are full by 
inhaling various food scents when hungry," Hirsch says. "The odors act on the 
satiety center in hypothalamus, or the area of the brain that makes you feel 
full." 
</P>
<P>
 Most people who use ThinPen, if they also stick to eating healthy foods and 
doing some exercise, will be able to lose weight, according to ThinPen 
researchers. A recent six-month study of 3,193 overweight patients found an 
average loss of five pounds per month. Those who had a better sense of smell 
lost more, Hirsch says. 
</P>
<P>
 ThinPen ($31.95 plus $3.50 shipping and handling) can be ordered from 
Nutrition for Life, 16300 Mill Creek Blvd., Suite 114-A, Mill Creek, Wash. 
98012; (800) 800-7943. The set of three lasts for a month. It's Three! Three! 
Three Lotions in One! 
</P>
<P>
 In time for summer sun and bug season is Treo, the first three-in-one lotion 
that serves as a sunscreen, a bug repellent and a moisturizer for adults and 
children. It has a clean, herbal scent and comes in three sunscreen strengths 
-- SPF 8, 15 and 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Treo's manufacturer, Biopharm Lab, a pharmaceutical company in Bellport, N.Y., 
spent two years testing the product before receiving a registration from the 
Environmental Protection Agency, which sanctions all insect-repellent products. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Treo is PABA-free, effective for at least 80 minutes in the water, and gives 
an hour of protection from mosquitoes, fleas, ticks and other biting insects. 
The bug repellent is made from natural, plant-derived citronella. 
</P>
<P>
 Treo ($7.99 for SPF 8; $8.99, SPF 15; $9.99, SPF 30) is available nationwide 
in drugstores, supermarkets and sporting-goods stores. Call (800) 336-TREO for 
additional information. LYNN SIMROSS

THE SCENE; WHEELS OF FORTUNE; A PAIR OF SANTA ANA TEENS ARE SPOKESMEN OF THE 
STREETS WITH ARTFULLY APPOINTED LOWRIDER BIKES 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana High freshman Benito Miranda has a ride like no other. 
</P>
<P>
 He's got a phone, a tiny television set in the steering wheel and a special 
case for his Game Boy. The audio system -- a compact disc player, equalizer and 
remote control -- blares from a red crushed velvet boombox. There's a bar with 
cup holders, a space for a goldfish tank and enough cut mirror to put a disco 
ball to shame. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring the fish tank and Game Boy, consider these features standard equipment 
in any limousine. So what would a 15-year-old be doing with a limo? 
</P>
<P>
 A limo it's not. Because, like with most teens his age, Miranda's ride is a 
bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 His isn't of the two-wheeler variety. That proved too mundane for Benito. 
Instead, he opted for five wheels, one in the front and two on each side of the 
boombox. Tough for turning corners, but not for turning heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the number of accessories and wheels on Benito's Schwinn Stingray is 
extreme, his excessive indulgence is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Tricked out with all the flashiest fixings and almost dragging on the 
pavement, custom bicycles such as Benito's claim ties to their engine-powered 
cousins, lowrider automobiles.  
</P>
<P>
 For teens not licensed to drive, lowrider bicycles are an option that lets 
them express themselves with all the chrome and velvet they could possibly 
desire. That these wheels are powered by pedal instead of petrol makes no 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The term "lowrider" refers to the precarious proximity of a vehicle from the 
ground. Lowriding emerged with the zoot suit assaults of the early 1940s, when 
Mexican Americans living in Los Angeles were harassed and sometimes jailed more 
for their race and flamboyant dress than any proven crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lowriding became a form of expression, an art form, for Chicanos," says Mark 
Hansen, spokesman for Lowrider magazine in Walnut, Calif., which has chronicled 
such vehicles since 1976. "There's always been white guys that thought it was 
cool. In Japan, it's a phenomenon right now. But for Chicanos, it's a way of 
life. Lowriding embodies their ideal of what's beautiful and cool." 
</P>
<P>
 The first lowrider bicycles surfaced in the early '70s. There's more 
speculation than any specific anecdotes or facts to explain why it took so 
long. Younger siblings wanting a piece of the action, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 Flash forward to today and that's the motivation behind Benito's friend, 
Horizon freshman Armando Gonzalez, who transformed his Stingray into a 
three-wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando, 15, recalls his fascination with the decision by his older brother, 
Romero, to drop the body of his 1983 Ford Escort just inches above street 
level. Romero, 20, and his cronies returned the admiration and let the teens 
include bikes in their lowrider car club, California Class. Members tow the 
bikes along on their monthly cruises, making occasional stops in parking lots 
to let Benito and Armando show off their wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 The silver-flecked, brandy coat of Armando's bicycle and the coffin-like 
velvet "love seat" hooked to the bike recall the gaudy opulence and super-fly 
style of the '70s. The gold-link chain steering wheel attached to the 
handlebars seems borrowed from the requisite accessory on every hairy chest of 
that era. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowrider cars can be almost any model or year, but it's the basic frame of the 
Schwinn Stingray that makes it the starting point for lowrider bicycles.  
</P>
<P>
 Just about everyone who was a kid from 1963 to 1979 when the Stingray was 
manufactured had or wanted one of these midget bikes with the crazy banana 
seat. If you were really groovy, you had high-rise "ape" handlebars. Stingrays 
were far from performance bikes. And by design, they poised a young rider in 
such a way that oozed attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwinn, which ceased production of the Stingray due to dwindling sales, might 
want to reconsider dusting off the old model. Even with reproductions being 
churned out in Taiwan, vintage Schwinn Stingray frames carry a greater value 
for enthusiasts -- most of whom weren't even born when the last one rolled off 
the assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 It's among this generation of high schoolers that the lowrider bicycle 
subculture is coming into its own as more than just a younger sidekick to cars. 
The number of entries at custom bicycle and lowrider car shows is increasing, 
say observers, as is the sale lowrider bike parts at bicycle shops. Stores such 
as Dave's Schwinn in Anaheim and Pedal Pushers in Newport Beach report a 5% to 
20% increase in related parts sales in the past year -- up significantly from 
the past two decades, say the owners, who have been in the bicycle business 
that long. 
</P>
<P>
 Another significant factor in the past six months is a shift in the customer 
base. Latino teens still dominate the numbers, but owners of both stores count 
an increasing patronage by Anglo kids wanting to build lowrider bikes.  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Bodin of Dave's Schwinn attributes it to the cross-cultural influence in 
fashion and music that's become a hip part of being young in the '90s. "Rap and 
baggy clothes -- the gangster and cholo look -- has become so mainstream. These 
white kids want to imitate what's cool with the Mexican kids," Bodin says. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence last fall of Lowrider Bicycle, a magazine catering to 
enthusiasts -- specifically those in the "18-and-under generation" -- is widely 
considered the catalyst that pushed lowrider bicycles into recent trendy 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 The slick quarterly magazine sprung from its parent, Lowrider, when editors 
realized the subject demanded more space. "We suddenly had too many kids asking 
to see more bikes," says Nathan Trujillo, 29, Lowrider Bicycle's editor. The 
new magazine's circulation is at 40,000 at the third issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it targets mostly young teens, the magazine is produced so "kids could 
take it to school." In contrast to its parent publication, there are no 
bikini-clad babes and no foul language. "There's a little slang," says 
Trujillo, "because we wanted it to still be as cool as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping a degree of hard-core attitude is crucial. An integral appeal of the 
lowrider culture is a tough machismo that teeters on gangster cool, Trujillo 
says. "It's only a role, like playing rebel -- something all young people do."  
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect to find a journal of juvenile revolt. In between the 
profiles, the how-to articles and the photo spreads, the magazine encourages 
doing well in school and opening communication lines with parents. Trujillo 
supports his belief in the positive activities of his young readers, 
particularly staying busy with their bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping his son occupied with his five-wheeler is Benito Miranda Sr.'s 
intention. Miranda, 36, a metal painter, says that the wild bicycle keeps his 
son away from gang influences plaguing their Santa Ana neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I keep him doing different things. There's always more to add and 
change. It's never finished," Miranda says. 
</P>
<P>
 For this fall's L.A. Super Show, among the nation's largest lowrider events, 
father and son will finish gold-plating the chrome (a popular trend), replace 
the basic wheel assembly with 100 spokes and install a hydraulic pump so the 
boombox can "dance" -- similar to the effect achieved with lowrider cars. The 
two expect to take the first-place trophy as they did at last year's Super Show 
and at every contest since. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the bikes, it was go-carts for the Mirandas. "We spend a lot of time on 
these projects together," Miranda says. Most Sundays are spent traveling to 
contests, held two to three times a month, in Orange County and as far as 
Pomona and Phoenix. Few, if any, award money; in those that do, the amount 
barely covers the winner's expenses. But it's more about time invested than 
money, insists Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a lot of green can go into this hobby. Bikes less elaborate than 
Benito's can be finished for about $300. The more customized, the higher the 
tally, which can reach $4,000, as Benito's does. The frame, found at a swap 
meet, cost $25. Consider the $1,000 stereo, and the value skyrockets. Miranda 
occasionally exchanges his mechanic services with friends and relatives who 
deal with auto upholstery or body work. He did the same with the fender murals 
by Santa Ana auto-paint master Eliezer. The airbrushed images of the Grim 
Reaper, a cemetery and assorted skeletons are worth a grand, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Benito pays for it with his good grades," says his father. "He's a good kid, 
and he has fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The experience has also included more than this shy teen bargained for, 
including coverage from Lowrider Bicycle magazine, MTV and, recently, from a 
French publication. 
</P>
<P>
 To him, though, the bike is about him and his friends "hanging out, talking 
and working on the bicycle," he says. As many as 10 guys congregate in the 
Miranda garage daily, offering kudos and advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the pack is Armando, who sometimes brings his ride to the Mirandas to 
tinker with. "I encourage guys to build bikes," he says. "I know guys who spend 
their money on doing drugs. For me, I'd rather spend it on this." Armando has 
raised the hundreds of dollars poured into his bicycle by working at the swap 
meet with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 For Benito, this activity is a pretty simple choice that just happens to keep 
him out of trouble. "This is what I like to do -- to be a lowrider," Benito 
says. "A regular bike is too boring. I'd rather ride in a car than on a regular 
bike." 
</P>
<P>
 As for when he and Armando finally are old enough to drive, don't assume that 
they'll sell these valuable rides to finance bigger toys. They don't plan to 
get rid of their pedal-powered showpieces. They have future sons to think 
about, they say.

<P>
 What does mention of the Asian Club, African American Club, French Club, 
Spanish Club, Korean Club and Vietnamese Club bring to your mind? Cultural 
diversity and awareness? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but the only thing it brings to my mind is another form of segregation 
and building up of cultural barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't see the point of having these clubs when no one (who is not a member 
of the club) learns about their cultural background. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, what we learn in these clubs is how to live as segregated races in 
one society. Being culturally aware of your race is one thing, but learning to 
live as segregated races is another. "We should have one huge intercultural 
club in order to learn about other traditions and cultures," one student 
observed.  
</P>
<P>
 I feel it's the parents' job to educate their children about their ethnic 
background. I feel we are being taught at an early age to accept division into 
groups by ethnicity and color. 
</P>
<P>
 If high school is supposed to prepare you for college and the real world, then 
shouldn't we learn how to perform as one race . . . the human race? Instead of 
doing this, we are sending a mixed message that in the workplace or in 
classrooms we are the same but otherwise we are different. 
</P>
<P>
 I too love my heritage and my religion. But if I choose not to share it with 
others, many people will never know who or what a Pakistani Muslim is or what 
they are like. Islam has a theme that states that everyone is the teacher and 
messenger of God and that it is each individuals' duty to spread the work of 
God or Allah.  
</P>
<P>
 We don't need racial clubs; we need a club in which we can come together and 
share our differences. We need to come together as one group -- humankind.

 Many people are most comfortable with those who have the same interests, same 
ideals and the same experiences as they do. We hang around with people we have 
things in common with. So, what is the problem of having a club with people who 
have the same culture in common? A club based on race doesn't have to put 
another race down in order to have pride in its own. 
</P>
<P>
 We shouldn't be afraid of exploring a part of ourself and our culture with 
people we understand the most. We can best explore what we don't know if there 
is a commonality: We can learn from what other people know while communicating 
what we know. 
</P>
<P>
 Clubs based on culture or ethnicity benefit those who join. Participants can 
socialize with people who are from the same country or share the same religion. 
They can also discuss and debate subjects that their other friends might not 
understand. Perhaps more importantly, they can feel comfortable with people 
they understand the most, people like themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 As in all things, there is the possibility of misusing or diluting the 
original intent, causing the clubs to turn into something that is harmful. 
Clubs whose sole intent is to degrade other clubs are a painful reality. 
Anti-race clubs are always destructive and usually affect all people -- 
directly or indirectly -- in a community. Ignorance is the root behind this 
evil, yet it doesn't have to be this way. There is more capacity for good than 
for bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, some cultural clubs have a limiting factor. They limit the 
people who can join because they are different -- in a sense, voluntary 
segregation. Critics who disagree with these clubs will argue that participants 
are separating themselves from the main culture. They further argue that we 
should all be one with the mainstream way of thinking.  
</P>
<P>
 But what would our culture be without the ideas and beliefs that each culture 
has brought? 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot forget our identities. We cannot throw away the very roots that make 
us what we are. If we choose not to explore them and understand them, we lose a 
part of ourselves. Will we all conform to the mainstream and forget what has 
brought us all together in this nation?

<P>
 A Peace Academy Camp for high school student leaders will be held Aug. 28 
through 31 in the San Gorgonio Wilderness Area of Angelinas Oaks in San 
Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp is designed to foster appreciation of a multicultural society by 
providing students with skills to enhance intergroup understanding in their 
schools and communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Peace Academy is an exciting and innovative project which will help 
develop Orange County's next generation of leaders who face unprecedented 
social and educational challenges," Orange County Board of Education member 
Elizabeth Dorn Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuition for the camp is $200, which includes transportation and is open to

ETHNIC CELEBRATIONS PROMOTE SELF-ESTEEM OR FEELINGS OF SEPARATENESS? STUDENTS 
FROM MANY BACKGROUNDS AND WITH TIES TO ALL PARTS OF THE GLOBE HAVE ESTABLISHED 
CULTURE CLUBS ON ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUSES. AND, WHILE MANY SEE THE 
CLUBSAS IMPORTANT OUTLETS FOR EXPRESSION, OTHERS SEE THEM AS LIMITING.; MECHA 
OFFERS SUPPORT

<P>
 Many Orange County high schools have active MEChA clubs on their campuses, 
including one being established at Loara High School. MEChA serves to support 
and educate Chicano students as well as to promote social change. 
</P>
<P>
 MEChA -- which stands for Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan -- was 
founded in 1969 by activists who believed in and fought for the 
self-determination of Aztlan (Southwest United States). Mechistas fought for 
and won EOPS -- Extended Opportunity Program and Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, a few people view MEChA as an extreme political group 
determined to cause trouble in our community.  
</P>
<P>
 MEChA is a club about Chicanos. MEChA is not out to get the community. It 
focuses on inspiring fellowship, heritage, culture and politics of 
Latinos/Chicanos. It also encourages self-development to the fullest extent. 
Academic achievements and progress through education are what MEChA is really 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does MEChA focus on academic achievements, it also focuses on 
anti-gang and anti-drug activities. MEChA is a wake-up call for young, 
disillusioned Chicanos. 
</P>
<P>
 Many young Chicanos have no interest in school and figure, "Why bother?" They 
live in the ghettos and think they have no choice but to join a gang because 
they are poverty-stricken. Living in poverty can mislead anyone into a life of 
crime; that is almost inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 MEChA is a big-brother type club that will educate and encourage Chicanos to 
stay in school and get involved in school activities, so that joining a gang 
will not be an option. 
</P>
<P>
 The community will not only benefit from MEChA, but our school will also 
benefit from this needed education.

OC HIGH STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; CONTRIBUTING TO HISTORY AS A WHOLE

 No matter what month or week it is, a tribute of some sort is on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 But I think designations such as Black History Month (February) and Women's 
History Month (March) are monuments to tokenism rather than a tribute to a 
deserving group. 
</P>
<P>
 During February, black history in America is trivialized rather than 
appreciated. The media convey remembrances of black achievement while Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Top of the Mountain" and "I Have a Dream" speeches 
are repeatedly broadcast. Occasionally we witness people in authentic African 
clothing speaking about lost African civilizations or saying a few words in 
Swahili. 
</P>
<P>
 Confining black history to four weeks tends to minimize the achievements and 
impact of the black community on American history. 
</P>
<P>
 More importantly, I feel Black History Month works to segregate "black 
history" from "American history." 
</P>
<P>
 Black history, along with that of many other nationalities and cultures, is 
part of American history as a whole. One cannot talk about American history -- 
from the American Revolution to Operation Desert Storm -- separately from black 
history.  
</P>
<P>
 Discussing the impact of the black community in a single month, independent of 
American history, society, politics and economy, represents an inaccurate 
interpretation of history. 
</P>
<P>
 After Black History Month comes March, Women's National History Month. 
Realizing that women make up more than 50% of the population and receive one 
month to celebrate their history seems a little pompous to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's National History Month implies the same notions as Black History 
Month: The segregation of a culture or gender's history from that of total 
history.

SCHOLAR GETS IN LAST WORD -- ON RADIO SHOW; GRADUATION: SAUGUS HIGH 
VALEDICTORIAN BRAD BJELKE GIVES HIS SPEECH ON "MARK AND BRIAN" PROGRAM AFTER 
SCHOOL OFFICIALS STOPPED DESIGNATING THE TOP SENIORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was the speech no one was supposed to hear. Now tens of thousands have 
heard it. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Bjelke, 18, graduated at the top of his Saugus High School class with a 
grade-point average of 4.44 (he got extra points for taking honors classes). 
</P>
<P>
 But Brad never got to deliver a valedictory speech. School officials 
eliminated the honor this school year because, according to the principal, "it 
was a tradition that we didn't think had enough positives." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps -- hosts of the popular "Mark and Brian" radio 
show on KLOS -- disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio duo invited Brad to read his speech Thursday morning on their show, 
ensuring that it was heard not only in Greater Los Angeles but also in other 
cities where the program is broadcast, including San Diego, Tucson and 
Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must follow our dreams and never surrender to frustrations or obstacles 
which stand in the way," the tall, athletic Brad read as he sat before the 
microphone, with Thompson and Phelps at each side of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our life is what we make it,"Brad said. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio hosts had played a grossly out-of-tune version of "Pomp and 
Circumstance" just before Brad read the speech. They also serenaded him with 
other tunes during his time on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brad was having a great time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a blast," Brad said when it was all over. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad's excellent adventure began at 6:30 a.m. with the arrival of a 
chauffeured car sent by KLOS to whisk him and his mother from their Santa 
Clarita home to the radio station in Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad had not gotten much sleep. The night before was the graduation ceremony, 
during which he received a standing ovation when he led the procession of 
seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus High School officials had decided to eliminate valedictorian, 
salutatorian, and top-10 honors for students this year. They instead designated 
anyone with a 3.75 or higher grade-point average as an honors student. School 
officials said the pressure to finish first had become so intense in recent 
years that one student became suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision struck a chord with the public, and not just in Santa 
Clarita. After The Times reported that Brad's mother had expressed her 
disappointment over the policy at a school district meeting in June, word of 
the situation spread nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone calls poured into the school and the Bjelke household. Rush Limbaugh 
blasted the school's decision for two days on his radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little surprised there has been so much media attention," the easygoing 
Brad said during the ride to the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad's classmates had given him an irreverent but good-natured, tribute late 
on graduation night. They pelted his house with wet toilet paper. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he kept hearing the thumps of the toilet paper hitting his house every 
hour or so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a couple of hours of sleep at the most," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad took a call on one of the car's two cellular phones. It was the station 
checking on his progress. At the end of the call, he could not figure out how 
to hang up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sure you're a valedictorian?" asked the chauffeur, who had a British 
accent. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad, who plans to attend Cal Lutheran in Thousand Oaks this fall, was ushered 
through the iron gates outside the KLOS building and into a waiting room 
minutes before his scheduled 8 a.m. appearance. He said he felt surprisingly 
calm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He had agreed to a request from station officials to wear his graduation 
outfit while reading his speech, but, feeling uncomfortable, removed it shortly 
before going on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's going to see me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother pressed his speech into his hands, and suddenly he was on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 He delivered his speech in a clear tone without any hitches or interruptions. 
It was full of praise for his memories of Saugus High, but also contained a 
note of defiance for the school's decision to no longer honor valedictorians. 
</P>
<P>
 "For reasons not thoroughly explained, our administration has decided that 
academic competition is not healthy," he said. "However, I am privileged to 
represent the Class of 1994 and regardless of this year's new policy, I still 
am the valedictorian." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad left the studio to applause from the radio duo, but he was not done yet. 
</P>
<P>
 KLOS personnel guided him into an adjacent booth and handed him several sheets 
of news and weather reports, which he was asked to read at 8:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad looked a little startled, especially when Mark and Brian burst into the 
studio playing horns while he read the weather. But Brad read the information 
without difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 Station officials were impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad took it to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was neat," he said. "That's what I want to do for a living."

$45.6 MILLION MORE IN QUAKE AID RELEASED; RECOVERY: THE BULK OF THE FEDERAL 
MONEY WILL GO TO SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR EXISTING LOAN 
PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Thursday announced $45.6 million in additional 
earthquake aid, most aimed at assisting small Los Angeles-area businesses whose 
heavy indebtedness makes them ineligible for existing federal loan programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, applications for aid denied by the Small Business 
Administration will be referred to the Commerce Department's Economic 
Development Administration, which will get $30 million of the federal funds to 
help businesses restructure their debt loads. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be funneled through community development groups that are 
responsible for selecting businesses most likely to spur local economic 
recovery. About 100 such nonprofit organizations dot the Los Angeles region, 
officials said, but only about 50 have the expertise to handle the complicated 
financial arrangements with other lenders that the loans require. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials hope that once the quake-impacted businesses get back on 
their feet, they will be able to expand by obtaining loans from more 
conventional government and private sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have heard over and over about tragic stories of small businessmen but 
haven't been able until today to address these problems adequately," said 
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, who with Budget Director Leon Panetta announced 
the new release of federal aid. "We have crafted an innovative program that 
meets those needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials estimated that about 1,000 businesses in the quake damage 
area might be eligible for the economic development program, but with an 
average loan of $150,000, only about 200 may receive the funds. The program 
covers Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to be eligible for the federal money, businesses must show that they 
have been affected by the Northridge quake, rejected for a Small Business 
Administration loan and have strong potential to create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reps. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama 
City) and Julian Dixon (D-Los Angeles) were instrumental in developing the loan 
program, but it had support among other Los Angeles area House members. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) also praised the loans as "a creative way to 
make sure the federal assistance is targeted to the job-creating businesses in 
most need." 
</P>
<P>
 A bond issue for a similar state assistance program, aimed at owners of 
apartments and homes, was rejected by voters in the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The balance of the relief funds -- $15.6 million will be spread among several 
other earthquake-related needs: 
</P>
<P>
 * $7.5 million to upgrade earthquake detection equipment and to study dangers 
from pipeline breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * $4.1 million to correct health and safety problems in some of the 8,000 
restaurants damaged in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * $4 million to move disaster victims to more permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The money comes from a $500-million contingency aid fund that the Clinton 
Administration had at its disposal since shortly after the quake struck in 
January. After several previous allocations, $42.4 million remains in the 
account, Panetta said, and those funds will probably be needed to cover 
additional FEMA and SBA costs over the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress approved an $11.8-billion earthquake aid package in February. The 
White House this month requested an additional $400 million to augment the 
SBA's ongoing loan program.

JOBS SCARCE FOR RECIPIENTS OF 'WORKFARE'; EMPLOYMENT: COUNTY REQUIRES 
ABLE-BODIED WELFARE RECIPIENTS TO WORK FOR THEIR MONTHLY CHECKS. BUT THE 
PROGRAM IS STRUGGLING WITH A JOBLESSNESS RATE OF NEARLY 60%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One recent morning before dawn, a long line of bleary-eyed men waited outside 
a welfare office on Skid Row, primed with coffee and cigarettes to pay their 
debt to society.  
</P>
<P>
 For some, the prospect of cleaning county beaches in exchange for $212 in 
monthly welfare benefits seemed fair. Others familiar with the system hung back 
at the end of the line, hoping that there would not be enough room in the 
county vans to take them to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 For 46 years, Los Angeles County has required single, able-bodied welfare 
recipients to earn their monthly checks by cleaning restrooms, raking flower 
beds and performing other tasks for government agencies and nonprofit 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a scene repeated throughout the county every weekday because of a 
shortage of community service jobs, 21 of the 60 men waiting to help clean 
county beaches on this morning were sent home by the time the sun had crept up 
over the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being a success, the county's General Relief "workfare" program is 
posting its highest unemployment rate ever -- nearly 60% -- as it struggles to 
find public service jobs for thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
 As the county's experience demonstrates, workfare is not the panacea its most 
ardent advocates hope it will be. Here and elsewhere, it has failed to 
significantly reduce welfare costs or to raise people out of poverty, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not the people -- most of whom bust stereotypes of recipients 
as ne'er-do-wells by showing up to work. Instead, the county program is 
bedeviled by employers' reluctance to use welfare recipients, union opposition, 
a shortage of supervisors for the new workers and competition from other 
sources of free labor -- including the 74,000 people sentenced annually by the 
courts to community service in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an easy sell," said James Adler, chairman of the county's welfare 
commission. "As I look around the county, I think there are hundreds of jobs 
they could do, but the problem is getting government agencies to sign on."  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the lack of slots, 16,000 -- or about 40% -- of the 41,500 
recipients eligible to work end up doing so, down from 70% four years ago. 
About 25,500 of those who could work get their checks without having to pick up 
a shred of litter. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts disagree about what the impact of the public service jobs shortage 
would be on President Clinton's welfare reform proposal, which seeks to impose 
a two-year limit on cash benefits and requires younger recipients to find work 
or take a government job.  
</P>
<P>
 Direct parallels are difficult to draw because the President's program would 
apply primarily to welfare mothers, while the county's workfare requirement 
involves mostly males on General Relief. Another significant difference is that 
Clinton's plan includes funds for education and training; the county program 
does not. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House policy aide Bruce Reed, co-chairman of the Administration's 
welfare reform group, has said that the difficulty of creating jobs, even in 
the public sector, is one of the reasons the Administration plans to initially 
impose the two-year limit on young recipients only. 
</P>
<P>
 To market the workfare program, the county produced a slick 13-minute video 
and mailed it to dozens of government agencies and private nonprofit groups 
last fall. The video, with its catchy synthesizer music and upbeat message, has 
helped drum up jobs for 500 more recipients in the past six months. But during 
the same period, the county lost more jobs than it gained, and employs 267 
fewer recipients than in September, said Nancy Diaz, the county's workfare 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think it's real easy to find jobs, but we just can't keep up," Diaz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four years, the county has nearly doubled the number of work 
slots, creating work for 16,000 recipients, as agencies that were unable to 
hire new workers because of budget cutbacks drew increasingly on the pool of 
cheap labor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the recession has proved to be a double-edged sword. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time that the number of work slots increased, the pool of eligible 
workfare participants tripled as more people went on welfare. Thus, the 
percentage of those who pick up a shovel or rake dropped from nearly 
three-quarters to two-fifths of those eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is the biggest employer of welfare recipients, using more than 
10,000 a month to clean beaches and parks, answer telephones and guard parking 
lots. Most recipients receive a monthly grant of $212 and in exchange are 
supposed to work about six days a month at the minimum wage rate of $4.25 an 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen other cities, school districts and state agencies employ almost 6,000 
recipients a month to help repair roads, stock shelves and sweep floors. But 
only seven private, nonprofit organizations countywide employ them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we don't use them is there's too much paperwork involved," said 
Mary Ann Osness, volunteer coordinator for Pacific Hospital of Long Beach, 
which recently rejected county overtures to join the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Some agencies worry about their ability to screen out workers with problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a year ago, the Los Angeles Unified School District employed about 4,000 
recipients a month, largely as janitors and groundskeepers. The responsibility 
for screening them fell to the school district because the county, which spends 
about $270,000 annually to administer the workfare program, lacks the money to 
fingerprint and check each recipient's record. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district only ran background checks when the behavior of recipients 
raised suspicion, because the inquiries cost $64.50 apiece, officials said. 
Last spring, several checks revealed convictions for assault and sexual 
molestation, they said. Acting on legal advice, the district decided to stop 
using recipients once those remaining on the job go off the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the worst happened. Earlier this year, a recipient who worked as a 
janitor at a South Gate elementary school was arrested and charged with 
murdering an 82-year-old woman who was a longtime volunteer there. Although the 
man had no criminal record, the incident hardened the district's resolve not to 
use welfare recipients.  
</P>
<P>
 Competition from other sources of cheap labor is another obstacle facing the 
workfare program. Countywide, welfare recipients compete with the more than 
6,100 criminals sentenced to community service each month. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation relies on people sentenced to 
community service or in early release programs about eight times as often as 
welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them (welfare recipients) are real good workers, but their incentives 
to work aren't quite as high as someone who could go to jail," said Larry 
Ornay, a Caltrans regional manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the shortage of public service jobs is that agencies lack 
the personnel to supervise welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not really free workers," said Eddy Tanaka, director of the county's 
welfare department. "Even with simple things like graffiti removal, you have to 
have enough equipment and supplies, and people to supervise them."  
</P>
<P>
 Among General Relief recipients left out of the workfare program there is 
relief and mild regret. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who wants to work for peanuts? I want a real job," said Indris Ahmad, 44. But 
the county does not have the money to make a systematic effort to match 
recipients' skills with their work assignments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They give you garbage jobs," said Robert Perna, 47, a former welfare 
recipient and workfare participant whose typing skills led to a job at Glendale 
Adventist Hospital. "It only led to a job for me because I begged them over and 
over again to place me at a work site where I could use my intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 But another man at the Skid Row office who identified himself only as David 
said he was sorry he did not get a spot on the van. "There's a lot of boredom 
down here actually. You need something to do to pass the time away." 
</P>
<P>
 Union opposition may also hinder the creation of public service jobs for 
welfare recipients. In some cases, unions have added to the cost of using 
welfare recipients by getting raises for government employees who are assigned 
to supervise them.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're basically against it," said Marcel Bell, a business representative with 
the Service Employees International Union, which represents thousands of Los 
Angeles county and city workers.  
</P>
<P>
 The union's biggest fear is that its members will be displaced by the cheap 
labor pool.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the city of Pico Rivera has saved at least $789,000 by using welfare 
recipients to help fill the gap left by about 35 municipal workers who have 
retired or quit in the past 30 months, city officials said. The recipients 
perform a variety of duties from opening envelopes to cleaning storm drains.

PRISON BARS KEEP CONTEST WINNER OUT OF USC FILM PROGRAM; VIDEOS: AN ANTI-DRUG 
MESSAGE PREPARED BY CALIFORNIA YOUTH AUTHORITY INMATES TOOK TOP PRIZE. BUT THE 
VIDEO'S TEEN-AGE WRITER CAN'T ATTEND A SUMMER WORKSHOP BECAUSE SHE'S SERVING 
TIME FOR CAR THEFT. 
</P>

<P>
 The prizewinning video's message is blunt: Drugs kill. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize is impressive: a five-week scholarship at USC's film school. 
</P>
<P>
 And the winner is miffed: A California Youth Authority inmate, she cannot go 
to USC because she is serving time for grand theft auto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flatlines," the anti-drug video written by 16-year-old Wendy Creiglow at the 
CYA's Ventura School, beat nearly 100 other student videos in May to become a 
finalist in the Teens Making a Difference contest held by KCET-TV Channel 28 in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, it wowed the USC faculty judges, who chose it as their favorite 
for the grand prize. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no way Wendy can leave, CYA officials said, because she must 
remain imprisoned at least until March. 
</P>
<P>
 And USC officials said they finally decided to award the scholarship to Orange 
County student Josh Goldstein, who helped produce the second-best video, an 
AIDS awareness clip. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, none of the Ventura School inmates who also worked on the winning 
video -- young women serving time for car theft, armed robbery and drug crimes 
-- will even be allowed to attend the June 30 awards ceremony at Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Wendy is allowed to travel to KCET's studios today for a televised 
panel discussion with the hosts of KCET's "Life and Times," school officials 
said, she will be flanked by two CYA guards. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET is pleading with the USC faculty to award Wendy the $4,500 scholarship 
after her release. 
</P>
<P>
 But USC officials said they do not know if they can wait that long to put the 
San Diego County teen-ager through the intensive filmmaking class at the 
university's School of Cinema Television. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been able to discuss it with all the people who are involved," 
said Duke Underwood, who runs the summer production workshop for teen-age 
filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is any way she can go to USC, Wendy said, "I'd love it. 
</P>
<P>
 "For one thing, it's something for me to do with my life," she said. "I love 
learning about new things." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wendy has not met enough requirements to satisfy the parole board, Ventura 
School Supt. Vivian Crawford said. Even if she had, pre-parole planning takes 
60 to 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are excited about this," Crawford said. "But I have heard nothing from 
anyone who's been involved with her that says she's ready for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy, who says she is a recovering alcoholic and drug abuser, took the idea 
for "Flatlines" from an anti-drug poster she once drew for another class. The 
poster equated lines of cocaine with the flat-line readout on a machine 
monitoring an overdose victim's pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 60 seconds long, the video expands on the idea and packs a graphic punch. 
</P>
<P>
 While a voice-over warns that one line leads to another, images flash in quick 
succession: a young woman snorting a line of cocaine, the red lines of an F on 
a report card, the profile of a pistol, the chalk outlines of a body at a 
murder scene, and the flat line of a dead person's absent pulse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs kill," the narrator intones, and then comes the kicker: garish yellow 
words reading, "A Message From Wards of the California Youth Authority."  
</P>
<P>
 USC teacher Pablo Frasconi said he and the other two faculty judges thought 
the video was extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was quite above the others in the program," said Frasconi, 
adding that the judges had no idea "Flatlines" was made by juvenile inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The director . . . had a very strong vision of how to tie the work together, 
and also it was very strong in the area of visual language," he said. "It's too 
bad that she can't attend the workshop because it's clear that there's a lot of 
talent there that can be tapped, and I guess could help them get out of that 
cycle" of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Ventura School video makers -- about 15 worked on the clip -- said 
they just hope it reaches the right people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like watching it, 'cause it's me" said Tami Jefferson, 20, of Watts, 
who pretends to snort a line of baking soda, plays dead and provides the voice 
over. "But I think it'll turn a lot of heads and get a lot of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The commercials I've seen on drugs and violence didn't get my attention, 
because if they did I wouldn't be here," said Jefferson, who is serving time 
for armed robbery and admits she has had problems with drugs. "I just want my 
5-year-old son to see it. . . . I don't want him to be like I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Taylor, a 17-year-old serving time for a strong-arm robbery, produced the 
soundtrack, wringing electronic gunshots and queasy, threatening chords out of 
a synthesizer. 
</P>
<P>
 She also was the only inmate willing to lie on the floor so classmates could 
draw the body outlines of the staged murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 That scene should grab young viewers "because it's scary," said Mapuana 
Pulotu, 20. While serving time for a Riverside robbery, she says, she managed 
the technical side of Wendy's video and three others submitted by inmates in 
the CYA video class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked hard on everything, but this was the best one," Pulotu said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Gardner, who runs the class, says he too hopes that teen-agers who might 
ignore typical anti-drug messages will heed one from young women who have been 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the kids with experience in all those areas, especially drugs and 
violence, so they know it better than anyone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Wendy's Creiglow's iffy prize, Gardner said, he can only wait and see, 
and be glad that an entry from his class won. "It's the best thing that's 
happened to my students since I've been here," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DISMISSAL 
OF SUIT BY FORMER POLICE OFFICIAL UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An appeals court Thursday upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit by former Los 
Angeles police official Robert Vernon, whose church activity had prompted a 
1991 city investigation into whether his decisions as a high-ranking officer 
had been colored by his religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon, a former assistant police chief who 15 years before had made a series 
of religious tapes for a Sun Valley church, had filed a $10-million suit 
against the city and the Police Commission after a published article about the 
tapes set off the five-month probe. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was dismissed in 1992 when the city showed that the probe was limited 
to his on-duty job performance, that Vernon's private religious activities 
never were monitored, and that the city reported at the inquiry's end that the 
concerns that had spawned it were unsubstantiated. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the U.S. 9th District Court of Appeals upheld the lower court 
decision, ruling that Vernon "failed to demonstrate that the government's 
action burdened his right to freely exercise his religion."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; TRUCK 
DRIVER HAILED FOR AID IN ARRESTING KIDNAP SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police hailed a Williston, N.D., truck driver as a hero Thursday for helping 
to catch a Long Beach father who allegedly abducted his 11-month-old son from 
the boy's mother.  
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin White, 21, is "the hero of the day," said Long Beach police spokesman 
Joe Levy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If not for the observation that he made, and his persistence and quick 
thinking, perhaps the reunion (of the boy and his mother) would not have taken 
place," Levy said.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kneavel, 33, was booked Wednesday for spousal abuse, child stealing 
and child endangering, and held on $1 million bail. White, a driver for Allied 
Van Lines, was southbound on the Golden State Freeway near Castaic Lake about 
8:30 a.m. when he saw Kneavel driving alongside with the boy in his lap, Levy 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 White had seen news reports that Kneavel was wanted for allegedly abducting 
his son, Michael, about noon Sunday from JoAnne Smarsly's home after hitting 
her, Levy said. Smarsly had legal custody of the child, Levy added.  
</P>
<P>
 Police broadcast a description of the car Kneavel was believed to be driving 
and White had memorized it, Levy said. "After seeing the car and recognizing 
it, he called the California Highway Patrol on his cellular phone and followed 
it," Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The suspect was in the fast lane, traveling about 80 m.p.h.," Levy said. 
"(White) gave the dispatchers the (freeway) call box numbers to update their 
location."  
</P>
<P>
 CHP officers caught up with the Pontiac at the Balboa Boulevard off-ramp near 
Sylmar and Kneavel was taken into custody.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; MTA 
UNION AUTHORIZES STRIKE IF NEGOTIATIONS FAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bus and train operators for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted 
overwhelmingly Thursday to authorize union negotiators to schedule a strike 
date if agreement on a new labor contract cannot be reached before their 
contract expires Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the United Transportation Union voted 2,843 to 265 to set the date, 
union officials said.However, they added, they still hope to resolve the 
dispute at the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 The UTU is one of three union whose contract agreements with the MTA expire at 
midnight at the end of this month. Union officials initially requested a 3% 
raise and retention of a cost-of-living increase. MTA officials, who are 
considering a fare increase to help ease a $126-million operating deficit, 
oppose both demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the MTA announced a strike contingency plan, saying the 
agency has trained 100 substitute bus and train operators in the event of work 
stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
 However, UTU General Chairman Earl Clark said the bus and train operators 
"have no desire or intention of disrupting public transportation 
unnecessarily." Rather, Clark said, the union plans to ask Gov. Pete Wilson to 
intervene in the dispute to give both parties more time to negotiate.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; 15-YEAR-OLD 
SENTENCED IN SLAYING OF STORE CLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 15-year-old Azusa boy who was convicted of murder in the robbery and 
shooting death of a 40-year-old store clerk was ordered confined in the 
California Youth Authority until he is 25 years old, the maximum sentence for 
minors.  
</P>
<P>
 "The tragedies they just seem to keep coming," Pomona Juvenile Court 
Commissioner Wade D. Olson said at a disposition hearing Thursday for the boy, 
whose name was not released because he is a minor."A family man, a father, 
loses his life for $72." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy and his 16-year-old brother were accused of killing Raj Kumar Sharma, 
a clerk at an Arrow Highway convenience store in February. Sharma died after he 
was felled by a robber who fired five shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The older boy, who has pleaded not guilty, will be tried as an adult. He faces 
a preliminary hearing July 12 in Citrus Municipal Court in West Covina. The 
boys' mother turned her sons into the police because she said she believed that 
it was her duty.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES AIRPORT; 
SURPRISE CHECK FINDS 19 LAX SHUTTLE VANS UNSAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nineteen of 78 shuttle vans inspected Thursday at Los Angeles International 
Airport were declared unsafe and ordered out of service, a California Highway 
Patrol sergeant said.  
</P>
<P>
 The CHP and the Public Utilities Commission staged the surprise inspection at 
the airport shuttle van holding lot at Alverstone Avenue and 96th Street, said 
CHP Sgt. Ernie Garcia.Inspectors examined the brakes, steering, suspension, 
tires, frames and exhaust systems, and also checked to see if the drivers were 
properly licensed, Garcia said.  
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two of the vans had no violations and 27 others had minor violations 
not considered safety hazards, so they remained in service, Garcia said. 
Inspectors found 74 violations of varying degrees of severity, and 24 of the 
problems involving steering systems, Garcia said.  
</P>
<P>
 In all, 33 drivers were cited for vehicle violations. Four drivers had no 
license in their possession, but it was unclear if they were unlicensed, Garcia 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 In a similar operation recently, citations were issued on 31 vehicles, 10 of 
which were taken out of service, and two drivers were ticketed for driver's 
license violations, Garcia said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BURBANK; COMIC PLEADS 
NOT GUILTY IN 'TONIGHT SHOW' FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stand-up comedian Bobcat Goldthwait pleaded not guilty Thursday to misdemeanor 
charges of unlawfully setting his chair on fire during a May 6 taping of "The 
Tonight Show With Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-born entertainer, who appeared in some of the "Police Academy" 
movies, waived his right to appear for an arraignment at Burbank Municipal 
Court.Instead, Goldthwait's lawyer, Peter Laird, entered the plea on his 
client's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedian is believed to be the first guest of "The Tonight Show" ever to 
be charged based on conduct on the air, according to NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 In a skit that aired Wednesday, Goldthwait appeared buried in a sandbox at a 
make-believe NBC day-care center. He cried, "Jay, let me out! I promise I'll be 
good," as a child poured sand over his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait had been a guest on "The Tonight Show" in May when he suddenly 
stood up during an interview with Leno and set his chair afire, using lighter 
fluid and a long-handled lighter. A startled Leno and model Lauren Hutton 
doused the fire with cups of water. The unscripted stunt aired the same night.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
INSTALLATION OF PORTABLE TOILETS ON SKID ROW OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has approved a six-month pilot project to install as many as 30 
portable toilets for homeless people on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Public Works said the program, which was proposed by social 
service providers but opposed by many businesses, could be canceled at any time 
if problems develop. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a temporary solution," said Public Works Commission President Charles 
Dickerson. "This is not the optimal solution to homelessness. This is just a 
Band-Aid." 
</P>
<P>
 Toilets were all set to go up in 1992 but former Mayor Tom Bradley interceded 
to keep them off sidewalks. For months, activists have been pressuring Mayor 
Richard Riordan to approve the latrines, arguing that the homeless should not 
be forced to defecate and urinate on the streets.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; HEARING SET 
FOR SUSPECTS IN SLAYINGS OF 2 STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge Thursday set a preliminary hearing for July 11 on 
charges against two suspects in connection with the killings of two Marymount 
College students in March during a carjacking in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Oscar Butler, 18, and Alberto Vasquez Reygoza, 20, appeared briefly 
before Judge James L. Wright in Long Beach Superior Court on Thursday to set a 
date for the hearing and to hear their lawyers request jailhouse telephone 
privileges for them.Wilson ordered jail supervisors to allow each defendant one 
daily telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, who is accused of shooting Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, both 19, on 
March 22 in a crime that brought protests from Japan about lawlessness in Los 
Angeles, is being held without bail. Ito was a native of Japan, and Matsuura 
was American-born of Japanese parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Reygoza is charged with being an accessory and with receiving stolen property 
in connection with the case. Bail was initially set for Reygoza at $45,000, but 
he was held without bail after it was determined that he was in violation of 
the terms of probation from a prior case.

NON-ATHLETE ROLE MODELS URGED; CULTURE: ACTIVISTS SEEK MORE ATTENTION FOR 
EVERYDAY AFRICAN AMERICAN HEROES SUCH AS LAWYERS AND DOCTORS AND LESS FOR 
SPORTS STARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fourteen-year-old Tony Price cannot run like O.J. Simpson. "I don't have the 
legs he has," Price said on a Watts sidewalk this week. "I do not have the jump 
shot Michael Jordan has." 
</P>
<P>
 So Price admires non-athletic talent in his role models. He believes other 
young blacks must do the same, and the press must give them the right examples. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to stop glorifying the fantasy role models who have the big yachts," 
Price said. "I probably won't live in a yacht. . . . So many of our young 
African American males know about the NBA. But rarely do they know about the BA 
and the MBA." 
</P>
<P>
 Price and more than a dozen black activists gathered for a news conference 
Wednesday to urge the media to focus on everyday African American heroes and 
bring balance to the coverage of charges that Simpson murdered his ex-wife and 
her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James Mays, a Central City physician and community activist, said that 
while white children have many role models, black youths see "those persons you 
have designated, and who young people have accepted as role models topple like 
bowling balls. . . . And there's no backup." 
</P>
<P>
 Mays urged reporters to focus on true role models such as lawyers, doctors and 
the people enshrined on Watts' Promenade of Prominence, where he spoke. The 
promenade features plaques and pictures of honorees in the sidewalk along Will 
Rogers Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The activists noted that on Friday, the day that 95 million Americans watched 
police pursue Simpson on freeways, two community activists -- (Sweet) Alice 
Harris, who works with teen-age parents, and retired businessman John T. 
Stevens -- were enshrined on the promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let the children know that (Sweet) Alice Harris and John Stevens exist in our 
land," Mays said. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad Nassardeen, founder of Recycling Black Dollars, a black business 
group, said the press assumed that Simpson was guilty before he was charged. 
"There was almost a joy in that someone that seemingly pristine was taken 
down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also admonished the police for leaking details of the investigation to the 
press, and said "the press deserves its own kick for being so quick to jump on 
this information without any corroboration whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nassardeen cited reports of a bloody ski mask being found in Simpson's house, 
first reported last week by KCOP-TV, which cited unidentified law enforcement 
sources. On Wednesday, prosecutors said no such mask has been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Nassardeen also criticized Time magazine for touching up Simpson's mug shot on 
this week's cover to make it look more menacing. The purpose of techniques such 
as Time's, Nassardeen said, "is to instill fear in America . . . that trickles 
down on all of us as people to be feared."

MAN ARRESTED FOR ALLEGEDLY TRAFFICKING IN BEAR PARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A Rosemead businessman was arrested Thursday for allegedly purchasing large 
volumes of bear parts, culminating a 1 1/2-year undercover investigation of an 
illegal wildlife trafficking operation that California agents say is the 
largest they have seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the California Department of Fish and Game said Joseph S. 
Chang, 39, purchased bear gallbladders from undercover wildlife wardens three 
times in the past five months, including 164 gallbladders worth an estimated 
$715,000 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang allegedly was involved in a trading operation encompassing four Western 
states. Gallbladders were taken from American black bears in Colorado, Utah and 
Alaska, and brought to Los Angeles for distribution and sale in Asia, according 
to Fish and Game wardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest is the second in the Los Angeles area this year concerning 
trafficking of the bear gallbladders, which are coveted in Asian nations as a 
medicine to treat high blood pressure, stomach problems and other ailments. 
Hollywood businessman William Jin Taek Lee, 35, earlier was fined $10,000 after 
allegedly running an illegal hunting club to collect and sell the bear parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife agents say the cases show that Los Angeles is a major hub for 
distributing bear gallbladders, which fetch $265 per gram. The inquiry included 
undercover agents from the California wildlife agency as well as from Colorado, 
Alaska, Utah, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang is "a very, very big dealer in animal parts," said Fish and Game Lt. 
Eddie Watkins, who oversees the special operations unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins said Chang told the undercover agents he had previously made purchases 
of as many as 500 bear gallbladders at a time. Each sells for $2,000 to $5,000 
in California and as much as $100,000 in Asia.

HIGH COURT REJECTS L.A. COUNTY'S CHALLENGE TO STATE TAX TRANSFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court on Thursday rejected Los Angeles County's challenge to 
the state government's shift last year of $2.6 billion in property tax revenue 
from local governments to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, which lost $681 million, argued that the shift violated local 
authority over property tax money and the financing of local government. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue transfer was upheld by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Diane 
Wayne and by a state appeals court. The Supreme Court denied review of the 
case.  
</P>
<P>
 The tax money was shifted to satisfy the state's funding obligations for 
schools, under voter-approved Proposition 98, without widening the deficit. 
Counties lost $2.1 billion, and the rest came from cities and special-purpose 
local districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Local governments were partially compensated with revenue from a half-cent 
sales tax increase, but still lost significant amounts of money. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal said March 30 that the California 
Constitution gives the Legislature "the power . . . to allocate property tax 
revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Reed, the county's chief administrative officer, said: "The suit was 
well-founded. We regret losing it, but we knew it was a long shot." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling has no immediate impact on the county's budget deliberations. The 
lost revenue has already been factored into its revenue projections.

CORRALLING A NEW NAME; MEMORIAL: CITY OFFICIALS WANT TO RENAME A SCHOOL IN 
HONOR OF GUNSLINGER WYATT EARP, WHO ONCE LIVED ON THE SITE. THE IDEA DRAWS 
FIRE, HOWEVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Legendary Wild West gunslinger Wyatt Earp may soon get caught in the middle of 
another shootout -- this one over his name. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they may try to commemorate Earp by renaming Mt. Vernon 
Middle School in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Over their dead bodies, counter those who feel the 70-year-old Los Angeles 
campus should continue to memorialize the country's first president instead of 
one of its last gunfighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Famed for his quick draw and sure aim during the 1881 gunfight at the O.K. 
Corral in Tombstone, Ariz., Wyatt Earp lived for 25 years at the site of the 
current campus. He died in a bungalow at 4004 W. 17th St., on the eastern side 
of the present school grounds, at age 80 on Jan. 13, 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 The name change was suggested by City Councilman Nate Holden, who visited the 
Mid-City campus Thursday with historians Carl Chafin of Culver City and Jeff 
Morey of Long Beach. They met with seventh-graders to outline the significance 
of the site -- and the contribution made by Wyatt Earp to America's western 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said he learned of the school connection from aide Roger Galloway, a 
former writer for the TV series "Legends of the West," who researched the 
onetime lawman's background for the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The councilman said he plans to ask actors Hugh O'Brian, James Garner, Kurt 
Russell, Bruce Boxleitner, Burt Lancaster, Kevin Costner and Harris Yulin -- 
each of whom have portrayed Wyatt Earp -- to contribute money to a proposed 
reading center at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've all derived financial reward from Wyatt Earp. Maybe they'd like to 
share a little of it," Holden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the sound of 'Wyatt Earp Jr. High.' I think renaming it would be 
appropriate. It would draw attention to the school and the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Education member Barbara Boudreaux said she was unaware until 
recently that Earp had lived and died at the school site. She said she would 
consider taking the name-change proposal to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Several seventh-grade boys quickly endorsed the idea. "The name, Mt. Vernon, 
is kind of corny," said Larry Luckett, 12. Said Travon Glescoe, 13: "Mt. Vernon 
is a geek name. Mt. Vernon is a street or something. There aren't any mountains 
around here." 
</P>
<P>
 But several seventh-grade girls rolled their eyes at the gunslinger name. And 
school historian Charles Laraway said he would oppose a name change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be very happy. There's a lot of history to this name. When the 
school opened, it was an exact replica of (George) Washington's home, Mt. 
Vernon," said Laraway, who has taught at the school since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Leonard George said the school initially was to have been called 
Washington Jr. High when it opened in 1926. But it became Mt. Vernon when 
officials decided to open Washington High School in 1927. The Mt. Vernon 
replica disappeared when the school was rebuilt after being damaged in the 1971 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said campus names have been changed in the past. But this one 
sounds like it might need some special consideration, said Beverly West of the 
school district's school design and construction branch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would go in the books as 'Earp, Wyatt Middle School,' " West cautioned. 
"Maybe they should rethink this one."  
</P>
<P>
 Even if Earp School wouldn't make traditionalists throw up, it might still 
sound like it.

2 KILLED IN CAR CRASH AFTER ARMED ROBBERY; CRIME: ALLEGED GUNMAN STEALS MONEY 
AND AUTO FROM A TELLER MACHINE CUSTOMER AND LATER IS INVOLVED IN A COLLISION. 
WITNESSES CHASE HIM AND HOLD HIM FOR POLICE.

 Quevan Posey's Wednesday night started with him stealing $300 and ended with 
him taking two lives, Los Angeles police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Posey, 26, robbed attorney Glenn White at gunpoint and abducted him and his 
female companion in White's 1993 Mustang, police said. The lawyer and his 
companion were dropped off unharmed, but police said Posey drove through a red 
light on Burlington Avenue later that night and slammed into an oncoming car. 
The driver of that car and a passenger with Posey were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Posey fled the scene on foot, police said. Witnesses chased him onto a bus and 
kept him there until police arrived. He was arrested on suspicion of murder 
with special circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 White said he was withdrawing money from an automated teller machine at 3rd 
and Gardner streets about 7:30 p.m. when a man police later identified as Posey 
approached him with a gun. After unsuccessfully trying to grab the gun from the 
man, White said he was ordered to withdraw $300. 
</P>
<P>
 The man then forced the attorney to walk to his car where his friend waited. 
After the man told him to get in the car, White said, he tried again to grab 
the gun, thinking he and his friend might be killed otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 But the man hit White with the gun and forced him behind the wheel. He drove 
for a few blocks until he was told to stop. The man then ordered White and his 
passenger out of the car and sped away, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than three hours later, Posey had picked up a passenger and was driving 
White's car at more than 50 m.p.h. north on Burlington Avenue when he ran the 
red light and hit the eastbound car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no indication that the (Mustang's) brakes were hit," Detective 
Richard Lopez said. "Both cars looked like crushed tin cans." 
</P>
<P>
 Posey, who was protected by an air bag, managed to struggle out of the car, 
Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said passersby chased Posey, who was waving a .22-caliber automatic 
pistol, for about two blocks before he got onto a Metropolitan Transit 
Authority bus that was stopped at Wilshire Boulevard and Alvarado Street. One 
man drove his car into the path of the bus so it could not be driven away, 
Lopez said, and others crowded around the vehicle, refusing to let Posey out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they contained the guy within the bus for about five minutes, 
until police arrived," Lopez said. If it were not for the witnesses, he said, 
Posey "would have been gone. He would have been adios."

A FULL PLATE; ABDUL-JABBAR KEEPS BUSY AS FILM PRODUCER, BUSINESSMAN, ACTOR, 
COMMENTATOR AND PARENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Displayed in a wooden frame on the wall behind a glass desk in his office high 
above Century City is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's Laker warm-up jacket, purple with 
gold trim. Visitors notice two striking aspects of the garment: It's very big 
and Kareem isn't in it. 
</P>
<P>
 The former owner said there is no mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't wish I was still playing," said Abdul-Jabbar, 47. "I'm glad I have 
the opportunity to live at a normal pace, the pace that real people have to 
deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played longer than any professional basketball player ever played, so I got 
everything I could out of the game. There 
</P>
<P>
 wasn't anything left there." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar hasn't worn Laker purple and gold for five years, not since his 
retirement in 1989, five years ago this month, when the era of the sky hook 
officially ended and a completely different one began. 
</P>
<P>
 It is called life after basketball, a daunting prospect for some players who 
fear they might foul out in their attempts to make a living in jobs that 
require something other than dribbling, shooting or blocking out under the 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sky hook had his name on it and so does Abdul-Jabbar's new business. 
He is president of Kareem Productions, a 2-year-old Los Angeles entertainment 
company that produces movies about the black experience. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, a television movie about civil rights activist Vernon Johns was 
shown. It was an Abdul-Jabbar project in association with Laurel Entertainment, 
a subsidiary of Spelling Entertainment Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar believes the movie, which starred James Earl Jones, might win an 
Emmy. Kareem Productions also has a development deal with Warner Brothers to 
produce a film about the old Negro baseball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Another project Abdul-Jabbar has in mind is a movie about a black tank 
battalion in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar said there is potential for many such stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of promise there and it's something that people have only 
scratched the surface of," he said. "I think I've come a good ways in 
understanding the marketplace and my function in it." 
</P>
<P>
 When he played, there was never any problem understanding Abdul-Jabbar's 
function in the marketplace. He spent 20 years in professional basketball, 
scoring more points than anyone else ever has. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 39, he averaged 23.4 points a game and led the team. In seven of 
his last eight seasons, the Lakers reached the NBA finals and won four titles. 
Abdul-Jabbar played until he was 42, when the Lakers were swept by the Detroit 
Pistons in the 1989 championship series. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar remembers that series for another reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in Detroit and at the same time my daughter was graduating from high 
school," he said. "I really didn't want to be where I was, but I knew I didn't 
have a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I enjoy being able to have my time to myself to make my own agenda. That 
makes it an extraordinary luxury." 
</P>
<P>
 When you've played for 20 years, it would seem there might have been time to 
prepare for what you will do the rest of your life. But that idea works better 
in theory than practice, Abdul-Jabbar discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Geez, you don't get enough time to prepare for it," he said. "Well, not 
thinking about it rationally. It's always just an imaginary place until you 
finally end up there and there's really no preparation for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar thought he was laying the groundwork for a post-basketball career 
in 1985 when he signed a three-year deal with MCA to head his own record label. 
</P>
<P>
 As chief of Cranberry Records, Abdul-Jabbar planned to sign at least two new 
jazz acts a year and oversee the reissue of jazz and blues records in MCA's 
catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cranberry turned out to be a sour experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really didn't have any interest in my doing jazz," Abdul-Jabbar said. 
"They just wanted to have my name on the marquee. That was it. It was just a 
waste of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Irving Azoff, president of MCA Records when Abdul-Jabbar signed that deal, 
said he had no comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that part of Abdul-Jabbar's work went unnoticed, a recent endeavor was 
seen by millions. His friend, Steven King, wrote a role for him in the recent 
television mini-series, "The Stand." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar said he would like to act more. He has has had movie roles in 
"Fletch," "Airplane," "The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh," "Troop Beverly Hills," 
"Game of Death" and "The Mighty Ducks II." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he is on a sound stage or a basketball court, Abdul-Jabbar said there 
is no question which is more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, acting isn't as tough as playing basketball," he said. "There are 
300 people playing basketball at the level I did. There are a lot more actors. 
But it is the same dynamics, you know, 8 million people for one slot and many 
of them very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar, who worked with Bruce Lee in "Game of Death," used to baby-sit 
for Brandon Lee when the Lees lived in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was real squiggly," said Abdul-Jabbar, who never knew Brandon Lee as an 
adult. Lee died last year in an accident on the set of his film, "The Crow." 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar's own children are past the squiggly stage, except possibly 2 
1/2-year-old Adam. Habiba, 22, will graduate from UCLA in December. Kareem, 17, 
will attend Valparaiso on a partial basketball scholarship. Sultana, 15, is at 
Pacific Hills High and Amir, 13, is a soccer player at Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any parent, Abdul-Jabbar has his hands full. 
</P>
<P>
 "I nag the boys about their homework and see that they get to the dentist," he 
said. "It's nice seeing my boys growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 He still gets away to Hawaii as often as possible, reads as much John Le Carre 
as he can and has taken up squash, automatically setting another record as the 
sport's tallest, baldest player. 
</P>
<P>
 At the office, Abdul-Jabbar extends himself as much as he did on the court. He 
endorses a weighted exercise rope, has a merchandising deal for T-shirts and 
socks and is the national spokesman for Athletes and Entertainers for Kids. His 
Kareem's Kids program in the Los Angeles school district carries an anti-gang, 
stay-in-school message. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Abdul-Jabbar was a commentator on ESPN basketball telecasts and 
he would like to do more. He even hinted that he might do something in 
basketball besides talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has had feelers about coaching from several major colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had feelers, but no talks," he said. "The message I sent back? We'll 
talk again." 
</P>
<P>
 But the closest Abdul-Jabbar actually has been to basketball since he left was 
his cable commentary. Although it was a new line of work, Abdul-Jabbar kept 
running across reminders of his old job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was interesting because I crossed paths with my own personal history," he 
said. "Everywhere I went, it was somebody on the team's father played against 
me. That was wild." 
</P>
<P>
 What was so wild about it? 
</P>
<P>
 "You start to understand how many people's lives you touched."

ANALYSIS; DAVIS FINALLY DECIDES L.A. ISN'T SO BAD; PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER MUCH 
SPECULATION AND POSTURING, HE FIGURES THAT THE TIME ISN'T RIGHT TO MOVE HIS 
RAIDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So the Raiders aren't leaving town, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they never were. Not unless they absolutely had to. 
</P>
<P>
 After battling his way from Oakland to Los Angeles through a gantlet of 
lawyers, politicians and bureaucrats, after spending months in a stuffy 
courtroom far from his beloved practice field, after defying and beating the 
powerful NFL and nemesis Pete Rozelle, Raider owner Al Davis was not about to 
pack up his organization and give up his territory, the largest market in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially not now. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rams apparently ready to leave, this territory will belong solely to 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis knows very well that the NFL is not about to operate without a franchise 
in Los Angeles. If both the Rams and the Raiders were to leave, it wouldn't 
take long to fill the gap. Some team would move here faster than you can say 
Tinseltown. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the vast number of potential buyers of tickets and team-related 
merchandise, there is the spotlight permanently focused on L.A. And the only 
thing owners of sports teams seem to like as much as making money is making 
headlines. If you can make it here, you'll make it everywhere. Stars in L.A. 
tend to become national figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis wasn't about to turn his back on all that and return to small-market 
Oakland, no matter how many sellouts he could get there. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows he can get even bigger sellouts here if he can put a winning team on 
the field. And he should be able to do that with the material he now has. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 It was the same problem Davis has faced since arriving here in 1982. He wants 
luxury boxes and other improvements in the decaying Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of that work was done last season with the removal of the 
track and the lowering of the field, bringing the seats closer to the action. 
</P>
<P>
 But optimism for the swift completion of that work ended, along with a lot of 
other dreams, at 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the earth had stopped shaking, the Coliseum had suffered $42 
million worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the estimated cost of the repair work still going on at a furious rate 
so it can be done before football season starts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis knew all this work would only get the 71-year-old stadium back to 
where it had been. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't good enough. Davis believes he is entitled to the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Many think a city this size is entitled to even more, such as a brand new, 
state-of-the-art stadium like those enjoyed by far smaller metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis couldn't complain publicly. Not with all the money already being spent 
to repair the Coliseum. Not with the community still trying to repair schools 
and hospitals and freeways after the devastating quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was sensitive, he was realistic, but he was also concerned about his own 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 So he began applying pressure. A master of intimidation on the field, Davis 
knows how the power game is played. 
</P>
<P>
 He made a highly publicized visit to the Citrus Bowl in Orlando to allow the 
city fathers of that Florida city to make a case for the Raiders moving there. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis then negotiated an agreement with the city of Oakland for the Raiders to 
move back there for one year in case the Coliseum repairs weren't completed. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't sign the agreement, but it was on his desk, tantalizingly close. 
</P>
<P>
 The message to Coliseum Commission officials was plain. Davis had cities 
courting him. He had an agreement he could wave in their faces. He had options. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Raiders had agreed to play in Dodger Stadium or the Rose Bowl in the 
event the Coliseum wasn't ready, that wouldn't have threatened Coliseum 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Orlando tour and the Oakland agreement sent a very different message. 
</P>
<P>
 A threat, though, is only as powerful as the resolve of the person making it. 
Davis had to be prepared to follow through. Now, that's not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement that was signed Thursday benefits both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 No politician wants to be responsible for spending $42 million on a stadium, 
whether it was local money or federal money, only to see its professional team 
march out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, another team would arrive, but it would soon have its own demands. Nobody 
is going to want to play in the Coliseum for long in its present condition. 
</P>
<P>
 This story isn't over yet. Thursday's agreement is only for the 1994 season. 
If, in a year, the move to improve the Coliseum has bogged done, Davis will 
start looking again. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if he thinks he has to, he and the Raiders will leave. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost money to fix up the Coliseum, money that must somehow be raised, 
but that will, in turn, generate additional revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 A new pro soccer team is supposed to play here next spring. There are always 
Super Bowls and political conventions and huge concerts to bid for and, 
perhaps, even another Olympics down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 If Los Angeles hopes to attract those kinds of events and keep a pro football 
team, the Coliseum, sooner rather than later, must be improved.

DREIFORT DEMOTED TO MINORS; DODGERS: ROOKIE SENT DOWN WITH 0-5 RECORD, 6.21 
ERA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Deciding it was time to let him develop in a less pressured situation, the 
Dodgers sent rookie relief pitcher Darren Dreifort to their San Antonio farm 
club Thursday. He will continue to work on his mechanics with Burt Hooton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had hoped that Dreifort, 22, would progress under the guidance of 
pitching coach Ron Perranoski, who has been working intently with Dreifort the 
last two weeks. But another bad outing against the San Diego Padres on 
Wednesday convinced team officials that Dreifort needed a more relaxed setting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort -- who is expected to be the Dodgers' future closer -- will join 
another heralded rookie, Chan Ho Park, at double-A San Antonio. Dreifort leaves 
with an 0-5 record, 6.21 earned-run average and six saves in 29 innings over 27 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, who has impressed some of the best hitters in the league with his 
sinker, pitched well at the start of the season. But when thrust into the 
closer role after Todd Worrell hurt his ribs on May 4, Dreifort struggled. 
</P>
<P>
 He seldom had a chance to work on the mechanical deficiencies that Perranoski 
had identified during spring training, and hitters began to take note. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Dreifort had a 1.20 ERA and held opponents to a .214 batting 
average. In May, his ERA swelled to 8.48 and opponents hit .429 against him. 
During the 17 days Worrell was sidelined, Dreifort was 0-2 with three saves in 
seven games, one blown save and a 9.45 ERA. He gave up seven earned runs in 6 
2/3 innings.  
</P>
<P>
 Even after Worrell returned from the disabled list and Dreifort reverted to 
his original set-up role, he continued to falter. After a bad outing on June 11 
against the Chicago Cubs, Perranoski broke Dreifort's delivery down and began 
building it up again. Dreifort made only two appearances afterward and 
struggled in both. In his last five outings, Dreifort gave up seven earned runs 
in 2 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dreifort has so much potential and is such a good kid to work with, it's 
important to try and keep his confidence level up," Perranoski said recently. 
"He was starting to become concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort will join San Antonio Saturday for a game in Wichita, Kan., his 
hometown.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; OWNERS PREVAIL, KEEP EXEMPTION 
</P>

 A Senate committee unsympathetic to either side in a dispute between baseball 
team owners and players defeated a proposal Thursday that backers said would 
forestall a players strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected a bill by Sen. Howard Metzenbaum 
(D-Ohio), that would remove major league baseball's antitrust exemption in 
labor matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Joseph Biden (D-Del.), chairman of the panel, said baseball owners were 
"not a group that seems to be particularly concerned about anything except 
their self interests and the players are right up there with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee rejected the bill, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The players' union said the bill would have helped forestall a walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regrettably, the interests of the fans were ignored, and the interests of the 
owners' cartel protected," Donald Fehr, head of the players' union, said. "This 
vote continues the state of affairs which has resulted in a strike or lockout 
every time major league players and owners go to the bargaining table." 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers and chairman of the ruling executive 
council, said he was pleased by the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will allow the collective bargaining process to continue unimpeded," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional baseball has held an antitrust exemption since a 1922 Supreme 
Court decision. It precludes the Major League Baseball Players Assn. from suing 
team owners, and union officials say that could lead to the game's eighth work 
stoppage since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 If baseball were subject to antitrust laws, the union could decertify, as the 
NFL Players Assn. did, and sue. That would move the confrontation into court 
while play continues.

 Chicago Cub broadcaster Harry Caray, apparently overcome by the heat, fell on 
a set of steps at Joe Robbie Stadium in Miami but was pronounced fine after 
hospital tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Caray, who won't give his age but is believed to be in his mid-70s, was listed 
in stable condition at Parkway Regional Medical Center and will remain in the 
hospital overnight for observation, said hospital spokeswoman Lynn Friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Caray cut and bruised his face when he fell.

 Larry Walker of the Montreal Expos was suspended for four games by National 
League President Leonard S. Coleman Jr. Walker received the suspension, 
effective today, and was fined an undisclosed amount for charging the mound and 
provoking a bench-clearing brawl in a game on June 14 against Pittsburgh. . . . 
Phillie outfielder Lenny Dykstra was listed in good condition at a Philadelphia 
hospital after having his appendix removed. Dykstra will be out two to three 
weeks.

ANGEL ROOKIE EXCELS IN ANONYMOUS ZONE; LITTLE-KNOWN LEFT FIELDER JIM EDMONDS 
SOLIDIFIES JOB WITH HOT BAT, VERSATILE GLOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 He is seldom recognized in airports, has no commercial endorsements and 
doesn't pull down a seven-figure salary. No one chants his name when he steps 
to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of the Angels' best players this season and there's no question he's 
their biggest surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Jim Edmonds, the man who put Bo Jackson on the bench, prompted the Angels 
to send Dwight Smith to Baltimore and delayed J.T. Snow's return to the major 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 He never won the Heisman, never even played college baseball. Heck, he's a 
local kid from Diamond Bar, just up the 57 Freeway from Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels simply couldn't get Edmonds out of the lineup earlier this season, 
so they stopped trying. There was no sense ignoring the obvious: He was the 
best they had in left field. And for a time, he also was their best first 
baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds, a 23-year-old rookie, has emerged as a bright spot in an Angel season 
that has been punctuated by the firing of a manager, the revamping of the 
infield and inept pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only June, but there is talk that Edmonds is a leading candidate for 
American League rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't have the power of right fielder Tim Salmon, doesn't run as fast as 
center fielder Chad Curtis, but Edmonds plays to his strengths and is better 
for it. He's a singles hitter who plays solid defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're always surprised when somebody does as well (in his first season) as 
Jimmy has," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. "He is a good outfielder and could 
be an outstanding player. What makes him a tough out is that he hits to all 
fields." 
</P>
<P>
 Others may be surprised by Edmonds' progress, but he is not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be surprised if I was hitting .200," he said. "I'd be surprised if I was 
struggling." 
</P>
<P>
 He believed he would play this well in the majors. After six seasons in the 
minors, Edmonds knew he was ready. 
</P>
<P>
 His standout defense finally earned him a starting spot in the outfield, but 
his hitting solidified his job. In 56 errorless games, including 17 starts in 
left, he has a .331 average with six doubles, four homers and 25 runs batted 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who will never run as he once did because of hip replacement surgery, 
and Smith, better known for his swing, were to share the left-field position 
when the season began. Each struggled and Edmonds, who started as the Angels' 
fifth outfielder, quickly zoomed past them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, one of the world's best-known athletes, now fills in for Edmonds. 
Smith was traded June 14 to Baltimore because Edmonds didn't need two backups. 
</P>
<P>
 When Edmonds filled in for the injured Eduardo Perez at first base for eight 
consecutive games in early May, he proved he could handle that, too. He hadn't 
played first since 1988, his first professional season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He surprised me," former Manager Buck Rodgers said at the time. "I know he 
can play center, left and right. He's a good outfielder. Maybe the second best 
on the club. But when he showed what he could do at first, that was 
surprising." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edmonds: "I always wanted to play the infield. There was never any doubt 
I could fill that spot. I just knew I could do a routine job at first base." 
</P>
<P>
 He did so well the Angels put off promoting Snow from triple-A Vancouver until 
June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he's an everyday player, Edmonds thinks winning the rookie of the 
year award isn't that far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be perfectly honest, I thought about it before the season," he said. "I 
thought it was an attainable goal." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a distinct possibility because, as Edmonds said, "there isn't a whole lot 
out there right now." Competition could come from teammate Brian Anderson, a 
left-handed starter with a 5-2 record and a 5.09 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 If Edmonds does win, he'll be the second consecutive Angel outfielder to win 
the award; Salmon won it last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't think for a moment everything has come easily to Edmonds, who played in 
only 18 major league games before this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He began as a professional before Salmon and Curtis, but was passed by both 
when nagging injuries troubled him in the minors. Twice, he had seasons ended 
by injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 More recently, he missed five games after suffering a concussion April 26 at 
Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds, a seventh-round pick of the Angels in 1988, began his career at 
Class-A Bend, Ore., of the Northwest League. His second season, at Class-A Quad 
City, Iowa, was cut short by a shoulder injury after 31 games. After a 
breakthrough season in 1990, when he hit .293, he injured his knee and missed 
most of '91. 
</P>
<P>
 He was promoted to the triple-A level in 1992 and last season made his major 
league debut. However, there was no guaranteed spot on the roster when he 
arrived at Tempe, Ariz., this spring. After all, the Angels already had Jackson 
and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minors didn't bother me too much until last year," Edmonds said. "When 
you go back to the same league twice it's tough. I talked to a few people and 
they said, 'This is going to be your year.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds knew he had paid his dues, but from an early age he also was aware of 
the long odds of advancing to the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a kid you don't realize how far away this is," he said, gesturing out at 
an empty Anaheim Stadium before a recent game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never dreamed of being a major league player until I got into the minors. 
When you get to the minors, you start to realize that it's a long ways away. 
Around double-A ball I realized I could make it. That's when I learned to play 
the game a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 He played the game pretty well at Diamond Bar High School, where as a senior 
he batted .548, was the Southern Section 5-A co-player of the year and led the 
Brahmas to the 5-A championship at Anaheim Stadium in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edmonds knows not to take anything for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 While running to first base in the second inning of the Angels' April 26 game 
at New York, Edmonds was hit on the head by Yankee shortstop Mike Gallego's 
errant throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Edmonds couldn't move his legs, couldn't feel anything but 
numbness. He was carried off on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to a nearby 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 He was later diagnosed with a concussion. Although there were no lingering 
physical problems, Edmonds was frightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had come back from injuries before, but never one that was so serious," he 
said. "If you have knee surgery, you can walk again. You might not be able to 
play again, but you can walk and live a normal life. But (a head injury) is 
something much more serious. You might not be able to talk again or walk again 
after something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 He was back in the lineup May 5, filling in for Perez, who had suffered a 
sprained ligament in his left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonds has missed only four games since, winning a spot in left field and 
making a name for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been one of those guys who didn't mind not being in the 
limelight, but I want to see my name on the lineup card."

JOHNSON MAY RETURN TO COACHING BY 1995; FOOTBALL: FORMER DALLAS COACH TELLS 
SPORTS EDITORS HE WILL MAKE A DECISION AFTER UPCOMING SEASON AS TV ANALYST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Johnson, who coached the Dallas Cowboys to consecutive Super Bowl 
championships before stepping down March 29 in a dispute with owner Jerry 
Jones, is thinking about a new football season. But it won't be the same this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 He won't be putting a team through preseason workouts, and he won't be a 
colorful fixture on the sidelines in the National Football League. Instead, 
he'll be an analyst for Fox Network and HBO. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson left no doubt when he spoke Thursday at the Associated Press 
Sports Editors Convention that he could be back coaching as early as 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always wanted to be the best I could be at one thing . . . coaching 
football," Johnson said. "That's what I worked my entire career to do, and 
there's a good chance I'll try to do that again." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson took note of the fact that this will be the first season since 1953 
that he hasn't either played or coached football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I'll miss part of it," he said. "That's why after this year I'm 
going to pull back and see whether I'm going to continue in television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to lay out in the Florida Keys, scuba dive, snorkel and fish and 
then decide. . . . There's a good chance that I'll go back. But I won't make 
that decision until at least after the end of this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Will other teams be more willing to dump their coaches knowing Johnson will be 
available? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so," Johnson said. "I may pull back and say, I like what I'm 
doing and I don't know if I want to get back into coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 As Johnson spoke of his accomplishments in Dallas, it was clear the 
competitive fire was still burning. He was asked why he wasn't wearing one of 
his NFL championship rings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're sort of outdated," he said. "To be honest, I haven't been wearing 
them because I've been down in Florida fishing. I've got them in the safe, but 
I haven't gotten my ring for this past season yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I will get one," he said, drawing a laugh from the crowd. 
"I'll try to be more up to date if I get that ring." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson did come away from Dallas with a reported $3.9-million settlement of 
his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the Cowboys, he said, "I've got mixed feelings. I've got 
people there that I really care about. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that they are the most sound team in the league. I think 
San Francisco is very close. They're the two most talented teams in the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
 "My mixed feelings are that there are people there that I really care about . 
. . from the coaching staff, the players, the trainers, all the administrative 
people I brought with me. Some of those people have been with me for years. I 
truly want them to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there's a side of me that's saying that I don't want them to 
surpass what we did the last couple of years. That's natural. I'd be lying if I 
said anything different.  
</P>
<P>
 "But because of the people I really care about, I want them to win and I want 
them to win it all. I want them to win their third Super Bowl, and I'll get my 
third Super Bowl somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Where might that "somewhere else" be? 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said either he or his attorney have talked with "a half-dozen 
different owners" about coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of them wanted me to coach this year, but I said there was no way, 
and we've tentatively agreed to talk again to some others at the end of the 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson virtually ruled out returning to college football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say I'm 99.9% sure that if I coach again, it will be in professional 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson acknowledged that he's having some "anxious moments" about his new 
career in television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a coaching show for about 15 years and I think I'll be comfortable in 
front of the television (camera). But it's not where my heart is. If you're not 
totally into something, I don't know that you're going to be able to do your 
best. But I'm also looking forward to it because it is different. I think I'll 
have fun with it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnson knows it won't provide the same excitement as coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt I'll have the same kinds of feelings I've had the last 10 years or 
so," he said. "I won't be nearly as anxious the night before a game. I won't 
have the misery or ecstasy the day after the game. I won't have the highs and 
lows I've had the last 10 years. But that's what I like. 
</P>
<P>
 "My entire life is at the very top or the very bottom. There's been very 
little in between, so I guess for this year I'm going to see what a lot of 
other people do. That is . . . live their lives between the highs and lows."

 No. Just hot. 
</P>
<P>
 In this hot and humid World Cup tournament, Zona Fresca was becoming a mixed 
zone of painted faces, Valderrama fright wigs and frizzy orange-haired Alexi 
Lalas wanna-bes, a temporary oasis for tired and sweaty soccer fans at the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 At any given time during the first three games at the Rose Bowl, one could 
find 80 to 90 weary spectators huddled under what appeared to be a huge 
inflatable shower stall, 25 feet wide by 25 feet long, basking in the fine 
chilled mist wafting over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, where temperatures have approached triple digits, similar 
misting devices have been rigged above both benches, cooling the players with a 
soft and steady spray. 
</P>
<P>
 The misters, as they are informally called, can be found behind the benches at 
eight of the nine World Cup sites -- everywhere but Pontiac, Mich. -- and 
outside the stadiums in Pasadena, the New Jersey Meadowlands, Dallas and 
Orlando for the refreshment of fans. They were provided by Cool Zone Products, 
a Los Angeles company that conceived the idea, for a per-game rental fee of 
$3,000 to $4,400, depending on the cost of transport. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been extremely popular," said Christopher Miehl, Cool Zone's chief 
financial officer, as he watched the huddled masses jockey for position under 
the spray nozzles. "We've toyed with the idea of installing timers. 'OK, it's 
been 10 minutes, time to let someone else in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The technology, known as "evaporative cooling," has been around for 70 years, 
according to Miehl, although Cool Zone didn't begin mass-producing the misters 
until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evaporative cooling was first used on pig and sheep farms, to keep the 
animals cool and get rid of the smell," Miehl said. "We started out in 1991 by 
making back-yard misting systems for homes in hot-weather areas. Arizona, 
Florida, Texas -- they were perfect markets for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also installed them in outdoor restaurants in places like Palm Springs. 
Finally, we decided, why not take the same concept to the sporting field?" 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Cool Zone contacted USC and lent the Trojan football team a sideline 
mister on trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally," Miehl said, "the players loved it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Bills heard about the misters and rented a few for the 1992 AFC 
championship game at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "They loved it so much, they took it with them to Pasadena for the Super 
Bowl," Miehl said. "It would have been great for us if they had won that game." 
</P>
<P>
 Miehl says the misters lower temperatures 20 to 25 degrees and "could save 
some players' lives. Our system was used at a football game between Syracuse 
and Texas Tech, and the field temperature was 110 degrees. Syracuse used the 
mister, Texas Tech didn't. Fifteen players form Texas Tech collapsed from heat 
exhaustion. None from Syracuse collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
 Cool Zone also makes "portable misters," which are basically plastic bottles 
with a pump on the bottom and a misting nozzle on top. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them to all the Rams last year," Miehl said. "Everybody liked it but 
Jim Everett. I don't know why. But I see he's not with the Rams anymore. That 
may be why." 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup was the testing ground for the outside misters, and Miehl and 
his staff weren't sure how the spectators would take to the strange-looking 
contraption. 
</P>
<P>
 "We turned it on at 1 o'clock and people came out of nowhere," said Anna 
Harper. "It's an attention-getter." 
</P>
<P>
 So far at the Rose Bowl, it's been the one fan attraction that can't be mist.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; FOR SOME, THIS CUP IS TOO HOT TO HANDLE; 
WEATHER: HEATED DISCUSSIONS RAGE ABOUT TEMPERATURES AND HUMIDITY; OTHERS COOLLY 
DISMISS IT AS EXCUSE-MAKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We had to find something in common because while we're talking about John 
Starks, they're talking about John Harkes. While we're talking roundball, 
they're talking about a round ball. 
</P>
<P>
 With all these soccophiles rambling around the United States speaking in 
tongues, drastic measures had to be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 So, it seems, we've dusted off that old conversational icebreaker, the 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 The sultry, sticky, steamy days of summer are upon us, and that's practically 
all anyone wanted to discuss during the first week of World Cup '94. The Lower 
48 are sweltering like a Mississippi swamp, and everyone is thunderstruck. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's put this as delicately and succinctly as possible: If it's summer, it's 
hot and humid. Those in Alaska need not reply. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the cacophony of complaints echoing across the land could drown out the 
cheers at the nine stadiums where they are showcasing international soccer's 
quadrennial event. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like complaining about the Winter Olympics being cold. 
</P>
<P>
 But because soccer is a worldwide passion, grumbling during World Cup 
tournaments is in fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, it was Mexico's altitude. The altitude and the heat and the smog, and 
the water and those two Moroccan army tanks that were escorting the team until 
Mexican officials put the kibosh on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the oppressive conditions, 34 of 52 games began at noon to accommodate 
European television, similar to the situation in the United States, where most 
early-round matches are starting in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Journalists predicted players would die (in Mexico)," recalled Guido Tognoni, 
a spokesman for FIFA, soccer's international governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monterrey (Mexico) was one of the hottest places on Earth during the World 
Cup," Andreas Herren of FIFA said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 in Italy, it was the heat again. The heat and the hooligans and the 
train strikes. Yugoslavia and Argentina played a quarterfinal game in Florence 
in temperatures that reached 104 degrees but without the energy-sapping 
humidity much of the eastern United States experienced during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the Cup's U.S. debut, here's what they are saying: 
</P>
<P>
 -- From San Francisco, Alan Rothenberg, chairman-chief executive officer of 
World Cup '94: "So far, everything has been about as good as we hoped for, 
except for the awful heat everywhere except California." 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Chicago, goalkeeper Carlos Leonel Trucco of Bolivia, accustomed to 
playing in 12,000-foot-high La Paz: "I think these schedules were (designed) to 
kill players. They should change the game times." 
</P>
<P>
 After Germany had defeated Bolivia, 1-0, in the Chicago opener last Friday, 
German forward Juergen Klinsmann said, "All along we have trained for the heat, 
but once you get out on the field it is different. To get a rhythm going under 
those brutal conditions was really difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Pontiac, Mich., U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic, before his team played 
Switzerland in the Silverdome: "I hope it is 300 degrees and 2,000% humidity." 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Washington, Coach Miguel Mejia Baron of Mexico: "I would tell those 
gentlemen from FIFA to take their suits off and play soccer. If they could 
choose between midday and 7 in the evening, I am sure they would choose to play 
at 7 p.m." 
</P>
<P>
 Tognoni, of Switzerland, accepted Baron's challenge. He kicked a ball around 
the field in Dallas' Cotton Bowl last weekend and reported that a slight breeze 
blows through, making conditions bearable. 
</P>
<P>
 -- From Dallas, Bulgarian forward Velko Iotov, whose team opened training camp 
in Austin, Tex.: "It's hard to breathe correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 The Belgians were so obsessed with heat, they wore protective hair gel to 
reflect the sun during their game last week in Orlando against Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swiss and Irish complained officials were too rigid when it came to 
allowing water bottles on the field. Regulations allow bottles on the sidelines 
and near the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said teams know where to line the bottles so that most players can 
take a quick drink whenever the action is away from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encourage them to drink water," Tognoni said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heated debates also were heard about using the conditions as justification for 
poor showings, as did Sweden in its 2-2 draw with Cameroon at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bit of an easy excuse for Sweden to say they were suffering from the 
sun," said Joseph-Antoine Bell, Cameroon's goalkeeper. "It's not going to get 
any cooler. They better get used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes wilted on a typically hot San Gabriel Valley day, which left some 
fans wondering why they had selected cool San Diego as a training site to 
prepare for games in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there were those who complained that Brazil, which opened at Stanford 
Stadium, the coolest of the nine sites, had a big advantage because everyone 
knows what Rio is like in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who says that?" asked Carlos Alberto Parreira, Brazil's coach. "Brazilian 
players will not be affected by the weather conditions? Brazilian players are 
not human? We have 11 players who play in Europe, not in Brazil, during the 
year. To give 100% effort in this weather, you'd have to be a robot." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the humans are doing fine. Officials said none of the players have 
suffered from heat-related complications. 
</P>
<P>
 The same could not be said for 106 fans in Orlando last weekend who were 
treated for mostly minor heat problems. In Chicago, 43 were treated for heat 
exhaustion and 13 were hospitalized last Friday, opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is sweating so much they don't have to use the rest room," a Chicago 
woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Knochel, chairman of internal medicine at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas 
and one of the country's foremost experts on heat exhaustion, said the 
conditions are dangerous only if athletes do not take proper precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 He said lack of acclimatization is the biggest factor, and most people need at 
least two weeks to become comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been concerned for some weeks about these people coming to town from 
cooler climates and higher altitudes," Knochel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But because soccer players are some of the world's fittest athletes, he 
expects few problems from the heat. Knochel said the best precautions are 
drinking lots of water and generously salting foods to replenish elements lost 
through exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are urinating properly, that's the best measure," he said. "The 
kidneys are efficient. That tells you if your water and salt stores are 
replete." 
</P>
<P>
 Knochel also said the athletes should spend time in the heat during days off, 
instead of staying in air-conditioned rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their endocrine glands and kidneys will have a better chance to adapt," he 
said. "They need all the help they can get." 
</P>
<P>
 At least most do. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Saudi Arabia was the only team wishing it were hotter. The Saudis 
opened the World Cup on a humid 86-degree day in Washington last Monday and 
goalkeeper Muhammad Al Daeyea actually donned long pants. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the Saudis played in shorts, though. 
</P>

Plaschke, and special correspondent Martha Vargas-Seagle contributed to this

GOOD NEWS AND BAD; PLAYER REACTION TO TORGESON LEAVING NORTHRIDGE DEPENDS ON 
THE PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All-American Shannon Jones is happy for Gary Torgeson, the long-time Cal State 
Northridge softball coach who said this week he is leaving his alma mater to 
take a dean's position at Sacramento City College. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably ready for a change," the Matadors' third baseman said. "That's 
great for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so pleased, however, is Scia Maumausolo, an All-American utility player as 
a freshman in 1993: "I'm really disappointed. He didn't even tell us he was 
leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 So there you have it, opinions based entirely on perspective. It all depends 
on whether the player is coming or going. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and other seniors who have completed their eligibility have accepted 
Torgeson's sudden announcement easily, even though it comes just three weeks 
after he led the Matadors to the brink of a national championship.  
</P>
<P>
 But Maumausolo and those who have remaining eligibility are struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of people coming back, and other people just coming in, were 
looking forward to playing for him," said Maumausolo, who will be a junior next 
season. "Now I don't know what we're going to do. I'm basically clueless to 
what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson, who has been associated with Northridge as a student, football 
player, assistant football coach, head football coach and softball coach for 30 
years, leaves with a school-record 644 coaching victories. 
</P>
<P>
 His softball teams won four NCAA Division II national championships, and the 
Matadors, in only their fourth Division I campaign, last season finished second 
in the nation -- losing, 4-0, to No. 1-ranked Arizona in the championship game 
of the Women's College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Torgeson's departure hit the rumor mill last week at a high school all-star 
game and at an amateur softball tournament in Bakersfield. However, the coach 
dismissed those reports until earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in denial until this morning when I picked up the newspaper," 
Torgeson said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the players would prefer he stayed in denial. Kathy Blake, 
Northridge's top returning pitcher, broke into tears when she heard the news. 
Other returning players are withholding judgment until a coach is hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Sherman, Torgeson's top assistant the past three seasons, is a strong 
candidate. The former Granada Hills High and UCLA catcher has Torgeson's 
support and the backing of several players. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Cunningham, a recruit from Simi Valley High, said that Torgeson told 
her Sherman likely will get the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be OK as long as they don't bring in a new coach," said Lee Ann Taylor, 
an infielder with a year of eligibility. "Janet has been around a long time and 
she knows how things are run. As long as she takes over I think Northridge will 
stay successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, reached by telephone while on vacation in the Sacramento area, said 
she will pursue the job. That the players seem united behind her is not a 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I helped recruit all of the ones coming back," Sherman said. "I feel like I 
have a good relationship with all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will not announce Torgeson's replacement any time soon. His job as 
dean of health, physical education and recreation at Sacramento does not become 
official until the college's board of trustees approves the hire at a July 20 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, for one, has a hard time accepting the idea of her boss actually 
leaving the coaching ranks. "I'll believe it when I see it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one player is gearing up for whatever the future brings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all still have the fire Coach instilled in us," Taylor said. "We have a 
reputation to uphold."

SEEMILLER TO MAKE HIS SENIORS DEBUT IN TABLE TENNIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five-time national table tennis champion Dan Seemiller will compete in his 
first seniors tournament this weekend when the nation's top players converge in 
Laguna Hills for the National Seniors Open at Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
 Seemiller, who also has held men's doubles and mixed doubles titles, became 
eligible for seniors competition June 13 when he turned 40.In the 40-and-over 
singles bracket, which begins at 11 a.m. Sunday, he's likely to meet Rey 
Domingo and David Sakai, the top two finishers from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The top singles player will receive $1,000 of the $10,000 in prize money. The 
winner of the women's singles bracket, which begins at 10:30 a.m. Sunday, will 
win $300, although women can compete in the open bracket. The doubles champion 
will share $400. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament begins at 9 Saturday morning with the draw doubles, in which a 
top-ranked player will pair with a less-accomplished partner. A total of 170 
entered the annual event, which concludes Monday afternoon with the senior 
all-star matches.

<P>
 Seton Hall basketball player Tchaka Shipp has applied to UC Irvine, where he 
plans to play for the Anteaters in the 1995-96 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipp, a 6-foot-8 forward, announced his intentions to transfer to Irvine and 
play for Coach Rod Baker, a former Seton Hall assistant under P.J. 
Carlesimo.Carlesimo was hired as the head coach of the Portland Trailblazers on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrina Long, UCI associate athletic director and senior women's 
administrator, confirmed the school received Shipp's application, adding that 
it won't finish processing the paperwork until late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Under NCAA rules, Shipp, a sophomore, can enroll at Irvine but must sit out 
one season before playing basketball. He will have two years of eligibility 
remaining. 
</P>

SMITH, GRIFFIN NAMED SOUTHLAND CO-ATHLETES OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keith Smith of Newbury Park High and Sara Griffin of Simi Valley High have 
been selected boys' and girls' co-athletes of the year in the Southland by the 
Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who became California's all-time passing leader with 9,971 yards while 
leading the Panthers to a Southern Section Division II championship last fall, 
turned down a football scholarship with Arizona to sign a pro baseball contract 
with the Detroit Tigers.Smith, a shortstop who batted .352, was drafted in the 
fifth round. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, a senior pitcher who will attend Michigan, was 21-2 with 16 shutouts 
and an 0.15 earned-run average. Griffin twice was selected state player of the 
year by Cal-Hi Sports. Griffin's four-year record was 63-6 with 43 shutouts and 
five no-hitters.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 GROUP B at Stanford Stadium, Palo Alto 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil vs. Cameroon 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * TELEVISION: ESPN, Univision. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: This is soccer's version of a game between two fast-break 
teams.Because both will look for every opportunity to attack, the outcome will 
be determined by which is better in the transition from offense to defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team traditionally emphasizes defense, although Brazil has, to the 
derision of its fans, made an effort in recent years to become more balanced. 
Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira seemed to have found the right combination in an 
opening 2-0 victory over Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russia was not the offensive threat that Cameroon figures to be. Also, a 
third starting defender, Ricardo Rocha, was added this week to Brazil's injury 
list. He has a pulled groin muscle. Two other starters, Ricardo Gomes and 
Mozer, were sidelined before the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroon has improved defensively since the 1990 World Cup, when it fouled 
often to compensate for mistakes. The Lions cannot relax for a moment against 
Brazil's sensational strikers, Romario and Bebeto. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: For those who insist on scoring, this is the game to watch. 
Cameroon's players have been haggling with their federation and government over 
money, but they seemed eager after Thursday's practice to test themselves 
against Brazil. "I think this is going to be a very entertaining show," 
Cameroon captain Stephen Tataw said. Perhaps not for him. He is a defender. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: "I give us a 40% chance against Brazil," Cameroon goalkeeper 
Joseph-Antoine Bell said. The Lions will be better than that -- but not by 
much. Brazil 4, Cameroon 2. RANDY HARVEY

CRESCENTA VALLEY PASSES EARLY BASKETBALL TESTS; WATTS GAMES: BEHIND JACOBSON

<P>
 If the Watts Summer Games serve as a testing ground for what lies ahead during 
the regular season, Coach John Goffredo can't wait for the 1994-95 basketball 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In numerous years of competing in the Games, this is only the third time 
Goffredo's Crescenta Valley High team has reached the second weekend of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like it because it helps us find out where we're strong and weak and 
we get to do it against the best teams around," Goffredo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the solid play of Brock Jacobsen, 6-foot-5 All-Southern Section 
forward, and 6-8 center Blake Jacobson, the Falcons have reached this weekend's 
round of 16. They meet Morningside at 11 a.m. Saturday at Washington High. The 
final is Sunday at 2:30 p.m at Compton College. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley started the 128-team tournament with a 64-48 victory over 
Canyon, then defeated Pius X, 57-31. Jacobsen had 29 points against Pius X and 
Jacobson added 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of them are Division I players," Goffredo said. "They give us a one-two 
punch that is pretty tough to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons earned a spot in the quarterfinals by defeating Washington, 57-53, 
in Sunday's third round. Jacobson had 15 points and Jacobsen had 14. Both 
players are being recruited by Division I colleges, according to Goffredo. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine, Texas A&M, Brigham Young University and St. Mary's are among the 
schools that have contacted Goffredo about his two standout players. 
</P>
<P>
 Both must be in top form against Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't run like they do, but we're an excellent shooting team," Goffredo 
said. "Brock is an excellent three-point shooter and that always makes a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Also advancing to the round of 16 is Notre Dame, which will play Manual Arts 
at 9 a.m. Saturday at Inglewood High, and Kennedy, which meets Norwalk at noon 
at Washington High. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame defeated Pilgrim, 44-31, Inglewood, 43-40, and Alhambra, 48-41. 
Kennedy beat J.W. North, 53-47, Antelope Valley, 50-22, and Eagle Rock, 58-53. 
</P>
<P>
 No area teams survived the first weekend in the 64-team girls' basketball 
tournament. Crescenta Valley lasted the longest, losing to Morningside, 50-30, 
in Sunday's third round. 
</P>
<P>
 In seven-on-seven football, Hart has qualified for Sunday's semifinal at 
Compton College. The Indians, making their third consecutive semifinal 
appearance, beat L.A. High, Carson and Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart meets Trabuco Hills at 10:30 a.m. Millikan and Long Beach Poly play in 
the other semifinal. The championship game is at 1:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart quarterback Steve McKeon, in his varsity debut, had solid performances in 
every game. He did so well, in fact, that Hart assistant Dean Herrington said 
the recent transfer Scott Boldvich from Burroughs will not affect McKeon's 
starting role in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Boldvich, a 6-3 senior, passed for 843 yards last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve is our starting quarterback and he will be in every game as long as he 
is healthy," Herrington said. "For a junior and his first time out, he looked 
real good." 
</P>
<P>
 In water polo, Crespi defeated Fontana, 16-15, and will meet Servite in the 
final at Cal State Dominguez Hills on Sunday.

 GROUP E at Citrus Bowl, Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland vs. Mexico 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 9:30 a.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TELEVISION: ESPN, Univision. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Ireland builds its game on running, so heat and humidity may 
sap the players' energy and hurt their performance.Mexico favors short, crisp 
passes, a style more suitable for anticipated temperatures in the mid-90s and 
humidity not much below that. Ireland will try to control the midfield and rely 
on counterattacks for its offense, primarily along the wings. The Irish play a 
physical style, which contrasts with Mexico's reliance on individual skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican Coach Miguel Mejia Baron was unhappy with his team's technique in a 
1-0 loss to Norway in its tournament opener -- especially its failure to speed 
up the game. He has promised lineup changes. Look for playmaker Alberto Garcia 
Aspe to return, after a one-game suspension, and an appearance by veteran 
forward Carlos Hermosillo. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Mexico's defenders were criticized in the team's 1-0 loss, and they 
will be tested again today by Ireland's speed on the outside. Ramon Ramirez, 
who plays the left side, will probably be sent up to join the attack more than 
he was against Norway. Mexico can't afford to fall behind by more than a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Ireland can afford to sit back and play for a tie, but Mexico 
desperately needs a victory. If Ireland scores early, it will simply try to 
hang on. If Mexico scores first, Ireland will have to press to pull even and 
might become vulnerable enough defensively for Mexico to win by two goals.

 GROUP B at Silverdome, Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden vs. Russia 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 4:30 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision, KSCI (Russian). 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Both teams play a tough, European style, clogging the midfield 
and waiting patiently for opportunities.At least that was the scouting report. 
Inexplicably, Russia changed its style in a 2-0 drubbing by Brazil, switching 
to more man-to-man coverage. Swedish Coach Tommy Svensson said he would welcome 
a similar Russian strategy against his team. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden is a team of few stars, forward Martin Dahlin being the exception, and 
prefers to operate in group attacks. Russia, because of mass player defections, 
has lost considerable striking power. Forward Sergei Yuran is its best 
offensive weapon. In many ways, the teams are similar. "There will be a big 
battle in the midfield, that's for sure," said Anders Limpar, a Swedish 
midfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Having not yet played Brazil in the group, Sweden is in no position 
to blow this game. Henrik Larsson, who set up the tying goal against Cameroon, 
did not practice Thursday because of a sore knee but is expected to be ready 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: This game should be played close to the vest, unless the Russians 
figure they have nothing to lose and unveil another attacking scheme. Sweden 
squeezes out a close one, 2-1, and Russia packs. CHRIS DUFRESNE

MAN CONVICTED OF 1ST-DEGREE MURDER OF GIRLFRIEND, 16; COURT: DEFENDANT TOLD 
JURORS THAT WHEN SHE BACKED OUT OF A SUICIDE PACT AND WANTED TO BREAK UP WITH 
HIM, HE WENT 'INSANE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 21-year-old grocery clerk was convicted of first-degree murder Thursday for 
killing his 16-year-old girlfriend during what he describes as a suicide pact 
that went awry when the girl backed out at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors contend that Richard Kenneth Nunno planned the killing because 
he was upset that Melissa Allyson Austin, a high school track and soccer player 
who talked of becoming a television producer, was trying to break up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The relationship was ending and he wasn't going to let her go," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Clyde Vonderahe said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury agreed that Austin had been trying to 
break off the relationship when she was killed. Jury foreman Jack Rumfola said 
the evidence was "fairly clear-cut" in showing that Nunno had planned the 
shooting and that it was not a spur-of-the-moment act. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the decision to find Nunno guilty of first-degree murder -- which 
carries a sentence of 25 years to life -- was difficult to make in a case he 
described as "tragic all around for everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's verdict, which came after 2 1/2 days of deliberation, brought gasps 
and sobs from family and friends of Austin gathered in the courtroom. The trial 
started June 13, exactly one year from the day Austin was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents declined to talk outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Nunno's family expressed shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a cold-blooded murderer," said his sister, Jill Nunno, 19. "It was 
more a crime of passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Austin, a sophomore at Mission Viejo High School, was found shot to death in 
her parents' car behind a Mission Viejo warehouse. Earlier, Nunno -- whom her 
parents had forbidden her to see -- was found miles away in his parents' car 
with a critical, self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest. He had called his 
mother earlier saying he was going to kill himself and left a suicide note 
expressing depression over the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin's parents said they had tried for several months to get their daughter 
to end the relationship, worried that Nunno was obsessed with her.  
</P>
<P>
 But Nunno, of Anaheim, testified Monday that the two had agreed to a suicide 
pact June 13, 1993, and that they would rather die together than allow her 
parents to keep them apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunno told jurors that when Austin tried to back out of the suicide pact at 
the last minute and said she wanted to break up, he went "insane." He said he 
shot her twice then turned the gun on himself, but it misfired. He then drove 
around and ended up in Laguna Beach, where he tried the gun again and shot 
himself in the chest several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it," Nunno told jurors, explaining that he was shocked by 
the rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I shot her," he continued, as Austin's mother broke down in the 
audience, sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunno said he had been severely depressed over the relationship, and that the 
two -- who had met at the Knott's Berry Farm Halloween Haunt -- had tried 
suicide together before, including wading into the ocean off Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyer, Deputy Public Defender E. Robert Goss Jr., said he was surprised 
by the verdict and asserted that the evidence supported something less than 
first-degree murder. He contended throughout the trial that Nunno basically 
"just exploded and shot her in the moment of passion." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunno is scheduled to be sentenced July 15 before Judge Richard L. 
Weatherspoon. His lawyer said he expects Nunno will want to appeal the verdict.

RELATIVES ALLEGE COERCIVE TACTICS AT JUVENILE HALL; CORRECTIONS: THEY SAY 
LATINO YOUTHS WERE ISOLATED TO FORCE COOPERATION IN PROBE OF TWO COUNSELORS. 
CO-DIRECTOR DENIES IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Relatives of three Latino inmates at Juvenile Hall charged administrators 
Thursday with permitting "interrogations and isolation lockups" to force the 
youths' cooperation in an investigation of two counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatives contend that the juveniles' civil rights were violated when 
administrators allegedly coerced them to provide information about alleged 
misconduct against the counselors. One parent also purported racial 
discrimination in the handling of one Latino inmate's medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 relatives and a member of the League of United Latin American 
Citizens, a Latino civil rights organization, also called for a probe of 
Juvenile Hall by an outside agency and said their complaints will be taken to 
the Orange County Grand Jury and the U.S. Civil Rights Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand they have to conduct an investigation," said Jessica Castro of 
Anaheim, whose 14-year-old cousin is inside the hall. "But this isn't an adult 
facility. These are children, and even if they're in Juvenile Hall, they have a 
right not to answer any questions and be protected." 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations were denied by Tom Wright, co-director of Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is not to punish kids," Wright said. "We're here to protect the 
community by having the inmates here in Juvenile Hall. But while they're here, 
we are their substitute parents, and we try to act like that." 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply spoke with a variety of minors because they happened to have seen 
something that we needed to know about. There was no discipline involved when 
they were interviewed," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said none of the young inmates were interrogated or put into isolation 
lockups. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright refused to answer questions about two deputy probation counselors. 
Authorities have said both have been placed on paid administrative leave as a 
result of the investigation, which stems from allegations that counselors 
allowed youths to engage in gang behavior and ignored beatings that were part 
of gang rites. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation focuses on one unit where 22 youths are housed and where 
both of the suspended counselors are assigned. Juvenile Hall contains 17 living 
units and has an overall population of 433 inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's press conference, Castro alleged that during an interview about 
the counselors, a staff member intimidated her 14-year-old cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was intimidated and told to give them anything he had about the two 
counselors," Castro said. When he told them he didn't "have anything," Castro 
said the youth was put in administrative segregation -- isolation -- for three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't violate any rule inside the hall and wasn't written up for any 
violation. Yet, that is how he was treated," Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Espinoza of Anaheim, who said that her 14-year-old son at Juvenile 
Hall is charged with gang rape, said that he was interrogated and afterward 
jotted notes, which were made available to the media at the press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The notes include a passage in which the youth alleges that threatening 
remarks were made when the interviewer turned off the tape recorder. 
</P>
<P>
 The passage read: "You think YA (Youth Authority) is bad, try county. You 
think the little rape you did is bad? You've done a lot of time . . . but think 
county, cause I could send you there if you don't tell me the head guys. The 
administration gave me the power to file on you." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright acknowledged that inmates were interviewed about the counselors and 
other inmates' behavior. But he denied that anyone intimidated juvenile 
inmates. As to many of the parents' allegations, he said, they simply "were not 
true." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have procedures that allow us to place a kid on administrative room 
confinement, and it's their sleeping room," Wright said. "The intent is to stop 
the conduct and discover what happened so we can get some information and learn 
which direction we can go in. There was no interrogation and there was no 
intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Badillo of Westminster criticized the youth facility for allegedly 
ignoring her 17-year-old son's health problems. Badillo said her son was ill 
with a respiratory ailment and had fainting spells. She alleged unfair medical 
treatment based on race, contending that her son wasn't treated but an Anglo 
inmate was sent to a hospital by ambulance after exhibiting similar symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the specific complaints in relation to medical issues," Wright said, "we 
have had ambulances here for Hispanics and Asian kids and everyone else. It 
makes no difference. I have to tell you that as far as racism here (is 
concerned), it doesn't exist."

WASTE, AWAY; THE BURIED BLACK GOO BUBBLES TO THE SURFACE EACH SUMMER IN THIS 
WESTMINSTER TRACT; CREWS IN JULY WILL BEGIN TO SCRAPE IT OUT-FOR GOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By looking, no one would guess that beneath the tranquil back yards of this 
middle class neighborhood an ancient black ooze lies creeping toward the 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Neatly manicured lawns border quiet sidewalks lined with trees. Residents walk 
their dogs and wash new cars parked in fresh-swept driveways. And everywhere, 
the impression is one of quiet life in the sunny ambience of North County. 
</P>
<P>
 Every summer, though, something odd happens as the soil warms in this tract 
near Sowell Avenue and Golden West Street. A strange dark goo seeps up through 
back-yard lawns and cracks in the patios. It exudes a powerful stench, 
residents say, that causes coughing, headaches, sleeplessness, chest pains, 
nausea and breathing difficulty. One resident even attributes the recent loss 
of a lung and regular bouts of severe asthma to the annual appearance of the 
black goo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's miserable," said Gloria Delzeith, 51, a resident since 1978 whose asthma 
requires almost monthly hospitalization and has kept her from working for the 
past two years. "It's black, it's tarry and it stinks like rotten eggs. It's 
just been a mess; it keeps coming out of the ground, and there's nothing you 
can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials plan to do something about it this summer. Starting late in 
July, they will begin a two-year project during which as many as 50 families 
will be relocated for up to four months. Bulldozer operators in breathing masks 
will dig deep into 25 back yards, tearing up swimming pools, patios, fences and 
room additions, which the government later will replace. Then they will remove 
45,000 cubic yards of the buried petroleum residue that officials say makes 
this one of the worst hazardous waste sites in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have moved quickly on this," said Dick Vesperman, project manager for the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which is overseeing the $15-million 
cleanup. "Not all hazardous sites are in residential areas." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, this one wasn't heavily residential either in 1936 when, according to 
historical records gathered by the EPA, the Long Beach-based Ralph Gray 
Trucking Co. dumped petroleum waste products of unknown origin into four open 
pits in a field the company owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous complaints to health officials and the Westminster Chamber of 
Commerce landed the matter in court. On Dec. 2, 1936, the company's owner, 
Ralph Gray, was convicted of maintaining a public nuisance, a misdemeanor, and 
ordered to pay a $100 fine and to eliminate the problem within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently that never happened. Four years later a county health inspector was 
responding to further complaints with predictions that, left alone, the mess 
would seep away "within a short time." And in 1958 a developer, intent on 
building a housing tract unmarred by the unsightly pits, moved the hazardous 
material into two long trenches buried 18 feet beneath the back yards of 25 of 
the houses he was building. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently he felt he could do better with it underground," Vesperman said. 
"He just put dirt over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials say Gray has since died, they can't find any descendants, 
and the trucking company no longer exists. Nor can they find the developer of 
the tract. 
</P>
<P>
 So two years ago, the site was added to the National Priorities List of 
Superfund sites, thus qualifying it for the federally funded cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 That project will take place in two phases. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Vesperman said, about half of those affected will be temporarily 
moved at government expense to nearby hotels, rented houses or the homes of 
relatives and friends. The families will include 12 whose back yards are to be 
excavated as well as their nearest neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 The waste will be taken to an as yet undetermined hazardous waste disposal 
site in California. And later, Vesperman said, government workers will 
reconstruct the torn-up back yards with landscaping and swimming pools, patios 
and room additions. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials have set up headquarters in one of the affected houses; a 
three-bedroom rental which, like other homes in the neighborhood, would 
probably sell for $150,000 to $200,000 if banks were willing to finance the 
sale -- which none are, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's second phase will occur next summer when the same thing will be 
done to the remaining affected back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The ethnically diverse community, where 12 languages are spoken, has "been 
very supportive," Vesperman said. "It's really a cooperative effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some residents aren't pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Nguyen, a 23-year-old law student who has lived here with his mother for 
10 years, said he has never seen evidence of the black ooze.  
</P>
<P>
 "I never gave it a thought," he said. "This is an inconvenience; we don't want 
to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, say that the project couldn't happen a moment too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Torres, a sheet metal worker who has lived here for 34 years, said that 
four members of his family already suffer from asthma, which he attributes to 
the waste. "It's great that they're doing it," he said. "We'll enjoy being in a 
different location for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And Delzeith, whose family expects to spend much of the summer living at a 
nearby Marriott hotel, said that while the cleanup may be too late to 
significantly improve her own health, she hopes that it will help maintain the 
health of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken them a long time," said the former office supervisor, who had a 
lung removed last year because of what she describes as internal "blistering." 
While no medical evidence exists directly linking her condition to the waste, 
Delzeith said, she is convinced that it stems from years of breathing the 
material's fumes.  
</P>
<P>
 "They should have done this a long time ago," she said, "but I'll be glad when 
it's all cleared out." 
</P>
<P>
 While officials say they have detected no statistically significant increase 
in the incidence of disease among residents of the tract, they acknowledge that 
long-term exposure to some of the chemicals contained in it, particularly 
sulfur dioxide, can exacerbate pre-existing upper-respiratory conditions, 
including asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a chemical soup down there," said Marilyn C. Underwood, a 
toxicologist with the state health department who is familiar with the site. 
"It's a health hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 Vesperman concurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk assessments we've done have indicated that there is some potential 
long-term health threats from continued exposure," he said. While the material 
is relatively harmless while buried in the ground, he added, there is some 
danger when it seeps to the surface during hot summers or because of 
excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the major hurdles in the project, officials say, is finding places 
where relocated residents can have their pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a problem," said Fraser Felter, the agency's community relations 
coordinator. "We've got people with tortoises, 250 koi, rabbits, pheasants, 
chickens, birds, dogs and cats. Just a little thing like pets can really 
complicate matters." 
</P>
<P>
 While government officials tackle that, some residents have begun packing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to it," Delzeith said of the planned move. "We're leaving 
everything except food, clothes and important papers. Some other stuff we'll 
put in storage." 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Haynes, 73, said spending four months away from her home of 16 years 
"will be kind of fun. I don't get out much any more; this will be something 
different." Back-Yard Cleanup In a few weeks, the federal Environmental 
Protection Agency will begin to excavate and remove toxic oil refinery waste 
buried in a Westminster housing tract. The waste wil go to an authorized 
disposal site. * Evaluating Waste Sites Surface leaks Soil samples with 
hazardous waste: Small cores of soil establish locations and toxicity. Air 
monitoring wells: Measure noxious fumes and hazardous emissions during 
excavation process. * Excavation After fences, patios, pools and some rooms are 
removed, backhoes load hazardous material on trucks. When excavation is 
complete, lots will be regraded and pools, patios, fences and rooms rebuilt. * 
Hauling Hazardous Waste Under federal safety guidelines, dump trucks hauling 
hazardous waste must have bed lined with thick, durable plastic sheeting. Waste 
is loaded into bed, sprayed with a foamy moisture sealant and battened under. * 
Original disposal pits: Oil-refining materials buried at site in 1936. Area to 
be cleaned in 1995. Area to be cleaned in 1994 * Topsoil (surface-3 feet) 
Hazardous waste (3-18 feet) Security fencing surrounds cleanup area; other 
security measures include increased police patrols and additional street 
lighting. Water-based misting system, woven into security fence, keeps fumes 
and dust inside excavation area. Orange County Flood Channel Source:

 Five candidates have made the final cut for president of Irvine Valley 
College, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 They face mid-July interviews for the president's job, said Saddleback 
Community College District spokeswoman Diane Riopka. The person chosen will 
succeed Anna L. McFarlin, who has been president since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarlin announced her retirement March 14 and will leave in August, Riopka 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-member panel of faculty, administrators and staff from Irvine Valley and 
Saddleback colleges narrowed the finalists to P. Carter Doran, Marchelle S. 
Fox, Daniel L. Larios, Antonia Darlene Pacheco and Paul D. Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 Doran is assistant superintendent and vice president for instruction and 
student services at College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita. He was also Rancho 
Santiago College's vice chancellor of academic affairs for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Doran studied at Yale University, Occidental College and Fuller Theological 
Seminary and has a doctorate from UCLA, Riopka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is dean for institutional advancement at San Diego City College, where she 
has also served as dean of instruction and assistant to the president. She 
earned degrees from San Diego State University, Pacific Oaks College and 
University of Texas at Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 Larios is dean of instruction at Tillamook Bay Community College in Oregon. He 
was dean of the technology and applied science division at Saddleback College 
before moving to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied at Cal State Fresno, Cal State Bakersfield and Nova University, 
Riopka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacheco, vice president for instruction at Moorpark College since 1988, also 
served as the college's dean of general and transfer education and director of 
the social sciences division. 
</P>
<P>
 His alma maters include Northern Colorado State University and Colorado State 
University, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker is an independent higher education consultant. He has been president of 
both Yavapai College in Arizona and Everett Community College in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied at Arizona State University and West Chester University in 
Pennsylvania, Riopka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to have the new president on the job by mid-August, she said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LATINO JEWS TO LEARN TO HALT HATE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latino Jews will meet in Orange County this weekend to learn how to prevent 
and respond to acts of anti-Semitism and other hate crimes that occur in 
schools, workplaces and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking will be Jonathan Bernstein, director of the Anti-Defamation League of 
Orange County; and Sonia Adelman, a trainer with the ADL's "A World of 
Difference" anti-prejudice program. Spanish translation will be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The public forum was prompted by a 141% rise in reported acts of anti-Semitism 
in Orange County this year, said organizer Bruno Ledwin, an ADL board member. 
The event is also an outreach to the county's Latino Jews, many of whom came 
from "a hostile environment where anti-Semitism runs very rampant," Ledwin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that we, as a group, are the scapegoats for many of the 
socioeconomic problems" in Latin America, said Ledwin, 54, who immigrated to 
the United States from Buenos Aires 30 years ago. Many Jews from Argentina, 
Mexico, Cuba and other Latin-American countries tend to keep quiet about abuses 
they suffer, according to Ledwin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot allow this kind of bigotry and racism anymore," he said. This is 
especially important for Orange County's estimated 1,500 Latino Jews, because 
they are "a minority within a minority" and therefore potential targets of 
immigrant bashing and anti-Semitic acts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get it from both sides," said ADL director Bernstein. To illustrate his 
point, Bernstein pulled out a crudely-produced flyer that slurs both Jews and 
Hispanics. These and similar flyers, containing a phone number for the White 
Aryan Resistance hate group, have been circulated at Orange County schools in 
an attempt to recruit racists, "especially skinheads," Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no perfect response to these sort of things," he said, but it is 
vital that acts of hatred are not ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes down to what you're comfortable with," said Bernstein. Sometimes 
"getting up and walking out of a room is enough of a response," he said. 
Sometimes a formal complaint letter or an organized community response is 
appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 Acts of anti-Semitism and other hate crimes should be reported to the ADL and 
the police, according to Bernstein, who said law enforcement agencies are 
"taking these incidents more seriously now." 
</P>
<P>
 Police can help victims overcome feelings of isolation and vulnerability by 
letting them know there is a support network, Bernstein said. And when hate 
crimes are reported, police can search for patterns and make arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "In California, fortunately, we have some of the strongest hate crime laws," 
Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with responding to acts of hatred, the ADL does work to prevent such 
incidents. One example is "A World of Difference," an eight-hour interactive 
workshop attended by 10,000 Orange County schoolteachers so far. The workshop 
is designed to combat prejudice and promote intergroup understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein points out that the ADL, which was founded in 1913, is "very much 
involved in non-Jewish issues," such as fighting prejudice against Hispanics, 
blacks and other minorities. The primary objective, he said, "is to not simply 
teach tolerance of each other, but to celebrate our diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Anti-Semitism and Hate Crimes in Orange County" forum is scheduled for 7 
to 9 p.m. Saturday at the Jewish Community Center of Orange County, 250 E. 
Baker St., Costa Mesa. The cost is $3. For more information, call (714) 
751-0608.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; HOUSE FIRE CAUSED BY TOSSED CIGARETTE 
</P>

<P>
 A discarded cigarette tossed on to the wood-shingled roof of a house caused a 
fire that resulted in an estimated $200,000 in damage, fire officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out about 3:45 p.m. Wednesday afternoon in the 4300 block of 
Mahogany Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 Flames were about 20 feet high when firefighters arrived, Orange County Fire 
Department spokeswoman Maria Sabol said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A teen-ager was home and had several friends over," Sabol said. "Someone 
tossed a cigarette, which landed on the roof and started a fire that destroyed 
or damaged about 75% of it," Sabol said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 35 firefighters about 20 minutes to bring the blaze under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately $150,000 of the estimated damage is to the structure, with about 
$50,000 of its contents also destroyed, Sabol said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were able to salvage quite a bit of stuff but there is significant smoke 
and heat damage," Sabol said. "Firefighters were able to stop the fire before 
it went into the garage area." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were concerned about the fire spreading to other homes because 
several nearby houses also have wood-shingled roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 But no other residences were damaged by the fire and there were no injuries, 
Sabol said. GREG HERNANDEZ

<P>
 Theodore (Bob) Robins Jr. learned to love cars early in life. 
</P>
<P>
 During school vacations, he worked at his father's landmark Ford dealership, 
which opened in the 1920s as an auto repair shop next to the Balboa Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 65, Robins runs the 10-acre Theodore Robins Ford complex on Harbor 
Boulevard in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 He was recently named Citizen of the Year by the Newport Harbor Chamber of 
Commerce. In presenting him with the award, chamber officials recognized Robins 
for his 40 years as a business leader and longtime volunteer for a variety of 
charity organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins said that cars have been a central part of his life for as long as he 
can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had a love for automobiles, and I was raised in the right family 
to enjoy that," he said. "It was a perfect tie-in for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Robins grew up in Newport Beach and attended local schools. After graduating 
from Loyola Marymount University in the 1950s, he began working full time for 
his father's growing dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 He holds fond memories for the cars of that era, such as the sporty 1955-57 
Thunderbird coupes and the powerful Fairlane with its supercharged engine. As a 
young man, he even drag-raced cars at a track near what is today John Wayne 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1960s, the dealership moved from its cramped quarters in Newport 
Beach to a site on Harbor Boulevard's auto row. Robins became head of the 
company in the mid-1970s after his father died. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping with family tradition, Robins' two sons now work at the dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins is a longtime member of several local business groups, and is past 
president of the Southern California Motor Car Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also past president of the Newport Harbor Exchange Club and has worked 
with Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian's 552 Club, the YMCA and the 
Assistance League of Newport Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was very active in the community. He held the strong belief that you 
should give something back to the community you make your livelihood in," 
Robins said. "That certainly makes a lot of sense to me." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; 4 SCHOOLS TO RECEIVE ENERGY-SAVING WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four schools will receive $800,000 worth of new lighting, heating and 
air-conditioning equipment under an energy savings program sponsored by 
Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 The retrofitting is expected to be completed when students return to College 
Park, El Camino Real, Turtle Rock and Vista Verde elementary schools in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison officials said the program will reduce the schools' energy bills by 
about 40% annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort will include replacing the old fluorescent tubes now used at the 
schools with high-intensity discharge and high-pressure sodium lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting will be completed in classrooms as well as in administrative 
offices and cafeterias. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Unified School District officials said they are pleased with the 
arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irvine was looking to do something like this, but we did not have the funds 
to make the capital investment for energy savings," said Don Babitz, director 
of maintenance and operations for the district. "This gets us over the hurdle 
of capital investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison will finance all the modifications up front. Babitz said that Edison 
will receive most of the savings from the energy-efficient equipment until the 
$800,000 is paid off.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then we will see a dramatic drop in our energy bill," he said. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; RESIDENTS OPPOSE HOME FOR RETARDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of a Travis Ranch neighborhood are protesting plans to open a 
residential facility in their community for six adults with severe mental 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 About three dozen residents asked the City Council at Tuesday night's meeting 
to explore ways to prevent the home from opening at 20701 Vista del Sol. 
</P>
<P>
 "These adults are classified as the most severely disturbed, exhibiting 
inappropriate behavior and feelings," said Jameson Garrett, whose home is near 
the planned facility. "Who in their right mind would let children play near 
such adults?" 
</P>
<P>
 The home would be operated by Bob Valenzuela, who would accept adults 
considered profoundly mentally retarded and requiring extensive supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Taylor, community services planner for the Development Disabilities 
Center, a nonprofit agency that oversees the operation of group homes in Orange 
County, said fears that children and other residents will be harmed by those 
living in group homes are largely unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 210 group homes in the county, and I have never heard any complaints 
once they went in," Taylor said. "People's fears are greater than the reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said the six residents in the home would be supervised by three 
caretakers during normal waking hours and by one staff member at night. 
</P>
<P>
 While the City Council was sympathetic to the residents' concerns, city 
officials say there is nothing they can do to prevent the home from opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Hawthorne of the state Department of Social Services, which licenses 
operators of group homes, said state law preempts the city's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything for six adults or less in a house in a residential neighborhood is 
considered to be a residential property just like any other residence," 
Hawthorne said. "Cities cannot place any restriction on adult residential 
facilities that they don't place on other residential use." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett and other residents protesting the facility say they are upset that 
they were not notified by the home's operator or by the various licensing 
agencies involved in approving such facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents say they have a number of concerns. "Who assumes responsibility 
for these individuals if they damage property or cause harm (to residents)? 
What is required of care-givers? How should we respond if we encounter these 
individuals?" Garrett asked. 
</P>
<P>
 For-profit adult residential facilities are regulated by the state, although 
the homes are private business. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state does set requirements for operators, the staff need not 
meet any educational requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Taylor, state regulations govern the staffing requirements and 
who may live there. 
</P>
<P>
 The operator of the Vista del Sol facility is seeking a level 4-G designation, 
one of the most stringent. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said that, typically, residents in a 4-G facility are moderately to 
profoundly mentally retarded, need intense supervision and "may also have 
behavior episodes requiring treatment and intervention." 
</P>
<P>
 Such episodes may include the residents injuring themselves or eating 
inappropriate items, Taylor said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY TO WRITE OFF $2.5 MILLION IN DEBTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has decided to write off nearly $2.5 million in bad debts 
that officials in several city departments have been unable to collect. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the losses were incurred because residents and businesses have gone 
bankrupt or could not be located by the city to seek payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to collect when that happens," said City Manager James D. Ruth, 
before the council unanimously agreed Tuesday to absorb the bad debts. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the debts, about $1.7 million, was owed to the city-owned 
utilities departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the institution of more stringent credit and collection policies . . 
. the department has experienced a net increase of $433,107 in the bad debt 
write-off" in the last year, a report by Public Utilities General Manager 
Edward K. Aghjayan stated. 
</P>
<P>
 Aghjayan said his department has expanded its deposit policy on residents to 
better absorb future losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Other departments that suffered losses were Anaheim Stadium, with $15,477, the 
Anaheim Convention Center, with $2,455 in uncollectible tenant accounts, and 
the city paramedics, with $673,510 in uncollectible services.MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CLUBS' PLAN TO MERGE DRAWS OPPOSITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About two dozen demonstrators picketed a board meeting of the Boys and Girls 
Club of Garden Grove Thursday to protest the club's imminent merger with the 
Girls Club of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Children and their parents waved signs reading "We Are the Future" and "Kids 
Are People Too," chanting as board members drove down Larson Avenue on their 
way to the meeting at the Lions Club headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Protest organizer Roxanne Padilla said parents are worried that fees will go 
up after the merger and that many of them will not be able to afford to send 
their children to the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want us out of the streets and out of trouble," said Justin Esquivel, 
17, one of the protesters. "But we can't come here anymore. My mom can't afford 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Halberstadt, executive director of the Girls Club of Garden Grove for the 
past 20 years, said there are no plans to increase fees now, but acknowledged 
that fees could rise if costs go up. 
</P>
<P>
 Board director Bruce Beauchamp said that parents should not rush to judge the 
merits of the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they give it a chance, instead of fighting it every step of the way, they 
will find out that the whole effort is to improve services to the community," 
Beauchamp said. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest had no effect on the merger plans. The two organizations, which 
provide recreational and other services to youngsters here and in neighboring 
cities, are scheduled to merge July 1, said Bob Garrett, president of the Boys 
and Girls Club of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 The new organization will be called Girls and Boys Clubs of Garden Grove Inc. 
and will be run by a 34-member board of directors made up of former directors 
of the two organizations. The new board will meet for the first time Thursday, 
Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys and Girls Club currently offers recreational programs at its Larson 
Avenue headquarters. The Girls Club operates five child-care centers. After the 
merger, the new club will serve about 700 children ages 5 to 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Halberstadt, who will serve as executive director of the new club, said the 
merger was a logical move aimed at providing expanded services to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were beginning to discover we were duplicating some services and competing 
for the tight charitable dollars in our community," Halberstadt said. "The 
motivating factor was we realized we could do so much more if we worked 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Merger talks between the two groups started more than a year ago, Halberstadt 
said. In January, directors from both sides approved the merger, and set July 1 
to complete the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla and other parents said they were never consulted about the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're protesting because of the lack of respect toward the parents and club 
members by the board of directors," Padilla said.BERT ELJERA

 Because a moratorium on building new homes on certain lots in the city has 
caused inconvenience and financial hardship for some property owners, some 
homes have been exempted from the building ban. 
</P>
<P>
 The council enacted a 45-day moratorium earlier this month on so-called 
"in-fill lots" -- vacant land zoned for single-family housing that is next to 
existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The moratorium was a result of complaints made by Huntington Seacliff 
residents concerned about new homes being built in their area that are taller 
and larger than existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A new ordinance is expected to be adopted by the council July 5 to ensure 
compatibility and safeguard privacy against visual intrusion when new homes are 
built next to existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the council this week exempted single-family homes from the 
moratorium provided they are: 
</P>
<P>
 * No more than 25 feet in height. 
</P>
<P>
 * At least 50 feet from an existing single-family home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Part of a new subdivision of custom homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Built to the same zoning standards as neighboring homes. 
</P>
<P>
 All new homes would be reviewed to determine compliance with design and zoning 
guidelines, Planning Director Howard Zelefsky said.  
</P>
<P>
 Zelefsky said 85 building permits for new homes are pending. However, many of 
the lots are separated from existing homes by streets, alleys or public 
easements. Other homes are part of a larger tract that will be next to existing 
tracts of homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Zelefsky said the city staff is determining how many homes would qualify for 
the exemption.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; SERVICE HOURS WORTH MANY STUDENTS' TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amanda Diamond needed 20 hours of community service to earn her diploma 
Thursday night. Instead, she accumulated 1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 One of 157 students scheduled to graduate from Laguna Beach High School, the 
college-bound senior said she just continued volunteering because it felt so 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed it, I enjoyed it a lot," Diamond said. "The feeling you get after 
doing it, that makes you go back." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Laguna Beach Unified School District became the first in the 
county to require that high school students perform 10 hours of community 
service each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since this is the second year the requirement has been in effect, 1994 
graduates were required to prove they had worked 20 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Program coordinator Chris Krach said Thursday that the last student was 
completing his service that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's our last one, and he's worked the last two days," she said. "I'm so 
excited. . . . They've all done it." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers served in a variety of ways. They worked in thrift shops, 
volunteered at the Laguna Beach Community Clinic and umpired Little League 
games. Many went beyond the call of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our students had more than the 20 hours, and I find that real 
encouraging," Krach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond, who was honored for her efforts by the school board Tuesday, served 
in myriad arenas, from nursing homes to an elementary school where the children 
were unable to speak English. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you teach a kid how to count to 10 who didn't know the numbers at all, 
that's like the greatest feeling," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After some initial grumbling by students last year and a hectic scramble to 
meet 1993 requirements, Krach said this year's students were more receptive to 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, she said, the process went more smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in 100% better shape this year than last," she said. "I foresee the 
future as this just being something the students do and there's not going to be 
any resistance and, hopefully, they're going to be some students like Amanda 
who get into it and really get the benefit from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond says she gained some new insights during her hours as a community 
volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you see that not everyone has everything handed to them," she said. 
"I think it makes you realize there are people out there who need help. And 
every little thing you do (is appreciated). Just by going by and saying 'hi' to 
someone who's been in a bedroom all day in a nursing home brightens their day." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Saddleback Valley Unified School District also adopted a 
community service graduation requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the appeal of two Pennsylvania 
students who said that requiring them to perform unpaid community service to 
graduate from high school amounted to slavery. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; FORMER BOYFRIEND IS SUSPECT IN 2 SLAYINGS 
</P>

 The former boyfriend of a slain cocktail waitress is being sought in 
connection with the murders of the woman and her new boyfriend, who were found 
shot to death inside the woman's apartment earlier this week, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillermo Villanueva Aguilar, known locally as Guillermo Ochoa, was reportedly 
seen near the woman's apartment shortly before the shootings, which police 
believe occurred early Sunday morning, said Lt. Robert Helton. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was upset about the break-up of their relationship and is alleged to have 
been violent," Helton said of the 33-year-old suspect, whom authorities have 
been trying to question all week. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, 23-year-old Maria Laura Suarez and 31-year-old Crisanto Flores, 
were discovered Monday afternoon, about 36 hours after the shootings are 
believed to have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors in the three-story apartment complex, in the 1100 block of West 
Civic Center Drive, said this week that Suarez and Flores began dating about a 
month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar "was jealous," said neighbor Max Mendez. "I heard them fighting a 
couple of times. She told me she was afraid, but she never thought anything 
would really happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say Suarez had kicked Aguilar out of the apartment two months ago 
after a violent argument. The woman told several people in the complex that 
Aguilar had tried to choke her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he tried to choke her, she kicked him out," said Art Bautista, assistant 
manager of the complex. "She came downstairs crying and told us that he beat 
her up. She had marks on her neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and neighbors said Aguilar had been trying to reconcile with Suarez. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to get her to come back," Bautista said. "She would refuse to 
talk to him. He would wait outside of her door. He knew her schedule and would 
go to her work. It was like he was stalking her." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar is described as Latino, with black hair and brown eyes. He is 5-foot-7 
and weighs 150 pounds, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not know his whereabouts," Helton said. "We are in the process of 
obtaining an arrest warrant for him alleging two counts of murder." GREG

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CITY OKS PETITION TO INSTALL NEW LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a petition by residents on Hoggan Avenue to 
install new street lights over a 1 1/2-block area of the neighborhood that has 
been dark for a number of years. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to approve the proposal, which calls for 
property owners to pay for the cost of installing the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Robert F. Dinsen dissented, because he said the estimated $3,700 
cost of installing the lights could have been cheaper if the city had hired a 
private contractor to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison Co., which will install the lights, will be 
responsible for their maintenance, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for the residents," City Manager George Tindall said. "We couldn't 
do it any less expensive than the Edison Co. could." 
</P>
<P>
 Tindall said that if the city were to install the lights and pay for their 
maintenance, including assuming liability, the cost could be more than $9,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of 22 parcels in the area will see an increase in their lighting 
and landscaping assessment fees, which are included on property tax bills. 
Owners will pay $171 for the 1994-95 fiscal year. Twenty-one property owners 
currently pay about $20 for landscaping and lighting. One owner pays more 
because he has multifamily units on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1996, Tindall said, the property owners would be paying $53 a year, the 
amount other homeowners on Hoggan Avenue are currently paying. 
</P>
<P>
 In a public hearing before the council vote, no one from Hoggan Avenue spoke 
for or against the lighting project. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Patapoff, the city's engineering services manager, said the lights would 
be installed in "six to eight months." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the residents had asked the council to install the street lights about 
a year ago.BERT ELJERA

TB REGIMEN ORDERED FOR 79 AT LA QUINTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Completing their investigation just before La Quinta High School closes for 
the summer, county health officials said Thursday they have prescribed 
treatment for 79 of the 105 students whose skin tests for tuberculosis earlier 
this month were positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional information is needed to decide how to treat the 26 other students 
and eight staff members who tested positive, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these students or staff members has active tuberculosis, but all of 
them harbor bacteria in their bodies that could trigger the disease later. The 
purpose of the screening at La Quinta was to decide which of several strains of 
TB was responsible for individual infections. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials said with that knowledge they could match infected 
students with the drug regimen that would best reduce their chances of 
developing active TB. Without taking preventive drugs, there is a 10% chance 
that the disease will develop in a student's lifetime, with half that 
probability in the first two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two years 17 students at La Quinta have been treated for active 
TB. Ten of the contagious cases were found during a voluntary campuswide 
screening last September. However, health officials say this most recent 
screening found no students who were contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 Retesting of the entire 1,300-member student body was mandated by the county 
after one of the students, Debi French, who was diagnosed with active TB last 
spring, suffered a relapse of the disease with a much more drug-resistant 
strain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, the county public health officer, said that through 150 
hours of interviews with students last week, in which state and federal 
epidemiology experts lent a hand, only five of the students were discovered to 
have been in close contact with French. 
</P>
<P>
 Those students, 18 other students and two staff members who were close 
contacts of French and earlier tested positive have been prescribed a 12-month 
regimen of two drugs proven to be effective in treating multi-drug-resistant TB 
but with no record of preventing the disease.

RIGHTS CLAIM FILED FOR BOY SCHOOL DISTRICT TRIED TO OUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAIME ABDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Peters, father of the 6-year-old boy whose school district went to court 
to oust him from his mainstream kindergarten class because of allegedly violent 
behavior, said Thursday that he has filed a federal civil rights claim alleging 
that school administrators are harassing his child. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters said he filed the complaint Wednesday with the U.S. Department of 
Education's Office of Civil Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Palomino, regional director for the civil rights office in San 
Francisco, said he would not be able to verify receipt of the complaint for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters declined Thursday to detail the allegations made in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View School District officials filed suit in Superior Court on May 25, 
asking a judge to bar Peters' son Jimmy from attending the mainstream 
kindergarten class at Circle View Elementary School. The suit alleged that 
Jimmy hit his teachers, bit other students and picked up a chair with the 
intention of throwing it at another student. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state law, the district can move a special education student from 
a mainstream classroom only with a parent's permission or a court order. Peters 
has refused permission. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters has denied the allegations against his son, calling them "out and out 
lies." 
</P>
<P>
 The case was transferred to federal court and in a June 8 ruling, U.S. 
District Judge Matthew Byrne ordered the school district to allow Jimmy back 
into his classroom. Byrne concluded that school officials did not prove Jimmy 
was a danger to himself or others. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a meeting last week at which Peters and school officials agreed to a 
program of one-on-one summer school lessons for Jimmy at Circle View, Peters 
said he decided that administrators were attempting to circumvent Byrne's 
ruling.

MAN FACES LEGAL FEES IN MARITAL FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim banker who convinced a jury that his former wife duped him by 
concealing her lack of sexual passion, but later lost the case on appeal, must 
pay his ex-wife more than $89,000 in attorney's fees, a Superior Court judge 
ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The awarding of money to Bonnette Askew is the latest twist in a unique fraud 
case that began in 1992 when Ronald Askew sued his former wife of 11 years, 
said Bonnette Askew's defense attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Askew accused his former wife of fraud after she admitted during 
marriage counseling that she had hidden the fact that she felt no physical 
attraction for him before or during their marriage. He told the jury that he 
never would have married her or made her joint owner of four properties if he 
had known she considered him physically undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a Superior Court jury sided with Ronald Askew, ordering his ex-wife 
to give up her share of the jointly owned parcels of property valued at 
$242,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case was reversed on appeal in February when the 4th District Court of 
Appeal ruled that such matters are "best left to advice columnists than to 
judges and juries." The appeals court also raised concerns that such lawsuits 
could have played havoc with California's no-fault divorce system. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals panel said Bonnette Askew was entitled to compensation for her 
costs in defending herself in the civil lawsuit and referred the case back to 
Superior Court to determine the amount.  
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert D. Monarch awarded the fees Thursday, Bonnette 
Askew's lawyer, Richard W. Millar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Albert M. Graham Jr., Ronald Askew's trial attorney, could not be 
reached for comment late Thursday.

TWO GIRLS INJURED WHEN HIT BY CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Anaheim girls were struck by a car, one suffering critical injuries, on 
Magnolia Avenue about 3 p.m. Thursday, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sophan Kes, 14, and Thevy Kes, 7, had walked halfway across the street, 
heading east, when a large northbound truck stopped to let them pass, Sgt. Ed 
Dougherty said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the girls passed the truck and stepped into the next lane, he said, a 
car hit both of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Dougherty said it did not appear that the driver of the car had committed any 
traffic violation. She did not see the two girls, police said, until they 
stepped into her path. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were treated by Anaheim Fire Department paramedics and taken to UCI 
Medical Center in Orange.

CAR IN DUMBO RIDE AT DISNEYLAND LOOSENS FROM BEAM AND TIPS, INJURING WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old woman received minor injuries Thursday when a car in the 
Dumbo-the-Flying-Elephant ride at Disneyland apparently came loose from its 
supporting arm and abruptly tipped, scraping against the concrete sidewalk as 
it came to a stop, park officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, whose name was not disclosed, was treated at the park for arm 
scrapes.She was riding in the car with a man and a child when the accident 
occurred about 1 p.m., park spokesman John McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride was immediately shut down for the afternoon as supervisors sought the 
cause of the accident, which McClintock said was undetermined. 
</P>
<P>
 A ride operator at the scene said that the car apparently came loose from the 
metal beam attaching it to the central axis. A safety cable prevented the car 
from breaking away, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride, named for the cheerful elephant of Disney cartoon fame, is one of 
the Magic Kingdom's original rides. Park-goers sit in the fiberglass elephant 
cars, restrained by a leather strap, and spin like a merry-go-round while 
operating a lever that allows them to climb or descend. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of the simpler rides in an amusement park filled with sophisticated 
roller coasters and robotic figures. But the ride has had problems before.

NO PATH BEATEN TO SOCCER VICTORS' DOOR; SPORT: ALL IS SERENE AT U.S. TEAM'S 
DANA POINT HOTEL, WHERE AN EX-FOOTBALL COACH MAKES BIGGER SPLASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a 44-year wait, you'd think there would be a toast, a party, something.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, many of the guests at the Dana Point Resort, where the U.S. soccer 
team is staying for the World Cup and sports editors are having a convention, 
had no idea who the guys sporting the crisp new U.S.A. hats were, let alone 
what they had done. 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case somebody drop-kicked you Wednesday night and you missed it: the 
U.S. squad notched the biggest victory in American soccer in nearly half a 
century, dropping Colombia, 2-1. You've heard of the Miracle on Ice in the '80 
Olympics and the Miracle Mets of '69 -- well, this was the Miracle on Grass. 
But you could hardly tell that Thursday -- The Day After -- in and around the 
team's hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the excitement and fans, there might as well have been a convention of 
Maytag repairmen in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Lima, banquet waiter: "Well, no, it's been pretty quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet? There would be more noise at a meeting of mimes. "Well, maybe nobody 
knows they're here," Lima sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stephan Kachani, a hotel valet parking attendant, said he's not sure people 
could recognize a U.S. World Cup soccer player even if they knew the team was 
here. After all, they're not like professional basketball players or football 
players, he said. "They're all so . . . so . . . tiny," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was that only 24 hours after what was arguably the greatest day in 
U.S. soccer history, team member Ernie Stewart, he of the game-clinching goal, 
did his laundry, teammate Paul Caligiuri slept in and former Dallas Cowboys 
football coach Jimmy Johnson, at the Dana Point Resort to address a gathering 
of the Associated Press Sports Editors, got a bigger police escort than the 
entire U.S. soccer squad. 
</P>
<P>
 As if there needed to be any more evidence that soccer, favorite sport of the 
rest of the civilized world, has yet to catch on in this country. Aside from 
the throng of reporters who interviewed the players Thursday afternoon at the 
hotel, it's a good bet that the U.S. soccer team was bigger news just about 
anywhere else in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard at the stately hotel's front desk near where the players were being 
interviewed by reporters from France, the Netherlands and points beyond: 
</P>
<P>
 Woman 1: "What's going on here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Woman 2: "The U.S. soccer team is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Woman 1: "You're kidding." Pause. "Did you know they had a shuttle that goes 
to the hotel beauty parlor?" 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Schroeder of San Diego, who was attending a credit union meeting at the 
hotel, heard the U.S. soccer team was in the next room. Did he know what any of 
them looked like? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really," he said. "They don't really stand out. They're not 6-foot-9 or 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Schmidt of Rancho Santa Margarita, who was at a park just down the 
knoll from the hotel: "You'd think they'd be mobbed." 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think. But then again. . . . Schmidt thought it was bigger news that 
Johnson, the football coach, was at the hotel. "He came in a helicopter and had 
probably five or six police cars as an escort," she observed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer has just never been as popular a sport here," she said, almost 
apologizing. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the players seemed to be a patient, forgiving lot. If they 
play, they seem to think, the fans will come . . . eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been asked so many questions over the past couple of months . . . 
about the future of soccer. I can't worry about that," said Alexi Lalas, a 
mop-headed, 25-year-old rock guitar player turned elite defender. "I don't care 
if two people tune in to the game Sunday," he shrugged, referring to the 
upcoming contest against the Romanian team, which is also staying in Orange 
County. "We're still going to play in the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, the striker who scored what ended up being the game-winning goal 
Wednesday, said America's young people have a case of soccer fever, so it's 
only a matter of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should look at it happening next year or the year after 
that. It's just not realistic," said Stewart, who said he took the opportunity 
to "do laundry" Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Caligiuri, who did his interviews with his 4-year-old daughter, Ashley, 
crawling on his lap: "I wasn't really aware of the World Cup until I was 10, 
11, 12 years old." He said it was enough to see the 90,000-plus fans chanting 
"U-S-A" at Wednesday's contest and see motorists paint their cars with the 
improbable outcome of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, there is hope that soccer will gain a toehold, so to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Before discovering that the U.S. squad's first team wasn't practicing at the 
Mission Viejo training facility Thursday morning, about 100 people had lined 
the grassy hills above the soccer fields to get a glimpse of their heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's "win was the best, I'm totally into this soccer kick now," said 
Alicia Martin, 17, a Sherman Oaks resident who sat on a blanket with three 
friends. "I think the U.S. is going all the way. I just hope I can find 
tickets" for Sunday's game against Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 Several brokers reported sales booming for World Cup tickets, particularly for 
games involving the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 "A ticket for Sunday that was $45 before (the victory over Colombia) is now 
costing $65," said Lance Keller, manager of Murray's, an Anaheim ticket agency. 
"We've had a lot more people calling us today than ever before looking for Cup 
tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back at the hotel in Dana Point, Schroeder, the businessman there 
for the credit union meeting, said his kids, after seeing sweeper Marcelo 
Balboa perform an acrobatic "bicycle kick" Wednesday, immediately padded out to 
the back yard to give it a try. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw that kick three different times on replay and they immediately went 
out back and started trying it," he said, adding, "and these are kids who sleep 
with their baseball mitts." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, baseball. America's true national pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 For now.

CALLS TO O.C., L.A.'S ABUSE HOT LINES SOAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As the violent saga of O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown Simpson unfolds, men and 
women are flooding domestic violence hot lines with questions about their own 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of women are calling the shelter saying, 'Maybe this is as serious as I 
thought; that when he says he's going to kill me, it's real,' " said Jan Tyler, 
director of the Human Options Shelter in south Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls there have tripled since transcripts were released Wednesday of Nicole 
Brown Simpson's October call to 911, Tyler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems the more this unwinds, the more the phones start ringing," said 
Andrea Thompson Adam, hot-line coordinator for the Los Angeles Commission on 
Assaults Against Women, where calls are up 80%. The commission's hot line 
usually fields about 1,300 calls a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women say, 'If it could happen to Nicole, it could happen to me. . . .' 
The men say things like, 'I've pushed my wife before. Does this mean I'm a 
batterer?' It's really shaken the tree," Thompson Adam said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Los Angeles County Domestic Violence Council, the county's 
other 18 hot lines for battering victims have reported increased calls and 
higher attendance at support groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the murders of Nicole Simpson and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, 
increasingly graphic details of the Simpsons' stormy relationship have emerged. 
He was convicted of misdemeanor spousal battery in 1989 after beating his 
then-wife so severely that she required hospitalization. On Wednesday, as O.J. 
Simpson awaited trial in the slayings, police released the 911 transcript. On 
the tape, which has been broadcast nationwide, she could be heard pleading for 
help because Simpson was breaking down her door. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in calls to hot lines is the result of the unusual exposure of 
Nicole Simpson's experiences and people identifying with her, said Patricia 
Occhiuzzo Giggans, executive director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults 
Against Women. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're seeing their lives played out on TV -- the intimidation, how fearful 
they are, how they keep the guy close to control his anger and abuse, how they 
almost accommodate him in some ways, especially when children are involved," 
Giggans said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half the callers volunteer that the Simpson case inspired them to 
call and more callers than before are using the words domestic violence to 
describe their situation, staffers said. The calls started to increase Monday 
and have continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Derith Mason, who works on the hot line at the Women's Transitional Living 
Center, the largest shelter for battered women in Orange County, said most of 
the callers have been asking how to get restraining orders, which Nicole Brown 
Simpson didn't have. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the callers worried that the media coverage would spur renewed 
attacks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One woman said, 'My batterer's been away for four months and, seeing all this 
O.J. stuff on the news, I think he's going to come back at me,' " said Mason, 
who has been handling a minimum of 30% more calls since the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Harris, who runs counseling groups in Fullerton and Long Beach for men 
who batter women, said his phones also have been deluged with calls, most from 
men concerned about their behavior. Some past group members also have shown up, 
worried about backsliding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two people who hadn't shown up in awhile were back this week," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 The publicity given the Simpson case also has motivated some women to take the 
first step to addressing long-term abuse. Roz Wolpert, a volunteer counselor at 
Santa Monica's Sojourn, a multi-service program for battered women, recalled 
one woman who said she had been in a battering relationship for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me the only reason she was finally calling is what's happening on 
the news," Wolpert said. "I was beside myself, I was so happy that something 
good could come from this." 
</P>
<P>
 But for some callers, the details of the Simpsons' turbulent relationship have 
triggered flashbacks to previous traumas. "They say, 'This is making me scared, 
the Simpson thing. . . .' Some said they wanted to leave the area," said Tyler 
of Human Options.  
</P>
<P>
 The calls have come from all parts of the region and beyond. Many have been 
referred to multicultural hot lines and shelters with programs that are 
tailored to the callers' ethnicity and are conducted in their native language. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the recent callers are women but the counselors have also received 
calls from men, a few of whom say they have been battered and some of whom 
wonder if they are batterers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times people don't honestly recognize what this behavior is. It's 
learned behavior," Thompson Adam said. Some people may have grown up with 
violence in their home or neighborhood, where they heard men say, "You have to 
slap 'em every once in a while to keep 'em in line," she said. "People believe 
that, even though it's just a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 Counselors said potential batterers might ask themselves questions such as: Am 
I controlling? Do I expect her to conform to my time schedule and list of 
priorities? Do I have her call in and report to me? 
</P>
<P>
 One counselor suggests that batterers try to see themselves realistically by 
tape-recording themselves as they lose their temper and then listening to the 
tape in a calmer moment. 
</P>
<P>
 They can also call a hot line without having to identify themselves or explain 
their entire story. One episode does not make an abuser, Thompson Adam said. 
"But you have to be careful and recognize this episode for whatever it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Counselors at the Commission on Assaults Against Women identified a 
three-stage "cycle of abuse": the tension-building stage, when the victim feels 
as if she has to "walk on eggshells"; the violent or abusive stage that 
consists of anything from verbal abuse to a slap across the face to being 
beaten in front of the children; the honeymoon stage, a tender, making-up 
period that may include sex or, for the wealthy, "something from Tiffany's." 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the honeymoon stage eventually fades away, they said. In those 
cases, counselors tell women there are three ways out: He leaves and stays 
gone, you leave and he lets you stay gone, or somebody dies. Counseling may 
work, but they advise women not to rely on it.  
</P>
<P>
 Victims need to ask themselves if they have found outlets to talk about the 
violence, or if they need to call the police.  
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't any easy advice," Thompson Adam said. However, counselors often 
advise women to make an escape plan in conjunction with a local hot line.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every woman has to evaluate her own situation. What works for one woman may 
not work for another. A woman in one situation may be able to leave the first 
time, where another could suffer severe repercussions as a result. Only they 
can know when is the best time for them to get out."

O.C. IS EXPECTED TO ADD 10,000 JOBS THIS YEAR; ECONOMY: NEW FORECAST IS MUCH 
HIGHER THAN EARLIER ONES. HIGH-TECH AND MEDICAL PRODUCT EXPORTS CREDITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Encouraged by strong overseas sales of their high-technology and medical 
products, Orange County employers likely will add 10,000 jobs to their payrolls 
this year, according to a Chapman University report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 That employment increase plus higher-than-expected levels of consumer and 
business spending in the first months of the year led university economists to 
predict far more dramatic 1994 growth for the county than they had forecast in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reinforces a lot of other positive news we've been hearing," said Tom 
Wilck, chairman of the county Chamber of Commerce and Industry. "Orange County 
is going to be one of the hot spots in the country. The momentum is with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the aerospace industry is still reeling from defense spending cuts and 
massive layoffs, and while Orange County businesses have slashed more than 
50,000 jobs since the recession began in 1990, the Chapman Center for Economic 
Research said in its midyear report that the county will likely end 1994 well 
into a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 James Doti, the university's president and chief economic forecaster, also 
predicted that taxable retail sales and housing sales -- both strong indicators 
of consumer confidence -- will show appreciable growth. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast with the healthy employment growth now projected in Orange County, 
the Chapman report said, Los Angeles County employers are expected to slash 
almost 30,000 jobs from their payrolls this year, said Chapman economist Esmael 
Adibi. 
</P>
<P>
 Adibi also said the construction industry in Los Angeles is not likely to 
enjoy a "mini boom" like the one that seems to be starting in Orange County. 
Average home prices in Los Angeles County, he predicted, will decline 3.3% -- 
the fourth annual decrease in a row. The value of building projects started in 
Los Angeles County this year will fall almost 5% to $3.9 billion, Adibi 
predicted, down from $4.1 billion for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The research center is predicting a 17.8% increase in building permit values 
in Orange County this year -- to $1.9 billion from $1.6 billion. The entire 
increase, Doti said, will come from increased home building. Pent-up demand for 
housing after the minimal construction activity of the recession, he predicted, 
will nearly double housing production to about 13,000 units a year through the 
end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Adibi said he expects about 9,800 jobs to be added this year in the Inland 
Empire -- where locally based employment remained constant during the 
recession. But construction in Riverside and San Bernardino counties will 
remain weak through the rest of the 1994, he predicted, and home prices are 
likely to drop 2.5% after a 4.6% average decline last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for its emphasis on improvement in Orange County economy, the Chapman 
midyear report is quite similar to a statewide study issued earlier this week 
by the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 In both the UCLA and Chapman reports, economists say that California's 
economic recovery is underway but is being held back by short-term interest 
rate increases and continuing layoffs in the aerospace industry. Chapman's 
Doti, however, disagrees with UCLA forecasters who say that income losses 
because of January's Northridge earthquake are holding back growth. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been income losses, Doti said, "but the spending that will result 
from the rebuilding effort will make up for them. The spending to come is going 
to be a positive influence on the recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither school, however, is optimistic about the likelihood of a big economic 
boom any time soon. UCLA forecasters said that, though they expect the gross 
domestic product -- a key measure of economic growth -- to increase by 3.9% 
this year, they think the growth rate will slow in 1995 to just 2.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman economists were slightly more pessimistic, calling for GDP growth of 
3.6% this year, slowing to 2% for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's premature to try to evaluate whether we're heading into another national 
recession in 1996," Doti said Thursday, "but we will have a significant 
slowdown in 1995." Orange County's Slow Climb

along with local defense and construction spending to predict Orange County's 
non-agricultural employment levels. Percentage change in county employment and

ARRESTEE IS AMONG FEW WITH CONCEALED GUN PERMIT; WEAPONS: IT IS NOT EASY TO 
HAVE THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE GRANT A REQUEST. BUT ONE MAN WITH A RAP SHEET SLIPPED 
THROUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Paul Alfred Ragone is in select company. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the likes of judges, lawyers, executives and celebrities, Ragone is 
allowed to pack a gun with the blessings of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragone -- an appliance repairman, electronics parts clerk and sometimes 
photographer -- was issued a permit to carry a concealed weapon despite a long 
record of arrests and his own sworn testimony that he suffers from mental 
disorders.  
</P>
<P>
 Gun control advocates point to the fact that Ragone can carry a loaded 
9-millimeter handgun anywhere in the state as proof that granting such licenses 
is inherently dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is an example -- without passing blame -- as to why concealed 
weapon permits present a problem," said Sandy Cooney, western region director 
of Handgun Control Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 In processing applications to carry a concealed weapon, the Sheriff's 
Department checks with the state Department of Justice for criminal and mental 
commitment records. But deputies do no field investigations of applicants and, 
for the most part, simply process paper. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Ragone, most of his criminal record was somehow overlooked and deputies 
were unaware of his acknowledged mental problems, said Sheriff's Sgt. Edward 
Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have his total rap sheet," said Barstow, who reviews 75 to 100 
concealed weapon applications per month before forwarding them to top 
department officials for final decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not easy to get a concealed weapon permit from the Sheriff's 
Department. Such permits from a law enforcement agency are necessary to legally 
carry a gun in California. The permits are normally good for one year. An 
applicant to the Sheriff's Department must present a convincing case that a 
clear and present danger is so great that carrying a gun is the only practical 
response. Simply living in a high-crime area, for example, is not considered 
sufficient cause. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's cautious policy has been recently adopted by the Los Angeles 
Police Department as a result of a tentative legal settlement in which the LAPD 
agreed to end its two-decade-old practice of rejecting all applications to 
carry concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't grant them lightly," said Undersheriff Jerry Harper, who is among 
three top officials in the department who rule on permit applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the same token," he added, "we don't take the position that there should 
be zero gun permits issued. We believe that we have taken a responsible, 
cautious approach that is consistent with the law and in the best interests of 
the people.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe that it is in the best interests of the people to issue gun 
permits willy-nilly. We also don't believe that in Los Angeles County with some 
9 million people that there are not some people out there who have a legitimate 
need to have a gun permit." 
</P>
<P>
 There were only 88 concealed weapon permits granted last year out of about 
1,000 applications, bringing the total of such licenses, including renewals, to 
about 300 for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charge that the department favors influential people such as judges, 
attorneys, business executives and celebrities.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials deny the allegation, contending that high-profile people 
whose lives are threatened are especially vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are the chief executive officer of an oil company or something like 
that," Barstow said, "they're probably one of the biggest targets in the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Simply being a high-profile personality is not enough to qualify for a permit, 
Barstow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a big celebrity came in and said: 'I want a permit,' it's not just, 'OK, 
we'll give it to you.' We ask, 'What types of problems have you experienced?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Judges, Barstow said, are frequently granted concealed weapon permits because 
they often come face to face with violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Barstow insisted, however, that "quite a few Joe Blow citizens" have also been 
issued permits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But, besides Paul Ragone, there are apparently few "Joe Blows" on the 
sheriff's list of 300 people who this year held concealed weapon permits. About 
two-thirds were judges, commissioners, hearing officers, attorneys, reserve 
peace officers or retired federal law enforcement officials. Another two dozen 
were businessmen, physicians or people connected with the entertainment 
industry.  
</P>
<P>
 Ragone was granted the one-year permit to carry a concealed weapon last June 
30 after claiming that he had received death threats from holdup men, records 
show. The 43-year-old Norwalk resident would not talk to The Times on the 
advice of his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the permit despite a criminal rap sheet that lists 10 arrests and three 
misdemeanor convictions -- including a weapons violation -- over a 20-year 
period from 1969-89. He was sentenced to jail once and put on probation three 
times. Sheriff's officials have wide latitude in evaluating an application for 
a concealed weapon permit, but conviction on a felony or a serious misdemeanor 
is automatic grounds for denial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragone was convicted in 1981 of a misdemeanor violation of carrying a loaded 
firearm in Bellflower. The arrest report indicates that he pointed a loaded gun 
at another driver during a high-speed chase. He was also arrested and released 
several times on suspicion of burglary from 1969-73 and convicted of petty 
theft in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Barstow recalled seeing records indicating that Ragone was 
convicted of petty theft and arrested -- but not convicted -- for drunk driving 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I missed the others," he said. "I don't know how, but I didn't know about 
it. I don't know if I misplaced it (Ragone's rap sheet) or what." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time Ragone got his permit to carry a gun, he testified in a lawsuit 
deposition that -- as a result of being robbed -- he was under the care of a 
psychiatrist and was using medication to cope with the shakes, depression and 
panic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I get the shakes real bad or real unstable, I take this 
(medication)," Ragone testified on May 19, 1993, a month before getting his 
concealed weapon permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to wake up in the morning," he testified in regard to his 
mental condition. "I went through periods I didn't even want to live anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't handle traffic," he testified. "If I'm backed up in traffic and I get 
stopped, or stop-and-go, I feel trapped. I feel claustrophobic. I've got to do 
something."  
</P>
<P>
 Because there are no field investigations of concealed weapon applicants, 
Barstow had no way of knowing about that testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Barstow said the fee for a concealed weapon license, which is $45, would jump 
to about $2,000 if field investigations were conducted. "The expense that would 
be charged to the individual would be so steep that it would preclude a lot of 
people who are not wealthy from applying," Barstow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragone's application was approved, Barstow said, because of his claim that he 
was in danger from armed robbers who held him up June 14, 1992, and threatened 
to come back and kill him. Ragone claimed that he had received numerous 
threatening phone calls after the holdup, which occurred on the street. But 
Ragone testified in a civil suit deposition that the robbers did not take his 
wallet or credit cards, raising the question of how they would have known his 
identity or how to contact him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Barstow said. "It was overlooked on my part." 
</P>
<P>
 Court and sheriff's records show that Ragone had numerous run-ins with the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 He was first arrested in 1969 at age 19 on suspicion of burglary and was 
apparently released without prosecution. A year later, he was arrested on 
suspicion of drunk driving. The charge was dismissed and he was convicted of 
reckless driving and fined $120. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three months later, Ragone, not yet 21, was arrested for possession 
of dangerous drugs and possession of alcohol by a minor. The drug charge was 
dropped and he was put on probation for one year for the alcohol violation. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, Ragone was arrested for burglary, but the charge was dismissed. 
He was arrested in January, 1973, for trespassing. Again, the charge was 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, he was arrested for burglary. The rap sheet indicates that 
once more he was released: "Deemed not arrested, detained only, ascertained 
evidence insufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested again seven months later for possession of burglary tools, but 
again he apparently was not prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly eight years after that, on July 21, 1981, Ragone, by then 30, was 
arrested for carrying a loaded firearm, reckless driving and hit and run 
without personal injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's arrest report alleges that Ragone, driving at high speeds, 
chased a tow truck from Norwalk to Bellflower, sideswiped another car and 
pointed a loaded .357-caliber Ruger handgun at the tow truck driver. Ragone was 
convicted of possession of a loaded gun in a public place and put on two years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years later, on June 8, 1989, Ragone was taken into custody by a store 
detective in Norwalk and accused of shoplifting a $2.35-pocket level. He was 
convicted and sentenced to 60 days in jail, a $480 fine and two years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 14, 1992, at 1:30 a.m., Ragone was shot in the buttocks by holdup men 
at a Bank of America automated teller in Norwalk.  
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, he filed suit against the Bank of America, the shopping 
center in which the ATM was located and the security firm that patrolled the 
center. The suit, which was dismissed in April and is on appeal, accuses the 
three companies of failing to provide proper security at the ATM site. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in connection with this suit that Ragone described the psychological 
problems he said were caused by the holdup. 
</P>
<P>
 A month after giving such testimony, Ragone received his permit to carry a 
loaded gun. A month and a half after that, he testified: "My nerves are 
starting to fall apart on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ragone's permit to carry a concealed weapon expires at the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 And if he applies for a renewal? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to sit and take a look at some things," Sgt. Barstow said.

CONTRACT DISCLOSES RAIDERS MAY NOT OWE RENT IN 1994 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Raiders will play in a repaired Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum this fall, 
most likely rent-free, under the terms of the team's one-year agreement with 
the Coliseum Commission disclosed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to what Coliseum sources said earlier in the week about hundreds of 
thousands of dollars of 1994 rent going into a special fund to finance luxury 
boxes and other improvements, it turned out that in the fine print of the 
contract the Raiders are not required to pay any rent until major conditions 
are met. 
</P>
<P>
 These include a written agreement still to be negotiated between the team and 
the Coliseum Commission to bring the stadium and its surroundings in Exposition 
Park up to the level of other National Football League facilities, as well as a 
Raiders agreement on a long-term contract to play in the new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Raiders signed a renovation agreement, but it collapsed two years 
later because of the poor economy. It included forgiveness of all team debts, 
totaling $10 million, to the Coliseum Commission, and an immediate, 
non-refundable payment of another $10 million to the team by the Coliseum 
manager, Spectacor. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewing the history of transactions with the Raiders on Thursday, two 
knowledgeable Coliseum officials said it is very likely that any new long-term 
agreement to be negotiated in the year ahead would include a similar 
forgiveness of debts, thus absolving the Raiders of having to pay any 1994 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is rent we really do not expect to get," said one of the officials, who 
declined to be identified. The other called it "a charity deal." 
</P>
<P>
 In all of the Raiders' negotiations with cities interested in wooing them, the 
team has insisted on some cash inducement to move. That was the rule in their 
talks with Irwindale, Oakland, Sacramento, Baltimore and other cities. The team 
got a $6.7-million loan, later forgiven, to move to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The total $20 million in payments or credits already made to the Raiders by 
the Coliseum and its managers since the team began playing in the Coliseum in 
1982 is more than twice the rent the Raiders have paid since coming to Los 
Angeles 12 years ago. So, on balance, they have been playing rent-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Coliseum officials have been trying without success since 1976 to assemble the 
millions of dollars of financing necessary to improve the stadium and 
Exposition Park to the level sought by the Rams before they departed and then 
by the Raiders when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are asking for luxury boxes, much more parking, security at 
Exposition Park and amenities at the stadium such as improved concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement announced Thursday also cuts the Raider share of day-of-the-game 
expenses from $60,000 last year to $25,000 this year, thus saddling the 
Coliseum administration with new charges that threaten its ability to turn a 
profit this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, however, the Coliseum will still receive a 50-50 split on 
concession revenues. The stadium's general manager, Pat Lynch, estimated those 
to be an average of about $70,000 a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch expressed some confidence the Coliseum could cut expenses and remain 
profitable. He noted that other events besides football are being solicited. 
</P>
<P>
 Under another provision, the Raiders could still move elsewhere for next 
season if the $42-million Coliseum earthquake repairs were not satisfactory and 
at least 67,500 seats were not ready to be occupied by Sept. 11, the date of 
the team's regular season home opener against the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 The new one-year agreement, with options for short-term renewals through 2006, 
was signed late Wednesday night by Los Angeles County Board Chairwoman Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, who is the commission president, and Raiders attorney Amy 
Trask. It is scheduled to be ratified by a full Coliseum Commission meeting 
July 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the Raiders' constant talks about moving to other cities, Coliseum 
officials portray it as the best deal that they could work out with Al Davis, 
the team's managing general partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said at a Coliseum news conference Thursday: "We feel this agreement is 
a good one for the city and county, the Raiders organization and, of course, 
Raiders fans throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the coming months, the Coliseum Commission hopes to initiate negotiations 
toward an agreement with the Raiders that will establish a long-term 
relationship for the team in L.A.," she added. "(We) will move swiftly to 
identify the resources needed to upgrade the Coliseum so the stadium will be 
ranked among the best in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders issued a written statement that said in part: 
</P>
<P>
 "In March, we announced that the Raiders were in Los Angeles and that we 
wanted to stay in Los Angeles, but that there was a tremendous cloud of 
uncertainty with respect to the Coliseum situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "That cloud of uncertainty has been lifted insofar as we have received 
assurances that the . . . Coliseum will be ready for our 1994 season. We have 
made a commitment for the 1994 season."

CALLS TO L.A. DOMESTIC ABUSE HOT LINES SOAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Both men and women are flooding domestic violence hot lines as a result of the 
O.J. Simpson murder investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, the calls are up 80%. It seems the more this unwinds, the more the 
phones start ringing," said Andrea Thompson Adam, hot-line coordinator for the 
Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women. The commission's hot line 
usually fields about 1,300 calls a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The women say, 'If it could happen to Nicole, it could happen to me. . . .' 
The men say things like, 'I've pushed my wife before. Does this mean I'm a 
batterer?' It's really shaken the tree," Thompson Adam said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Los Angeles County Domestic Violence Council, the county's 
other 18 hot lines for battering victims have reported increased calls and 
higher attendance at support groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Domestic Abuse Center in Northridge has quadrupled its calls as a result 
of the Simpson case, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, 
increasingly graphic details of the Simpsons' stormy relationship have emerged. 
He was convicted of misdemeanor spousal battery in 1989 after beating Nicole 
Simpson so severely that she required hospitalization. On Wednesday, as O.J. 
Simpson awaited trial in the slayings, police released a transcript of a 911 
call his ex-wife made in October. On the tape, which has been broadcast 
nationwide, she could be heard pleading for help because Simpson was breaking 
down her door. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in calls to hot lines is the result of the unusual exposure of 
Nicole Simpson's experiences and people identifying with her, said Patricia 
Occhiuzzo Giggans, executive director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults 
Against Women. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're seeing their lives played out on TV--the intimidation, how fearful 
they are, how they keep the guy close to control his anger and abuse, how they 
almost accommodate him in some ways, especially when children are involved," 
Giggans said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half the callers volunteer that the Simpson case inspired them to 
call and more callers than before are using the words domestic violence to 
describe their situation, staffers said. The calls started to increase Monday 
and have continued to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women have been motivated to take the first step to addressing long-term 
abuse. Roz Wolpert, a volunteer counselor at Santa Monica's Sojourn, a 
multi-service program for battered women, said she has noted a 60% increase in 
callers on her shift. She recalled one woman who said she had been in a 
battering relationship for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me the only reason she was finally calling is what's happening on 
the news," Wolpert said. "I was beside myself, I was so happy that something 
good could come from this." 
</P>
<P>
 But for some callers, the details of the Simpsons' turbulent relationship have 
triggered flashbacks to previous traumas. "They say, 'This is making me scared, 
the Simpson thing. . . .' Some said they wanted to leave the area," said Jan 
Tyler, program director of Human Options in South Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The calls have come from all parts of the region and beyond. Many have been 
referred to multicultural hot lines and shelters with programs that are 
tailored to the callers' ethnicity and are conducted in their native language. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the recent callers are women but the counselors have also received 
calls from men, a few of whom say they have been battered and some of whom 
wonder if they are batterers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times people don't honestly recognize what this behavior is. It's 
learned behavior," Thompson Adam said. Some people may have grown up with 
violence in their home or neighborhood, where they heard men say, "You have to 
slap 'em every once in a while to keep 'em in line," she said. "People believe 
that, even though it's just a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 One counselor suggests that bthemselves as they lose their te They can also 
call a hot linestory. One episode does not makeand recognize this episode for w 
Counselors at the Commission 1633842547lets you stay gone, or somebody on it.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "There isn't any easy advicemake an escape plan in conjuncti "Every woman has

</P>
<P>
 More than 1.4 million domestic violence-related calls for help have been 
reported by law enforcement agencies to the state Department of Justice since 
domestic violence was first made a separate crime from all other general 
assault crimes in 1986. These numbers include all calls, whether or not an 
arrest was made. 
</P>
<P>
 WHO ARE THE ATTACKERS? 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 400,000 individual interviews conducted between 1987 and 1991 by 
the U.S. Department of Justice showed that relatives and friends were 
responsible for 33% of attacks on women in cases where there was a single 
offender. By contrast, family violence accounted for only 5% of all violence 
against men: 03,19,07,05 WOMEN MEN Relative/intimate 33% 5% Acquaintance 35% 
50% Stranger 31% 44% Unknown 1% 1% * Percentages are based on total number of 
victimizations for the five-year period, rather than on the annual average.

'SUNSET BLVD.' TO BE CLOSED; DUNAWAY'S SINGING FAULTED; THEATER: ACTRESS, 
REPORTEDLY 'FLABBERGASTED' BY OUSTER, WAS TO REPLACE GLENN CLOSE. REFUNDS COULD 
TOTAL $4 MILLION.

<P>
 The producers of "Sunset Boulevard," the mega-musical at the Shubert Theatre 
in Century City, abruptly announced Thursday that the show will close after 
Sunday's final appearance with Glenn Close in the lead role, leaving the 
theater dark and thousands of advance ticket-holders disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Faye Dunaway was scheduled to begin preview performances July 5. After weeks 
of promotion, the producers now say that Dunaway is not capable of taking over 
the starring role as the fading film star Norma Desmond. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway had been given the demanding singing role without any previous musical 
stage experience -- to the surprise of many in the theater community -- and it 
was her lack of singing ability that caused the cancellation, the producers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was concluded after several weeks of rehearsals and vocal preparation that 
the musical demands of the role were such that it was not possible for 
(Dunaway) to perform as scheduled," said a statement released Thursday by 
producer/composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Company. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation came despite advance ticket sales for the Los Angeles 
production "way in excess of $4 million," said Peter Brown, a spokesman for 
Lloyd Webber. All of those purchases will be refunded at the point of purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway was "flabbergasted" at her dismissal when told about the cancellation, 
according to her manager, Bob Palmer, who said he informed her of it late 
Wednesday. Palmer said Dunaway sang parts of her role for Lloyd Webber on 
Monday evening in a rehearsal room at the Shubert, and "she was given great 
praise and encouragement. She felt very good about it." He added that a 
lingering disagreement over which key to use in parts of the role appeared to 
have been resolved at the Monday meeting, according to what Dunaway told 
Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway was shooting a movie, "Don Juan de Marco and the Centerfold," in 
Culver City on Thursday and could not be reached for comment. Palmer said 
Dunaway would probably hold a news conference soon to discuss the experience. 
He said he could not comment on any financial settlements or legal action that 
might follow Dunaway's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Close is moving to the Broadway production of "Sunset Boulevard," which is 
scheduled to open in New York on Nov. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 A media opening for Dunaway's debut in the Los Angeles show, along with Rex 
Smith as her co-star, had been scheduled for July 27. Recently, the producers 
had taken the unprecedented step of lowering ticket prices by $5 for the July 
5-26 preview performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The rehearsal schedule was complicated because of Dunaway's commitment to "Don 
Juan," which also features Marlon Brando. Dunaway had rehearsed with most of 
the "Sunset" cast last Friday, but had been working on the movie all this week 
and was not expected to return to her work on "Sunset" until Tuesday -- only 
one week before her first preview appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Lloyd Webber has changed his mind on casting for 
the role of Norma Desmond. Patti LuPone, who originated the role in London last 
July, was first signed to take that performance to Broadway this fall. After 
months of rumors -- which Lloyd Webber continually denied -- it was announced 
that Glenn Close would play the role on Broadway. In mid-May, the Really Useful 
Company and LuPone's attorney said they had reached a settlement regarding 
LuPone's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Before LuPone left the London cast last March, the actress was offered the Los 
Angeles role, replacing Close. She did not turn it down officially, her agent 
said a few months ago, but "she has never replaced anybody in her career." 
LuPone could not be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd Webber spokesman Brown said plans for a national touring production will 
now be moved up and that Los Angeles will be included on the tour, although 
casting for it has not yet begun. All the Los Angeles cast members will be 
offered the chance to continue their roles on Broadway.  
</P>
<P>
 The $12-million production opened at the Shubert in December and has run for 
232 performances.

'85 ATTACK BY SIMPSON ON WIFE'S CAR DESCRIBED; VIOLENCE: POLICE RESPONDED AFTER 
HE ALLEGEDLY BROKE WINDSHIELD WITH BAT, SOURCES SAY. SHE DID NOT PRESS CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As officials scrambled Thursday to control a flood of pretrial publicity in 
the O.J. Simpson double murder case, law enforcement sources detailed a 1985 
incident in which the football legend allegedly shattered the windshield of his 
then-wife Nicole's car with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said police responding to the call encountered an agitated Simpson 
who told them, "It's my car, I'll handle this. There is no problem here." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson, as she had after a 1993 incident of domestic violence 
chronicled in graphic police audiotapes released Wednesday, declined to move 
forward with charges, so officers left, according to the sources, who insisted 
on anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 One police sergeant familiar with the 1985 case said Simpson smashed the car 
so hard that he shattered the entire windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Shapiro, who is defending Simpson on charges that he murdered Nicole 
and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman, declined to comment. When asked about prior 
incidents of domestic violence at a news conference earlier this week, he 
confirmed that Simpson had struck his wife's car with an object but would not 
elaborate. Sources said the 1985 incident came up during an 1989 battery case, 
in which Simpson pleaded no contest to beating his wife, but there is no record 
of it public documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosures came as Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and other 
officials moved on several fronts Thursday to tighten the lid on the release of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging from a closed-door session with two other top law enforcement figures 
-- Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams and City Atty. James K. Hahn -- 
Garcetti told reporters they will not honor any more news media requests for 
law enforcement public records involving the football legend. 
</P>
<P>
 The clampdown, accompanied by the imposition of a virtual news blackout at the 
Police Department and a move in court by investigators to seal search warrants 
in the Simpson case, came on the heels of the LAPD's release, with Hahn's 
approval, of stunning tapes of 911 emergency calls, including one from 1993 
that captures the sounds of an enraged man, identified as Simpson, screaming 
obscenities as his ex-wife sobs that he has broken her door down. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials would not specify the nature of any additional information they are 
withholding. Garcetti acknowledged that "there's still information that was not 
released" but he would not say what it is or how much of it there is. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney said he did not know the chilling tapes had been 
released until Wednesday night, when he saw television reports. "Frankly, I 
almost called Chief Williams last night to say 'What is going on with these 
tapes?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Only later, he said, did he find out Hahn had approved the release of the 
tapes under the California Public Records Act in response to requests from news 
organizations. "The city attorney may be right," Garcetti said, "but I disagree 
with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti insisted that his chief concern was that Simpson get a fair trial and 
that there be "a perception that he is being treated fairly and properly." He 
said releasing the 911 tapes is "not fair to Mr. Simpson (and) not fair to the 
public." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's chief prosecutor also defiantly challenged news organizations to 
take him to court on the issue, vowing to join forces with Hahn and even 
Shapiro, Simpson's defense attorney, to defend his position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to fight as hard as I have to, to make sure that that information 
is not improperly released." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers saw Garcetti's move as a calculated, if legally questionable, 
tactic to deflect criticism that authorities are trying the case in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD reported that it was inundated with calls from the public Thursday, 
most of them from people complaining about the release of the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola University law professor Laurie L. Levenson said Garcetti "doesn't want 
the public to think that he's playing dirty -- that creates more sympathy for 
Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to be aware that he is vulnerable to defense motions that their rights 
to a fair trial have been compromised by prosecution pretrial publicity," 
Levenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti's announcement came after a 23-member grand jury panel wrapped up a 
fifth day of taking secret testimony as it worked toward a possible indictment 
of Simpson, who has maintained his innocence in the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness who appeared before the grand jury Thursday -- her second visit in 
three days -- was Jill Shively, a Westside resident who appeared on the tabloid 
television show "Hard Copy" this week to say she saw Simpson racing away from 
the area of Nicole Simpson's townhome about the time of the murders. Shively 
declined to comment outside the grand jury room or say if she was paid for her 
televised interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, James Epstein, also refused to say why his client was called but 
he signaled that prosecutors now are concerned about the usefulness of 
Shively's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect her to be called as a witness at the trial. It's my 
understanding that the district attorney does not plan to call her at the 
trial. That's their decision, not mine." 
</P>
<P>
 In the "Hard Copy" interview, Shively appeared on camera -- but was not 
identified -- saying that she saw an excited Simpson about 10:50 p.m. two 
blocks from Nicole Simpson's Bundy Avenue townhome. Simpson has maintained that 
he was at his Brentwood estate, waiting for a limousine, at the time of the 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked crazy, he was enraged," Shively said on the syndicated telecast. 
"He ran a red light, and the only reason he stopped (was) because there already 
was another car in front of him." Shively, who says she sometimes jogged with 
Nicole in the tony Westside neighborhood, said Simpson yelled at another 
motorist. "I thought he was drunk," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, The Times has learned, the grand jury has taken testimony from 
the owner of the limousine service that ferried Simpson to Los Angeles 
International Airport the night of the murders. Earlier, they heard from a 
resident of a guest house at Simpson's estate who met the limousine. While 
details of the testimony given are not clear, they do indicate that prosecutors 
have been focusing considerable attention on Simpson's alibi in the secret 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson already has been charged with two counts of murder. But a grand jury 
indictment would preclude a preliminary hearing next week, where the 
prosecution would have to publicly lay out much of its case and Simpson's 
attorney could challenge witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury adjourned without returning an indictment and was expected to 
meet again today in a rare Friday session. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Police returned to the Bundy Avenue murder scene Thursday and taped off the 
area with yellow crime-scene tape as they milled about. Three uniformed 
officers shooed away the omnipresent curious bystanders. One officer said 
investigators were "reviewing schematics of the crime scene."  
</P>
<P>
 * The president of the Police Commission, Gary Greenebaum, defended the LAPD's 
early handling of the case and disputed a news service report that top police 
brass may have interfered with an arrest of Simpson after he returned from his 
short-lived trip to Chicago. "I've talked to the chief about this very issue. 
As far as I know, (investigators on the case) did what they did using their own 
discretion. . . . They had no other instruction when they went out or after 
they got out there." 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Los Angeles Rams star Roosevelt Grier visited Simpson in jail 
Thursday. Simpson's lawyer and Robert Kardashian, a longtime Simpson friend and 
personal attorney, also visited.  
</P>
<P>
 * Simpson's close friend, Paula Barbieri, appeared on the ABC-TV show 
"PrimeTime Live" and said the football-hero-turned-suspect is not a violent 
person: "You're seeing what the police want out there. . . . I know he didn't 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the official maneuvering revolved around the cyclone of news coverage 
of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. John Dunkin, a department spokesman, said Parker Center was hit 
with public criticism over release of the 911 tapes and reports on Wednesday. 
The department's public information office received "several dozen calls" about 
the tapes and Chief Williams' office received "many more," Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most callers complained that the LAPD was trying the case in the media, Dunkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the department did not want to release the information but had been 
legally obligated under the state Public Records Act. "Then you guys left us 
hanging out to dry" for not explaining how the information came to be released, 
Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong public reaction to the tapes' release, coupled with calls and 
visits to officers' work sites and homes, prompted Williams to place the gag 
order on the entire LAPD staff, Dunkin said. "Notwithstanding the tragedy of 
this event, life does go on in the city of Los Angeles and we have other cases 
to be investigated," Dunkin said. "The department has to balance its efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 After Thursday's meeting, Garcetti said Williams and Hahn agreed with him "to 
cut this off." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Garcetti told The Times: 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that transpired before June 12 (the day of the slayings) . . . any 
of those occurrences may likely come up during some part of the trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the airing of the tape so far and the publication of the transcript 
had hurt Simpson's defense, Garcetti replied that he was "confident that we can 
find 12 jurors who know very little if anything about this tape."

TOBACCO OFFICIAL DENIES HIDING NICOTINE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A top cigarette company executive Thursday rejected allegations by Food and 
Drug Administration Commissioner David A. Kessler that the firm concealed 
efforts to develop a high-nicotine form of tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing before the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the 
environment, Thomas E. Sandefur Jr., chairman and chief executive officer of 
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., accused the FDA chief of "grandstanding" in 
testimony before the panel Tuesday and of "exaggerating the situation to fit 
his personal and political agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA "set up" B&W to imply that the company lied or hid information about 
research involving the development of a high-nicotine plant known as Y-1, 
Sandefur said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said the Justice Department is 
reviewing charges that tobacco company executives may have lied in recent years 
about cigarette safety and nicotine addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department is responding to a request last month from seven 
members of Congress who asked for a criminal investigation based in part on 
their belief that industry executives may have committed perjury and other 
violations, such as fraud and conspiracy to obstruct Congress, in the last 
several decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandefur's comments came two days after Kessler testified that B&W officials, 
during a May 3 meeting with FDA representatives, failed to disclose the 
decade-long project after they were specifically asked whether they were 
engaged in any plant-breeding practices to raise or lower nicotine levels in 
tobacco. They told the FDA they were not involved in such work, Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project involved developing a tobacco plant, grown in Brazil, that yielded 
twice the nicotine of standard tobacco plants. B&W shipped several million 
pounds of the plant from Brazil and used it in at least five of its American 
brands. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sandefur insisted Thursday that "the FDA never asked B&W a single question 
about Y-1. . . . B&W has never attempted to hide the existence of Y-1." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandefur said he was not present at the May 3 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell Zeller, an FDA special assistant for policy who attended the May 3 
meeting, said B&W officials were specifically asked whether they engaged in 
plant-breeding practices related to nicotine levels. They did not volunteer 
information about the Y-1 project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That question was certainly an opportunity for them to come forward to us and 
say: 'Let us tell you about Y-1,' even though we didn't put the question in 
terms of Y-1," Zeller said when asked Thursday about Sandefur's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandefur also said Kessler had "failed to say" that the brands using Y-1 
"deliver essentially the same nicotine as the products they replaced. Some of 
the brands actually deliver less nicotine than the non-Y-1 blends for the same 
products and some were higher." 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), has been 
conducting an investigation of the tobacco industry. Waxman, a leading Capitol 
Hill foe of tobacco, has authored legislation that would prohibit smoking in 
most public buildings and supports the FDA's authority to regulate cigarettes 
as drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA is attempting to build a case to regulate cigarettes as drug-delivery 
systems because of the addictive nature of nicotine. But the agency has 
rejected the idea of an all-out ban. 
</P>
<P>
 One other federal agency, the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration, which regulates job health and safety, has proposed 
rules that would ban smoking in all workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said Justice Department officials "will look at all the information that 
we have received to determine what would be the appropriate action" to take in 
the perjury allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to review all the issues and make an appropriate determination as to 
what the role of the Justice Department should be, and we're in the process of 
doing that," she said during her weekly press briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter from the seven members of Congress asked the department to look 
specifically at whether the tobacco company executives might have committed 
perjury during recent testimony before Congress when they insisted that 
nicotine is not addictive and that they do not deliberately spike their 
products with nicotine to "hook" smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also was asked to examine whether the industry had been aware 
of the health dangers of cigarettes and had intentionally waged a decades-long 
effort to hide them from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 A law enforcement official familiar with the department's inquiry said a 
review of perjury charges is "very preliminary" and probably would be difficult 
to sustain. The department's antitrust division also was reported to be 
examining allegations that major manufacturers had worked together to suppress 
competition in the development of new, less hazardous cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said the civil division also is involved -- reportedly to determine if 
federal labeling regulations were violated by manufacturers who added nicotine 
without disclosing it on cigarette packages. 
</P>
<P>
 In their testimony before Congress in April, which was delivered under oath, 
the executives acknowledged that cigarettes might increase the risk of 
developing some diseases but maintained they do not pose a definitive health 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin B. Bell, attorney general during the Jimmy Carter Administration and 
now a lawyer representing Sandefur, said in response to the allegations: "I've 
never heard of perjury based on giving an opinion. That would be an opinion 
that some folks might have a falling out over. We don't put folks in jail for 
that -- so far." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In their letter to Reno, the seven lawmakers said newly revealed internal 
documents showed that tobacco company officials in their testimony last month 
"deliberately misled Congress and the American people" about the dangers of 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers who have followed the tobacco controversy agreed that it would be 
difficult to convict the executives on criminal charges of perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a great deal of evidence to bring a perjury charge," Abbe D. Lowell, 
a defense attorney and former Justice Department official, said in an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most perjury cases are never brought unless you have two sworn statements 
that directly conflict. If a statement is couched as opinion, it's almost 
impossible to bring a perjury charge."

PANEL OKS CLINTON HEALTH CARE GOALS; LEGISLATION: COMMITTEE IS FIRST IN HOUSE 
TO BACK PLAN THAT HEWS TO THE PRESIDENT'S KEY OBJECTIVE OF GUARANTEED UNIVERSAL 
COVERAGE. APPROVAL ASSURES A FLOOR VOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton's beleaguered effort to overhaul the nation's health care 
system took a step forward in Congress on Thursday when the House Education and 
Labor Committee became the first committee in the House to approve a health 
plan that closely resembles the Administration's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on Capitol Hill, however, the fate of health legislation remained in 
question. In the Senate, a bipartisan group of moderate Finance Committee 
members encountered stiff resistance from both the left and the right as they 
attempted to fashion a bill that could require uninsured individuals to buy 
health coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of a bill similar to Clinton's was never in question in the Education 
and Labor Committee, the most liberal of the three House panels considering 
health legislation. Indeed, the committee also narrowly approved Thursday the 
most radical of the health care options before Congress: a Canadian-style, 
government-financed health care system known as "single payer." 
</P>
<P>
 But the committee's 27-17 vote in favor of a plan that hews to Clinton's goal 
of guaranteeing coverage for every American nonetheless marked a milestone and 
assured that health legislation can reach the House floor. The vote, generally 
along party lines, with two Democrats defecting, followed similar action 
earlier this month by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "With today's action, for the first time ever, a committee in each house of 
Congress has reported a bill that guarantees universal coverage," Clinton said 
in a statement issued by the White House after the vote. "They have broken the 
chokehold of special interests, and by choosing to cover everyone, have stood 
up instead for millions of hard-working, middle-class Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Chairman William D. Ford (D-Mich.): "It's going to be on the floor in a 
matter of weeks. . . . Everyone's going to get the chance to put up or shut 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Education and Labor Committee bill is significantly more generous than 
Clinton's. Over five years, it would add an extra $30 billion in health 
benefits and subsidies for the poor and small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the House Ways and Means Committee plodded through a series of 
minor amendments to its health bill but Chairman Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) called 
the lawmakers into unusual weekend sessions in a drive to finish work by 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, with a single exception, the Ways and Means panel has kept to its 
chairman's call to match spending on benefits with new revenues to pay for 
them. The biggest challenge ahead appears to be the financing provisions, 
coming up for votes early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The third House committee considering health legislation -- Energy and 
Commerce -- appears hopelessly deadlocked and perhaps unable to produce 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, House leaders will have the task of melding the committee bills 
into a single piece of legislation that they hope could come to a vote this 
summer. They also have promised advocates of a single-payer system, who number 
more than 90 in the 435-member House, that they will get a separate vote on 
their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), who will be leading the 
effort to meld differing versions of health care legislation, said he is now 
spending at least two-thirds of his time preparing the way for the House vote. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the going is slow, he insisted that he remains optimistic. "We are 
winning this fight in little bitty steps in little bitty ways every day," 
Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the House are watching the Senate -- and specifically its Finance 
Committee -- with a wary eye. They are reluctant to take a dangerous political 
stand on health care until they are confident that the Senate will not undercut 
them by insisting on something more conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes for a compromise in the Finance Committee are riding on the group of 
moderates, who have said they are close to agreement. Their plan would first 
put into place a set of changes in insurance practices that are aimed at making 
health coverage more affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, those measures alone would expand the number of people who have 
health coverage -- now about 85% of all Americans. But if that figure did not 
reach 95% by the year 2002, a so-called "individual mandate" would kick in, 
forcing people to buy health coverage, just as state law now requires them to 
buy insurance for their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The moderates' approach is an effort to reach Clinton's goal of universal 
coverage without his proposal to require businesses to pay for 80% of their 
workers' insurance. That has proved to be the single most controversial 
provision of the Clinton plan, with business groups warning that the additional 
cost would force many small firms to lay off workers or shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is far from certain that there would be any more support for a 
bill that could force middle-class families to spend thousands of dollars a 
year on health coverage. Moreover, it is unclear whether such a requirement 
could be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor and low-income people would receive government subsidies to help them 
afford the coverage. However, paying for those subsidies could mean hundreds of 
billions of dollars in new taxes over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives already had expressed opposition to the individual mandate. On 
Thursday, liberal groups chimed in as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Senate Finance Committee is moving toward abandoning millions of American 
health care consumers," said Robert Carolla, legislative counsel to Consumers 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to each member of the Finance Committee, the Health Care Reform 
Project -- a coalition of 56 organizations that support the President's plan -- 
also said that it opposes the alternative being crafted by the moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly urge you to reject this approach or any others that fail to meet 
the test of guaranteeing all Americans affordable comprehensive coverage," the 
groups wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton continued her effort to rally the 
President's supporters, telling a lunch-time audience a story about a young 
girl who died of meningitis after her parents, who did not have health 
insurance, were sent away from a hospital with a bottle of Tylenol for their 
child's fever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to live in a country where the care of children is not determined on 
whether or not their parents have health insurance," Mrs. Clinton told her 
audience at a luncheon sponsored by the Women's Legal Defense Fund. "This is an 
issue that has an ethical dimension, a moral dimension. It says a lot about 
what kind of people we are, what our values are, what we care about. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way for all of us to be secure, and particularly for those among us 
who already are vulnerable or are more likely to become vulnerable -- women and 
their children -- to be taken care of is to absolutely commit ourselves to 
giving health care coverage to every single American."

COLUMN ONE; ITALIANS' BABY BOOM GOES BUST; LONG KNOWN FOR ITS LARGE FAMILIES, 
THE NATION NOW HAS THE WORLD'S LOWEST BIRTHRATE. THE BAMBINI GAP HAS SPURRED 
IMMIGRATION, PROMPTED GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES AND FUELED FEARS OF A GRAYING 
SOCIETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 La Mamma is the same dominant figure in Italy today that she was in Caesar's 
time, but she is raising fewer bambini than ever, and her changing role is 
forcing a social revolution in a country that is running out of children. 
</P>
<P>
 A land where baby clothes hanging on urban wash lines has been as much a 
tradition as pasta is now graying rapidly. Italy's birthrate today is the 
lowest in its history and the lowest in the world -- 1.3 babies per woman. And 
that number is falling. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline has been a long time building; now, long-range scenarios of its 
impact are beginning to alarm some specialists. And for the first time, the 
Italian government is casting about for social and economic policy initiatives 
to revitalize the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's bambini gap is at once a product of change and a catalyst for further 
change. On the one hand, it triggers here-and-now challenges that reach into 
every corner of national life. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other, it implicitly offers an against-the-odds chance for a new life 
to ambitious immigrants like Fan Shu Li. When she left her native town near 
Shanghai four years ago, Fan says, she knew coffee as an exotic luxury that 
only foreigners drank. Now, she serves cappuccino for a living in the shadow of 
the 2,000-year-old Pantheon here -- one of thousands of new arrivals doing jobs 
for which there are too few native Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 If current rates persist, in another century instead of 57 million Italians 
there will be about 15 million, half older than 60, said Antonio Golini, 
director of the government-financed Institute for Population Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "High or low fertility only become dangerous if they last too long. Italy is 
reaching that point," he said. "If the trend continues for another five to 10 
years, it will be really alarming, because it becomes so difficult to reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers, Golini notes, are inexorable. If Italy's birthrate were to rise 
overnight to two children per woman, it would still take 30 years for the 
population to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy is aging quickest, but all of Western Europe is shunning children in the 
waning years of a tumultuous era. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe had about one-third the world's population when the 20th Century began. 
Today, it has one-tenth, the consequence of both its falling population and 
exponential growth in the Third World. Fertility rates for Europe of 2.8 in 
1965 fell to 2.1 in 1975, and to about 1.5 by 1990. By 2020, there will be 4 
million fewer West Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 12 member states of the European Union, only in Ireland are enough 
babies being born to keep the population growing. Italy, where Pope John Paul 
II regularly rails against birth control, is the most notorious dropout: 
Already there are only 83 children younger than 14 for every 100 adults older 
than 65. There are 11.5 million Italians younger than 18; that is 4 million 
fewer than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite unflagging Vatican opposition to artificial birth control and 
abortion, Catholic Spain and Portugal join Orthodox Greece and formerly 
Communist eastern Germany near the bottom of the European fertility charts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, big, close-knit families have historically formed the backbone of 
society: Jobs, recommendations, partnerships, doctors, plumbers, priests, 
lawyers -- all sprang from a seemingly endless chain of cousins and in-laws. 
Even 20 years ago, children were still fashionable, as one New York woman 
discovered when she married a Roman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have six, and not a lot of money but faith in their futures," said 
Gretchen Triulzi, 54. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people these days are more materialistic. They want designer clothes 
and to keep the lifestyle they had as singles. Me? I'd do it my way all over 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 More typical of today's mother, Monica Falcone is a professional woman who has 
just turned 40 and has a 5-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have been affected by the fact there is no more child culture in 
Italy. There is no space for children, socially or even physically in a city 
with few parks, playgrounds and nursery schools," she said. "Someone once said 
that I haven't allowed my life to be built around my child. She meant that as a 
compliment, but I'm not sure I like it." 
</P>
<P>
 What triggered Italy's dramatic turn away from children? 
</P>
<P>
 All the same things that have lowered birthrates in other parts of the 
industrialized world, says Carla Collicelli, deputy director of Censis, a 
private research center: industrialization, education, communications, the 
pill. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is different in Italy is the speed of change. It was an agrarian 
country, and women came late to the labor market," Collicelli said. "Now, women 
working is a question of economics but also of identity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, 2.1 births per woman keep the population stable. In 
Italy, women tell pollsters that 2.2 children is their ideal. In fact, they are 
having one baby less. "We call the difference between the ideal and reality the 
'deficit child,' " Golini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever-high economic and social expectations are often the reason for the 
deficit child. Stress, infertility and the fact that male attitudes have not 
changed much are also part of the equation, he said. As ever, kids are women's 
work in Italy. Often for a mother with a job outside the home, her second child 
is one cradle too many. 
</P>
<P>
 Maternity benefits are liberal, and women routinely return to their jobs. But 
if, for instance, after a second child a woman wants a job less than full time, 
the workplace has trouble accommodating her. 
</P>
<P>
 Collicelli laments what she calls "an absence of flexibility" in employment 
laws. About 5% of jobs are filled by part-time workers, the lowest percentage 
in Europe, Golini said. In places like Britain and the Netherlands, part-timers 
are as much as 30% of the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women want to work, but the problem in Italy is that once you leave there's 
no way back," said Collicelli. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, the shortfall is taking a national toll. In such cities as Venice, 
where the population is rapidly dwindling, public schools actively compete for 
students -- to save teachers' jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Italy, small towns that once bristled with energy are becoming 
melancholic preserves for the old; the women in their kitchens, the men with 
their canes and wool caps around the piazza reliving old times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no jobs here, people go to the cities, population is dropping, the 
family is in crisis -- so we decided to do something about it," said Ivo 
Boscardin, a 44-year-old schoolteacher and part-time mayor of Enego, a mountain 
village of 2,300 people in northern Italy. To encourage growth, the City 
Council will pay about $400 per year in nursery school fees for parents who 
have three or more children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is only a gesture, but judging from the national response, it has touched 
a nerve," Boscardin said by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 More than civic vitality is hostage to the deficit children. The national 
health and pension systems are in financial distress. They will need drastic 
overhaul as Italians retire, grow older and fall ill with proportionately fewer 
of their countrymen and women to shoulder the cost. Already, the government 
pays more pensions than there are people working in Italy, and as in the United 
States, many workers are deferring retirement until they can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of this: fewer people in a rich country and an array of necessary, 
sweaty jobs that Italians will no longer do despite serious unemployment among 
the young. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination makes Italy an inviting target for enterprising outsiders. 
Last month, police on Italy's Adriatic coast broke up a ring smuggling Asians 
and East Europeans into the country via Albania. 
</P>
<P>
 Large Italian cities such as Milan and Rome are still more homogeneous than 
big cities in France or Britain. But they are rapidly acquiring an 
international cast that can be only partly explained by an official 30,000 
immigrants a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, about 1 million foreigners live in Italy, but some estimates 
say there are as many as 400,000 more. 
</P>

 Rafaele Ciarelli, a law professor who counsels immigrant groups, estimates 
that 200,000 foreigners are in Rome -- 120,000 of them illegally. Rodrigo 
Hidalgo, president of an association of expatriate Peruvians, says there are 
60,000 in Italy -- 40,000 of them illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers' presence is pervasive. Italians still work as seamstresses, but 
not many as house cleaners: The homes of well-to-do Romans are cleaned almost 
exclusively by Filipinas and other Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty years ago, my relatives in Tuscany remember asking black American GIs 
for permission to touch them -- they had never seen a black person," said John 
Navone, a Jesuit theologian from Seattle who has lived in Italy for 31 years. 
</P>
<P>
 There is hardly a sidewalk in central Rome without Senegalese salesmen hawking 
faux designer sunglasses and pocketbooks. And knots of Roman Somalis, 
Ethiopians and Nigerians form and dissolve around the clock at the vast Termini 
train station. 
</P>
<P>
 At the high end of the economic scale, boutiques of Italian designers in 
cities like Rome and Florence boast Japanese sales clerks. There is a boomlet 
of Korean and Indian restaurants in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 When a fellow bread buyer couldn't speak basic Italian early one recent 
morning, she was offered help in French, under the assumption she was West 
African. She replied in Portuguese -- she was a Brazilian newly arrived to cook 
for a wealthy family. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Cold War, it was Poles who washed windshields at Roman traffic 
lights. By now they have moved into blue-collar industries and Fiats of their 
own, and the best corners are patrolled by North Africans and Bangladeshis. 
</P>
<P>
 Navone remembers a single hard-to-find Chinese restaurant when he came to Rome 
30 years ago. Now, they are everywhere, the only ethnic food (discounting 
American hamburgers and french fries) to make a dent in King Pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist Collicelli was surprised to learn the nationality of the oven 
master at a legendary Roman pizza parlor: "A Filipino? That is interesting. So 
many pizza makers are Egyptians nowadays." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the three movements in Italy's young right-wing coalition government 
are anti-immigrant. The "they'll overrun us" school spews alarming figures. 
</P>
<P>
 At current rates, in 30 years Italy's population will drift from 57 million to 
about 52 million. At their present levels of growth, in that same period 
Morocco will go from 26 million to 47 million, Nigeria from 115 million to 285 
million and Iran from 61 million to 144 million. Immigrants from all three 
countries routinely come to Italy -- legally or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, we see no economic, social or cultural factors to make the 
numbers change for Italy," said Golini. "The state should act to remove 
obstacles that stop people from having the children they would like. We need 
practical changes and structural changes." 
</P>
<P>
 An innovation of the new government of Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi (a 
billionaire father of five) is a Ministry of the Family presided over by 
49-year-old child psychiatrist Antonio Guidi. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guidi, a father of three who took office last month, foresees across-the-board 
reforms to strengthen the family: expanding child care, making it easier for 
employers to hire part-time workers, offering tax relief for couples with 
children and financial aid to young families buying a house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many couples who decide to start a family don't know how. There is no house, 
and no work. What we must do is find ways to help them," Guidi said. And, he 
said, the government must win back Italian cities from the automobile and make 
them more livable for families. 
</P>
<P>
 Reformers who hope to reverse population decline say official audacity can 
help: Sweden's birthrate soared after women who had two children within 30 
months were offered two long, well-paid leaves.  
</P>
<P>
 In larger Italy, though, it is clear that the bambini gap will be a long time 
closing. That is hardly dismaying to thousands of new Romans like Fan Shu Li. 
</P>
<P>
 "My name is Ana now. I'm here to stay," she said. Ana's Italian is still 
shaky, but she makes cappuccino like a Roman.

WORKFARE SERVICE JOBS DIFFICULT TO FIND; WELFARE: THE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO LOWER 
PUBLIC RELIEF COSTS IS SUFFERING ITS HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE EVER -- NEARLY 
60%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One recent morning before dawn, a long line of bleary-eyed men waited outside 
a welfare office on Skid Row, primed with coffee and cigarettes to pay their 
debt to society.  
</P>
<P>
 For some, the prospect of cleaning county beaches in exchange for $212 in 
monthly welfare benefits seemed fair. Others familiar with the system hung back 
at the end of the line, hoping there wouldn't be enough room in the county vans 
to take them to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 For 46 years, Los Angeles County has required single, able-bodied welfare 
recipients like these men to earn their monthly checks by cleaning restrooms, 
raking flower beds and performing other tasks for government agencies and 
nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a scene repeated throughout the county every weekday because of a 
shortage of community service jobs, 21 of the 60 men waiting to help clean 
county beaches were sent home by the time the sun had crept up over the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from being a success, the county's General Relief workfare program is 
posting its highest unemployment rate ever -- nearly 60% -- as it struggles to 
find public service jobs for thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
 As the county's experience demonstrates, workfare is not the panacea its most 
ardent advocates hope it will be. Here and elsewhere, it has failed to 
significantly reduce welfare costs or to raise people out of poverty, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem isn't the people -- most of whom bust stereotypes of recipients as 
ne'er-do-wells by showing up to work. Instead, the county program is bedeviled 
by: 
</P>
<P>
 * Employers' reluctance to use welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 * Union opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 * A shortage of supervisors for the new workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Competition from other sources of free labor, including the 74,000 people 
sentenced annually by the courts to community service in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an easy sell," said James Adler, chairman of the county's welfare 
commission. "As I look around the county, I think there are hundreds of jobs 
they could do, but the problem is getting government agencies to sign on."  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the lack of slots, 16,000 -- or about 40% -- of the 41,500 
recipients eligible to work end up doing so, down from 70% four years ago. 
About 25,500 of those who could work get their checks without having to pick up 
a shred of litter. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts disagree about what the impact of the public service jobs shortage 
would be on President Clinton's welfare reform proposal, which seeks to impose 
a two-year limit on cash benefits and requires younger recipients to find work 
themselves or take a government job. Direct parallels are difficult to draw 
because the President's program would apply primarily to welfare mothers, while 
the county's workfare requirement involves the mostly male population on 
General Relief. Another significant difference is that Clinton's plan includes 
funds for education and training, whereas the county program does not. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House policy aide Bruce Reed, co-chairman of the Administration's 
welfare reform group, said earlier this year that the difficulty of creating 
jobs is one of the reasons the Administration plans to initially impose the 
two-year limit on young recipients only. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to end up with a situation where a large part of the target 
population is exempt because there is not enough work to go around like in L.A. 
County," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To market the workfare program, the county produced a slick 13-minute video 
and mailed it to dozens of government agencies and private nonprofit groups 
last fall. The video, with its catchy synthesizer music and upbeat message, has 
helped drum up jobs for 500 more recipients in the past six months. But during 
the same period, the county lost more jobs than it gained, and employs 267 
fewer recipients than in September, said Nancy Diaz, the county's workfare 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think it's real easy to find jobs, but we just can't keep up," Diaz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz and the other five county employees assigned to develop workfare slots 
are used to falling behind. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past four years, the county has nearly doubled the number of work 
slots, creating work for 16,000 recipients, as agencies that were unable to 
hire new workers because of budget cutbacks drew increasingly on the pool of 
cheap labor. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time that the number of work slots increased, the pool of 
eligible workfare participants tripled as more and more people went on welfare. 
Thus, the percentage of those who actually work dropped from nearly 
three-quarters to two-fifths of those eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 The county itself is the biggest employer of welfare recipients, using more 
than 10,000 a month to clean local beaches and parks, answer telephones and 
even guard parking lots. Most recipients receive a monthly grant of $212 and in 
exchange are supposed to work about six days a month at the minimum wage rate 
of $4.25 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen other local cities, school districts and state agencies employ almost 
6,000 recipients a month to help repair roads, stock shelves and sweep floors. 
But only seven private, nonprofit organizations countywide employ them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we don't use them is there's too much paperwork involved," said 
Mary Ann Osness, volunteer coordinator for Pacific Hospital of Long Beach, 
which recently declined to join the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another nonprofit hospital, Glendale Adventist Medical Center, uses dozens 
of recipients each month and has hired several of them permanently as orderlies 
and clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I like about the program is that I'm not obligated to take anyone I 
don't want," said spokeswoman Sandy Contreras. "I can do my own screening." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone is satisfied with the level of screening in the workfare 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a year ago, the Los Angeles Unified School District employed about 4,000 
recipients a month, largely as janitors and groundskeepers. The responsibility 
for screening the workers fell to the school district because the county, which 
spends about $270,000 annually to administer the workfare program, lacks the 
money to fingerprint and check each recipient's record. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district only ran background checks when the behavior of welfare 
recipients raised suspicion, because the inquiries cost $64.50 apiece, 
officials said. Last spring, several of those checks revealed prior convictions 
for assault and sexual molestation, they said. Acting on legal advice, the 
district decided to stop using welfare recipients once those remaining on the 
job go off the rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the worst happened. Earlier this year, a recipient who worked as a 
janitor at a South Gate elementary school was arrested and charged with 
murdering an 82-year-old woman who was a longtime volunteer there. Although the 
man had no prior criminal record, the incident hardened the district's resolve 
not to use welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effect of losing them will be dramatic," said Walt Greene, LAUSD's 
director of employee relations. "But we can't afford to risk it."  
</P>
<P>
 Competition from other sources of cheap labor is another obstacle. Countywide, 
welfare recipients compete with the more than 6,100 criminals sentenced to 
community service each month. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation, for instance, relies on people 
sentenced to community service or in early-release programs about eight times 
as often as welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them (welfare recipients) are real good workers, but their incentives 
to work aren't quite as high as someone who could go to jail," said Larry 
Ornay, a Caltrans regional manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the shortage of public service jobs is that agencies lack 
the personnel to supervise welfare recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not really free workers," said Eddy Tanaka, director of the county's 
welfare department. "Even with simple things like graffiti removal, you have to 
have enough equipment and supplies, and people to supervise them."  
</P>
<P>
 The county Department of Beaches and Harbors, for instance, tried to 
accommodate more welfare recipients by promoting county employees who 
previously cleaned the beaches to supervise them. But a lack of vans to 
transport the workers is still a problem, resulting in the 21 men being left 
behind at the Skid Row welfare center recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those left behind, there was both relief and mild regret. "Who wants to 
work for peanuts? I want a real job," said Indris Ahmad, 44. But the county 
does not have the money to even make a systematic effort to match recipients' 
skills with their work assignments, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They give you garbage jobs," said Robert Perna, 47, a former welfare 
recipient and workfare participant whose typing skills led to a job at Glendale 
Adventist Hospital. "It only led to a job for me because I begged them over and 
over again to place me at a work site where I could use my intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Union opposition may also hinder the creation of public service jobs for 
welfare recipients. In some cases, local unions have added to the cost of using 
welfare recipients by getting pay raises for government employees who are 
assigned to supervise them.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're basically against it," said Marcel Bell, a business representative with 
the Service Employees International Union, which represents thousands of Los 
Angeles county and city workers.  
</P>
<P>
 The union's biggest fear is that its members will be displaced by the cheap 
labor pool.  
</P>
<P>
 "What workfare does is remove the incentive to hire new workers," Bell said.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the city of Pico Rivera has saved at least $789,000 by using welfare 
recipients to help fill the gap left by about 35 municipal workers who have 
retired or quit in the past 30 months, city officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, more than one obstacle comes into play.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department, for instance, credits welfare recipients 
with turning the West Los Angeles police station on Butler Avenue into a 
gleaming showpiece. Under the supervision of maintenance man Bill Wisner, about 
25 recipients a month wax footlockers, polish wood doors and moldings, and even 
bleach the sidewalks around the station to rid them of stains. 
</P>
<P>
 But the LAPD is wary of rapidly expanding its use of welfare recipients, 
partly because criminals sentenced to community service already help out at 
many of the stations, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another impediment is transportation, they said. Plans to use welfare 
recipients at the training academy are on hold while officials figure out how 
to get them to the site in the absence of bus service there, said Don Teich, a 
senior personnel analyst for the LAPD.  
</P>
<P>
 Welfare officials are making an all-out effort to create more jobs by urging 
the county's 43 departments to employ more recipients.  
</P>
<P>
 But the county's top welfare official is pessimistic.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Catch-22 is that there is insufficient money to provide support services, 
like equipment, transportation and supervisors, for the workfare program," 
Tanaka said.

HILL RESIGNS BUT FAILS TO SET DEPARTURE DATE; SENATE: COMMITTEE PUTS ASIDE 
MOTION TO EXPEL THE CONVICTED LAWMAKER, PENDING CLARIFICATION OF HIS APPARENT 
INTENTION TO REMAIN UNTIL SENTENCING. 
</P>

<P>
 Republican state Sen. Frank Hill of Whittier, convicted last week of 
corruption, resigned Thursday, but threw the Senate into confusion by refusing 
to say when he will actually leave. 
</P>
<P>
 In a one-paragraph letter, Hill, 40, said his resignation would "become 
effective immediately upon an official judgment of conviction," which commonly 
occurs when a defendant is sentenced to prison. For Hill, this is scheduled to 
happen Sept. 12, when he appears in U.S. District Court to face sentencing on 
his conviction for extortion, conspiracy and money laundering. He faces a 
sentence that could exceed six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who has refused public comment since his conviction, declined to 
elaborate on his letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill submitted his resignation shortly after a demand was made on the Senate 
floor by Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael), chairman of the Ethics Committee, 
for Hill to be expelled immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene told colleagues that to ignore the federal court jury verdict "is to 
turn our back on the criminal justice system which we have established." 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of this state have a right to expect that we will judge convicted 
criminals in this house by the same standards by which we judge others," Greene 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Senate Rules Committee put aside consideration of the expulsion motion 
after it received Hill's letter. Members were puzzled by Hill's failure to set 
a date for his departure and said they needed more time to clarify whether he 
would leave by Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Gov. Pete Wilson, a fellow Republican, was asked by reporters 
whether he thinks the Senate should expel Hill. "Yes, I do," he said. "I have 
sympathy for a lot of people who are in trouble. That doesn't mean I condone 
their actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, elected statewide officials must resign when convicted of a 
serious crime. However, the requirement does not apply to legislators, who can 
be expelled only by a two-thirds vote of their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, popular among many legislators, appeared to be gambling that supporters 
of expulsion could not muster enough votes, at least before Sept. 12, 
legislative sources said privately. 
</P>
<P>
 The last expulsion from the Senate occurred in 1905 and also involved a 
criminal scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear from the debate on the Senate floor over Greene's proposal that 
the expulsion resolution will face stiff opposition in obtaining the needed 27 
votes in the 40-member chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was the first Republican lawmaker tried as part of a lengthy federal 
political corruption investigation that surfaced nearly six years ago when the 
offices of Hill and three other lawmakers were searched by FBI agents. Hill was 
videotaped accepting a $2,500 honorarium from an undercover FBI agent posing as 
a businessman seeking a legislative favor in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rules Committee stripped Hill of his committee assignments but did not 
defuse the controversy over a convicted felon remaining in the Senate as a 
lawmaker. Hill voluntarily agreed not to vote on bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill has secluded himself in his Capitol office and has continued to draw his 
$52,500-a-year salary and $101-a-day tax-free living allowance.  
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) said he wants to get 
clarification from lawyers before deciding whether an expulsion proceeding 
should go forward next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that the lack of a quick resignation will anger the public, 
Lockyer said, "It is hard to get people to understand that basic justice 
necessitates some fairness and due process. And even politicians should be 
granted those basic rights." 
</P>
<P>
 He described Hill as contrite and heartbroken over how the conviction is 
affecting his wife and three children. Lockyer said that Hill believes "he is 
the victim of an out-of-control criminal justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, Hill walked through the Senate chamber, greeting colleagues 
and staff members. "I'll have an announcement by the end of the day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, Greene introduced the measure demanding Hill's expulsion, 
triggering a spirited debate, including supporters of Hill who urged against 
hasty action. "We have to ask ourselves . . . what if the conviction is 
reversed?" said Sen. Nicholas Petris (D-Oakland). "I don't believe it is 
necessary to rush to judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate GOP leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, who testified on Hill's behalf at the 
trial, said lawmakers regard Hill as a good friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like a lot of tragedies that enter people's lives . . . I think he was 
more of a victim of circumstances and the venue than he is of committing a 
crime," Maddy told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But fellow GOP Sen. William Craven of Oceanside, a member of the Rules 
Committee, introduced a measure requiring legislators to resign when convicted 
of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to sound like an ogre, but we are not judging (Hill) on the 
basis of being a nice guy. The people don't understand a lot of the nuances 
about how legislators feel toward each other. They say, 'What's that got to do 
with it? If they are guilty, they are guilty.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some Democrats indicated privately that if Hill were to resign effective July 
1, Gov. Wilson could consolidate a special election to fill the seat with the 
Nov. 1 general election. This would save local taxpayers the cost of a special 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Likely contenders in the GOP district include Republican Assemblymen Paul 
Horcher of Diamond Bar and Richard L. Mountjoy of Arcadia.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; PRESIDENT PROMISES TO VISIT STATE ON BEHALF OF BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California Treasurer Kathleen Brown picked up a commitment from President 
Clinton on Thursday to campaign throughout the state in support of her bid to 
defeat Gov. Pete Wilson in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 30-minute meeting in the Oval Office, Clinton said he would be happy 
to appear on Brown's behalf in California "if she asks me." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm asking, I'm asking," Brown said. "Come ride our bus." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's backing is the first public indication that his Administration will 
lend strong support to the Democratic candidate as the governor's race heats 
up. The President is expected to make appearances in California this fall, and 
Vice President Gore, who also attended the meeting, will host a San Francisco 
fund-raiser in July, aides said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown called Clinton "a great asset in California" and said she welcomes his 
support. The President enjoyed a 55% approval rating in a Times poll last 
month, only slightly down from a 58% positive ranking in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Clinton has done more for California's economy than Wilson has. "I 
told him he's the best governor California's had in the last 12 years," Brown 
said. "And what we need is to replace the one we've got with a Democratic 
governor who will be working with the President and working with Congress to 
revive the California economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's camp responded with glee at the prospect of Clinton, who has 
struggled in popularity polls nationwide, stumping for Brown this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time they get through with health care and Whitewater, we'll pay his 
air fare," said Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur. "Now that Kathleen Brown 
has fallen behind in the polls, she is looking for help anywhere she can find 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 On a one-day trip to Washington, Brown also met privately with First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton to discuss health care issues, huddled with members of 
the California congressional delegation and attended a fund-raiser sponsored by 
Emily's List, the feminist organization that gathers millions of dollars for 
pro-choice Democratic female candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's trip followed Wilson's appearance Wednesday before the Senate 
Appropriations Committee to lobby for federal reimbursement of the state's cost 
of providing services to illegal immigrants. At the hearing, Sen. Robert C. 
Byrd (D-W. Va.) called Wilson's complaints hypocritical because Wilson's 
Department of Health Services last year actively urged undocumented pregnant 
women to apply for a publicly funded program to pay their medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said Thursday that she does not think it was necessary for the state to 
promote the availability of government-paid services to illegal immigrants who 
are pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 In her meeting with Clinton, Brown said they discussed illegal immigration 
issues and the urgent need for assigning more law enforcement agents on the 
Mexican border. The treasurer said she also stressed to Clinton the importance 
of defeating a November ballot initiative that would deny public education and 
non-emergency medical care to undocumented immigrants in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial measure, called Save Our State, "is not the way to deal with 
the subject of illegal immigration," Brown said. "It is going to cost tens of 
millions of dollars for Californians, threatens education, and could result in 
greater crime and violence on our streets by putting schoolchildren out on the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton did not express a position on the initiative. Wilson has indicated 
that he supports it.

FEINSTEIN AD SAYS SHE STEPPED IN TO SAVE JOBS IN RIVAL'S DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein continued her effort Thursday to check the momentum of 
Republican challenger Michael Huffington with a pair of new television 
commercials that highlight the congressman's problems in his home district. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-second spots focus on a controversy freshman Rep. Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara) set off last year when he declined a request by one of his district's 
largest employers, Raytheon Corp., to help it seek State Department waivers for 
selling high-tech military equipment to Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ads, about half a dozen workers from the company offer testimonials 
that portray Feinstein as the legislator who picked up a ball that Huffington 
dropped, saving hundreds of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael Huffington wasn't there for us and Sen. Feinstein was," a woman says. 
"He didn't seem to feel that it was his duty to help one single company in his 
district," a man adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Raytheon officials said Thursday that the employees were acting on their own 
time as private citizens and that the company does not want to take sides in 
California's U.S. Senate race. The company has, however, contributed to the 
Democrat's campaign and praised the handling of the Taiwan issue by Feinstein, 
whose help was sought after Huffington declined to become involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington told reporters and company officials last fall that he believes 
helping Raytheon would have effectively made him into a special interest 
lobbyist and compromised his promise to represent all groups equally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to be a paid or unpaid lobbyist for any company," Huffington 
told a Times reporter earlier this year. "That's not my job. I represent 
everyone equally." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also charged that Feinstein's involvement "smacks of conflict," and 
his campaign said Thursday that the senator's action was a political pay-back 
for contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of Raytheon, she is California's vending machine -- you put your 
money in, you get something back," said Huffington campaign manager Bob 
Schuman. "If we were going to get into this tit-for-tat thing . . . there are a 
ton of companies that fled out of San Francisco when she was mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein campaign officials said, however, that the senator's interest in 
helping a company gain access to foreign markets was sparked by the struggling 
California economy and the need for jobs -- not the aid of a contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dianne's view is that . . . when people have problems with government, to 
fight for them," said Kam Kuwata, Feinstein's campaign manager. "Huffington has 
said he believes in the general interest, not the special interest. We do not 
believe that workers are a special interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Coulter, director of communications for Raytheon at its Lexington, Mass., 
corporate headquarters, said the company is still competing for the Taiwan 
contract after State Department officials, encouraged by Feinstein, waived 
restrictions last April on the sale of military equipment to the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Coulter also said the company has not disclosed whether any of the Santa 
Barbara facility's 1,364 employees are at risk if Raytheon does not win the 
Taiwan sale, although the ad suggests Feinstein saved about 250 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercials, to be broadcast statewide for about two weeks, are the second 
pair of ads Feinstein has used in the campaign, both communicating unflattering 
images of Huffington while many California voters still don't know much about 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The first pair of commercials began shortly before the June 7 primary, when 
polls showed the two candidates in a race that has become surprisingly close 
after Huffington spent several million dollars on unanswered television 
commercials during the spring that attacked Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's hometown district has been a source of controversy that was 
underscored in the Republican primary when it voted for his challenger, William 
E. Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington was elected to the district, which includes most of Santa Barbara 
and San Luis Obispo counties, in 1992 after spending a record $5.2 million of 
his own money. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomer made some enemies in the district by unseating a veteran GOP 
congressman who still maintains many loyal followers. Then he sparked anger 
last fall when he announced that he would abandon the Santa Barbara seat to run 
for the U.S. Senate.

PREGNANCY AND BREAST CANCER POSE LETHAL RISK; HEALTH: A NEW STUDY SAYS 
EXPECTANT WOMEN WHO HAVE THE DISEASE ARE THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO DIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Women who are pregnant when breast cancer is diagnosed are three times as 
likely to die from the disease as women who are not, Texas researchers report. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, a recent pregnancy, extending as far back as four years before 
the diagnosis of the cancer, also increases the risk of a fatal outcome, but to 
a lesser degree, epidemiologists from the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in 
Houston will report in Saturday's issue of the international medical journal 
The Lancet. 
</P>
<P>
 The results, based on studies of 407 women in their 20s, may be due to changes 
in hormonal distribution or immune response during pregnancy, the researchers 
speculated. The new findings may explain why younger women, as a group, have a 
poorer prognosis than older women from breast cancer, said Dr. Vincent F. 
Guinee of M.D. Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers also found that the mortality associated with breast cancer is 
independent of how far advanced the tumor is when it is detected. Results of 
previous, smaller studies that hinted at a pregnancy-breast cancer link 
suggested that the results may have occurred because breast cancer is detected 
at a later stage in pregnant women, perhaps because swelling of the breasts and 
other factors associated with pregnancy masked the tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took all those things into account and we still see a large effect from 
pregnancy," Guinee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Eugenia Calle of the American Cancer Society cautioned that women in their 
20s represent less than 1% of all cases of breast cancer. "We're concerned that 
young women might be very fearful (because of the study). We need to reiterate 
that it is a very rare disease at that age." 
</P>
<P>
 Among women under the age of 30, one in every 2,426 develops breast cancer. By 
the age of 45, the number has grown to one in every 96. Over a woman's life 
span, the risk of getting breast cancer is one in nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Calle and Guinee said the results with the young women should hold for 
pregnant women of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 About 182,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year in the 
United States, making it the most common form of cancer in women, according to 
the American Cancer Society. About 46,000 will die from the disease -- second 
among women only to lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Guinee and others have been interested in the link between pregnancy and 
breast cancer, he said, because of evidence showing that younger women have 
poorer prognoses than older ones. "We could see that 20-year-olds don't do as 
well as 30-year-olds, 30-year-olds don't do as well as 40-year-olds, and so 
on," he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Researchers hadn't looked at it in terms of what might be causing (the higher 
mortality rate in younger women)," he said. "It was generally assumed that 
cancers might be more aggressive in younger women, or that they might be 
detected later (in the course of the disease). Our results show that it is the 
pregnancy itself that is responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Guinee's international team studied 407 breast cancer patients who received 
care between 1978 and 1988 at one of the nine member institutions of the 
International Cancer Patient Data Exchange System. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, they found that women who were pregnant when the breast cancer was 
diagnosed were 3.26 times as likely to die from the disease as women who had 
never been pregnant. When they adjusted for the stage of the disease at the 
time of detection -- the size of the tumor, the number of lymph nodes involved 
and so on -- the risk was reduced, but the women were still 2.83 times as 
likely to die. 
</P>
<P>
 They also looked at the effect of previous pregnancies on outcome. For women 
who had been pregnant in the year before the tumor was diagnosed, the risk of 
dying was about 15% less than for those who were pregnant at the time of the 
diagnosis. For those pregnant two years before, the risk was 30% less. The risk 
did not return to normal until the pregnancy had occurred five years before 
diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely cause for the increase risk is hormonal changes, said Dr. 
Janet Mohle-Boetani of the Santa Clara County Department of Health. Estrogen 
levels rise appreciably during pregnancy, and the female hormone has previously 
been shown to promote the growth of breast tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatively, the risk could be associated with changes in the immune system. 
Pregnant women have a slightly reduced immune efficiency and are more 
susceptible to infectious diseases, she said. "Immunologic changes might also 
predispose to poor control of a developing tumor."

BOOST FOR TEACHER-IN-SPACE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairman of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration committee 
reviewing the teacher-in-space program said Thursday that he favors reviving 
the project but that the space agency is not close to a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of Sharon Christa McAuliffe, meanwhile, said that renewing the 
program would just bring back bad memories of the accident that killed her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 McAuliffe, of Concord, N.H., was selected in a national contest to become the 
first teacher in space. She and six crew mates were killed in 1986 when the 
shuttle Challenger exploded less than two minutes after launch. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Ladwig said NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin named a 12-member 
committee this month to review the program and make a recommendation about its 
future. The committee will hold its first meeting next month. "I'm personally 
leaning toward recommending that it be revived, but it will be up to the review 
panel," said Ladwig, an agency executive. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Barbara Morgan, the McCall, Ida., teacher who trained alongside 
McAuliffe as the designated backup, is still poised to fly and has made many 
speeches on behalf of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Corrigan, McAuliffe's mother, opposes resuming the program but said her 
daughter "accomplished her mission. She got kids excited about space and 
teachers excited about being teachers. She elevated the level of the 
profession."

WHITE HOUSE AFRICA CONFERENCE UPSETS BLACK LEADERS; FOREIGN POLICY: EFFORT IS 
CRITICIZED FOR POOR PLANNING AND INEPT POLITICAL ETIQUETTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A White House conference on Africa that was supposed to showcase the Clinton 
Administration's concern for the continent's social, political and economic 
problems has instead alienated the entire Congressional Black Caucus and the 
most prominent pro-Africa group in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day session, which starts Sunday but was formally announced only 
Wednesday, has been marred by poor planning, botched diplomacy and inept 
politics, according to invitees who are boycotting the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Robinson, the outspoken director of TransAfrica, turned down an 
invitation to lead a discussion group at the conference because of President 
Clinton's "egregiously bad faith" in dealing with black Haitian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "For as he treats blacks from one place, so must he necessarily feel about 
blacks from another," Robinson wrote in a letter to the conference organizer, 
Donald Steinberg, the senior National Security Council officer for Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-member Congressional Black Caucus will not participate in the 
conference because of disputes over the Administration's Africa policies and 
because many members felt slighted because they did not receive formal 
invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the strangest White House conference I've ever seen. There was no 
formal consultation with the caucus," said Rep. Donald M. Payne (D-N.J.), who 
chairs the caucus's foreign policy task force. "It's kind of noble that they've 
decided to think about a conference on Africa, but the manner in which it's 
been planned and executed leaves me concerned about how much of a commitment 
there really is for Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 One aide to a black congressman dismissed the conference as "a public 
relations event, that's what it is. We don't expect anyone from the caucus to 
be there." 
</P>
<P>
 The flap has exacerbated already testy relations between Clinton and the 
African American community. While black lawmakers said their boycott of the 
conference is based on objections to the Administration's Africa policy and 
breaches of political etiquette, the tension between blacks and the White House 
has roots in other disputes with Clinton over personnel, welfare reform and 
anti-crime measures. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers apologized for the changing guest 
list and agenda. She blamed the confusion on fast-moving events in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We regret any problems that have been caused by the late invitations or the 
changing invitations," she said. "I think the agenda for the conference has 
developed quickly as issues facing Africa have changed -- shifted somewhat over 
the course of the last few weeks. Certainly . . . this will include a broad 
variety of people. I think that the list of attendees grew as word of the 
conference spread and people wanted to participate." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's Africa policy took another punch on Thursday in a Human 
Rights Watch report, which said Clinton's "shameful response to Rwanda suggests 
that human rights in Africa do not become a priority even when abuses amount to 
genocide." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official said about 150 prominent Africa specialists 
would attend the conference, including academics, religious leaders, business 
executives, labor organizers and human rights officials.

LIFESTYLE, LIFE CELEBRATED AS GAY GAMES IV NEARS END; NEW YORK: MORE THAN 
11,000 ATHLETES HAVE TAKEN PART, WITH SPECIAL TRIBUTES TO HIV-POSITIVE 
COMPETITORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As Gay Games IV move toward closing ceremonies in Yankee Stadium over the 
weekend, the competition has been as much a display of symbolism and 
affirmation of life and lifestyle as a massive gathering of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 11,000 athletes have entered competition in 31 sports this week at 
30 locations in the New York area. During some of the events, ranging from ice 
skating to platform diving, there have been tributes to HIV-positive 
competitors who have traveled here to take part in the games, which have been 
received with courtesy by most New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
 The games are one part of a gay festival that will culminate Sunday with a 
march commemorating the 25th anniversary of the June 28, 1969, uprising against 
police at a Greenwich Village gay bar, the Stonewall Inn. The riotous 
resistance to the police raid became a rallying cry for gay pride and 
empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival includes a reception honoring lesbian lawyers, lectures on heroes 
of the lesbian and gay civil rights movement, evenings of poetry and prose, a 
performance by the gay actor Sir Ian McKellen, special church services, and 
workshops on gay and lesbian firefighters, emergency and police workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the games "we are treated phenomenally well and with a lot of respect," 
said Gene Kearon, 29, a telephone company account manager who traveled from 
Washington, D.C., to swim. "Strangers wish us good luck on the bus for the 
competitions. It's nice to see people from all over the world -- loving, 
hard-working professional athletes -- and oh, by the way, they're gay." 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside the swimming pool at the Asphalt Green AquaCenter on Manhattan's 
upper East Side, all activities stopped the other day while the names of 
HIV-positive athletes who had died or were unable to come to the games were 
read aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 The swimmer who read the list then announced he, too, was HIV-positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank everyone for their love and support," he continued, listing 
HIV-positive swimmers who had won races. 
</P>
<P>
 "The athletes have been incredibly polite, cooperative and making every 
effort," said Tracy Sundlun, the official in charge of the track meet, which 
also featured straight athletes, at Randalls Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the gay game events were carried off with a touch of panache. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pink Flamingo Swimming Relay, male and female competitors wore costumes 
ranging from takeoffs on business suits, Scarlet O'Hara crinoline dresses, 
angels wings, and 1960s-style baby doll dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace was not record-shattering. But neither the athletes, some of whom 
swam while drinking bottles of water, nor the spectators, who cheered wildly, 
seemed to care. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers predict that hundreds of thousands of gay men and lesbians will 
take part in Sunday's march, which begins at the United Nations and ends with a 
rally in Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers include Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is running for reelection, 
Democratic congressman Gerry Studds of Massachusetts, actress Liza Minnelli, 
and Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tony Kushner. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether New York's Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani will address the throng was 
uncertain. The mayor, who interceded with the New York Yankees organization to 
help obtain the stadium for closing ceremonies, was booed when he spoke at the 
opening of Gay Games IV. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Fry, the co-chairman of the march, announced that he opposed the 
mayor's presence in Central Park, charging he "does not have that good a track 
record." Fry criticized the mayor for attempting to cut funding for AIDS 
services and abolishing the Mayor's Office for the Lesbian and Gay Community. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliani aides insisted that he would at least be marching with the 
demonstrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Also planning to be present is ACT UP, which has staged civil disobedience in 
the past and which wants to change the route of the march, arguing that for 
symbolism and accuracy it should begin in Greenwich Village, site of the 
Stonewall Inn and not at the United Nations.

ELECTIONS; BRAZIL'S SOCCER MANIA FORCES FANCY FOOTWORK ON CANDIDATES; 
PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER LEAVES THE COUNTRY TO CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For nearly four years, presidential candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva has 
crisscrossed this country in pursuit of the prize that narrowly eluded him in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Lula, a union leader and political outsider with a sixth-grade education, has 
struggled to woo gold miners, farmers and rubber tappers in tiny backwater 
towns, factory workers in the country's huge urban centers, and intellectuals, 
professionals and left-wing millionaires in its coastal cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, less than four months from the Oct. 3 election, as Lula leads in the 
polls and appears on the threshold of becoming head of the world's fifth most 
populous country and eighth-largest economy, he has all but abandoned his 
efforts at campaigning on the homefront. 
</P>
<P>
 He has flown off to South Africa, because while Lula may be able to handle his 
six political rivals, he can't compete with 11 other men, dressed in yellow 
shirts and green shorts, kicking a white and black ball around a big grass 
field in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil is competing in soccer's World Cup, and nothing is more important than 
that for the 155 million people of this country where schools close, factories 
shut down and government workers are let off early for each game Brazil plays. 
When Brazil played its first game on Monday, only 77 of Congress' 584 
representatives showed up for the daily session, and they spent the day making 
speeches urging the team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "A presidential election should be more important than a sports championship, 
but here it's not," said Richard Foster, editor of Brazil Watch, a newsletter 
that publishes economic and political analyses. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, as the presidential campaign heads into its final stretch, 
anxious candidates are scrambling to keep their message in front of voters 
whose attention will be focused thousands of miles away until Brazil is 
eliminated from the championship contest or the games end July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 How those in the running do that is being watched carefully by political 
analysts and campaign strategists, because the candidates' efforts in coming 
weeks will have implications far beyond the immediate campaign. Due to a 
constitutional change this year, every presidential election and the elections 
of hundreds of other officials -- the entire Chamber of Deputies, a major 
portion of the Senate and all 27 governors and state assemblies -- will, by 
happenstance, coincide with the quadrennial World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trying to compete with soccer, the candidates plan to go full bore 
in August when they begin receiving required free television time. Until then, 
they are searching for soccer tie-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 They mug for the cameras while bouncing soccer balls off their knees and 
heads. In interviews, they recite detailed analyses of Brazil's team, tout 
their childhood soccer experiences and offer advice to the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign rhetoric is overlaid with soccer metaphors, something analysts 
predict will intensify with each Brazilian victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have a government just like this team," said candidate Fernando 
Henrique Cardoso, the country's former finance minister and Lula's strongest 
challenger, right after Brazil swept past Russia in its first game. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperidiao Amin, a right-wing candidate seeking to bolster a flagging 
campaign, claimed, "I am the Romario (de Souza Faria) of the elections," 
referring to the Brazilian team's star player. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too early to tell how the politicians' efforts are playing with the 
electorate. Ironically, Lula, whose next stops are in Germany, may have picked 
the best strategy of all. Photographs and reports of his meeting with South 
African President Nelson Mandela made the front pages of the major newspapers 
and led news broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a major coup for us," said one Lula official. "We determined the only 
way to deal with the Cup was not to be here during the Cup."

POLITICS; HORIZON CLOUDY AS EU MEETS ON SUNNY GREEK ISLE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The European Union's semiannual summit, on the Greek island of Corfu today and 
Saturday, was envisioned as a look at Europe's future. 
</P>
<P>
 The agenda carries an interim report on a planned multibillion-dollar 
trans-European network of new and upgraded rail lines and highways that will 
not just bind the continent more closely in the next century, but also create 
thousands of jobs and a vision in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, who arrived in Corfu on Thursday, will 
sign the first cooperation agreement between Russia and the EU. And a short 
time later, leaders of the union's 12 member states are supposed to pick a 
successor to Jacques Delors as president of the EU's Executive Commission -- 
the organization's single most powerful job. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is a problem: discord. 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreements on funding surround the ambitious transportation plan, and the 
task of agreeing on Delors' successor, which should have been managed in a 
series of discreet, gentlemanly consultations (there are no female EU leaders), 
has turned into a bruising and embarrassing fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Details have even leaked out of the smoke-filled rooms and onto the front 
pages of Europe's leading newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the summit convened, it was uncertain whether the job would go to Belgian 
Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene (the choice of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl 
and French President Francois Mitterrand), to his Dutch counterpart Ruud 
Lubbers (said to be favored by the Danes and others but actively opposed by 
Kohl) or possibly to a long shot such as Britain's Leon Brittan, currently the 
EU trade commissioner, or Ireland's Peter Sutherland, a former EU commissioner 
who presided over last autumn's successful round of world trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Deadlock is also possible, a scenario that would most likely force the 12 into 
a special summit later this year. Delors' term ends in January. 
</P>
<P>
 With uncertainty clouding internal issues, the EU-Russia accord could wind up 
as the summit's only event of lasting significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin today will sign a "Partnership and Cooperation Agreement" with the EU 
that will establish a regular, formal political dialogue between Moscow and 
Brussels, open the prospect of an eventual EU-Russia free-trade agreement and 
improve the investment climate in Russia for EU-based private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord is "a milestone on the road toward greater economic and political 
stability across the entire continent," Brittan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Added Yuri A. Borko, of the Institute of Europe, Russian Academy of Sciences: 
"This is a qualitatively new level of partnership and cooperation between the 
(EU) and Russia. I think we got more or less optimal conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 In an important concession by Moscow, the agreement will progressively open 
the Russian market to EU-based banks, breaking a ban on contact between Russian 
nationals and foreign lending institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Five European banks already registered in Russia can start operations 
immediately: ABN-AMRO Bank and INGBank of the Netherlands, Societe General and 
Credit Lyonnais of France and Dresdner Bank of Germany. The EU is also expected 
to start opening its doors to Russian banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Economically, however, the pact seems to offer Moscow little in the short 
term, even though the EU is by far the largest importer of Russian goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Few trade experts believe that Russian manufactured products will be 
competitive in the West, and in many areas where Moscow could sell more to the 
EU -- such as steel, textiles and some metals -- the agreement carries 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 France, for example, refused to go along with the accord until it received 
guarantees protecting its domestic nuclear fuel industry from cheap Russian 
enriched uranium.

SALINAS NAMES NEW ENVOY FOR CHIAPAS

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Carlos Salinas de Gortari on Thursday named the head of the 
government Human Rights Commission as his new peace envoy to Mayan rebels in 
the southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Jorge Madrazo Cuellar would be responsible for beginning a new round 
of talks with the rebels of the Zapatista National Liberation Army. Madrazo, a 
lawyer, will replace Manuel Camacho Solis, who resigned last week after the 
rebels rejected a 32-point peace plan Camacho Solis had proposed in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiapas conflict began Jan. 1 when Mayan guerrillas rose up in arms to 
demand land and legal reform, greater respect for Mexico's indigenous people 
and nationwide democratic reform.

COLOSIO'S WIDOW WON'T TAKE ROLE IN INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The widow of slain Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio on 
Thursday appeared to back down from previous indications that she would take an 
active role in the investigation into her husband's killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not up to me to accuse the guilty or to pass judgment on the 
investigation," Diana Laura Riojas told a hushed room of reporters. "I have 
confidence that our institutions will redouble their efforts and soon present 
us with a clear and convincing truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Her statement seemed to close the door on the possibility that she would 
protest conclusions of the special prosecutor assigned to investigate the case 
when they are presented. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Riojas hired a well-known criminal lawyer to represent her 
after special prosecutor Miguel Montes Garcia said he is leaning toward the 
theory that a 23-year-old factory worker acted alone when he fatally shot 
Colosio on March 23 after a campaign rally in a working-class Tijuana 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes previously had been investigating the possibility that the alleged 
assassin, Mario Aburto Martinez, was part of a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other men are being held on charges that they helped Aburto murder 
Colosio. An appeals court this week confirmed that they should stay in jail, 
despite Montes' doubts about the conspiracy theory. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexican criminal courts, victims' families have the same standing as the 
defense or prosecution. Riojas had been expected to exercise those rights in 
pressing for investigation of a third theory: that a mastermind manipulated 
Aburto into killing her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 That theory was contained in a note that she sent to Montes when she notified 
him she had hired attorney Juan Velazquez.  
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday, a tired-looking Riojas said that she had hired the lawyer to 
help her follow the investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 Riojas announced the creation of a foundation named for her late husband that 
will promote peace and dignity, personal improvement, development and health.

JAPAN'S BESIEGED PREMIER LIKELY TO RESIGN, RUN AGAIN; ASIA: HATA, BATTLING A 
NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION, MAY ACCEPT SOCIALISTS' DEMAND HE QUIT TO DRAW THEM BACK 
TO COALITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata, who is battling a no-confidence motion, indicated 
Thursday that he will resign and run again for prime minister to meet a 
face-saving demand of the Socialist Party, if the Socialists return to his 
coalition government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists renewed the demand in bargaining that is continuing today on 
terms for a new coalition that would remain under Hata's leadership. If the 
demand is not accepted, Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said his party 
would support a no-confidence motion against Hata and insist on holding the 
vote today. 
</P>
<P>
 Television commentators called the demand "hard to understand." But analysts 
said the Socialists need the gesture of contrition to justify their return to a 
government they bolted only eight weeks ago after voting for Hata as prime 
minister. They then accused him of betraying them for failing to consult them 
about a shuffle in the makeup of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata's resignation would wipe out the no-confidence motion, which was certain 
to pass without Socialist support of the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 A Socialist return to the coalition would give the ruling group a razor-thin 
majority of only one seat in the lower house and would offer no assurance that 
Hata would win a new election, which would have to be held to pick a prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 20 Socialists intend to vote against Hata if their party rejoins 
the coalition, said Minoru Morita, a respected political commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 Hata offered to resign in a news conference conducted less than an hour after 
the upper house approved the 1994 budget and the opposition Liberal Democratic 
Party submitted its bid to oust him.  
</P>
<P>
 Coalition opponents had pledged to uphold a political truce only until the 
long-delayed budget was enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Socialists' offer underscored Hata's desperation and the peril to his 
continued rule. Emphasizing the political crisis, Foreign Minister Koji 
Kakizawa canceled plans to meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Los 
Angeles this weekend to conduct trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Admitting that his Cabinet controlling only 37% of the seats in the lower 
house was "very weak," Hata declared that Japan needs a strong government "more 
than anything else" to tackle a host of urgent issues. Among them, he named tax 
reform, trade frictions with the United States, suspicions of North Korean 
development of nuclear weapons and reforms of politics, economics, and the 
government administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan cannot avoid dealing with these issues . . . (that) will fix the 
direction for the nation's future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He belittled the suggestion that he should seek an alliance with the Liberal 
Democrats, rather than with the Socialists. 
</P>
<P>
 That move, he said, would turn the clock back to a time when the political 
structure was conservative and concerned with preserving the status quo. "We 
(the coalition) came into power seeking change," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear who would run against Hata if an election for prime 
minister were held. But Morita named Liberal defector Masayoshi Takemura, 
leader of the splinter New Party Harbinger, as a likely prime minister in any 
coalition involving the Liberal Democrats and part or all of the Socialists. 
Takemura, he said, is the only "bridge" figure who could link the two disparate 
parties without causing splits in both of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura's party joined the ruling coalition in August and voted for Hata in 
April but refused to join Hata's Cabinet. Since then, Takemura, a former 
prefectural (state) governor, has become increasingly critical of the 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bid Thursday to sabotage talks between the Socialists and Hata's 
followers, Takemura offered to support Socialist Chairman Murayama as prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura is an archenemy of Ichiro Ozawa, Hata's chief strategist. While Ozawa 
supports Japan playing a larger role in international politics and U.N. 
peacekeeping efforts, Takemura advocates Japan assuming the posture of a "small 
country that sparkles," shying away from both overseas military activities and 
a global leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist and coalition leaders met three times Thursday and agreed to hold 
another session this morning. Should the talks break down and the Socialists 
join the Liberal Democrats in passing a no-confidence motion, Hata is expected 
to dissolve the lower house and call a general election for either July 24 or 
July 31, Morita predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Morita said a July election would be an unpredictable, nip-and-tuck battle 
between Hata's coalition on one side, and the Liberal Democrats, all or part of 
the Socialists and Takemura's New Party Harbinger on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 More than any argument over policy, he said, the core of the present political 
uproar centers on a "generational dispute." His view is that the aging Liberal 
Democrat bosses -- in league with elder Socialists -- struck out against Hata 
now to hang on to the old system of multi-seat election districts, in which 
candidates have focused on pork-barrel promises.

 A cheering General Assembly readmitted South Africa, now a non-racial, 
democratic state, as a full member, ending 20 bitter years of banishment and 
pariah status because of apartheid."The long night of diplomatic isolation has 
finally come to an end," South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo told the 
assembly. The 184-nation assembly decided by acclamation to seat the new 
black-majority government of Nelson Mandela that won the nation's first 
all-race elections in April. South Africa is a founding member of the United 
Nations and has remained a U.N. member, but it had been suspended from General 
Assembly work since 1974.

 The Guatemalan government and leftist guerrillas have agreed to form a 
commission to investigate human rights abuses, raising hopes for an overall 
peace agreement to end Central America's only ongoing civil war. "With 
agreement on the sensitive and most difficult issue of human rights, a final 
peace (agreement) in Guatemala is becoming a very strong possibility before the 
end of this year," said Norwegian diplomat Arne Aasheim, who participated in 
the talks in Oslo. The panel, which will have no legal authority to punish 
abuses, will start work as soon as an overall agreement is signed.

 Bosnia's Muslims and Croats moved closer by selecting a joint government, but 
Bosnian Serbs remained doggedly outside efforts to establish peace after 26 
months of war.The current head of Bosnia's federal government, Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic, was chosen to also lead the federation government. The 
assembly also agreed on a Cabinet that includes 14 Muslims, 13 Croats and one 
Serb. But the federation government lacks one basic prerequisite: territory. 
Serbs control more than 70% of Bosnia and have shown no inclination to reduce 
that to the 49% envisioned in a proposal by international mediators.

FRENCH UNITS MOVE INTO RWANDA, VOW NOT TO PROVOKE REBELS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 French marines and Foreign Legionnaires headed into the chaos of Rwanda on 
Thursday to try to stem the ethnic slaughter that has horrified the world. They 
pledged not to pick a fight with rebel forces who view them as enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of the small U.N. peacekeeping force in Rwanda said he hoped the 
French would stay away from front lines between troops of Rwanda's 
Hutu-dominated government and the mainly Tutsi rebel movement. 
</P>
<P>
 A small group of French soldiers in armored vehicles met no opposition and was 
welcomed by locals after advancing several miles into western Rwanda, a 
military spokesman said in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rwandan army is believed to control the western third of the small Central 
African nation. The rebels have won control of the eastern two-thirds since the 
war resumed April 6 after a suspicious plane crash killed Rwanda's Hutu 
president, who had reached a power-sharing accord with the Tutsi minority. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 Foreign Legion paratroopers protected by helicopter gunships crossed 
the border from Bukavu, 60 miles south of Goma, the military said. Their goal 
was to secure a refugee camp near Cyangugu to protect 8,000 Tutsis from the 
widespread slaughter being inflicted on the tribe by Hutu militias. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations and aid groups estimate that hundreds of thousands of 
Rwandans have died in the past two months, most of them civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 A reconnaissance team of French marines also headed from Goma for the 
northwestern region of Gisenyi, French state radio reported, quoting an 
unidentified government source. 
</P>
<P>
 "The role is only to protect refugees," said Col. Andre Schill, a French 
spokesman in Goma. He said French troops would use their weapons only if 
threatened or to protect refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not out here to make a new war, but to protect people. We are not here 
to shoot," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The French government said it is sending about 2,500 soldiers and marines for 
the two-month mission that was authorized Wednesday by the U.N. Security 
Council as a stopgap until a larger, all-African peacekeeping force can be 
deployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Schill said 500 French soldiers already were in Goma, including marine 
infantrymen, supply troops and combat engineers. About 250 paratroopers were in 
Bukavu, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 French troops are turning the airport at Kisangani, Zaire, into an air base to 
support the mission, dubbed "Operation Turquoise." 
</P>
<P>
 In Kigali, Rwanda's capital, Maj. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian commander 
of the 450 U.N. peacekeepers, said he had not been contacted by the French 
force but expected them to stay away from confrontation zones. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallaire cautioned against intervening in a civil war "when you do not have 
the consent of both sides." He said he took seriously rebel threats to attack 
French troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the French government says the operation is a strictly humanitarian 
mission, the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front is suspicious because French 
intervention blocked a rebel offensive in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no doubt whatsoever that their intentions are far from being 
humanitarian," Theogene Rudasingwa, secretary general of the Patriotic Front, 
told journalists in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels' representative in Paris, Jacques Bihozagara, said rebel forces 
would not seek out French troops. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warned the rebels would "treat them as invaders" if they did make 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
 French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur said Wednesday that he could not 
exclude the possibility of fighting, but his conditions for the operation 
indicated that French troops would not deploy near rebel areas.

EGYPTIAN LAWYERS ON HUNGER STRIKE OVER COLLEAGUES' JAILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mohammed Abdelaziz, head of the Cairo Lawyers Syndicate, has been hospitalized 
on a weeklong hunger strike, the latest development in a looming showdown 
between the Egyptian government and the Muslim Brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesting the detention without charges of 59 lawyers, most of them Islamic 
fundamentalists, Abdelaziz, 60, was admitted for observation in a weak 
condition while Sayed Khalef, 53, secretary general of the lawyers' syndicate, 
entered the fifth day of his own hunger strike.  
</P>
<P>
 "I found myself helpless to accept the requests of my colleagues to help them, 
so for the helpless person, death is better for him," Khalef said Wednesday. 
"There are others who are ready to go on strike as soon as we die." 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation over the arrested lawyers -- about half of whom were taken 
into custody after protesting the death in police custody of colleague Abdel 
Harith Madani -- is the most serious eruption in the steadily declining 
relations between the Egyptian government and the nonviolent Islamic 
opposition, the most potent political opposition force in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 While Egyptian authorities have relentlessly sought to stamp out militant 
Islamic groups responsible for a wave of attacks on banks, foreign tourists and 
government officials, they have allowed the moderate Muslim Brotherhood to 
operate with relative freedom, though it is officially banned. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the brotherhood has elected 40 deputies to Parliament under 
the banner of an allied political party. It runs a network of charitable 
institutions through mosques and maintains a vocal diatribe against the 
government through a widely read newspaper it controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the brotherhood has flexed its political muscles further, winning 
elections for control of a number of student and professional groups and 
syndicates, most prominently the Egyptian Lawyers Syndicate and the Egyptian 
Physicians Syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Minister of Interior Hassan Alfi as recently as a few months ago 
affirmed the government view that the brotherhood is not linked to recent 
terrorist attacks, authorities in the last few months have begun to move 
against it to try to stamp out its growing political influence. 
</P>
<P>
 A new law passed by Parliament will make it easier for the government to 
control union elections; a controversial new law also lets the government 
appoint village leaders, who had been selected by villagers and were often 
sympathetic to the Islamic movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the government took the unusual step of detaining the 
brotherhood's Supreme Guide, Sheik Hamed Abul Nasr, on suspicion of 
distributing leaflets advocating violence.  
</P>
<P>
 President Hosni Mubarak has now publicly asserted that the brotherhood has 
links to violent activities, signaling the government's determination to 
curtail it. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Egyptian president since the 1952 revolution has clashed with the 
brotherhood, and Saif Islam Banna, the son of the group's founder, said the 
current repressive measures will not prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are against this movement," said Banna, who also heads the Egyptian 
Lawyers Syndicate. "But the question is, is it useful for the state to make a 
clash with the Muslim Brotherhood? Will society in Egypt accept this? Every 
time they try to make a clash, they become certain that the people will not 
accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights and lawyers' groups around the world have appealed for the 
detained lawyers' release. Some are on the staff of the Egyptian Organization 
for Human Rights; others have defended prominent Islamic fundamentalists 
accused of anti-state terrorism.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither Abdelaziz nor Khalef is affiliated with the Islamic movement. But they 
have insisted the lawyers' detentions, permissible for 60 days at a stretch 
under Egypt's emergency law and indefinitely renewable on court order, are a 
civil rights issue.

STUDY FINDS NO SINGLE CAUSE FOR GULF WAR AILMENTS 
</P>

 A Pentagon-commissioned panel that undertook the most exhaustive study to date 
of illnesses plaguing Persian Gulf War veterans uncovered no single cause for 
their ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, led by Nobel-laureate Joshua Lederberg, found no conclusive 
evidence that Iraqi forces deployed toxic agents on the battlefield or that 
bombing of Iraqi storage facilities by allied forces released biological or 
chemical agents into the air that affected U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could find no persuasive evidence of the use of chemicals in that 
theater," Lederberg said at a news conference Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pentagon has established a toll-free number for veterans who believe 
they are suffering ailments as a result of their military service and launched 
a program to diagnose the ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch said he believes "there are servicemen 
and -women who are ill as a result of this Gulf War experience. . . . 
Responding compassionately and effectively are our principal priority." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Pentagon will declassify previously secret intelligence reports 
and medical documents dealing with possible use of chemical agents, but 
acknowledged the information would have little bearing on the illness veterans 
and physicians have come to call "Gulf War Syndrome." Chest pain, dizziness and 
skin irritation are among the symptoms reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon has come under fire from veterans and lawmakers who have charged 
the military has been ignoring evidence that U.S. troops were exposed to 
chemical or biological contaminants. The study, conducted by the Defense 
Science Board Task Force on Persian Gulf War Health Effects, is the latest in a 
string of inconclusive scientific investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Panel scientists said the syndrome may be a group of diseases caused by 
wartime stress, inhaling fine Kuwaiti sand or alcohol deprivation, among other 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lawmakers privately dismissed the report Thursday, saying that the panel 
only examined evidence provided by the Pentagon.

LIMBAUGH DEFENDS ROLE AS JUICE SALESMAN; MEDIA: RADIO TALK SHOW HOST ASSAILS 
LIBERALS AND PRESS FOR THE FLAP OVER HIS PROMOTIONS. HE DENOUNCES WHAT HE CALLS 
THE 'ANGRY, BITTER WOMEN' OF NOW. 
</P>

 Conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh has defended his record as a 
salesman for Florida orange juice while charging that the controversy over his 
role has been fomented by longtime critics he described as "liberals, both in 
government, in special interest groups like the militant National Organization 
for Women, and the press." 
</P>
<P>
 With two months to go on his contract to sell orange juice, Limbaugh devoted 
about 20 minutes of his nationally syndicated program last Friday to a ringing 
denunciation of what he called the left-leaning news media and the "angry, 
bitter women" of NOW. 
</P>
<P>
 A boycott of Florida orange juice called by NOW to protest the use of Limbaugh 
in advertising has drawn support from several national groups, including 
Greenpeace, the American Assn. of University Women and the National Federation 
of Business and Professional Women's Clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh began touting Florida orange juice in February as part of a 
six-month, $17-million national advertising campaign. The New York firm that 
syndicates Limbaugh's top-rated program, EFM Media Inc., was paid $1 million 
for Limbaugh to read advertising copy promoting the health benefits of orange 
juice. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Department of Citrus, funded by a special excise tax collected 
from growers and shippers, also bought air time with radio hosts Larry King and 
Dr. Dean Edell. But no one has generated as much publicity as Limbaugh, who is 
known for his slashing attacks on gays, Democrats, environmentalists and 
feminists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way anyone can say that orange juice sales have been harmed by 
advertising on this show," Limbaugh said. He called the advertising campaign "a 
resounding success" that is "causing orange juice sales to skyrocket." 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures from A. C. Neilsen's Scantrack survey released by the 
Department of Citrus, sales of Florida orange juice actually declined by 4.4% 
between mid-February through May 14 compared to the same period the previous 
year. But 1993 was a year of record sales, so the decline was not unexpected, a 
department spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline could not necessarily be linked to Limbaugh, the boycott or any 
one aspect of the advertising campaign, the spokesperson added, noting that 
price, brand names and local promotions also affect total orange juice sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions of whether to renew the state's contract with Limbaugh's 
syndicate is expected to come up at the next meeting of the 12-member citrus 
commission, scheduled for July 20 in Lakeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the 12 commissioners -- William E. Owens -- has declared publicly 
his opposition to rehiring Limbaugh to promote orange juice. But at least two 
others have expressed surprise at the flap. "I was astounded," Talmadge G. Rice 
said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rex V. McPherson: "I don't think controversy is good. But I'm not going 
to tell you how I'm going to vote. I want to hear the thoughts of the DOC 
economist." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans discussed earlier this year call for the Department of Citrus to shift 
the promotional focus from national advertising to local retail promotions 
beginning this fall. But, the spokesperson added, there is money available to 
buy more national radio time and renewing Limbaugh's contract is an option. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh declined to be interviewed for this story. But in remarks on the air 
last week, he commented on the possibility that his contract would not be 
renewed. "Nothing lasts forever," he said. "But this contract goes through 
August, and our intention is to continue advertising with them. It's a great 
product, it tastes great, this is a program of great taste. We think it's a 
good marriage, and it clearly has been beneficial to the Department of Citrus." 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Citrus has reported receiving more than 26,500 telephone 
calls, letters and faxes on the issue, which are running 4 to 1 in opposition 
to Limbaugh. But, the DOC spokesperson emphasized, Limbaugh has urged his 
listeners not to call or write in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The temptation is great to give you the number and have you call," Limbaugh 
said Friday. But, he added, "the objective is not generating phone calls; we 
know we can do that . . . the single best thing you can do is to buy orange 
juice."

OFFICIALS SEE NO CHARGES IN EARLY WHITEWATER INQUIRY; PROBE: LAWYERS FOR 
TREASURY, WHITE HOUSE AIDES SAY THEY DO NOT EXPECT SPECIAL COUNSEL TO SEEK 
INDICTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior officials at the Treasury Department and the White House have been told 
by their personal attorneys that they do not expect special counsel Robert B. 
Fiske Jr. to seek criminal indictments against them because of allegedly 
improper meetings linked to the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske is said to be close to completing the first phase of his probe, which is 
focusing both on the suicide last summer of White House Deputy Counsel Vincent 
Foster and the way in which Administration officials responded to the news of a 
Whitewater-related criminal referral by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 That aspect of the inquiry will focus in part on a series of meetings between 
Treasury Department and White House officials in the fall of 1993 and early in 
1994 to discuss how to respond to a criminal referral that investigators at the 
Resolution Trust Corp. sent to the Justice Department. The referral named 
President Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign as a possible beneficiary of 
alleged criminal actions by a failed Arkansas savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration sources said they are increasingly confident that Fiske 
will conclude that part of his investigation without seeking criminal charges 
against current or former officials of the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they stressed that they have not been given any information by 
Fiske's office on the status of his investigation, they said attorneys hired by 
Administration officials that have been subpoenaed and investigated by Fiske do 
not believe that he will move against those officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based upon my understanding and assessment of what is going on, I don't see 
the basis for any criminal indictments," said Steven Tabackman, an attorney who 
represents Jack Devore, the Treasury Department spokesman who testified before 
the Whitewater grand jury earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury Department became embroiled in the Whitewater controversy because 
the RTC had no permanent head. In the interim, Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger 
Altman became acting RTC chairman last year, and other senior Treasury 
Department aides helped him work on RTC issues on an ad hoc basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Their dual roles as political appointees running an independent regulatory 
agency raised questions after they took part in a series of meetings with White 
House officials to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske has been trying to conclude the Washington part of his investigation so 
that Congress can begin Whitewater hearings this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arkansas part of his inquiry, which covers the origins of the controversy 
-- including the Clinton family's investment in the Whitewater real estate 
development and the failure of a Little Rock, Ark., S&L owned by their 
Whitewater partner -- is likely to take much longer, however. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the White House said it would comply with a request by the Senate 
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee for Whitewater-related documents, 
which the committee wants for Whitewater hearings that probably would begin in 
late July. 
</P>
<P>
 Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said the White House received a letter Wednesday 
night from committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) and Sen. Alfonse 
M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), the ranking Republican on the panel, asking for documents 
already turned over by the White House to Fiske. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee said in a statement that it wants documents from current and 
former officials at the White House and other agencies who may have had some 
involvement in the Washington aspects of the Whitewater case.

GOP CONGRESS FORCES ASSAIL FAZIO OVER RELIGIOUS RIGHT; POLITICS: SKIRMISH IS 
TOUCHED OFF AFTER THE DEMOCRAT ATTACKS THE RISE OF 'INTOLERANT' ELEMENTS IN 
REPUBLICAN PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Partisan animosities and election-year politics flared in Congress on Thursday 
as GOP senators joined conservative counterparts in the House in attacking Rep. 
Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento) for criticizing the rising influence of the 
religious right on the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming on the heels of a testy partisan debate in the Senate over hearings on 
the Whitewater controversy, it underscored the polarization in Congress as it 
struggles to find increasingly elusive compromises on health care and other 
major reforms during the countdown to the November mid-term elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The skirmish was touched off earlier this week when Fazio, chairman of the 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, attacked the GOP and the rise of 
the "intolerant . . . religious right." His comments came after several 
victories by religious conservatives in Republican Party primaries and 
conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly concerned about predictions suggesting that the GOP may pick up 20 to 
30 House seats in November, Fazio began the new Democratic line of attack by 
warning voters to beware of "the radical right" and the way its candidates are 
forcing more mainstream Republicans "to the fringes" of their own party. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging that Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition and other socially 
conservative groups are using "subterranean tactics" to subvert the Republican 
Party, Fazio said that the religious right now controls the GOP political 
apparatus in at least 15 states. Americans ignore the growing political 
strength of these "radical fringe" groups at their peril, he warned. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the GOP's big guns on both sides of the Capitol fired back, 
accusing Fazio and the Democrats of "religious bigotry" and, in a letter signed 
by all 44 Republican senators, asked President Clinton to disavow his own 
party's attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We write to ask that you now join with us in repudiating the remarks of those 
who use terms like 'fire-breathing Christian radical right' and who cheapen our 
democracy through religious bigotry," the senators wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming increasingly clear that some members of the Democratic Party 
are resorting to campaign tactics based on religious bigotry to divert 
attention from (the Democratic Party's) own failings," Senate Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) added on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, Republican Policy Committee Chairman Henry J. Hyde of Illinois 
denounced what he said is a "calculated smear campaign" by the Democrats. Rep. 
Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) recited the dictionary definition of 
McCarthyism and said it would be replaced in the future by a new word: 
"Fazioism." 
</P>
<P>
 Fazio, in response, accused the Republicans of distorting his remarks and said 
their reaction "confirms that we really hit a nerve." 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly appreciate that Christians are participating in politics across 
the spectrum but what we are referring to is the radical right . . . whose 
views are outside the political mainstream," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not something we're manufacturing. This is not hysteria. This is what 
is happening," Fazio added. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican leaders, he said, want "to have it both ways" by harnessing the 
electoral strength of the evangelical Christian movement without ceding real 
influence to it -- a strategy that he asserted will backfire.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; WILSON ASSAILS BROWN'S TIES TO FATHER ON DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson chided Democrat Kathleen Brown on Thursday for basing her 
opposition to the death penalty in part on her father's experience applying 
capital punishment when he was the state's chief executive nearly 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, escalating what has become an increasingly personal debate between the 
two candidates on the sensitive issue, questioned his opponent's explanation 
and three times quoted her father, former Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, who wrote 
a book about his personal turmoil over the state's ultimate criminal sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "She says that her opposition to the death penalty is a result of what she 
learned from her father," Wilson told reporters at a Capitol news conference. 
"But I think her explanation to date indicates that if she may be a dutiful 
daughter, she would not be a good governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson added: "With all respect to Pat Brown, however people may remember him 
fondly for other reasons, I don't think he was greatly admired as governor 
because of his performance on the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown, at the White House for a meeting with President Clinton, was 
informed of Wilson's remarks and lashed back at the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is typical Pete Wilson," she said. "If Pete Wilson wants to ridicule me 
and my father and my family values, I would say Pete Wilson has a problem with 
his values." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who is seeking to follow her father and her brother, former Gov. Edmund 
G. (Jerry) Brown, into the state's highest office, returned to the old 
Governor's Mansion on Tuesday to explain how she came to oppose the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in the same room in which her father had pondered the fate of 59 
condemned criminals -- and had decided to send 36 to the gas chamber -- the 
younger Brown said her position was not based on logic or philosophy, nor on 
arguments over the death penalty's effectiveness as a deterrent. She described 
her reasoning as a "gut thing," based on her family and religious values.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown added that even though she personally opposes the death penalty she 
would carry it out if called upon to do so, appoint judges who supported it, 
and not stand in the way if lawmakers wanted to put a measure on the ballot to 
expand it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I oppose it because my father taught me it was wrong and the religious 
experiences I had reinforced that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he did not think Brown's statement was "much of an explanation" 
and in clear terms spelled out his own position. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my case," Wilson said, "I believe the death penalty is a deterrent, I 
think it is an entirely legitimate form of punishment, I think it answers the 
requirements of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson quoted extensively from Pat Brown's book, "Public Justice, Private 
Mercy, a Governor's Education on Death Row." 
</P>
<P>
 In weighing one case, Brown wrote: "I was trying to move beyond legal limits 
as I looked for reasons to commute" an inmate's death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, the elder Brown commuted the sentence of a killer who had not 
yet formally requested clemency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't see," Brown wrote, "how sending him to the gas chamber would deter 
some future frightened would-be robber from panicking and striking out at his 
victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's point: If Kathleen Brown says she is following the example of her 
father, then her father's reasoning and actions are fair game for criticism. 
And the record, Wilson said, shows that Pat Brown, as time wore on, leaned more 
toward granting clemency than denying it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know clearly what Pat Brown brought to these deliberations," Wilson said. 
"He was, I think, a good man but he agonized and was ambivalent and through 
life his attitude changed. More and more he was able to find excuses for 
granting clemency. I would not have found those excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also criticized an Assembly committee for bottling up two bills to 
expand the death penalty to cover killings committed in connection with 
carjackings or drive-by shootings. Wilson aides have suggested that Democrats 
blocked the measures so that Brown would not have to defend her opposition to 
them during the fall campaign.

EX-PROFESSOR SENTENCED TO 12 YEARS FOR MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former university professor was sentenced to 12 years in state prison 
Wednesday in a sexual molestation case that developed after photographs showing 
graphic abuse of a Newport Beach girl were found discarded on a Los Angeles 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Ruskjer, 44, a onetime faculty member at Loma Linda University's School 
of Public Health, apologized for the crime during a statement before a San 
Bernardino Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 His girlfriend, Evelyn (Evie) Bacilio, 33, a former secretary for an Ontario 
medical supply company, was sentenced Tuesday to six years in prison after 
begging forgiveness from the child's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruskjer and Bacilio pleaded guilty in April to multiple felony counts of 
sexually abusing the 4-year-old girl and taking sexually explicit photographs 
of her. The defendants, who lived in the San Bernardino County community of 
Grand Terrace, were arrested Oct. 8 after tipsters identified them as the 
suspects in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began to unfold in October when someone turned over to police 11 
photographs that had been found on the street. Police believe that the photos 
were thrown from Ruskjer's car by someone who had stolen the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state law prohibits distributing pictures showing sex with children, 
police won court permission to release three edited photos to the news media in 
the hope that someone would recognize the adults or the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, police received about 40 calls identifying Ruskjer and Bacilio 
as the suspects. Other tips led authorities to the identity of the girl. Police 
arrested Ruskjer in Detroit. Bacilio was arrested in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the photographs were taken Jan. 9, 1993, at Ruskjer's home 
while Bacilio was baby-sitting the child. Detectives say the girl has no memory 
of being assaulted.

COLOMBIANS PONDER DEFEAT, THREATS

<P>
 Grim-faced Colombian soccer players milled about the packed lobby of the 
Fullerton Marriott hotel Thursday, signing autographs for star-struck 
youngsters, granting interviews to swarms of reporters and looking for answers. 
</P>
<P>
 How did they lose to the United States team? What has become of their World 
Cup dreams? And, perhaps most troubling, who threatened the life of one of 
their star players, demanding that the player -- Gabriel Jamie Gomez -- be 
benched? 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we are not in the best mood," said back-up goalie Farid Mondragon, 
23. "We are hurt inside and we don't have (an) explanation for what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 About the death threat, Mondragon shook his head before he spoke: "In this 
group, when you touch one member, you touch all the group." 
</P>
<P>
 As the soccer players remained dazed over Wednesday's stunning defeat and 
concerned about the threat to mid-fielder Gomez's life, law enforcement 
officials were busy trying to identify the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI, World Cup authorities and police from Fullerton and Cal State 
Fullerton were working together but seemed to have few leads in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat was made through the hotel switchboard Wednesday morning about 5 
1/2 hours before the start of the game, said Gerry Lopez, hotel general 
manager. He said somebody called the Marriott asking to speak to the Colombian 
team's coach. Told that the coach was not in, the person made the threat to the 
hotel operator, who told the coach and law enforcement authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said it was his impression that the caller, who made the threat in a 
matter-of-fact tone, was relaying a message from someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Team and law enforcement officials took the threat very seriously. Gomez did 
not play during the game and flew back home to Colombia late Wednesday night to 
be with his wife and children, whose lives apparently were also threatened in 
the same phone call. The coach, Francisco Maturana, was also threatened with 
death if he allowed Gomez to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Many odds-makers had predicted that the Colombians would win the World Cup. 
Pressure on the players -- from the media, the fans and themselves -- was 
tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional hotel security and police were immediately sent to patrol the hotel 
after the 11 a.m. call. The added security will remain until the team leaves 
the hotel Saturday to play a game against Switzerland in Palo Alto. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said there was no audio, written or computer transcript of the caller's 
message. Investigators continue to look into the case, but there seems to be 
little information to go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know what they can do now," Lopez said. "We've heard nothing 
else on it." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the law enforcement agencies would comment Thursday on the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Romanian team is also staying in Orange County, while practicing at UC 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian team spokesman Tony Correa said death threats on World Cup players 
are not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 "You accept it because you have to," he said. "You've got to take it seriously 
whenever it happens because you never know if it's the real McCoy." 
</P>
<P>
 He described Gomez as a good but controversial player. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like a quarterback controversy," Correa said. "Some people 
believe he should be a starter and some believe another player should be the 
starter." 
</P>
<P>
 Correa said authorities have no idea who made the threat or the motive behind 
the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very frustrating to have a stranger dictating who comes in (to the game) 
and who goes out," Correa said.  
</P>
<P>
 The threat may have unhinged the team, Correa said. Prior to the game the 
players "looked very concerned. They looked lost." Across the field, he added, 
the Americans looked "loose and were smiling and chewing gum." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of reporters from around the world were in the hotel Thursday, 
interviewing dejected players. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondragon, the goalie, said the team's loss was devastating to many in his 
country. "I don't know why this happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mondragon rejected the idea that the loss could be linked to the threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to find this as an excuse," he said.

INITIATIVE TO DENY AID AND EDUCATION TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS QUALIFIES FOR BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An initiative that would deny public education and social and health programs 
to illegal immigrants in California has qualified for the Nov. 8 statewide 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretary of state's office said Thursday that backers of the "save our 
state" measure turned in sufficient signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would deny many public services to illegal immigrants and would 
require police, teachers and health care workers to report suspected illegal 
immigrants to state and federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say too much taxpayer money goes toward services for illegal 
immigrants. Gov. Pete Wilson has indicated his support for the measure, which 
is also backed by the Republican Party, GOP lawmakers and several taxpayer 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents include state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the Democratic candidate for 
governor; the California Teachers Assn; the California Medical Assn., and 
several labor and ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initiative is not only mean-spirited, it also is a prescription for 
public health disaster," Linda Sawyer of the California Nurses Assn. said 
Thursday.

RECYCLER GETS 18 MONTHS AND FINE IN FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Norman Rockmaker, owner of one of California's largest beverage recycling 
container centers, has been sentenced to 18 months in prison and fined $6,000 
after pleading guilty to mail fraud and money laundering charges in Los Angeles 
federal court in March. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the longest prison sentence handed down in a recycling fraud case 
since the program started in 1987, according to a spokeswoman for the state 
Department of Conservation.The department charged that Rockmaker, 47, of 
Compton defrauded the state of thousands of dollars by submitting false claims 
to receive reimbursement for cans that were not eligible for redemption. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate civil lawsuit, the department also recently won $704,000 in 
restitution from Rockmaker, which it said is the amount of money he 
fraudulently received.

MAN FILES O.C. SUIT IN SHARK BITE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Oh the shark bites, with his teeth dear" and the resulting wound may end up 
costing a San Diego aquarium, a marine transport company, and the Shark Club, a 
Costa Mesa nightclub replete with a shark tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Steven Rosenbloom, who says he was bitten last March while helping 
to transfer an over-sized shark from the Shark Club's tank to a vehicle moving 
the shark to the Stephen Birch Aquarium, filed suit in Orange County Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbloom, a former employee of the club, says in his suit that the club's 
owners and Richard A. Barbosa, Glenn Koschi and Martin Kendrick of Reef 
Systems, Inc. led him to believe they were experienced in handling sharks when 
they asked him to help move the shark. Instead, the suit said, Barbosa, Koschi 
and Kendrick "lacked sufficient expertise, knowledge, training" to make the 
transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanour Corp., owners of the club at 841 Baker St., also knew the shark was of 
a "vicious disposition with dangerous propensities," but neglected to properly 
inform Rosenbloom, the suit said.  
</P>
<P>
 The suit asks for an unspecified amount of damages for Rosenbloom's medical 
bills, lost wages and for punitive damages.

SUMMERTIME SWELTER EXPECTED TO LAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND; WEATHER: MERCURY 
REACHES 102 IN WOODLAND HILLS, TYING RECORD. THE THREAT OF BRUSH FIRES RISES 
WITH THE TEMPERATURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO and DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you thought Thursday was hot, wait a few hours. Today is supposed to be 
hotter. And no relief is in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 102 degrees in Woodland Hills on Thursday, tying the 1976 record, and 
forecasters said the "hot summertime pattern" will remain through the weekend 
as a high-pressure system hangs over Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to continue to be hot and dry," said Dean Jones, a meteorologist 
with WeatherData, which provides forecasts to The Times. "It will be cooler by 
the beginning of next week but it will still be warm in the valleys." 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty of people were already feeling the heat Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are just coming in all sweaty and saying, 'Boy, it's hot out there,' " 
said Dan Tanner, who works in an air-conditioned office at the Van Nuys Golf 
Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner said the sun essentially drove away all his customers, leaving him with 
nothing to do but play cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a lot of senior citizens here during the week, but when it gets this 
hot they just can't come out, and business stops," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Clarita, about 130 firefighters descended upon the narrow ridges of 
Tapia Canyon to sharpen their skills against another sign of summer -- 
wildfires. Working to contain a controlled burn, they cleared brush, 
established break lines, doused flames and overturned soil to prevent flare-ups 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives them good experience, from firefighters to captains," said 
Inspector Wade Little of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, surveying the 
work from an overlooking ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The individual fire crews practiced coordinating their efforts, and for many 
it was their first experience battling flames devouring a hillside rather than 
gutting a building. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where all the mistakes are made, if they're going to be made," said 
Capt. Everardo Gonzalez of the U.S. Forest Service. "With live fire, it's 
actually easier for them to see the fire behavior. It's easier to teach them 
than from a chalkboard." 
</P>
<P>
 The exercise was shut down around noon as temperatures rose and the wind 
picked up through Tapia Canyon -- perfect conditions for a brush fire to get 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an unplanned blaze, too. Churned by 20-m.p.h. winds, a 30-acre brush 
fire outside Lancaster burned for more than two hours before firefighters were 
able to contain it, said Cheryl Patterson, a county fire dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, Los Angeles fire officials performed an annual summer ritual: 
They gave a news conference on the hazards of fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are entering brush fire season with the weather change and the brush 
conditions are back to the volatile state," said Roger Gillis, a department 
spokesman, at the Sherman Oaks Burn Center. "Fireworks and brush obviously 
don't mix." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis said all fireworks are illegal in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were nearly 500 fireworks injuries in 1984 compared to 222 last year, 
according to Fire Department statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Reseda Recreation Center, Holly Nickels, 20, and her two sons, Cody, 2, 
and Caleb, 6 months, fed the ducks in the man-made lake as a breeze helped cool 
the sun's scorching heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to come to the park because the kids' plastic pool was chewed up 
by the dog," Nickels said as she carried Caleb and handed crushed crackers to 
Cody. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will probably go get a little pool this weekend," she said, beads of 
perspiration starting to form on her nose. 
</P>
<P>
 In Woodland Hills, Varpkes Parsanian was getting ready to pour concrete at the 
Topanga Car Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are used to the heat," said Parsanian, 42, as he wiped the sweat from his 
face. "We drink lots of water because if you don't, you could die out there."

A VALEDICTORY VICTORY; MILLIONS HEAR STAR STUDENT'S ADDRESS DESPITE CAMPUS 
POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the speech no one was supposed to hear. Now millions have. Brad Bjelke, 
18, graduated at the top of his Saugus High School class with a grade-point 
average of 4.44 (he got extra points for taking honors classes). 
</P>
<P>
 But Brad never got to deliver a valedictorian speech. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials eliminated the honor this school year because, according to 
the principal, "it was a tradition that we didn't think had enough positives." 
</P>
<P>
 Not enough positives? Achieving the top grades in your class? 
</P>
<P>
 Even Mark Thompson and Brian Phelps -- who as hosts of the hugely popular 
"Mark and Brian" show on KLOS radio are paid handsomely to goof off -- 
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedic duo invited Brad to read his valedictorian speech Thursday morning 
on their show, ensuring that it was heard not only throughout greater Los 
Angeles, but also in other cities where the program is broadcast, including San 
Diego, Tucson and Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We must follow our dreams and never surrender to frustrations or obstacles 
which stand in the way," the tall, athletic Bjelke read as he sat before the 
microphone, flanked by Mark and Brian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our life," Bjelke said, "is what we make it." 
</P>
<P>
 You could almost hear "Pomp and Circumstance" in the background. Actually, 
Mark and Brian played a grossly out-of-tune version of the graduation dirge 
just before he read the speech. They also serenaded him with other tunes during 
his time on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bjelke -- who was finally getting his revenge against the school 
administration -- was having a great time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely the best time I could have had," Bjelke said when it was 
all over. "This is a blast." 
</P>
<P>
 Bjelke's excellent adventure began at 6:30 a.m. with the arrival of a 
chauffeured Lincoln Town Car sent by KLOS to whisk him and his mom from their 
Santa Clarita home to the Culver City radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad hadn't had much sleep, anyway. The night before was the graduation 
ceremony, during which he received a standing ovation leading the procession of 
graduating seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus High School officials had decided to eliminate valedictorian, 
salutatorian and top-10 honors for students beginning this year, instead 
designating anyone with a 3.75 or higher grade-point average as an honors 
student. School officials said the pressure to finish first had become so 
intense in recent years that one student became suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision struck a nerve with the public, and not just in Santa 
Clarita. After The Times reported that Bjelke's mother had spoken out at a 
school district meeting in June expressing her disappointment over the new 
policy, word of the situation spread nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone calls poured into the school and the Bjelke household. Conservative 
commentator Rush Limbaugh blasted the school's decision for two days on his 
radio show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little surprised there has been so much media attention," the easygoing 
Bjelke said during the ride to the station. 
</P>
<P>
 His classmates gave him a somewhat more irreverent but good-natured tribute 
late on graduation night. 
</P>
<P>
 They TP'd his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the night, Bjelke said he kept hearing the thump of toilet paper 
about every hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a couple of hours of sleep at the most," he said with a grin as the 
Town Car rolled down the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjelke took a call on one of two cellular phones. It was the station checking 
on his progress. At the end of the call, he could not figure out how to hang up 
the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sure you're a valedictorian?" asked the English-accented chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjelke was ushered through the iron gates outside the KLOS building and into a 
waiting room minutes before his scheduled 8 a.m. appearance. He said he felt 
surprisingly calm. 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed to a request from station officials to wear his graduation outfit 
while reading his speech but removed it shortly before going on the air because 
he felt uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's going to see me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother pressed his speech into his hands and suddenly, after a quick 
introduction and the "serenade" from Mark and Brian, the brainy student was on 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 He delivered his speech in a clear tone with no hitches or interruptions. It 
was full of proud memories of Saugus High, but it also contained a note of 
defiance for the school's decision to no longer honor valedictorians. 
</P>
<P>
 "For reasons not thoroughly explained, our administration has decided that 
academic competition is not healthy," he said. "However, I am privileged to 
represent the Class of 1994, and regardless of this year's new policy, I still 
am the valedictorian." 
</P>
<P>
 Bjelke left the studio to applause from the radio duo, but he wasn't done yet. 
</P>
<P>
 KLOS personnel guided him into an adjacent booth and handed him several 
typewritten sheets containing the news and weather, which he was asked to read 
at 8:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjelke looked a little startled, especially when Mark and Brian burst into the 
studio playing horns while he read the weather. But Bjelke read the newscast in 
the same clear tones in which he delivered his speech. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Station officials were impressed. "I'm surprised you were so calm," Rosemary 
Jimenez, affiliate relations director for KLOS, told him when he finished the 
newscast and was off the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "You seem to have a natural talent." 
</P>
<P>
 The young man took it to heart. He might end up being the brainiest morning 
radio host of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was neat," he said. "That's what I want to do for a living." 
</P>
<P>
 Laden with plastic cups, bumper stickers, Mark and Brian chef's hats and other 
KLOS memorabilia, Bjelke and Mrs. Bjelke finally left at about 9 a.m. and 
headed home to catch up on sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the Town Car, his mother expressed regret that because her son had to 
be up early for the show, he missed the post-graduation celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad didn't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," he said, "was better than any party I could have gone to." Speech 
Excerpt 
</P>
<P>
 We never know where life will take us. However, each member of this graduating 
class was blessed with the privilege of attending a school where it is possible 
to reach one's goals and explore one's ambitions. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For me, this graduation is extremely important. I am proud to represent the 
class of 1994, and I feel that we have come a long way together. I would like 
to thank my friends and my parents for all their love and support. In 
conclusion, whether or not our paths will cross in the future is doubtful, but 
I feel honored to have shared four years with you and to represent you as 
valedictorian on this extremely very special morning.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TEEN-AGERS MAKE PITCH AGAINST GANGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bet would not be settled until the bottom of the last inning, when Ziggy, 
a Vineland gang member since he was 11, swatted the ball into the outfield for 
a double, sending home Dora, whose brother wants to be a cop. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing would have meant the group of 15 Sun Valley teen-agers would each have 
to perform eight hours of community service under the direction of the San 
Fernando Valley Partnership, a group that works against alcohol and substance 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 But that hit by Sigifredo (Ziggy) Bravo, 17, means that the partnership will 
now sponsor one of four teams in a softball league the teen-agers are trying to 
create. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a regular hit," said Bravo, after being mobbed by his friends on 
an infield at Las Palmas Park in San Fernando. "I didn't think it would win it. 
It was exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the softball league came from the teen-agers themselves after 
they were invited to join a Youth Empowerment Committee set up by the East 
Valley Partnership Community Council, which works with the San Fernando Valley 
Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is made up of a wide range of youngsters, including both student 
achievers and gang members, but they have something in common. All want to 
improve their community. 
</P>
<P>
 Using $10,000 in grant money from the program "Keeping Youth Doing Something" 
and the East Valley partnership, the teen-agers are trying to start the 
four-team softball league in Sun Valley. They hope playing softball will help 
keep the younger kids in their neighborhoods away from drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a good life," said Osvaldo Nunez, 17, known as Ozzie among his 
fellow Vineland gang members. He joined the Youth Empowerment Committee about a 
year and a half ago, and has not been as active in gang activities as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still play ball with them; we still hang out," Nunez said. "They respect 
why I'm doing this. It's helping our people." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers said most kids turn to gangs because there is simply nothing 
else to do in their neighborhoods. "It seemed like the thing to do," said Rudy 
Cardenas, 19, who had been a gang member since he was 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Life has gotten better because of a peace treaty established among the gangs 
in the last year, but sports are needed to help reinforce it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing something positive," said Cardenas, who with Nunez was one of the 
first to join the Youth Empowerment Committee. "Now things are starting to 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Palato, a neighborhood specialist with the partnership and the softball 
team's coach, tried to create a good mix on the committee. "They each bring 
their own expertise," Palato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gang members bring some very practical ways of preventing drugs and gang 
involvement." Palato said. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; KAISER DONATES 5 CARS TO LAPD

<P>
 They won't be used in high-speed chases, but five cars donated to police by 
Kaiser Permanente will get more black and whites on the streets of the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation of five sedan-style vehicles comes in response to a call from 
Councilwoman Laura Chick to help the Los Angeles Police Department.The vehicles 
will boost the police fleet by freeing up patrol cars now used for 
administrative duties, such as traveling to and from court. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, Kaiser will challenge other organizations to follow its 
lead at a news conference at the LAPD's West Valley Division.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Chick) is on a crusade to get companies to help the cash-strapped LAPD," 
said Eric Rose, a spokesman for Chick. "She is going to make a challenge to 
other corporate leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Chick led a donation drive to computerize the West Valley Division, 
where officers had been writing up their reports by hand or on typewriters. 
Since then, several companies in the Valley have donated more than $30,000 in 
equipment to the division, including about 50 computers, bicycles and 
sophisticated camera equipment. SUSAN BYRNES

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: WORK BEGINS ON CAR-POOL LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans has begun work on adding a car-pool lane to a 10-mile stretch of the 
San Diego Freeway through the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The $12-million project will add diamond lanes in both directions on the San 
Diego Freeway between the Ventura and Golden State freeways.Workers have 
started restriping the freeway, said California Department of Transportation 
spokesman Russell Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials plan no long-term lane closures, but in the beginning stages of the 
project workers may close one lane of the San Diego Freeway between the Simi 
Valley and Golden State freeways in the evenings until temporary concrete 
barriers can be erected.  
</P>
<P>
 After that, the work will be done behind the barriers in the median or on the 
right shoulder, out of view of traffic.  
</P>
<P>
 The project is to be completed by the end of 1996 by the Fontana-based Brutoco 
Engineering and Construction Co., one of the contracting firms involved in 
rebuilding the earthquake-shattered Simi Valley Freeway. HENRY CHU

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; DUMP'S EXPANSION MAY SOON BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A decade after it was first proposed, expansion of the Sunshine Canyon 
Landfill north of Granada Hills may begin in the next few days, the dump's 
operator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning-Ferris Industries Inc. was granted permission Thursday by a Los 
Angeles County oversight committee to start preparing the land for the first 
phase of a 10-year, 17-million-ton expansion of the now-idle landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased about it," said Browning-Ferris spokesman Arnie Berghoff. 
"It's been a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the dump, including Los Angeles city officials, said they 
will continue to fight the expansion in a sensitive oak woodland. 
</P>
<P>
 The dump straddles the border between Los Angeles city and county. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say Browning-Ferris still needs permission for trash trucks to 
travel across the city portion of the dump as they make their way to the 
expansion, which is under the county's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have satisfied all of our requirements," said county planner Richard 
Frazier. "But there may be other people's requirements they have not met." 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion was approved by the Board of Supervisors in November, but work 
was delayed by legal challenges. Earlier this month, a state appeals court 
allowed the project to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents have filed new challenges, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the nearby communities of Granada Hills and Sylmar fear that 
reopening and expanding the dump will create health hazards in their 
neighborhoods and threaten the water supply at Van Norman Reservoir, just south 
of the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Browning-Ferris initially proposed in 1984 to increase the landfill's capacity 
by 70 million tons, but that plan was scaled back to 17 million tons and 
approved by the Board of Supervisors in 1991. That decision sparked a myriad of 
legal assaults by opponents, some of which continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in 1991, the dump ceased operations after its city permit expired. AARON 
CURTISS

<P>
 Residents and World Cup tourists alike can put on their cowboy boots and kick 
up their heels tonight at a country-Western street party on Brand Boulevard in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials will close Brand Boulevard from California Avenue to Broadway 
from 6 to 10 p.m. to make way for the nine-piece country-Western band 
Branscombe Richmond & The Renegade Posse. 
</P>
<P>
 The band will perform with Darlene And The Dixie Flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The street party also will feature a ranch-style barbecue, prizes and 
line-dancing lessons hosted by In Cahoots Dance Hall & Saloon. 
</P>
<P>
 The party is the second in a series of three events designed by city officials 
to lure World Cup fans to Glendale to patronize local eateries, shops, hotels 
and theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 To kick off World Cup festivities, the city presented a soccer dribbling 
event, which drew crowds of residents to watch participants kick a soccer ball 
for one-tenth of a mile each around an 18-mile course that spanned the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The third and final World Cup promotional event in Glendale will be a cruise 
night from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. on July 15. This street party also will be held on 
Brand Boulevard between California Avenue and Broadway and will feature Dick 
Dale and Big Sandy and his Fly-Rite Boys. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND; 2 MEN ACCUSED OF ILLEGAL DISPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney's office on Thursday filed criminal charges 
against two men accused of dumping hazardous waste from a failed auto body shop 
down a hillside in La Tuna Canyon State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty.Donald Kass said a passerby allegedly saw Onik Damaryan, 42, 
of Los Angeles and David Azaryan, 40, of Burbank rolling drums down a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's characterized as midnight dumping," Kass said. "But this time there was 
an actual witness who was driving by and spotted two men stopped by the side of 
the road. It was fortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 The two are accused of dumping three drums -- ranging in size from five to 55 
gallons -- containing mixtures of automotive wastes with a gasoline odor. 
</P>
<P>
 The drums were found next to a dry stream bed in La Tuna Canyon, according to 
Kass, who said one of the drums was leaking when it was inspected by a park 
ranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are charged with illegally disposing of hazardous waste and 
unlawfully depositing a hazardous substance on another's property, charges that 
together carry a maximum one year in jail or $110,000 in fines, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 The men are scheduled to be arraigned July 28 in Los Angeles Municipal Court.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; 3-DAY UNITY DAY FAIR IS SCHEDULED

<P>
 In an effort to build goodwill throughout the community and the entire San 
Fernando Valley, Pacoima will hold its third annual Unity Day Fair today, 
Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to show the rest of the San Fernando Valley we can live 
together," Pacoima Chamber of Commerce spokeswoman Beatrice Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities, sponsored by the chamber and the Los Angeles Department of 
Parks and Recreation, will kick off today at 4 p.m. at Hubert Humphrey Park 
with live entertainment, carnival rides, dancers and ethnic foods to show off 
the community's cultural diversity. 
</P>

 The event runs until 10 p.m. today and from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. Saturday and 
Sunday. It will include speeches and appearances by community leaders, elected 
officials and clergy Saturday and Sunday. The event offers the perfect time and 
place to put recent racial tensions to bed and come together in celebration of 
unity, Hines said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is at 12560 Filmore St. For information, call the chamber at (818)

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MENTORS FROM DISNEY ASSIST STUDENT ARTISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They brainstormed. And they brainstormed. And they talked about the project 
some more. 
</P>
<P>
 To glance at the schedule for creating the 17-foot-wide by 30-foot-tall 
multicolored mural "Cries of the Unheard," which hangs from the south wall of 
the Alex Theatre, is to see what really goes into a project this size. 
</P>
<P>
 For nine months, 34 Glendale high school students and teachers met weekly with 
mentors from Walt Disney Imagineering to design, research, budget, sketch and 
paint the mural. The group's first seven meetings involved brainstorming about 
the project's theme and how it should be illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Svendsen, who works in the show design department at Walt Disney 
Imagineering, said brainstorming is crucial for Disney Imagineers who literally 
spend hundreds of hours creating theme park attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good system for doing projects," Svendsen said. "We're experienced 
in getting people together to form a chemistry between them." 
</P>
<P>
 After many planning sessions, the group took its inspiration for the mural's 
theme from a poem written by Glendale High School student and mural team member 
Mike Haltom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the ashes of the fire we arise. Holding a new light with a new guise. 
Plants always grow in fresh new soil. Plant the seeds of hope before it 
spoils," reads the caption taken from Haltom's poem and placed at the bottom of 
the mural. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mural, a phoenix rises out of a city plagued by decay and destruction, 
illustrating how today's youth attempt to overcome generations of neglect, 
mural sponsors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the mural's somber theme, Walt Disney Imagineering mentor Hani 
El-Masri said the painting is the end product of a project that gave students 
from Daily, Glendale, Crescenta Valley and Hoover high schools some real-life 
experience outside a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you don't see here is what people learned from this project -- the mural 
is just the cherry on the ice cream, but it's not the real fruit," El-Masri 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mural is the third collaborative project between the Glendale Unified 
School District and Walt Disney Imagineering in three years, said district 
spokesman Vic Pallos. 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership program has provided students with internship-type 
opportunities and allowed them to develop first-rate portfolios and contacts in 
the art world, said retired art teacher Duane Hagen. 
</P>
<P>
 Mural team member and Glendale High School alum Hyung Sun Kim agreed, adding 
that the mural project helped him learn to work with others and how to bring 
the ideas of many individuals together to form a single work of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mural was unveiled this month, the district and Imagineering mentors 
have resumed brainstorming, and are discussing a project that would involve 
construction -- such as a fountain or a sculpture. JENNIFER OLDHAM

FIRE GUTS VACANT APARTMENT UNIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire destroyed a first floor unit of a vacant three-story apartment building 
Thursday and damaged some others on the second floor, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 firefighters fought the 4:32 p.m. blaze in the 4200 block of Mary 
Ellen Avenue, said Jim Wells, a Los Angeles City Fire Department spokesman. 
Firefighters extinguished the blaze, but not before it spread to units on the 
second floor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, damaged in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, is vacant while 
undergoing repairs, Wells said. The building was not red-tagged, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters estimated the damage at $40,000. The cause of the fire is still 
under investigation, Wells said.

GANG MEMBER SOUGHT IN SHOOTING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homicide investigators Thursday identified a member of a street gang as a 
suspect in the shooting death of a Canoga Park man who had returned to his old 
neighborhood to attend a family party, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Germaine Hill, 21, of Pacoima is being sought by police in the June 12 
shooting of Wesley Williams, 23, who was found in a pool of blood about 11 p.m. 
in the 11560 block of Wheeler Street in Lake View Terrace, said Detective Frank 
Bishop of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities obtained a murder warrant for Hill's arrest on Thursday, Bishop 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting took place at a party held down the street from the house of 
Williams' relatives, Bishop said. Williams went to the second party because he 
knew the hosts, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came back for a family party and thought he'd go down and check out the 
(other) party," Bishop said. "He had been out of the area for 10 years, living 
Downtown (Los Angeles) and in Canoga Park." 
</P>
<P>
 As the party progressed, fights broke out in the back yard of the house and 
Williams, trying to avoid the trouble, walked around the side of the house 
intending to leave the party, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, investigators believe, Williams accidentally bumped into Hill 
and the two men exchanged words, Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill then followed Williams into the front yard and began shooting, firing at 
him numerous times, Bishop said. Williams was taken to Pacifica Industrial 
Medical Center in Sun Valley, where he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop said the two men knew each other before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew the suspect, knew him by name," Bishop said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is described as a black male who stands 5 foot 9 and weighs 145 pounds, 
Bishop said. Police are asking anyone with information about the suspect to 
contact Detectives Rick Plows or Keith Honore at (818) 834-3113.

PROBATION GIVEN TO TAX PREPARER IN MORTGAGE FRAUD; CRIME: THE TARZANA MAN 
PREPARED RETURNS FOR TWO OTHERS NOW AWAITING SENTENCING IN THE $7.6-MILLION 
SCHEME.

<P>
 A Tarzana tax preparer has been sentenced to five years' probation for his 
role in a $7.6-million mortgage fraud scheme that involved the purchase of 
expensive houses in Los Angeles and Ventura counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Arend, 62, who pleaded guilty to two counts of mail fraud, was also 
ordered to pay $10,000 in restitution, Assistant U.S. Atty. Peter Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 The restitution is "a drop in the bucket, compared to the total losses in this 
case," Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arend was a tax preparer for Navtej Kohli, 35, of Malibu and Charles Myers, 
49, of Camarillo, who orchestrated the complicated scheme, Spivack said. The 
two pleaded guilty in February and will be sentenced July 21, Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others involved in the scheme have also pleaded guilty and are awaiting 
sentencing. They are Ross Como, 34, of San Juan Capistrano, owner of Westwood 
Escrow Co. in West Los Angeles; Walter Pituch, 43, of Chino Hills, owner of 
W.P. Escrow Co. in Brea; Norbert Arriola, 60, of Las Vegas; Harvey Diamond, 58, 
of Manhattan Beach; Douglas Sefton, 56, of Phelan and Don Stout, 46, of Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohli and Myers managed to cheat banks and homeowners out of millions of 
dollars with the help of fraudulent escrow companies and fake buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohli and Myers would approach owners who were selling residences worth 
$500,000 or more and offer to buy the property, Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with Como and Pituch at the escrow companies, Kohli and Myers would 
prepare documents that actually listed the buyer as another person -- a fake 
buyer who was paid $5,000 to $10,000 by Kohli and Myers. The escrow papers 
would also inflate the sale price of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a paper sell only and the real seller never sees any of the documents," 
Spivack said. "It's created solely to fool the banks." 
</P>
<P>
 The two would use the name of the fake buyer to apply for loans from banks and 
other lending institutions, Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things they would submit to show that the straw buyers could pay 
off the loans were tax returns prepared by Arend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bogus tax returns would show high yearly incomes that led banks to fund 
the loan, Spivack said. Twelve properties were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 When Kohli and Myers received the loan money, the two paid the straw buyers 
and paid the sellers of the house a portion of the purchase price. They issued 
promissory notes for the remaining amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't pay off the full purchase price," Spivack said. "They would 
take the rest and spend it on personal expenses, living well." 
</P>
<P>
 The loans were never paid or were defaulted on after one or two payments, 
leaving the banks and the sellers out millions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The straw buyers are now being sued by the lenders and their credit is ruined, 
Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an awful lot of consequences for $5,000 to $10,000," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arend, who could have received 60 years in prison for his role in the scheme, 
received a light sentence in exchange for his early cooperation and his 
agreement to testify against Kohli and Myers, Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohli pleaded guilty in February to one count of conspiracy and 10 counts of 
mail fraud. He could be sentenced to up to 305 years prison but will probably 
receive six to 10 years, Spivack said. Myers pleaded guilty to one count of 
conspiracy and seven counts of mail fraud. He also faces up to 305 years in 
prison but will probably receive between six and 10 years.

COORDINATING COUNCIL CALLED 'CATALYST FOR ACTION'; PACOIMA: THE GROUP, 
CELEBRATING ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY, CONTINUES ITS WORK TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY A 
BETTER PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In this community's battle against drugs and alcoholism, the Pacoima 
Coordinating Council has been where the war plans have been laid out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a catalyst for action," said the Rev. Alicia Broadous Duncan, the 
group's recording secretary for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which celebrated its 50th anniversary at a luncheon Thursday, 
does much as its name implies. It coordinates. 
</P>
<P>
 It played a key role in the late 1980s when activists identified a major 
problem with drugs, crime and alcoholism, which in part was made worse by 
Pacoima's proliferation of problem liquor stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold White, the council's new president, said activists led by the 
Coordinating Council have been able to persuade city officials to deny permits 
to most prospective store owners. "I can't remember a case which we have lost," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the community's alcoholism rate has dropped and the number of 
liquor stores has declined. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also coordinated an effort to persuade the city to impose special 
restrictions on liquor stores and worked with store owners to make them more 
responsible and responsive to the blue-collar community. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the San Fernando Valley Partnership Against Substance Abuse and 
other local agencies, the council fought against a proliferation of billboards 
promoting alcohol in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups persuaded billboard companies to limit the alcohol advertising and 
co-sponsored a contest last month to select artwork from local schoolchildren 
that will be used in an anti-alcohol billboard campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The image of Pacoima has changed in the last 10 years," White said. "But we 
still have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Officer Tom Souza, who has been in the San Fernando Valley 
for almost 30 years, said the Coordinating Council has helped turn the 
community around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that what they were doing was effective, so I wanted to lend myself to 
it," said Souza, who started working with the council about a year ago. What 
the group does makes his job easier, he said. "These people are solid 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To plan strategy to make the community better, the council's members, 
including about 40 individuals and representatives of community organizations, 
churches and businesses, meet once a month at the Girls & Boys Club on Glenoaks 
Boulevard, where Thursday's luncheon took place. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk out issues, check schedules -- and they coordinate. 
</P>
<P>
 With the range of groups and individuals checking with each other, the council 
serves as a clearinghouse on all Pacoima issues. And when the council decides 
on a course of action, the word gets out through its members to much of the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more effective that way because people aren't clashing with each other," 
Duncan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Coordinating Council has played a very integral part in bringing them all 
together into one network," said Marie Harris, who has been with the council 
off and on for about 20 years, and is a member of a variety of community 
groups. "I think Pacoima is better with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Sanders, who stepped down as president of the Coordinating Council on 
Thursday, put the council's role in the community simply: "We are interested in 
helping the youth of the community. We would like a safer and more attractive 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 White, who grew up in Pacoima, said the community is very different than it 
was 30 years ago. He remembers dirt roads, hard-working people, family values 
and church activities. Pacoima's image may need polishing a bit but, White 
said, those values still remain.

COMEDIAN PLEADS INNOCENT TO SETTING FIRE ON TV SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Stand-up comedian Bobcat Goldthwait pleaded innocent Thursday to misdemeanor 
charges of unlawfully setting his chair on fire during a May 6 taping of "The 
Tonight Show with Jay Leno." 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-born entertainer, who appeared in some of the "Police Academy" 
movies, waived his right to appear for an arraignment at Burbank Municipal 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Goldthwait's lawyer, Peter Laird, entered the plea on his client's 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 Laird and Goldthwait's managers Tim Anctil and Ron Stone were unavailable for 
comment after the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 An NBC spokesperson said the network believes that the comedian is the first 
guest of "The Tonight Show" ever charged with committing a crime on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In a skit that aired Wednesday on the late-night program, Goldthwait appeared 
buried in a sandbox at a make-believe NBC day-care center. He cried, "Jay, let 
me out! I promise I'll be good," as a child poured sand over his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait was a guest on "The Tonight Show" in May, when he suddenly stood up 
during an interview with Leno and set his chair afire using lighter fluid and a 
long-handled lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 A startled Leno and guest Lauren Hutton, a model, doused the fire with cups of 
water. The unscripted stunt aired the same night. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank fire officials -- worried that Leno, Hutton and the studio audience 
might have been injured -- said Goldthwait pulled the stunt without a proper 
permit or a firefighter nearby in case of an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "Squirting that fluid the way he did, it's a wonder it didn't come back up in 
the can and cause an explosion, which would have seriously burned him and 
anyone nearby," Fire Capt. Richard Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department has "tried and not been able to have any contact with him 
or his attorney," Fischer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait was charged with unlawfully causing a fire and possessing a 
flammable device with the intent to burn. The misdemeanors are punishable by up 
to six months in jail, a maximum fine of $1,000, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 "The charges are not the most serious charges in (all) of criminal history, 
but they are valid and that's all that's required," said Deputy City Atty. 
Robert W. Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 A pretrial hearing for the comedian has been set for July 22.

MAN CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED KILLING OF BOY 
</P>

 A 4-year-old twin is comatose and breathing with the help of a respirator, and 
his mother's boyfriend could face a murder charge if the child dies, 
prosecutors said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The boyfriend, Fateheen Rahman, 22, of Glendale has been charged with the 
attempted murder of Jason Thivener and with child abuse involving the boy's 
twin sister, Jessica, in connection with events that took place while Rahman 
was baby-sitting the children at their Van Nuys home on June 12, Deputy Dist. 
Atty.Lea Purwin D'Agostino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason is in critical condition at the pediatric intensive care ward at 
Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, where his condition took a turn for the 
worse when he suffered a stroke over the weekend, prosecutors said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jessica was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahman, who has pleaded not guilty, faces a preliminary hearing July 6 on the 
attempted murder charge. But if Jason dies, D'Agostino said, the charge will be 
upgraded to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the baby is in the hospital and on a ventilator. There has been no 
improvement," D'Agostino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Rahman allegedly choked and slapped Jason after ordering the 
children to stop crying. He was filling in for the regular baby-sitter when 
their mother, a 25-year-old woman authorities declined to name, was called to 
work on her day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahman is being held on $500,000 bail.

MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN FATAL SHOOTING AT PARTY; LANCASTER: CHARGE WAS REDUCED TO 
VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER PARTLY BECAUSE WITNESSES WERE UNWILLING TO TESTIFY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Lancaster man accused of shooting his half brother to death pleaded no 
contest to voluntary manslaughter Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Lamont Gunn, 23, made the plea in Superior Court as part of an agreement 
with prosecutors that will result in him getting a nine-year prison sentence. 
Formal sentencing will take place July 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn fatally shot Rayshaun Love, 17, at a pay-to-enter party Dec. 19 in 
Lancaster. Two other men were wounded when the party turned violent. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn was initially charged with a count of murder, two counts of attempted 
murder and one count of possessing of rock cocaine, which was found on him at 
the time of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the plea bargain, entered before Judge Haig Kehiayan, Gunn 
plead guilty to a voluntary manslaughter charge and admitted use of a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven D. Ogden said the plea bargain was struck partly 
because of a lack of witnesses willing to testify in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were about 100 people at the party, only one eyewitness, Darius 
Perry, came forward, Ogden said. Perry was one of the two men injured during 
the shooting and while still hospitalized he identified Gunn as the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 But during a preliminary hearing in March, Perry answered, "I ain't sure," 
when asked if Gunn was the one who shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Ogden said, if the case had gone to trial he believes members of 
Gunn's family would have said Gunn was home at the time of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden also said the circumstances of the fatal shooting were more appropriate 
for a voluntary manslaughter conviction than murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a classic shooting on a sudden quarrel," Ogden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn, according to court records, allegedly began firing a small handgun after 
Perry spilled beer on Gunn's shoes. Prosecutors said that Gunn shot Perry in 
the shoulder and then fired into the crowd, fatally shooting his half-brother 
and wounding another person. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel R. Martinez Jr., the public defender representing Gunn, said the plea 
bargain was in Gunn's best interest considering the risk of the case going to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he went to trial he was facing 30 years to life, if convicted," Martinez 
said. "And while the evidence was in my view very weak, technically it was 
sufficient for conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 With the deal entered Wednesday, Martinez said Gunn might be released from 
prison in as little as 4 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The plea bargain pleased Martha Jordan, the mother of both Love and Gunn, 
according to Martinez. "She was happy that the case had been settled in this 
fashion and she would be seeing her son come home in a reasonable period of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of Love's killing, the Lancaster City Council passed a law 
that outlaws pay-to-enter parties in residential neighborhoods. A fine of $500 
and/or six months in jail can be imposed on anyone holding such parties. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three people, including Love, have died and numerous others have been 
injured at pay-to-enter parties in the Antelope Valley since 1990.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MANLEY QUITS CHAMBER POST AFTER BANK BOARD 
FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Manley, fired earlier this month as president of Valencia National 
Bank, has resigned as president of the Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley, fired June 1 by bank board members who stated they were unhappy with 
the bank's financial performance, said he plans to take legal action against 
the board.He said he submitted his resignation Wednesday to the chamber because 
several members of the organization are on the bank board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since as chamber president I am acting as a spokesman for all members, 
including members of the chamber with whom I would be an adversary," he said, 
speaking from his home, "I think integrity would indicate that I resign." 
</P>
<P>
 Manley, 51, had served six months as the chamber's president. 
</P>
<P>
 He contends he was terminated from the bank because he was getting tough about 
collecting delinquent loans made to former and current board members. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said resigning the chamber post will give him more time to 
look for a new job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may or may not be in the Santa Clarita Valley," he said. "I hope it is." 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation was not encouraged by the chamber, said Executive Vice 
President Viki Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the contrary, we have been reinforcing his position and telling him we 
wanted him to stay," she said. "There were a lot of things he was doing, a lot 
of projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Johnson, owner of a computer business and a longtime chamber member, has 
been named the new chamber president, Rudolf said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ANTELOPE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICT SAYS IT'S 
DEBT-FREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two years after veering dangerously close to bankruptcy, the Antelope Valley 
Union High School District has declared itself solvent and able to operate 
without an outside fiscal overseer. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Wednesday night, school board members celebrated by tearing up 
sheets of paper representing the district's major debts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went through two very bad years of trying to get this budget balanced, and 
we came very close to a state takeover," board President Billy Pricer said 
Thursday. "We've recovered in record time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll no longer have to have a fiscal adviser from the county, but the county 
is still going to watch us very closely." 
</P>
<P>
 The district, which has about 12,500 students and operates six schools, was 
placed under special supervision in 1992 after administrators determined that 
the district was deeply in debt. Ultimately, the shortfall was estimated at 
about $12 million, and the district had to obtain an $8-million loan from the 
county to continue operating. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Office of Education assigned retired school 
administrator Norman Miller to oversee the district's finances, giving him 
authority over spending decisions. At Wednesday's meeting, the school board 
gave a plaque of appreciation to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 To erase the debt, district officials eliminated more than 100 non-teaching 
jobs -- such as secretaries and maintenance workers -- and did not hire new 
teachers to take the place of those who retired or resigned. In addition, all 
district employees received a 7% cut in pay in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the budget cuts, class sizes have grown and the schools have 
run low on textbooks and supplies. "These last two years have been just 
horrible," said Con Oamek, assistant superintendent for business. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the district, which just adopted a balanced $53-million budget for 
the coming year, is now in much better shape. "We owe nothing. We have no 
debt," Oamek said. "Our credit card is paid off."

CARL'S JR. TEST OF GREEN BURRITO GETS GO-AHEAD; FAST FOOD: THE ANAHEIM-BASED 
CHAIN IS ALSO NEGOTIATING TO TRY OUT LONG JOHN SILVER'S FISH AT EIGHT 
LOCATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a year after a brutal boardroom fight erupted over introducing dual 
menus at its restaurants, the Carl's Jr. fast-food chain has agreed to test 
Green Burrito Mexican-style food in six locations and is negotiating to add 
Long John Silver's fried fish at eight other outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to the dual menu strategy, announced late Thursday, is an effort by 
the Anaheim-based hamburger chain to give families a wider choice of fast-food 
meals. The strategy is essentially a smaller version of the food courts at 
shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl's Jr. will add the test to its ongoing value menu concept, which is aimed 
at promoting good food at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The value menu has not spurred sales as much as the parent company, CKE 
Restaurants Inc., had hoped, mainly because the company rolled out its program 
long after other chains had established theirs. So the market test of the dual 
menu idea has been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had the value menu blown everyone's socks off, we wouldn't do this," William 
P. Foley II, CKE's chairman, said candidly. "We also are trying to be 
responsive to franchisees, who want us to try something new." 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said he is "real excited" about the dual menu strategy and that it is 
part of an "overall concept and plan to try a number of ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Franchise stores in Laguna Niguel and the Palm Desert area are among the six 
outlets that CKE will change over in the next month to accommodate Green 
Burrito foods. A third franchise location and three company-owned sites remain 
to be selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said the change-over will consist mainly of making room on menu boards 
for Green Burrito meals, training employees to handle those products, changing 
over cash registers to record the separate transactions, and changing signs. 
Carl's Jr. and Green Burrito will share profits from the test sites. No 
remodeling should be needed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the concept proves successful, the deal also provides for CKE to exchange 
warrants for up to 20% of the stock in Green Burrito's parent company, GB Foods 
Corp. in Anaheim, and gives GB Foods warrants to buy up to 2.5% of CKE stock. 
Voting control over stock bought, however, would remain with the chairmen of 
the respective companies. 
</P>
<P>
 CKE, meantime, is continuing talks with Long John Silver's to add the 
Louisville company's seafood meals to five Carl's Jr. outlets in San Diego 
County and up to three stores in the Bakersfield area. Foley said both 
companies are anxious to complete the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 The dual concept menu with Green Burrito was promoted a year ago by CKE's 
founder, Carl N. Karcher, then the company's chairman. Independent directors 
didn't want to sell competing products and, more important, didn't like a 
number of strings that came with Karcher's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that deal, Karcher, then in deep financial trouble, would have 
received a much-needed loan from William M. Theisen, who controls GB Foods and 
became its chairman this week. Theisen also would have joined CKE's board as 
vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher's insistence that his plan be adopted instead of the value menu then 
backed by Chief Executive Donald E. Doyle and other directors led to a bitter 
and much publicized board battle and to Karcher's ouster Oct. 1 as CKE's 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley led a team of investors who rescued Karcher from his financial trouble 
by taking control of most of Karcher's stock. Foley, acting as a mediator, 
helped to pave the way for Karcher's return as chairman emeritus, and Foley 
took over as chairman earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 During the rescue effort, Foley had said that he supported the value menu and 
would give it time to work, holding the dual menu strategy in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 CKE's directors voted unanimously, without abstentions, at their board meeting 
Monday to test market the dual menu concept.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: IS THE FUND INDUSTRY TOYING WITH ITS INTEGRITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As competition in the mutual fund business grows increasingly intense, more 
players in the industry appear willing to sacrifice integrity in the name of 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 For a $2-trillion business built on public confidence, this trend is 
disheartening at best and downright dangerous at worst. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, the industry's drift has been apparent in allegations of 
insider trading by fund managers, unsavory fund sales practices at banks and 
the use of high-risk securities in normally conservative money market funds. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the latest blow to public confidence in the funds, someone at industry 
titan Fidelity Investments decided last Friday to send newspapers Thursday's 
prices for most Fidelity funds because the Friday data wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ensuing public humiliation suffered by Fidelity this week, as it was 
forced to 'fess up to its intentional mistake, the firm has emphasized that 
nobody bought or sold a fund direct from Fidelity at the wrong price. 
</P>
<P>
 Though newspapers last Saturday unknowingly listed Thursday prices for about 
150 of Fidelity's 208 funds, the firm says transactions effected Friday were 
made at the correct prices, which Fidelity got after it met newspaper deadlines 
with the wrong data early Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't change the fact that most Fidelity shareholders were lied to, 
in varying degrees, if they looked at their fund prices in newspapers last 
weekend. For most funds, the difference between the true and incorrect price 
was less than 1%, but a wrong number is a wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified Fidelity employee who made the decision to go with incorrect 
prices should simply have listed them as "not available." That would be 
standard Fidelity procedure, said Jane Jamieson, senior vice president at the 
Boston-based company. "This was an error in judgment on our part," she said. 
"We have taken several steps to ensure that it doesn't happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity's mistake and most of the fund industry's self-administered black 
eyes this year have one thing in common: They could have been prevented if the 
employees involved were playing by the rules -- either the fund companies' 
internal rules or the "prudent man" rule that is supposed to govern the 
investment of money entrusted by the public to allegedly professional money 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that it can become very tempting to bend or break the rules in 
the name of staying "competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Take Fidelity's case: Someone there had to make a fast decision when a 
software problem resulted in botched fund prices last Friday, shortly before 
the company was due to report the day's data to newspapers. Had Fidelity 
provided no prices for most of its funds, it would have appeared to be having a 
problem that wasn't shared by other fund companies (which, of course, was 
true). 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, investors who compare fund prices and performance by using weekend 
newspapers would have had little data on Fidelity funds, perhaps costing 
Fidelity some new investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity won't say what motivated the employee who made the decision, but it's 
hard to imagine that the issue of competition wasn't involved somewhere along 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way, competitive pressures have figured prominently in the 
brouhaha over sales of funds by banks. State regulators charged earlier this 
year that many conservative bank customers who were buying fund shares from 
bank salespeople had no clue about the risk and weren't being adequately 
educated by the salespeople. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many mutual fund companies that had partnered with the banks insisted they 
could do little to control the transactions beyond providing "clear" warnings 
of risk in fund literature -- which, unfortunately, we know that many eager 
fund buyers don't read or comprehend thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 Some regulators argued that a bank lobby was no place to sell uninsured mutual 
funds and that the uninformed customer today would be a litigious customer 
tomorrow, when his or her fund shares suddenly lost a big chunk of their value 
in a market downturn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But as burgeoning fund companies battle for market share, creating new funds 
at a blistering and unprecedented pace, the risk of taking on the uninformed 
customer has been outweighed by the near-term profit potential -- in the form 
of management fees and commissions on new money. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a pattern here, and it's changing the whole dynamic of the business," 
worries one former fund executive who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, some growing pains in this now-gigantic industry were unavoidable. 
The bigger the business gets, the greater the potential for problems, either 
within formerly small and relatively easily managed organizations or at the 
fringe, with the entry of so many new fund players. 
</P>
<P>
 "This business is so large now that you're naturally going to have some stupid 
people doing stupid things," says Kathryn McGrath, a Washington lawyer who 
oversaw the fund business for the Securities and Exchange Commission in the 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 What she worries more about, McGrath says, is the potential for a large 
contingent of the industry to lose its traditional tendency toward 
overcautiousness, a quality that helped keep the business remarkably clean for 
most of the last 50 years -- unlike the banking, brokerage and S&L businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that the fund industry was good and scared," McGrath says. 
"They'd call the SEC before they'd do anything" that might appear at all 
questionable. Now, she says, the risk is that too many funds "feel as if 
they're too smart." 
</P>
<P>
 The great danger is that public confidence in the funds may be slipping, a 
victim of so much recent bad publicity. And in the financial services business, 
confidence ultimately is all there is between prosperity and ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this overstating the case? Most fund executives would probably say so. "I 
don't believe there is an erosion of public confidence in this industry," says 
Matt Fink, head of the Investment Company Institute, the funds' chief trade 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 He argues that the industry continues to police itself well, this year's 
controversies notwithstanding. Moreover, several fund companies' recent 
decisions to cover money market fund losses caused by so-called derivative 
securities demonstrate the industry's commitment to keeping public confidence, 
Fink and others say. 
</P>
<P>
 But fund shareholders might ask a more basic question: Why were normally 
conservative money market funds investing in derivative securities in the first 
place? The answer, naturally, has to do with performance and the need to stay 
competitive -- perhaps too competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's Corp., which rates the quality of 200 money market funds, 
this week announced that it may downgrade the AAA rating of BankAmerica's 
Pacific Horizon Government fund, depending on the fund's ability to reduce its 
exposure to derivative securities in the portfolio. In May, BofA spent $17.4 
million to cover derivative-induced losses in one of its other money funds. 
</P>
<P>
 S&P analyst Sandy Bragg says money funds have felt compelled to cross into the 
risky territory of derivatives to try for an edge over competitors. "The 
environment they've been in is such that getting a few extra basis points in 
yield means a lot" in marketing a fund, Bragg says. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, those few extra points are costing some fund players dearly, 
financially and image-wise. An early warning for the entire industry?

INSURER BIDS $3.25 BILLION FOR KEMPER; MERGERS: SURPRISING OFFER BY 
LITTLE-KNOWN CONSECO COULD SPUR CONSOLIDATION IN INSURANCE INDUSTRY. GE 
WITHDRAWS ITS BID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little-known Indiana-based insurance company on Thursday bid $3.25 billion 
for Kemper Corp., forcing General Electric Co. to withdraw its rival offer for 
the insurance and mutual funds company. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprising $67-a-share takeover offer by Conseco Inc., a fast-growing life 
and health insurance company that has grown primarily through acquisitions, 
could stimulate consolidation in the insurance industry as other insurers feel 
pressure to cut costs and get bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of Conseco and Kemper would create an insurance and financial 
powerhouse with $85 billion in assets. Besides selling insurance, Kemper owns 
the nation's seventh-largest group of mutual funds, a brokerage company and 
other money management operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the right strategic step for Conseco," said Stephen Hilbert, founder 
and chairman of the Carmel, Ind.-based company. "Kemper not only meshes well 
with our existing business mix, it brings us a significant new presence in 
mutual funds, variable annuities, brokerage and money management activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper -- which put itself up for sale in May after receiving an unwanted bid 
from GE's financial unit, GE Capital Corp. -- would not comment on Conseco's 
offer, saying only that its board will consider the proposal along with any 
other bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Conseco said Kemper must respond to the offer by Sunday. The short deadline is 
meant to put pressure on Kemper and give other bidders as little time as 
possible to counter-bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Other potential bidders are said to include SunAmerica Inc., a Los 
Angeles-based financial services company. 
</P>
<P>
 GE Capital, which had an outstanding $60-a-share bid for Kemper, wasted no 
time in terminating its offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wish both Kemper and Conseco success," said a statement issued by GE 
Capital, which has financed some of Conseco's previous insurance acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said GE's decision to pull out shows it is too wrapped up in 
problems with its Kidder, Peabody & Co. brokerage subsidiary to engage in a 
bidding war for Kemper. But GE denied that its Kidder problems had any 
influence on its withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Conseco offer, each Kemper share would be exchanged for $56 in cash 
and $11 worth of Conseco stock. Conseco would also assume Kemper's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said Conseco's offer will be hard to top. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, Kemper stock soared $3.375 a share to close at 
$62.625, while Conseco added 50 cents a share to $51. GE also gained 50 cents a 
share to close at $46. 
</P>
<P>
 A takeover of Kemper would be the largest for Conseco, which has amassed $19 
billion in assets through the acquisition of 11 insurance companies. In every 
case, Conseco has increased profits at the newly acquired companies by boosting 
productivity and cutting costs.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's an aggressive group," said David Armstrong, vice president at Firemark 
Research, an insurance industry consulting firm based in Parsippany, N.J. "They 
are cost cutters."  
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, Conseco has also sold off parts of the insurers to limited 
partnerships while retaining operational control of the companies. The process 
allows Conseco to cut takeover debt and pursue other acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the insurance industry, which can be staid and Old World, Conseco stands 
out on the cutting edge," said Adam Klauber, an insurance industry analyst at 
Duff & Phelps, a financial research firm in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides merging overlapping operations, a combination of Conseco and Kemper 
could also result in a wider distribution of each other's products. Kemper 
insurance, for example, could be sold through the more than 300 banks that sell 
Conseco products. Kemper brokers could also offer customers Conseco policies 
along with other financial services and products. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A successful merger of the two could speed up a long-awaited industry 
consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is clearly a lot of expectation of mega-mergers in the financial 
services industry . . . where companies cross industry lines," said Don Lewis, 
a financial services consultant at the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen in 
Los Angeles. But "the insurance business has been extremely slow to change."

HOME SALES SLIP AS LOAN RATES CLIMB; HOUSING: REALTORS PUT ON A HAPPY FACE, 
POINTING OUT THAT PACE STILL EXCEEDS LAST YEAR'S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Home sales in California dropped a slight 4.5% last month, the state's realty 
trade group said Thursday, as rising mortgage rates continued to push many 
first-time buyers out of the housing market. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents in Southern California generally put a positive spin on the 
news, saying the modesty of the decline indicated that the region's housing 
market is still rebounding. They noted that the sales pace was still sharply 
higher than in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the market was in bad shape, the kind of rate jump we've seen over the 
past few months would have sent sales down at least 10%, or even more," said 
Pat Neal, an Orange County real estate broker and president of the trade group. 
"Instead, the market seems to be absorbing most of the rate increases. That's a 
very positive sign." 
</P>
<P>
 But the sales decline reported Thursday was the latest in a string of bad news 
for mortgage bankers and most other lenders, many of whom began laying off 
hundreds of employees after rising rates this spring choked off a two-year 
refinancing boom. 
</P>
<P>
 With sales now falling too, some lenders say more layoffs may be in the 
offing. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest sales report by the California Assn. of Realtors said homes sold in 
May at a 480,500 annual rate, down 4.5% from April's 503,390 pace. However, May 
sales were up 20% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade group blamed the April-to-May decline on rising interest rates. 
Fixed mortgage rates stood at about 7% in February but have since shot up to 
8.5%, adding about $150 to the monthly cost of a $150,000, 30-year loan. 
</P>
<P>
 When mortgage rates began shooting up in February, it ended a long refinancing 
boom that had added millions of dollars to lender's profits over the last two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California homeowners refinanced $2.65 billion worth of loans last 
month, according to the La Jolla-based research firm Dataquick Information 
Systems, down a staggering 72% from a peak of $9.36 billion last October and 
off 67% from $8.05 billion in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders had hoped that a pickup in sales would offset much of the lower 
refinancing revenue, but so far that hasn't happened. Loans to consumers who 
want to buy houses were up only 35% in May from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lenders who thought that their skins would be saved by higher home sales are 
pretty disappointed right now," said John Karevoll, a Dataquick analyst and 
publisher of a monthly newsletter that tracks Southern California real estate 
and lending trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, General Motors Acceptance Corp. said it would lay off about 500 of 
the 3,300 workers in its mortgage division. A spokesman at GMAC's Philadelphia 
headquarters said the cuts would be spread among its 122 offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena-based lending giant Countrywide Funding has quietly laid off about 
500 people over the last 30 days, raising the number of furloughed workers to 
about 1,100 since its mortgage business peaked in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential Home Mortgage Co. laid off more than 50 people at its Costa Mesa 
processing center last month as part of a 12% reduction nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 If sales don't pick up soon, even deeper job cutbacks may be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're meeting on almost a weekly basis, seeing if our loan volume justifies 
our staffing levels," said Bob Garman, senior vice president of Directors 
Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The mortgage banking giant has already laid off about 250 of the 1,100 workers 
at its Riverside headquarters, and Garman fears more cutbacks will be needed if 
rates go up again or sales continue to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep new business coming in, many Southern California lenders have been 
aggressively marketing adjustable-rate mortgages. Introductory rates on ARMs 
are generally three percentage points lower than rates on fixed loans, which 
makes them particularly attractive to first-time buyers, who are most 
vulnerable to rising rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lenders are using more offbeat marketing gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under one plan offered by Irvine-based American Savings Bank, borrowers can 
get a no-points, no-fee loan and a $300 cash rebate when the paperwork is 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under another program, American promises to make up to a full year's worth of 
mortgage payments if a borrower unexpectedly gets thrown out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Barnum, American's president and chief operating officer, concedes that 
such giveaways cut into the bank's bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'd rather make a loan with a low profit margin than not make any loan at 
all," he said. Slumping Home Loans 
</P>
<P>
 Most lenders in the six-county Southland area* have seen their total loan 
volume fall recently, as rising demand for mortgages to purchase new houses has 
been more than offset by a sharp drop in refinancings. 
</P>
<P>

UAL PROPOSES NEW SERVICE ON SOUTHWEST'S TURF; AIRLINES: IF SHAREHOLDERS OK 
UNITED'S EMPLOYEE TAKEOVER, THE U-2 CARRIER WILL BEGIN OFFERING LOW-FARE, 
SHORT-HAUL FLIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 United Airlines has chosen the West Coast for the Oct. 1 debut of its new 
low-fare, short-haul airline in a move that will put it in head-to-head 
competition with Southwest Airlines, the region's reigning discount carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The new airline, dubbed U-2, will initially serve 14 cities with 82 flights 
daily, UAL said Thursday. UAL is the Elk Grove, Ill.-based parent company of 
United. Plans call for increasing the operation to 143 flights a day by 
December, which would raise pressure on major carriers such as American, Delta 
and Continental to also lower prices on competitive routes. 
</P>
<P>
 United is expected to eventually take U-2 nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is contingent on shareholder approval in July of a proposal to 
transfer ownership of United to its employees. In New York Stock Exchange 
trading Thursday, UAL stock rose $3.625 to close at $125.125 after the Wall 
Street Journal's "Heard on the Street" column reported that savvy investors are 
betting the proposal will be approved, allowing U-2 to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of large cities on the West Coast that are relatively close 
together with the population to support a high-frequency service," United 
spokesman Joe Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carrier would not name the 14 West Coast cities, but officials said seven 
of them are already served by United. Analysts said U-2 will probably operate 
from smaller regional airports such as Burbank, Ontario and Oakland, where 
short-haul fliers such as Southwest have made their mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have plenty of counter space and would seem to match what they are looking 
for," said Lonnie Mitchell of Long Beach Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Launching U-2 in the West is a logical move for United, analysts said, because 
the airline has a substantial infrastructure in the region, including travel 
agents who can connect travelers on United's transpacific flights with the 
short-haul affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's United with good facilities on the West Coast, lots of gates and a 
strong market presence," said David Banmiller, president of Banmiller & 
Associates, an aviation consulting firm. "It's a strong area of their system, 
and they decided they should go to their strengths." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins said approval of the employee buyout is key to the operation's 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concessions in the form of wage and benefits reductions will 
substantially lower our costs and allow us to compete effectively," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will take more than employee concessions to reduce operating costs 
enough to make the venture profitable, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This goes beyond salaries and gets into productivity," Banmiller said. 
"United's success will depend on how quickly they can turn their airplanes 
around and keep them up in the air, and how effectively they can manage the 
employee population to be highly productive to make it work."  
</P>
<P>
 U-2's Boeing 737 fleet will be in the air 11 hours a day -- 1 1/2 hours longer 
than United planes currently fly, the airline said -- and planes will be on the 
ground only 20 minutes between flights. To save time and money, seat 
assignments will be made at airport gates, and no meals will be served on 
flights, spokesman John Kiker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Southwest, which pioneered the low-fare, short-haul concept and 
now controls 51% of the intra-California market, serves no meals and does not 
make seat assignments. A spokeswoman for Southwest said it takes more than 
no-frills changes to run a successful airline. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain mechanics other airlines can try to copy, but the bottom 
line is we think our costs are very difficult to match on a long-term basis," 
said Linda Burke Rutherford of Southwest.

PASADENA'S CUP RUNNETH OVER; SOCCER FANS ARE FLOCKING TO THE CITY'S STORES AND 
RESTAURANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The World Cup final is weeks away, but Pasadena retailers and restaurateurs 
have already won by scoring big with soccer fans seeking fun, food -- and 
merchandise -- in the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Southern California is expected to benefit from the games, which began 
locally with a June 18 contest at the Rose Bowl and culminate with a July 17 
championship game there. It's estimated that the eight games at Pasadena's 
historic stadium will generate $600 million in Southland retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Various communities are angling for World Cup business, with merchants 
sponsoring World Cup-themed events to promote their restaurants, hotels and 
retail establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Pasadena appears to be getting the biggest boost, with visiting soccer 
fans already kicking up sales there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're projecting a 5% to 10% increase in sales because of the games," said 
Arnold Bellow, chief executive of the Pasadena Chamber of Commerce. "But that's 
a conservative estimate that may be exceeded." 
</P>
<P>
 The expectations of Pasadena merchants rose after the U.S. team shocked the 
world this week by beating Colombia at the Rose Bowl. By winning, the Americans 
stimulated local interest in the games and raised their chances of qualifying 
for the second round of play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 90,000 revelers in Pasadena after the Wednesday game -- and they were 
all paying customers," Bellow said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many visitors have already become familiar with merchants in the thriving 
business districts of Old Pasadena and South Lake Avenue. Some businesses in 
other parts of the city are offering discounts and soccer-related programs to 
lure World Cup fans as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Plaza Pasadena -- the mall that is home to 120 businesses, 
including Broadway and J.C. Penney stores -- is offering free disposable 
cameras to customers who make purchases of $100 or more at its stores.  
</P>
<P>
 The mall is also sponsoring contests that reward winners with free World Cup 
tickets and soccer souvenirs such as World Cup T-shirts, pins and coffee mugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traffic has been fabulous since the games started," said Wendy Albert, 
marketing director at Plaza Pasadena. "We anticipate even more sales increases 
as we get closer to the final game." 
</P>
<P>
 Albert said the mall has tried to accommodate foreign shoppers who speak no 
English. The shopping center's managers collected the names of bilingual 
employees and circulated a list containing their language proficiencies to mall 
tenants. A merchant facing a communications barrier can use the list to find an 
interpreter in any of nine languages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sales are up 5% to 10% the past two weeks compared to the previous two-week 
period," said Lloyd Cleland, manager of the Broadway. "I can't even identify 
some of the languages I'm hearing in the store." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although they speak little English, language has been no barrier for Arnoldo 
Harmento and Diana Chavez, two World Cup enthusiasts from Mexico visiting the 
Southland for the first time. The couple have encountered plenty of 
Spanish-speaking clerks at stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area is beautiful, and people in Southern California are very friendly," 
Harmento said as he searched for World Cup items at a Pasadena souvenir shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Banners welcoming visitors decorate the South Lake Avenue and Old Pasadena 
business districts. Individual businesses are also hanging welcome signs on 
their doors and windows. 
</P>
<P>
 C.T.'s, a sports bar on Colorado Boulevard, the main drag in Old Pasadena, 
attracts many World Cup ticket-holders for lunch. When those customers head for 
the game, their seats are taken by large numbers of fans who come in to watch 
the afternoon's action on the restaurant's television sets. Sales have risen 
80% on game days and 20% on non-game days since the tournament started, said 
Mike Fata, the restaurant's owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kid some of the customers by telling them we'll give them a red card if 
they don't behave," said Fata, referring to a player ejection in soccer. 
"Everyone has been great and the drinking is controlled." 
</P>
<P>
 The evening crowd in Pasadena has also swelled as soccer fans and the curious 
walk the streets and gather at restaurants, clubs and stores. Postgame 
customers are driving up sales at Old Pasadena's Penny Lane records as foreign 
visitors shop for compact discs, which are generally cheaper in this country, 
store manager Craig Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 And sensing a happening, more Southland residents from other communities are 
spending their time and money in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people living in Los Angeles who have never been to Pasadena, but 
they're coming here now," Pico Rivera resident Victor Obezo said, pausing 
outside a Pasadena store.

KODAK TO SELL DRUG UNIT FOR $1.68 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eastman Kodak Co. said Thursday that France's Sanofi has agreed to pay more 
than $1.68 billion to acquire the prescription pharmaceutical business of 
Kodak's Sterling Winthrop subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanofi, Kodak's partner in the unit, was named as a potential buyer when the 
photographic giant said in May that it planned to sell the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit includes Sterling Winthrop's stake in the Sanofi Winthrop global 
pharmaceutical alliance. Sanofi is the drug, cosmetic and perfume subsidiary of 
French oil group Elf Aquitaine. 
</P>
<P>
 It will boost Sanofi's size and presence in the United States and its ability 
to invest in research. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really establishes Sanofi as a worldwide force," particularly in research, 
said Samuel Isaly, a partner in Mehta & Isaly, a New York research and 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given any luck in research, they will emerge into something powerful," he 
said. "The transaction is fully aimed at what is happening 10 years from now." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Sterling Winthrop prescription business, Sanofi will become the 
20th-largest drug company in the world, with sales of more than $3.2 billion 
and a research budget of about $500 million. Its U.S. sales should rise from 
$500 million to $900 million. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, Sanofi will give Kodak back the minority stake the French 
firm holds in Sterling Health Europe.

 Durable Goods Orders Leap: Orders to U.S. factories rose a surprisingly robust 
0.9% in May, the ninth increase in the past 10 months, the Commerce Department 
said. After inching up a mere 0.1% in April, orders for long-lasting products 
soared, with aircraft and parts leading the way, the department said. In 
another report, the Labor Department said first-time claims for state 
unemployment benefits increased by 3,000 last week, from 349,000 to 352,000, 
the biggest increase in six weeks.

FORECAST FOR ORANGE COUNTY BRIGHT, REPORT SAYS; ECONOMY: IN SHARP CONTRAST TO 
L.A. COUNTY, STUDY SEES RAPID GROWTH IN JOBS, RETAIL AND HOME SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Bolstered by a strong export market for its high-technology and medical 
products, Orange County's economy is growing far more rapidly this year than 
expected, according to a report released Thursday by Chapman University in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, university economists said, they expect the county to end 1994 well 
into a recovery from the lingering recession that began in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by revised employment data and higher-than-expected levels of 
consumer and business spending, Orange County employers will add 10,000 jobs to 
their payrolls this year, predicted James Doti, the university's president and 
chief economic forecaster. He also said taxable retail sales and housing sales 
-- both strong indicators of consumer confidence -- will show appreciable 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Los Angeles County employers are expected to slash almost 30,000 
jobs from their payrolls this year, Chapman economist Esmael Adibi said. A key 
difference between the two regional economies is that Los Angeles County is far 
more dependent on aerospace and defense employment, which has plunged in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction industry in Los Angeles County is not likely to enjoy a "mini 
boom" like the one that seems to be starting in Orange County, according to 
Adibi. Average home prices in Los Angeles County should decline 3.3%, for the 
fourth annual decrease in a row.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the report also notes that personal income in Los Angeles County is 
expected to grow by 3% in 1994, while retail sales should also grow slightly, 
with new-car sales leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chapman Center for Economic Research is predicting a 17.8% increase for 
Orange County in building permit values this year, to $1.9 billion from $1.6 
billion. The entire increase, Doti said, will come from increased home 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pent-up demand for housing after the minimal construction activity of the 
recession, he predicted, will nearly double housing production to about 13,000 
units a year through the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Adibi said he expects about 9,800 jobs to be added this year in the Inland 
Empire, where locally based employment remained constant during the recession. 
But construction in Riverside and San Bernardino counties will remain weak 
throughout 1994, he predicted, and home prices are likely to drop 2.5% 
following a 4.6% average decline last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for its emphasis on improvement in the Orange County economy, the 
Chapman midyear report is quite similar to a statewide study issued earlier 
this week by the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 In both reports, economists said California's economic recovery is under way 
but being held back by interest rate increases and continuing layoffs in 
aerospace.  
</P>
<P>
 Chapman's Doti, however, disagrees with UCLA forecasters, who maintain that 
income losses caused by January's Northridge earthquake are holding back 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been income losses, Doti said, "but the spending that will result 
from the rebuilding effort will make up for them.

 Carl's Jr. Tests Green Burrito Food: Less than a year after a brutal boardroom 
fight over a dual-menu concept, the fast-food chain has agreed to test Green 
Burrito products at six locations and is negotiating to add Long John Silver's 
fish meals to eight other outlets.The dual-menu strategy is an effort to carve 
new ground in the industry by giving families a wider choice. The strategy is 
essentially a smaller version of food courts that have been set up in shopping 
malls. Carl's Jr. will add the test to its ongoing value menu concept, which 
promotes good food at lower prices but has not spurred sales as much as parent 
company CKE Restaurants Inc. had hoped.

HONG KONG FIRM ACCUSED OF COMMODITIES FRAUD IN U.S.; INVESTMENTS: TRADING 
AUTHORITIES CALL IT THE LARGEST OPERATION OF ITS TYPE YET UNCOVERED.

<P>
 Police and U.S. marshals have raided an unregistered Hong Kong-based 
commodities trader in what federal officials Thursday called the largest 
operation of its kind yet uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The offices of Frankwell Bullion Ltd. subsidiaries were seized and shut down 
Wednesday in California, Texas and New York, said Robert Butchko of the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect it to involve the largest number of customers, and we hope to 
freeze the largest amount of money for the benefit of the customers," Butchko 
said at Frankwell offices in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The seizure is the fifth since December, 1992, to involve a Hong Kong company 
accused of illegal commodity trading, commission documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators are still examining books and bank records, said Mark Breckler of 
the California Department of Corporations, but it appears that Frankwell's 
operations involved at least 1,000 investors and $1 million a month nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Frankwell purportedly specialized in the sale of gold, silver 
and foreign currency futures contracts and that customers had been called cold 
or responded to ads in local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors were often falsely told they could get returns of 15% to 20% and 
that their investments were guaranteed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankwell may never have invested customers' money, they said. "We have seen 
no evidence that any trades were executed on any market," Butchko said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the eight complainants listed in a federal court filing that led to the 
seizure reported losing $70,000, he said. Others reportedly lost all or part of 
their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators have frozen all Frankwell bank and trading accounts to determine 
what assets the company has, but Breckler said he is not optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their losses will no doubt be great," he said. "We are not hopeful about our 
chances to find monies that have already been shipped overseas." 
</P>
<P>
 Papers are being served on Frankwell's Hong Kong headquarters, Butchko said. 
Regulators refused to comment on the company's operations in other nations. 
Butchko said Frankwell had apparently once been listed on the Hong Kong 
commodity exchange but that it had been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminal prosecutions are possible, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Frankwell did business as Frankwell Investment Services 
Inc. in San Francisco and Foster City, Calif.; Maywell Investment Services Inc. 
in San Diego; Frankwell Investment Services Inc. in Houston, and Frankwell 
Management Services Inc. in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 As did the other four Hong Kong companies seized, Frankwell started out in San 
Francisco selling in Asian immigrant communities, Breckler said. The company 
eventually branched out to sell to other investors around the United States, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By federal law, contracts for the purchase or sale of a commodity for future 
delivery can only be offered and executed through a board of trade designated 
by the CFTC and by regulated brokers. None of the Frankwell companies were 
registered, Breckler said.

FOR GTE, LAST JAN. 17 BROUGHT A KING-SIZE PUBLIC RELATIONS PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K.H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you forgot, amid all the shaking of the area's strongest earthquake in 
three decades, that this past Jan. 17 was a holiday -- Martin Luther King Day, 
to be exact -- don't fret. GTE forgot that it wasn't.  
</P>
<P>
 In what has turned out to be a public relations embarrassment -- and a billing 
headache of migraine proportions -- the telephone company has twice backtracked 
on how it has charged customers for calls made the day of the 6.8-magnitude 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot is that GTE's million or so California customers will only have to 
pay holiday rates -- 60% of normal -- for calls made on that date, even though 
the phone company's tariff agreements do not recognize King Day as a holiday 
for purposes of rate discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE discovered its error, it said, when a customer -- of uncommon integrity, 
it seems -- reported having been undercharged. Because of the extraordinarily 
high number of calls after the quake, the error cost GTE $1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company made a "business decision" to correct the mistake, a company 
spokesman said -- but not until four months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Then many more customers called to question the mystifying adjustments that 
began showing up on GTE bills May 16.  
</P>
<P>
 At that point, the state Public Utilities Commission chastised GTE for 
violating a rule that prohibits back-billing beyond a 90-day period. So did 
state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), many of whose constituents are GTE 
customers. GTE subsequently decided to grant the holiday discounts after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers who paid the adjusted charges will be credited with refunds, the 
company said.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: YOUR MONEY; ANOTHER 'DEAL OF THE CENTURY' ON 
CABLE 
</P>

 "We have great news!" says the letter Century Cable sent to Los Angeles 
customers earlier this month. Charges for basic and full cable service are 
dropping $2.18 a month, the letter says. What's more, it notes, customers will 
get more channels, including Comedy Central and the Learning Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more to it, of course. People who order premium service (HBO, 
Showtime, the Movie Channel, Cinemax or the Disney Channel) now need a special 
converter to receive those channels. Monthly fees for the converter, which sits 
atop the TV set, are $3.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Century Cable General Manager Manuel Martinez said the converter is needed 
because the company is changing the way it transmits cable signals. Before the 
rate changes, which go into effect July 15, people ordering premium service 
paid a onetime $6.85 fee to have a special transmission device installed 
outside their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The converter charges mean people with premium service will end up paying at 
least $47.88 more for the service each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the reductions, all cable customers are paying more than they did a 
year ago. (Century Cable raised its rates last September.) 
</P>
<P>
 With the changes in monthly fees, basic cable customers will pay $21.07, 38% 
more than a year ago, and full-service customers will pay $27.37, 15.6% more 
than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 That's bad news.

 Playing it safe: Parents who use a MasterCard to pay pediatric bills through 
Aug. 31 can send away for a free cassette and book on child safety from the 
credit card company. The video, "Making Your Home Safer for Children," and 
book, "Child Proof Your Home," offer tips on accident prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "MasterCard wants you to play it safe," the offer reads. Seems to us the 
credit card company is doing just that itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying the offer is what appears to be a lawsuit-prevention tip: 
"MasterCard International is not responsible for any accidents or injury 
resulting from use of the information presented in the videotape, book or 
booklet."

 Phone fee: Marriott is the latest hotel chain to remove the long-distance 
access fee for guests who use calling cards. 
</P>
<P>
 As of July 1, it will eliminate the 75-cent fee at 140 of 200 Marriott Hotels, 
Resorts and Suites nationwide. A spokesman said it is expected that about 60 
franchise hotels will drop the fee at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotels instituted the fees over the last five years to raise revenue 
during a slump in hotel occupancy. The fees annoy business travelers, and 
hotels have been dropping them to attract customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton, Hyatt and ITT Sheraton have eliminated the fees for at least some of 
their customers. Here's a rundown of their policies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hilton has dropped the charge, which ranged from 75 cents to $1, at 150 of 
its 220 hotels. A spokeswoman said some franchise hotels still charge them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hyatt recently ended the 75-cent fee for its "business plan" rooms, about 5% 
of its 54,000 rooms in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. Those 
customers pay a $15 surcharge for their rooms but receive extra services, 
including a free breakfast and a fax machine in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sheraton in April removed the fee, which was 75 cents to $1, for guests on 
the "club floors" of 45 hotels. The company has more than 200 hotels 
nationwide. People staying in those rooms pay a $15 surcharge and get added 
services similar to those offered at Hyatt.

 Looking for the real Mr. Mom: "Hey, Mom, we'd like to hear from you," says a 
survey form McDonald's is attaching to Happy Meals, its meal for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey asks mothers to rate the Happy Meal food and toy prize and to state 
how often they take the children to McDonald's. At the end of the survey, 
McDonald's asks Mom for her name and address.  
</P>
<P>
 The survey says the information is needed because "from time to time, 
McDonald's may have special information or offers just for moms." Before she 
fills in her name, Mom is asked to check one of four boxes: Ms., Mrs., Miss, 
Mr.

 Charges settled: Sears, Roebuck & Co., Montgomery Ward & Co. and four R.H. 
Macy subsidiaries -- including Bullock's -- on Thursday settled federal charges 
that they failed to make warranty agreements available to customers before 
certain items were purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission alleged that the retailers violated a 1976 rule 
requiring them to make the warranties available on items over $15 by either 
displaying the information near the product or informing customers, through 
signs in various locations throughout the store, that warranties are available 
on request. 
</P>
<P>
 In the settlement, none of the retailers admitted any guilt. They agreed to 
instruct their staffs to follow the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Sears and Macy said the FTC had uncovered isolated 
instances of warranties not being available. 
</P>
<P>
 "Warranties are a big selling point at Sears," spokesman Bob McHenry said. 
"Typically, the salesperson explains the warranty to customers." 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of Montgomery Ward could not be reached for comment.

 Music industry insiders have already moved on from their gleeful reaction to 
Sony's victory in the landmark George Michael lawsuit that sought to release 
the singer from his recording contract in Britain. The latest chatter centers 
around whether Michael, who has publicly stated he will never record for Sony 
again, will negotiate and come to terms with the company before he files a 
legal appeal on the decision.With Michael's inner circle unable to mediate, 
speculation centers around the recruitment of an industry heavyweight. Among 
the names circulating are CAA's Michael Ovitz and attorneys John Branca and 
Allen Grubman.

COMPANY TOWN; NINTENDO SAYS IT'S BACK ON PATH TO THE TOP WITH NEW 'DONKEY'; 
SOFTWARE: CHAIRMAN TELLS CONVENTIONEERS THAT THE COMPANY, 'A LITTLE BIT 
HUMBLED,' WILL BE NO. 1 AGAIN BY YEAR'S END.

 Armed with new technology and a new version of its early-1980s hit game 
"Donkey Kong," Nintendo of America predicted Thursday that it will regain the 
market share dominance -- which it recently lost for the first time to Sega of 
America -- by the end of this Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 In a keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show, Nintendo Chairman 
Howard Lincoln said the company was "a little bit humbled." Lincoln also toned 
down the competitive rhetoric that has included public insults and nursery 
rhyme taunts. He praised Sega for having "great games and excellent marketing," 
reserving his more pointed remarks for the faltering start-up that got all the 
limelight at last year's convention: 3DO Co. 
</P>
<P>
 3DO Chairman "Trip Hawkins has made a career out of bad-mouthing Nintendo and 
Sega and everybody else in the video game business for a number of years, and 
now the marketplace has given him his comeuppance," Lincoln said later in an 
interview. "Quite frankly, I think a lot of people in our industry are having a 
big chuckle -- including me." 
</P>
<P>
 Answered Hawkins: "3DO has obviously touched a nerve; maybe that's why 
Howard's on the defensive." Hawkins noted that sales of the 3DO game machine 
have accelerated in the last three months as more software becomes available. 
"I think deep down inside Nintendo is scared to death." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Sega declined to set up a booth on the convention floor this year, but the 
company did throw a party Wednesday night, where Chief Executive Tom Kalinske 
announced that his firm -- whose philosophy has always been to use game 
software to drive sales of its proprietary game consoles -- will start 
distributing games for personal computer CD-ROM drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Palo Alto's Rocket Science Games, whose first titles are due out this fall, 
will be the first company distributed by Sega. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular belief and Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner's 
own technophobic pronouncements, it turns out that Disney is, in fact, a 
technology company. The convention hall is crawling with Disney executives, who 
made two technology-related announcements Thursday and plan another this 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg showed off "Mickey Mania: The 
Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse" a CD-ROM game that Disney Software 
co-developed with Sony's Imagesoft division. While the company's closely 
guarded flag bearer has been in video games before, this is the first time old 
animated footage from shorts such as "Steamboat Willie" and "The Prince and the 
Pauper" have been translated to the interactive realm. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Eisner announced a new exhibition at the company's Florida Epcot Center 
that will showcase new technology.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our audience is not going to be traveling in space, at least for the 
next 20 years, so we thought it was time to focus on the nearer term," Eisner 
said. "We are very technologically driven, but only as it enhances the value of 
entertainment. Besides, whatever I say last week I disavow anyway."

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; DISNEY ROLLS OUT CARPET FOR HUGHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney Studios, which had rolled up the welcome mat when it came to major 
filmmakers, is edging back into the big leagues. After recently working with 
Tim Burton and Robert Redford, the studio on Thursday announced a deal with 
John Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes will write, direct and produce a comedy called "The Bee" for the 
studio's Walt Disney Pictures division. But here's the real buzz. The 
man-versus-insect tale, which is expected to cost about $25 million to produce, 
has only 10 pages of dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The premise is how can an insect prevent a human being from doing something?" 
Hughes said of the movie, which is set for release next summer. "He's not a 
superpower bee, but he can definitely think. Bees also have a way of pestering 
people more than other insects." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bee" came to Disney after others passed on the project, which Hughes 
admits is tough to get a handle on at first. It takes place over an eight-hour 
period and will combine special effects with real bee footage. Hughes said one 
of the main challenges is figuring out the mechanics of the movie -- such as 
how a bee can succeed in locking someone out of a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to that, he said, making the deal with Disney was easy. "It's a 
really good fit there," Hughes said. "Walt would probably like this one." 
</P>
<P>
 David Vogel, production president at Walt Disney Pictures, said the 
partnership was overdue. "Everybody always admired his stuff," Vogel said. "A 
great deal of his work is quintessentially Disney-like." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes and Disney still seem like strange bedfellows at first glance. The 
director-producer gained a reputation of being tough to work with after 1980s 
hits such as "The Breakfast Club" and "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," but he came 
back strong in 1990 with "Home Alone." His latest movie, "Baby's Day Out," is 
being released by Fox on July 1. Hughes is currently wrapping production for 
Fox on a remake of "Miracle on 34th Street," which will be out this Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has spent the last few years distancing itself from big-name talent for 
the most part, to concentrate on low-budget movies. That strategy hasn't paid 
off as well as the studio hoped, which has led Disney to again loosen its purse 
strings. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one looks for Disney to make "Terminator 3," recognizable names are 
resurfacing in its credits. Burton made "The Nightmare Before Christmas" last 
year, and Redford directed "Quiz Show" for release later this year. More 
big-name deals are expected to follow.

 From the lowest reaches of the glamour chain, Hollywood tax lawyers are 
finally getting their day in the sun thanks to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 An IRS task force impaneled last year has already sent hundreds of audit 
notices to companies and individuals in Hollywood. Now it's feared that the 
agency will move ahead with new employment guidelines that will add millions of 
dollars to the cost of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax lawyers such as Mitchell R. Miller and Alan Kirios have emerged as buffers 
between the government and an industry rattled by concerns about Draconian tax 
measures. While no official moves are expected before next year, Miller says 
the task force's intent is serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen the IRS take up an issue with this much dedication," he said. 
"I can imagine how people felt seeing the hordes of Mohammed storm out of the 
desert." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force is exploring everything from plastic surgery write-offs to 
offshore tax havens. But much of the industry is fearful of how it will revise 
employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Government tax collectors are expected to make the case that people working as 
"independent contractors" are actually employees of each company they are in 
business with. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers oppose the classification because it cuts the number of deductions 
they can claim. Employers don't have use for it either, because it forces them 
to make payments into Social Security and other government programs. Any change 
would also complicate life for the talent guilds and loan-out service 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirios, a tax lawyer with Weissmann, Wolff, Bergman, Coleman & Silverman in 
Beverly Hills, said independent producers would be especially hard hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have taken the position that if a producer makes a guild contribution on 
behalf of any person, that person is conclusively presumed to be the employee 
of the producer," Kirios explained. "If you're talking about a commercial with 
a crowd scene in which you're paying 300 people something like $50 each, the 
burden on the producer would be quite substantial." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kirios assumes Hollywood's fears will be realized, because the IRS has already 
established such guidelines for the commercial and video industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica's Galanty & Co., which produces workout videos for Jane Fonda and 
political ads, saw its labor costs rise 20% when it followed the IRS 
suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We began to pay everyone through payroll rather than as independent 
contractors," Mark Galanty said. "It became more difficult to get some people 
to work. One problem is their paycheck comes three to four weeks later. As 
independents, they're paid on the spot."

 Exhibition: Time Warner Inc. and Paramount Communications Inc. are willing to 
sell their jointly owned Cineamerica theaters -- but at a big price. With 
operating cash flow of nearly $30 million, they want more than $250 million for 
the 350-screen circuit, sources said.By asking for nine or 10 times its cash 
flow, Cineamerica is demanding a higher multiple than the price paid for the 
giant United Artists circuit two years ago. Warner has been willing to sell for 
some time, but Paramount agreed only after control of the company passed to 
Viacom Inc. Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone already controls the closely held 
National Amusements movie theater circuit in the Northeast, but he is either 
unwilling to pay Warner's price or reluctant to risk the appearance of a 
conflict of interest. According to industry sources, the possible bidders 
include the Norman Lear-controlled Act III theaters; Cineplex Odeon, and an 
investment group led by the former owners of Cinema World, a Pittsburgh-based 
chain sold to Carmike Cinemas. KATHRYN HARRIS

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: J.M. PETERS REPORTS $3.9-MILLION PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 J.M. Peters Co., the regional home builder, on Thursday reported a profit of 
$3.9 million, or 26 cents a share, for its latest fiscal quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Those earnings contrasted with a loss of $1.9 million, or 14 cents a share, 
for the same period last year, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach builder sold $100 million of junk bonds during the latest 
quarter, which increased liquidity and allowed it to retire high-interest debt. 
Some of its profit for the period came from the sale of 193 homes, an increase 
from the 17 homes sold in the same period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported revenue of $32.8 million for its first quarter, which 
ended May 31. That was an increase of nearly 14% from revenue of $28.8 million 
for the same period last year.

ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS; RENO AIR ACCUSED OF INFLATING VALUE OF ITS STOCK; 
FINANCE: STOCKHOLDER'S LAWSUIT ALLEGES DECEPTIVE PRACTICES. AIRLINE SAYS ACTION 
'HAS NO MERIT.' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A lawsuit has been filed in federal court against Reno Air Inc. and two of the 
company's former executives, charging that the value of the company stock was 
inflated through deceptive financial statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockholder Gerald Adelman filed the suit Tuesday in U.S. District Court on 
behalf of investors who bought the stock from March, 1993, to March, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air spokeswoman Sue Putnam said the company believes "the suit has no 
merit and we will fight it." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contends that the company misrepresented its financial condition and 
failed to list in company reports the depreciation of its aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air hopes to bring its low-fare service to John Wayne Airport next week. 
The carrier had planned to take over as many as six of American Airlines' 
flights between Orange County and San Jose as early as Thursday, but questions 
from the Federal Aviation Administration and competitor United Airlines delayed 
the launch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors approved Reno Air's plan in concept 
last week. At the request of the FAA, however, airport officials withdrew the 
final contract from the board's agenda this week and postponed discussion on it 
until next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that Reno Air reported a net loss of $1.7 million for 
1992, but was "forced to restate" losses at nearly $2.2 million after an 
investigation of accounting practices by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit contends that, in mid-1993, the company published in the Wall Street 
Journal a net loss of $1.2 million for the quarter, but the loss was later 
placed at $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air General Counsel Robert M. Rowen confirmed that earnings were revised 
following an accounting change in March. The change was made to alter the 
method of accounting on aircraft lease rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Emert, an attorney for the investors, said the shifting figures "had 
the effect of destroying the company's credibility in the investment 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit names as defendants former chief executive officer Jeffrey Erickson 
and former vice president Roderick Leith, both of whom left the company in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge must approve class-action status before investors other than Adelman 
can become part of the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air serves San Jose, Ontario, Burbank, Los Angeles and San Diego in 
California; Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona; Portland, Ore.; Seattle, Las Vegas 
and Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 The company operates a fleet of 17 140-seat McDonnell Douglas MD-80 jets.

ORANGE COUNTY BUSINESS; BIG CERAMIC TILE SHOW WILL OPEN TO PUBLIC SATURDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking for the latest Fred Flintstone tiles for the bathroom? Or a framed 
tile reproduction of Botticelli's "The Birth of Venus"? Or marble inlaid with 
semiprecious stones? 
</P>
<P>
 From marble mosaics to plain whites, the world's biggest ceramic tile and 
natural stone show will be open to the public for free Saturday at the 
International Tile and Stone Exposition. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12,000 people are expected to file through the Anaheim Convention Center 
from 11 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Saturday to view tile and stone exhibits displayed by 
about 700 companies from more than 40 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The show opened Wednesday but, through today, is limited to about 20,000 
manufacturers, decorators, architects and other tradespeople who come from more 
than 70 countries, said William Dugan, a spokesman for the exposition. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 U.S. manufacturers have tile and stone on display, but consumers 
here use little tile compared to those in European countries, said Jerry 
Fisher, publisher of Tile and Decorative Services magazine in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, the world's leader in ceramic tile production, uses 31 square feet of 
ceramic tile per capita a year, while the United States uses about four.

<P>
 Chapman General Hospital, a 104-bed facility in Orange, said it will undergo a 
$10-million expansion, to be completed in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26,000-square-foot expansion will not increase the number of hospital 
beds, though patient rooms will be moved onto a new second floor.The hospital 
plans to double its operating rooms from three to six and expand its intensive 
care ward from six beds to 12. Two new labor and delivery rooms are planned, 
and the second floor will house new patient rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion is intended to allow the hospital to provide more preventive 
medicine services and specialty surgeries, said Howard Levine, chief executive 
officer of the hospital. He said patients had been requesting those services. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet another community demand, the hospital recently opened a primary-care 
clinic staffed by Japanese-speaking doctors, nurses and technicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital said it will remain fully operational during the expansion.

 Cotkin & Collins: Partners in the firm's Orange County law office said 
Thursday that they will sever their ties to the Los Angeles-based law firm in 
mid-July, making official what had long been a separate practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The amicable split-up will create the Collins & Naeve law firm in Santa Ana 
with four partners, seven associate lawyers and a support staff of 12.It will 
continue to limit its practice to defense work in the health care, employment, 
insurance, business and professional liability fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles office, with eight partners and 10 associates, has not 
selected a new name yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip S. Gutierrez, a partner in the Santa Ana office, said the two offices 
had become separate practices with little reliance on each other and had gone 
increasingly in different directions. While the Santa Ana office specialized in 
corporate defense, he said, the Los Angeles lawyers have been representing 
corporate plaintiffs and state and local government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The split, which becomes effective July 15, will put James P. Collins Jr., 
William D. Naeve, David A. Winkle and Gutierrez in charge of the Santa Ana 
office.

 The Presley Cos.: The new-home builder sold $200 million of junk bonds 
Thursday priced to yield 12.5%, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bonds were sold mostly to pension and mutual funds through Presley Cos.' 
underwriter, Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette, a New York investment banking firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a very attractive yield, considering today's choppy market," 
said Amin Arjoman, a real estate analyst with Beverly Hills junk bond firm 
Dabney Resnick Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the offering are earmarked for retiring high-interest-rate debt 
as part of the company's capital restructuring plan. Presley of Newport Beach 
builds homes in several Western states, but most of its business is in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased to get it behind us," said David Siegel, Presley's chief 
financial officer. "Now, we can concentrate on what we do best -- home 
building."

CPC TO TAKE RESTRUCTURING CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CPC International Inc. said Thursday that it will take a pretax restructuring 
charge of $227 million in the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 CPC, engaged in the restructuring for several years, said the charge amounts 
to 92 cents per share after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman and Chief Executive C.R. Shoemate said, "The charge . . . recognizes 
the cost of additional restructuring activities around the world, which are 
being compressed into the next 18 to 24 months. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 That allows the company to "anticipate now the competitive needs of the ever 
more unified markets of the late 1990s," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 9% of the work force will be let go under the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 CPC, a worldwide maker and marketer of such products as Hellmann's mayonnaise 
and Skippy peanut butter, said it has expensed the related costs on an ongoing 
basis, over the years, without taking restructuring charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The company sells its products in 55 countries.

INSIGHT FROM MAVEN OF THE MIND; STAGE: THE MENTALIST, WHO WILL PERFORM IN SANTA 
ANA, SAYS HE GETS HINTS FROM BODY LANGUAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's the last thing a reporter expects the man who bills himself as a mind 
reader to do during an interview? 
</P>
<P>
 Demystify his act. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's precisely what Max Maven did recently while sipping coffee at 
Hamburger Hamlet and looking almost like any regular Joe: A widow's peak, 
braided ponytail, goatee and two hoop earrings dangling from one ear don't 
necessarily spell eccentric in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you put any faith in IQ tests, I'm brighter than most people, fair 
enough," said Maven, who opens his one-man mind-reading act at the Way Off 
Broadway Playhouse in Santa Ana tonight. "I would hope that I have a certain 
theatrical flair that makes me interesting. OK, fine. But as far as having some 
sort of psychic power or sixth sense? I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
 A practicing mentalist for 25 years, Maven performs live and on television, 
here and overseas, often in Japan (he speaks Japanese) and Europe (where he 
uses interpreters). 
</P>
<P>
 He recently starred in a 12-part series for British TV, "Something Strange," 
in which, blindfolded, he selected a designated balloon from among several 
hovering above his TV studio audience and performed other mysterious acts. "Max 
Maven: Thinking in Person," his Santa Ana show, ran for two months in 1988 at 
the Beverly Hills Playhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The essence of what he does, he explained while chatting amiably at the 
restaurant near his home, involves nonverbal communication or body language. 
</P>
<P>
 During one performance, he said he told a stunned L.A. Reader newspaper 
reporter in his audience that the journalist, who wrote up the account, had 
within the past three years visited a remote village in Fiji, how long the 
vacation lasted, and what the reporter did there -- with perfect accuracy. And 
without the reporter having uttered a word. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get some information from the timing of someone's speech, how quickly or 
slowly they respond to the specific things I'm saying at a given moment," Maven 
said. Other insights come from "watching their pupils or watching the behavior 
of their lips perhaps. In some cases, I might be talking to someone else about 
what that person's thinking, but watching the other person react to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Maven uses the analogy of musical ability to further explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-nine percent of the population has some sort of musical ability, they 
can carry a tune, they can remember a melody, and maybe 1% are tone deaf," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now imagine there are two people and one has a grade-A musical ability and 
one has a grade-B ability. Let's say the person with the grade-A ability does 
nothing with it, but the person with the grade-B ability learns how to read 
music, to play instruments, to develop their vocal ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a period of time, we sit the two people down and say, 'OK, show me your 
musical talent.' Which one of them is going to come across as being the better 
musician? The one who worked at it, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, when I'm asked, 'Do you have this special talent?' or whatever, well I 
think there's a latent ability of this sort in everyone. Maybe there's the 1% 
who is the equivalent of tone deaf, but we all communicate nonverbally all the 
time. It's just that I've been exercising this stuff for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Maven won't give it all away. He won't reveal exactly how or why he 
chose Fiji, for instance, from a lip curl or the way the reporter's pupils 
dilated. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor would he fully explain the demonstration he executed for this reporter, 
which, he said, showed his ability to influence as well as to read people's 
thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 After putting a rubber band around my wrist, he asked me to draw any 
geometrical shape on a piece of paper. I drew a triangle. When I removed the 
rubber band and placed it on the table, it formed a perfect triangle. 
</P>
<P>
 All he would say is that "somehow, through some nonverbal means I was able to 
influence you into drawing that shape as opposed to any other shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, why explain so much of what he does? 
</P>
<P>
 Because, said Maven, "I think what's left over is so mystifying. . . . I feel 
no need to make exorbitant claims, to tell you I'm in communication with 
entities from outer space or from 1,000 years in the past who are channeling 
through me, because I feel what I do is inherently fascinating." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An erstwhile radio deejay, singer and actor, Maven, who won't give his age, 
became fascinated with the paranormal at age 7 through playing the old maid 
card game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're picking cards from the person on one side of you," he said, "and the 
person on the other side is picking from you. What you're hoping is that if you 
have the old maid card, you get to unload it, whereas if you don't have it, 
you're hoping you don't pluck it out of the hand of the person next to you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I found that if the person next to me had the old maid card, I didn't 
usually take it, and if I got the old maid card, I would sort of wish the 
person would take it from me. They didn't always take it, but it happened 
enough times that I thought, 'Wait a minute, there's something going on here -- 
this is better than luck.' I was becoming aware on a gut level that people were 
giving me information or receiving information from me" in a nonverbal way. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, he's made plenty of mistakes, misreading someone's mind, 
for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing in my main repertory that hasn't gone wrong," he said with a 
chuckle, "not a single thing. What do you do? You pick yourself up, you dust 
yourself off, and that's it. But I like that aspect, I like the risk, it gives 
an edge to the performance, and it makes it genuinely exciting for me because I 
don't know if everything is going to go right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I've been doing this for a long time, I'm good at what I do. In any 
given show, it's rare that I get much wrong. I don't put a piece into my 
repertory unless my batting average is (extremely high). But none of it is 
guaranteed. The minute I say, 'How about the person over here, choose this, 
think of that, come on stage,' the minute that happens, all the bets are off."

JAZZ NOTES: THE KEYS TO LIFTING AN EMBARGO; PIANIST GONZALO RUBALCABA'S MOVE TO 
THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC HAS OPENED DOORS TO THE U.S., THANKS TO A RULING BY THE 
TREASURY DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thoughtful, soft-spoken and articulate, Cuban pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba smiles 
occasionally as he answers a reporter's questions in a Century City hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubalcaba has reason to smile. He's making his second appearance in the United 
States tonight, playing with his quartet at the Wadsworth Theater in Brentwood. 
And because of a new ruling by the U.S. government, these appearances are 
likely to become more frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this week, the Treasury Department ruled that because Rubalcaba has 
established legal residence in the Dominican Republic, he no longer falls under 
the U.S. trade embargo with Cuba. This ruling has the effect of offering 
Rubalcaba, who still retains his Cuban citizenship, an open door to perform in 
the United States whenever he likes. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has maintained an economic embargo with Cuba for 32 years, 
and has only rarely allowed visas for cultural exchanges. Rubalcaba's first 
performance in this country -- at New York's Lincoln Center in May, 1993 -- and 
his two appearances this year (he'll also play Saturday at the Aspen Jazz 
Festival) were examples of such visas. 
</P>
<P>
 The importance of the change in his status with the U.S. government isn't lost 
on Rubalcaba. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important for me to have the connection with the world of jazz, and 
with the musicians here in the States," he says. "I need to be able to connect 
with those musicians, learn from them, and to present myself here."  
</P>
<P>
 Not only will Rubalcaba be allowed to perform in the United States but under 
the ruling he can also be paid for his work. (The pianist donated his services 
for his New York debut, as well as for tonight's concert, which is a benefit 
for the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences Foundation, a program 
that is dedicated to returning music education to our nation's schools.) 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Krinsky, Rubalcaba's attorney, says the shift in his client's status 
was not the result of a major U.S. policy decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a Cuban national establishes residence in a third country, it's standard 
Treasury Department procedure to license and unblock," Krinsky said. After 
living in the Dominican Republic for more than a year, Rubalcaba was granted 
permanent legal residence there in March. The Treasury Department officially 
acknowledged that residence in its ruling this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, Rubalcaba says he didn't move to the Dominican Republic to gain 
easier access to the United States. "I made the first step toward a move there 
in 1989," he says. "I was actually thinking about moving to Europe, because I 
was playing there so much, but when I established friendships and professional 
relationships in the Dominican Republic, I moved there with my family. Now I 
see there is a close relation between the styles of life of that country and 
Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he's obviously pleased at his new status, and so is Krinsky. "The U.S. 
government could have continued to impose roadblocks if it had wanted to," 
Krinsky said. "I think it is significant that this further action by the 
Treasury Department" has been granted to a musician who "has not broken his 
ties with Cuba, who goes there, performs there, is welcomed there as a major 
cultural figure." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cuba is my home," says Rubalcaba, 31, without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the pianist does make it clear that he is first and foremost a 
musician. "I am an artist, linked to my traditions, my family, my country," he 
says with some vehemence. "I am not a person who works for the government of 
Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubalcaba will appear at Wadsworth with his Cuban quartet -- Reynaldo Melian 
(trumpet), Felipe Cabrera (bass) and Julio Barreto (drums) -- offering pieces 
from his four recordings, which were licensed to Blue Note by Somethin'Else 
Recordings of Japan. The pianist will also perform some duets with bassist 
Charlie Haden. 
</P>
<P>
 Haden first heard and played with Rubalcaba in Montreux, Switzerland, in the 
late 1980s and brought him to the attention of Blue Note president Bruce 
Lundvall, who arranged the pianist's deal with Somethin'Else. Because of the 
U.S. trade embargo, Rubalcaba could not record directly for Blue Note. (A 
review of Rubalcaba's newest recording, "Rhapsodia," appears below.) 
</P>
<P>
 If Rubalcaba is quiet in conversation, he is the opposite in performance, 
unleashing torrents of notes that wash over the pulsating rhythms -- from 
back-beats to surging Latin -- that underpin his music. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to describe his style, he says "it is everything from Afro-Cuban to all 
varieties of Latin to be-bop." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the piano gets Rubalcaba in touch with the deepest parts of himself, 
he says. "It is, to me, the most exquisite form of communication, that says we 
are alive. I can hear everything. What is far away, what is close, what is 
inside me, and what exists within the space that is occurring within the 
musical presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rhythm is a basic element of our existence. It's in everything that is 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * Gonzalo Rubalcaba appears tonight at 8 at the Wadsworth Theater, VA Grounds, 
Brentwood. All seats: $26. Tickets: (310) 825-2101.

TODAY'S TALK-RADIO TOPIC: THE FUTURE OF TALK RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earlier this month, talk-show veteran Larry King quit his syndicated radio 
show and was replaced by a newcomer to the talk-radio circuit -- comedian David 
Brenner. 
</P>
<P>
 Since assuming King's mantle, Brenner, whose show is broadcast from New York 
and heard in more than 100 markets across the country (but not Los Angeles), 
has not made any attempts to emulate King or to discuss weighty topics. Rather, 
Brenner has continued to do on radio what he has done best elsewhere: comedy.  
</P>
<P>
 To many in talk radio, the move represents a clear-cut example of the 
heightened emphasis being given to entertainment in their format, as opposed to 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's sad when you see a Larry King replaced by a David Brenner," said 
Michael Jackson, who has hosted an issues-oriented radio show at KABC-AM (790) 
for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see what kind of staying power (Brenner's show) will have," said Bruce 
Williams, who for 13 years has hosted a show on the NBC talk network. "Isn't 
that the test? Brenner's an unknown quantity. He's certainly a very funny 
comedian. I don't think he's exhibited as yet an interview capability or a 
radio capability, but then all of us were unknown quantities before we got into 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The tightrope walk between information and entertainment will be the subject 
of the opening session today at the annual convention of the National Assn. of 
Radio Talk Show Hosts, which runs through Sunday in Santa Monica.  
</P>
<P>
 And how to turn unknown quantities into successful talk-show hosts is another 
issue that the 400-member association will grapple with, said president-elect 
Gene Burns, who hosts a talk program in New York that is heard in 150 other 
cities, including San Diego and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While there is a place in talk radio for an entertaining style, according to 
KABC's Jackson, the key is to be informed about the issues and fair-minded in 
their presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you equate entertaining with telling jokes, I'm not that good at it, but 
if you equate it with hospitality and building a bridge with an audience, 
that's what I do," Jackson said. He said he operates on the BBC motto he 
learned as a young broadcaster more than 30 years ago: "To enlighten, inform 
and entertain." 
</P>
<P>
 KFI-AM (640) program director David Hall sees the entertainment portion of 
that formula as the key to success, and his station has risen dramatically in 
the ratings over the past few years following that credo. KFI's ascendancy has 
been fueled largely by the runaway success of syndicated host Rush Limbaugh -- 
who, first and foremost, considers himself an entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If talk radio is moving away from anything, it's public service," Hall said. 
"And it's definitely moving toward entertainment. I think in the old days, 
people used to do topics because they felt they had to be done. Now they do 
topics just because they're fun to do. But a show still needs to have as much 
information for it to really have some bite and some substance. It can't just 
be entertainment, but it can't be just information either." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the proper mix, one thing is certain: Talk-radio outlets are 
proliferating. Ten years ago, there were 150 talk stations throughout the 
country. Today there are 900, and it is the second highest ratings-getter of 
all radio formats (after country).  
</P>
<P>
 With the increased number of outlets, the competition has gotten stiffer. In 
many cities there are several talk stations, with a newer brand targeted 
specifically to younger listeners, as is the case locally with the new KMPC-AM 
(710). Most programmers believe that younger talk-radio listeners prefer an 
emphasis on entertainment over information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry King was tired and they replaced him with a pure entertainer in hopes 
of drawing younger people," said George Green, general manager of KABC and 
KMPC, which are co-owned by Capital Cities Communications. "As talk radio has 
become a very hot medium, you start looking at the word entertainment as being 
more important than it was before. Entertainment doesn't necessarily mean a 
program that makes you laugh. There can be many ways to entertain." 
</P>
<P>
 Several talk-show hosts said they believe that information and entertainment 
are inextricably intertwined and that one cannot take precedence over the 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we shouldn't have to choose between information that the public 
should have and presenting a show in an entertaining way," said attorney Gloria 
Allred, who hosts a nightly program on KABC-AM. "I think we can do both and we 
should do both. By entertaining, I don't mean it should be a comedy. It should 
be involving, it should engage, it should be participatory." 
</P>
<P>
 "We straddle the fence between entertainment and serious discussion," said 
Joel Roberts, who hosts a daily show on KABC with Steve Edwards. "Our thing is 
to have big fun with serious issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand-up comic Stephanie Miller was hired at KFI with the directive to take 
serious issues and find the humor in them for her nightly show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until I heard KFI that I even thought about doing talk radio," 
Miller said. "I always thought it was just old guys talking about the budget. I 
think KFI has been the one that really trailblazed that kind of different, more 
entertainment-oriented talk radio." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller opens her shows with jokes. One night this week she encouraged callers 
to phone in with their "crackpot conspiracy theories" that would explain O.J. 
Simpson's innocence. She has also taken a comedic look at the Northridge 
earthquake, the Malibu fires and flesh-eating bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be Dan Rather every time you cover a serious issue," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Piper, who used to produce Larry King's call-in show and now produces 
Brenner's, praised the decision to lighten things up.  
</P>
<P>
 "There have always been attempts in radio to make people laugh," he said. 
"It's good to hear some guys having fun. When people call in, they say, 'David, 
this is such a breath of fresh air.' Not all of talk radio has to be what you 
see on 'Crossfire.' "

KMEX FINDS DISCREPANCY IN WORLD CUP TV RATINGS; TELEVISION: THE 
SPANISH-LANGUAGE STATION SAYS LATINOS ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN NIELSEN'S 
AUDIENCE MEASUREMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With roughly $1 billion worth of annual advertising revenue at stake for Los 
Angeles television stations, KMEX-TV Channel 34 is trying to use its stellar 
World Cup ratings to draw attention to what the station has maintained for 
years: that far more people watch Spanish-language programming here than the 
A.C. Nielsen Co. reports. 
</P>
<P>
 KMEX, the area's leading Spanish-language station, subscribes to two Nielsen 
ratings services. One measures only Latino households, while the other -- also 
used by the English-language stations -- measures the total number of 
households watching television, including Latino ones. 
</P>
<P>
 For last Monday's World Cup soccer game between Brazil and Russia, Nielsen's 
Latino rating service reported that 234,000 Latino homes in Southern California 
were tuned in. But the general market service reported total viewership of 
195,000 homes. Similar discrepancies have been found in other World Cup 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Schultz, director of research and marketing for KMEX, maintains that 
both numbers can't be correct if they are true representations of the 
L.A.-Orange-Ventura county market, where 33% of the people are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the local radio market, you see that the No. 1 station in Los 
Angeles (KLAX-FM (97.9)) is a Spanish station," she said. "But the No. 1 
television station is certainly not, because Nielsen under-reports Hispanic 
viewing in the total market." 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen explains that the methodology used to define Latino homes in the two 
samples is very different. For the Latino ratings service, Nielsen takes into 
account both the types and degree of Spanish spoken in the homes measured, 
making sure that Spanish is the primary language used in at least 60% of them. 
For the general market service, households are labeled Latino based on the 
identification of the head of household, with less regard for what language is 
spoken most often. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Nielsen can't specifically explain why the Latino rating breaks down 
into more households than the general market rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, these ratings are estimates," said Jack Loftus, vice president of 
communications for Nielsen. "You have entirely different samples, so you have 
different numbers. The Hispanic-language sample probably does a better job, in 
terms of both counting and identifying Spanish-language households in that 
sample." 
</P>
<P>
 Even using the broader general market numbers, KMEX outperformed its 
English-language counterparts in certain key demographics during last month's 
ratings sweeps. If Nielsen used the more precise methodology employed in the 
Latino measurement, Schultz believes KMEX would be the No. 1 station here. 
</P>
<P>
 Nielsen created the separate Latino service five years ago so they could 
better measure their Spanish-speaking audiences and charge advertisers a fair 
price to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino service uses a device called a People Meter, requiring viewers to 
push buttons and give information about themselves whenever they watch TV. So 
why not use the more sophisticated technology for the entire market? 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that not every customer in the market wants it that way 
because the methodologies are different," Loftus said. "I don't know if their 
numbers (at the English-language stations) would go down, but we offered them 
People Meter service some years ago, and they did not want it. If KMEX will sit 
down with all the other stations and agree that, as a market, this is what they 
want, Nielsen would have to look at that very carefully. But I don't see that 
happening."

THE GARAGE NEVER SOUNDED SO GOOD; CHILDREN'S MUSIC: NINE YEARS AGO, JOANIE 
BARTELS DID A KIDS' ALBUM FOR A VAN NUYS LABEL. FROM THAT MODEST BEGINNING, HER 
CAREER HAS TAKEN OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Joanie Bartels recorded her first children's album in a garage in 1985, 
she was not expecting children's music to become her full-time career. Nine 
years later, Bartels is near the top of the field, with a gold record to her 
credit, 2.5 million of her numerous recordings sold, a home video series and 
plans for a TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of Bartels and her label, Discovery Music, the Van Nuys-based 
independent label that skillfully and shrewdly developed the singer, attracted 
the attention of entertainment giant BMG last year, which is now in the process 
of absorbing Discovery and its artists into its children's wing, BMG Kidz. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, between audio and video recordings, Los Angeles-based Bartels, 
assured and youthful at 41, regularly crisscrosses the country to perform. 
Saturday, she will appear in concert at Six Flags Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and children, she said, should come prepared to "really let their hair 
down and have fun with a lot of dancing, silliness and sing-along stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Bartels, with a background in adult rock 'n' roll and jazz, makes 
intergenerational participation easy. She mixes musical styles, but rock 'n' 
roll oldies and original, humorous pop-style songs predominate, from '50s and 
'60s rock classics such as "La Bamba" and "Bare Footin' " to her own catchy 
ditties about "Silly Pie" and be-bopping Martians and dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's music can be cloying in repeat doses, but Bartels has staying power 
with polished, easy vocals that are notable for their mellow clarity. Her 
obvious career savvy is partnered by a disarming enthusiasm.  
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it is that I'm still kind of a kid myself," Bartels said. "I can get 
out there and still be goofy and silly and play. I think children get that . . 
. I love what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
 She's especially enthusiastic about her new "Simply Magic" videos. The first 
two in the series, "The Rainy Day Adventure" and "The Extra-Special Substitute 
Teacher," have given Bartels a chance to show off her acting skills in a story 
format. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're hoping to do next is a pilot for a children's TV show, 'Joanie's 
Juke Box Cafe,' " a sitcom-with-music based on her new audio series. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartels began her career by folk singing in Massachusetts coffeehouses. That 
led to regular gigs with rock and jazz bands and studio work as a backup 
singer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Ellen Wohlstadter, a young mother and head of production at RSO 
records, called Bartels with an idea for a lullaby album, the first in what 
would become the Discovery Music's "Magic Series," themed audio recordings -- 
bedtime, bath time, travel time -- for parents, infants and toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartels, one of many who auditioned, got the job, thanks to her "incredible 
voice" and her sincere interest in the project, said co-producer David 
Wohlstadter. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bartels, the rewards were unexpected. "What I had been doing was great, 
but none of it compares to what I'm doing now. It's a much healthier lifestyle, 
much more positive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bartels didn't start out with star billing. Initially, the recordings weren't 
even marketed in her name, because "no one knew who Joanie was," David 
Wohlstadter said. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife "pounded the pavement" and successfully placed "Lullaby Magic," the 
initial tape, on consignment in Westside and Valley specialty and juvenile 
stores as "an impulse buy" during the 1985 Christmas season. "That's the point 
we knew we had found a niche and started exploiting it," David Wohlstadter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years later as "more and more people" seeking Discovery Music recordings 
began asking for Bartels by name, "we started switching the direction of the 
marketing, toward developing Joanie as a children's artist." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, competition in the field was growing and major labels such as A&M 
began signing artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was (Canadian children's artist) Raffi who put children's music on the 
map," Bartels said, "so that it wasn't just a $2.99 album you picked up at 
Kmart. He really started working with children and child development through 
music; he opened the door for a lot of artists on the national level." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Discovery's years of "focus, patience and grass-roots marketing" on 
behalf of a concept and a single artist are still a phenomenon in the 
hit-driven recording industry, which has signed artists, then dropped them when 
immediate results weren't forthcoming. Discovery maintained its formula, using 
it to develop two other artists, Dennis Hysom and Bethie. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the label and its artists are being "absorbed 100% by BMG," 
Wohlstadter and his wife will be "exploring new opportunities in the children's 
entertainment field . . . but in this transition period with BMG, we're out 
pitching TV shows for (Bartels, Hysom and Bethie) to cable, network, 
syndication and PBS." 
</P>
<P>
 Singing is Bartels' first love, though. "My mom told me that when I was about 
3," Bartels said, "I saw Rosemary Clooney, probably on the Mitch Miller show or 
on Ed Sullivan. She said from that I was just transformed, and I said I wanted 
to sing like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The story was straight from her press bio, but Bartels, laughing, had an 
irreverent addendum: "I'm sure part of it was that she looked like an angel 
with her blond, blond hair that probably, on our black-and-white TV set, looked 
like it was glowing." 
</P>
<P>
 * Joanie Bartels, Six Flags Magic Mountain, Valencia, Saturday at noon and 
1:30 p.m. Free with park admission; (805) 255-4111, (818) 367-5965.

 The more things change . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another Playboy panorama has been unveiled before our eager ears. Bill Cosby 
has hollered "Give it to 'em!" for the 978th time. Beach balls have been 
bounced; handkerchiefs have waved; surging fans have all but invaded the stage 
for the umpteenth time. 
</P>
<P>
 These three questions bear a little examination, at least when used jointly: 
Is it Playboy? Is it jazz? Is it a festival? 
</P>
<P>
 These are fighting questions. There can be no doubt, really, about the first 
one, since Playboy managed, from the beginning, to identify itself with jazz in 
one way or another, even while the magazine's former jazz poll has degenerated 
into a forum for rock, pop, funk and rap. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's event was neither more nor less a jazz convention than the 15 that 
preceded it at the Hollywood Bowl. There must have been some significance in 
the failure to draw a full house Sunday, in contrast to previous years when 
both days were sold out weeks in advance. (But look at it another way: In those 
two days, the concerts still drew more than 35,000 fans.) Was it the recession 
that slowed things down? Was the Latin finale a less spectacular attraction 
than the Lionel Hampton jam session? Producer George Wein and his associates 
still don't have all the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains constant is the schism that separates aficionados of 
straight-ahead jazz from those who roar for David Sanborn and scream for King 
Sunny Ade. Year after year, Playboy faces the fact that you can't please all of 
the people all of the time. You would have to do a great deal of investigation 
to find a fan who went home raving about Earl Klugh and Spyro Gyra and Wynton 
Marsalis and Elvin Jones. To reverse the axiom, you have to displease some of 
the people some of the time, and the trick is to maintain a delicate balance 
that will leave enough satisfied people to counteract the gripes and grumbles. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of the term "jazz" has long been offensive to some musicians who felt 
that it has a negative connotation. Down Beat magazine changed its slogan a few 
years ago by adopting a subtitle: Jazz, Blues & Beyond. By the same token, the 
music presented last weekend could well have been billed as "Playboy Jazz and 
Entertainment Festival" or "Jazz, Pop & Funk Festival."  
</P>
<P>
 So was it jazz? The reply can only be a firm yes or no. 
</P>
<P>
 It was ever thus. Correction: At the very first Playboy Festival, in Chicago 
in 1959, the lineup was a phenomenal who's who that did not include a single 
act definable as non-jazz. But this was before the scene became as fragmented 
as it is today. 
</P>
<P>
 A final question: Is this a festival? 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody who has seen (or even heard via radio) the behavior of the crowd can 
deny that thousands of visitors are there simply to have a grand celebration 
under sunny June skies. They babble incessantly while some interesting, 
cerebral band is on stage, then go wild when some excitement-oriented group 
takes over, whether it's the African percussion of King Sunny Ade or the 
commercialized Dixieland of Pete Fountain. Sure, it's festive, and it will stay 
that way as long as the sun shines over the Hollywood Bowl. For those who can't 
go along with high spirits, the solution is simple: Stay home and relax with 
your personal CDs.

CHOREOGRAPHY GLIDES BACK INTO FOCUS ON SILVER SCREEN; MOVIES: FROM 'THE 
FLINTSTONES' TO 'THE MASK,' HOLLYWOOD IS ADDING MORE SMOOTH MOVES TO ITS 
REPERTOIRE. BUT THEIR PRESENCE IS OFTEN SUBTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's a far cry from the MGM musicals of the '40s or those over-the-top MTV 
dance videos. But choreography is nonetheless two-stepping its way back onto 
the silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993 alone, 43 movies had choreographed segments, says dance agent Julie 
McDonald of Joseph, Heldfond & Rix Inc., who represents many of the top 
choreographers on both coasts. This year, dance impresarios are putting their 
imprint on films such as "Casper," "The Flintstones," "The Mask" and "To Wong 
Fu" to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 But the presence of choreography is often subtle, playing on the audience's 
subconscious conditioning from all of those TV music videos, "of having music 
and dance incorporated in their lives," says choreographer Vincent Paterson. 
</P>
<P>
 "People always think of choreography as ballet or Broadway or a dance movie 
like 'Flashdance.' But choreography is becoming more and more of an integral 
part of filmmaking. All of a sudden it's in films like 'The Flintstones' or 
'What's Love Got to Do With It.' But people don't walk away talking about, 
'Wow, that dance number!' 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of MTV we've become so accustomed to music and dance, most people 
don't realize its role or remember it when they do see it on the screen," he 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 Paterson -- who choreographed segments in "Hook," "Havana," "Ruby," "The 
Mighty Quinn" and "Mannequin" -- is currently negotiating to compose the dance 
numbers for Oliver Stone's upcoming "Evita" for Hollywood Pictures. He is also 
one of three choreographers in the running for Paul Verhoeven's planned 
"Showgirls." 
</P>
<P>
 Paterson has also choreographed Madonna's "Blond Ambition" tour, her video 
"Express Yourself" and the 1990 live MTV Awards performance of "Vogue." He was 
Michael Jackson's dance maestro for the 1993 halftime Super Bowl performance, 
for Jackson's "Black or White" video and his 1989 "Bad" tour. And he 
choreographed Hal Prince's musical stage version of Manuel Puig's "Kiss of the 
Spider Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 He recently completed a fantasy documentary for TNT, "In Search of Dr. Seuss," 
starring Kathy Najimy, Robin Williams and the voice of Billy Crystal. The 
program is set to air Nov. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone's anticipated $40-million to $50-million version of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber's musical follows Stone's recent decision to drop "Noriega." Sources say 
Stone, who recently scouted locations in Argentina, could begin shooting on 
"Evita" as early as February. 
</P>
<P>
 What Paterson might do with "Evita" is still on the drawing board. "But it 
would be something with more of an edge -- again, something people are 
accustomed to seeing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to do a musical, to incorporate one art into another, so that the 
movement doesn't look like some big dance number," says Paterson. "That's the 
new message we're playing with in film. To bring choreography in but to make it 
. . . something you don't even notice."

TOASTING JAMAICAN MUSIC; U-ROY, WHO LIVES IN SANTA ANA, WILL BRING HIS MESSAGE 
OF UNITY TO LONG BEACH FESTIVAL OF AFRICAN AND CARIBBEAN MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 "When I was young," says Jamaican deejay U-Roy, "I didn't think I would ever 
live in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked just how he came from the Kingston ghetto of his youth to an 
apartment complex in Santa Ana, he is a little hazy on the details. He has some 
music business friends in Los Angeles and, well, he just kind of settled in 
about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He does his best to simulate some of the comforts of home. Every morning, for 
instance, he drives to Newport Beach to shop for fresh fish. And he tours 
heavily in the United States, so living in California (rather than Jamaica) 
comes in handy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just chill and make the best of life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 U-Roy will be part of a packed lineup of attractions at FESTAC -- the Festival 
of African and Caribbean arts and music -- Sunday at the Rainbow Lagoon in Long 
Beach. Others on the bill include Trinidadian soca star David Rudder, a quartet 
of salsa veterans billed as the Salsa All Stars, African reggae singer 
Mutabaruka and Zairean soukous star Tabu Ley Rochereau, a veteran of the 
original FESTAC in Lagos, Nigeria, in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 U-Roy (born Ewart Beckford) may make his home in Orange County these days, but 
Jamaica remains close to his heart. He travels back often ("If I don't go back 
to Jamaica, it's like I turn my back on my country") and owns a sound system 
there, a mobile deejay setup that travels to various neighborhood dances 
throughout the island nation. Such systems were a fixture in Jamaica in the 
'60s; U-Roy, now 52, first joined one as a deejay at age 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The deejays at that time were local stars in their own right, adding 
flamboyant introductions to the records and "toasting" over the instrumental 
sections. U-Roy's big break came when he was heard by King Tubby, who owned one 
of the most successful sound systems in Jamaica. Tubby is credited with 
inventing "dub," the spacey, echo-heavy, bass-driven remixes of top reggae 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when things started picking up for me," U-Roy recalls. The dub 
versions allowed him to toast at length, and the inventiveness of his raps 
quickly earned him a reputation. Record producer Duke Reid heard him at a dance 
and wasted no time getting him into a recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
 His first three releases were huge hits in Jamaica, holding down the top three 
spots on the chart for six weeks. "Wear You to the Ball," which went to No. 1, 
recently was covered by UB40. 
</P>
<P>
 U-Roy was surprised to find himself a recording star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before that, the deejay business was not something that people take 
seriously," he says, his thick patois intact despite his time in the States. "I 
never really took it serious . . . . People weren't really used to this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 His rhythmic sense and distinctive voice, with its gravelly exclamations of 
"Wow" and "Yeah," have been much imitated, but international success has been 
elusive for U-Roy. Still, he continues to have spells of success, and his 
recent recordings for Washington-based RAS Records have been well-received. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, he is widely recognized for his pioneer role in the breakthrough 
of toasting, the precursor to modern "dance hall" music (the biggest dance hall 
star, Shabba Ranks, is a graduate of U-Roy's Jamaican sound system). 
</P>
<P>
 Toasting also is considered by many to be a major influence on rap, a view 
U-Roy shares. But although he enjoys much of the music in dance hall and rap, 
he sometimes is dismayed by the lyric content. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I want from these kids is to be more positive," he says. 
"There's a lot of young kids who follow whatever these guys say or do."  
</P>
<P>
 Lyrics that glorify guns or are disrespectful to women are his biggest 
concerns. "The music should be uplifting for the youths. That's only what I'm 
saying. Whatever I say, it's just life as I see it." 
</P>
<P>
 In his own lyrics, "I just talk about unity with people. I don't really try to 
put down people or anything like that. Violence is very ugly, and love is very 
lovely. I never been to college or anything like that, but I have some common 
sense, and what I learn I just make the best of it, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He is encouraged by the current acceptance of reggae in the United States, 
particularly on college campuses. "I think it's a good time for music. When I 
started as a deejay, I didn't see Americans getting on to reggae at the time. I 
didn't see the people feeling the music." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his own fluctuating fortunes in the recording business -- well, with 
prototype Rasta patience, he takes them in stride. "The music business is 
something that wants to go up and down. I'm a survivor, and I can be 
comfortable with whatever comes." 
</P>
<P>
 * FESTAC takes place Sunday from 11 a.m. to dusk at the Rainbow Lagoon on 
Shoreline Drive near the Long Beach Convention Center. $10-$18. (310) 474-8685.

COMPOSING BROWN AS HE GOES ALONG; JAZZ: THE GUITARIST, WHO PLAYS IN IRVINE 
TODAY, GETS A TASTE OF RECOGNITION AS HE ESTABLISHES HIS IDENTITY ON HIS OWN 
TERMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Norman Brown can feel things changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been places lately where the people actually recognize me," the hot 
young guitarist said by phone from a Philadelphia hotel during a stop on a long 
national tour. "Or they know my music and have put the face with it, like 
'Yeah, man, I know your stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His first MoJazz album, "Just Between Us," placed highly on both sales and 
radio play charts, and his second, "After the Storm," opened earlier this month 
at No. 2 on Billboard's Contemporary Jazz Chart. It seems the Wes 
Montgomery/George Benson-influenced musician has found the right formula. 
</P>
<P>
 But what Brown, who plays the WAVE Stage at the Taste of Orange County 
Festival today, is most proud of is that he's establishing his identity on his 
own terms. While his first recording included such interest-attracting guests 
as Stevie Wonder, Boys II Men and Ronnie Laws, the second album, he says, is a 
clearer picture of what he's about. 
</P>
<P>
 "On this album, I got a chance to produce and do most of the arranging. I 
wanted to focus in on Norman Brown on this one and present different sides of 
what I was doing. In terms of the writing, you'll hear some Latin influence on 
some tunes, a little bit of that African thing and jungle rhythms, some 
groovier stuff, some R&B-style jazz, an original ballad." Translation: This is 
a very accessible album with strong rhythmic hooks, plenty of electric keyboard 
backing and enough vocal work (by Brown and an entourage of backup singers) to 
encourage radio play. 
</P>
<P>
 The disc features nine Brown originals and covers from Janet Jackson, the 
Isley Brothers and Luther Vandross. Over it all, Brown adds tasty guitar licks 
out of the Montgomery tradition in a way that fuses pop and jazz sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The disc's variety reflects his youthful exposure to all types of music. The 
Kansas City native is the second youngest of nine children and was turned on to 
all types of sounds through his siblings and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was played in our house," the 26-year-old guitarist said. "My 
father was into straight-ahead jazz like Wes Montgomery, Count Basie, Ellington 
and (guitarist) Grant Green. My mother was really into gospel -- Mahalia 
Jackson -- and she also liked the blues, you know, B.B. King and those cats. 
Then my sisters and brothers were into the popular stuff. They played a lot of 
Hendrix, the Isley Brothers, Kool and the Gang, Earth Wind and Fire. I never 
really locked into one thing." 
</P>
<P>
 At age 8, Brown picked up his brother's guitar and started playing along to 
the myriad sounds heard around the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it all so I tried to play it all. Especially Hendrix, the 'Band of 
Gypsies' album, the way he played the guitar. He made it scream and holler and 
cry; he got so much emotion from it that I was really drawn to it." 
</P>
<P>
 But then his father turned him on to Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the period that I fell more toward jazz, and that's all I wanted to 
do. It happened when my father played 'Bumpin' on Sunset.' He had that octave 
thing going, and that was very attractive. Then he played the album 'Boss 
Guitar' for me, where Wes plays a lot of single-line solos with his thumb and a 
lot of chord solos. I was blown away at how he could solo with chords like 
that. And I began to search out other guitarists, Grant Green and Kenny 
Burrell, and tried to learn what they were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior high school also served to broaden his scope. Because the school didn't 
have a guitar program, Brown took the opportunity to learn saxophone and 
upright bass. But the band director recognized his student's guitar skills and 
enlisted him for his quartet.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was doing more contemporary stuff, like Grover Washington Jr. and the 
Crusaders, and I got into that. Also, he didn't have a piano player in the 
band, so I got to play a whole lot, all the chords and fill. That really helped 
me get my accompaniment thing together." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, still largely self-taught, also joined other area R&B bands to keep up 
his chops. Then he saw an advertisement in Guitar Player magazine for the 
Guitar Institute (now the Musicians Institute) in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "I flew out to check it out and audition and decided it was definitely the 
place I needed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Los Angeles in 1983, studying with legendary session man Tommy 
Tedesco as well as guitarists Ron Eschete and Joe DiOrio. Upon graduation, the 
school asked Brown to stay on as an instructor, and he continues to do master 
classes and seminars there when his schedule allows. 
</P>
<P>
 His big break came in the late '80s when a girlfriend introduced him to 
drummer-producer Norman Connors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went over to his place for Thanksgiving, and I took my guitar and a bunch 
of tapes. After dinner, he put on the tapes and when he didn't take the 
headphones off, I knew he liked it." 
</P>
<P>
 Connors introduced Brown's music to Steve McKeever, senior vice president of 
A&R at Motown, which was looking to form a new jazz label. As a result, Brown's 
"Just Between Us" became MoJazz's initial release. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Just Between Us" did well, "After the Storm" has taken off with 
incredible speed. But the disc has not been well accepted by jazz critics. A 
review in Sunday's L.A. Times suggested that Brown had "Xeroxed" George 
Benson's sound (Benson was initially accused of ripping off Montgomery). 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure he's a major influence," says Brown of Benson. "My sister turned me on 
to the 'Breezin" album when it first came out and, you know, I didn't like it. 
I was such a Wes fan that I felt (Benson) was trying to unseat Wes. But then I 
listened to it some more and liked it and started to learn all his stuff. He 
was doing what Wes was doing but in a contemporary setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also admits that Benson influenced him to scat along with his playing, 
as he does on the new disc.  
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," he says, "but actually a lot of jazz cats did that, just off the 
microphone." 
</P>
<P>
 Singing, as he does on the ballad "It Costs to Love," is an old skill of 
Brown's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sang in choirs while I was growing up but lost interest when I focused on 
the guitar. But just before I moved to L.A., I got interested in expressing 
myself with lyrics, listening to Stevie Wonder and Christopher Cross and those 
cats. So it just sparked another creative thing in me. The voice is the closest 
instrument to your heart. It's the best way to express what's really inside 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown says he's interested in doing a future album in the organ trio setup ("I 
love the B-3," he says) and in duets with other guitarists, including his 
fellow instructors from the Musicians Institute as well as such names as Benson 
and Earl Klugh. "But the next album, like this one, will be more of a Norman 
Brown album. I really want to establish myself as an artist and a composer 
first." 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; RARE DISPLAY OF DELAFOSE'S ZYDECO MASTERY AT MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Delafose has played a lot of places in his 40-some years fronting a 
zydeco band: dance halls, dive bars, house parties, barbecues, fish fries, 
church basements and giant festivals before tens of thousands of fans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday was the first time the veteran singer and accordion player could 
recall having played an art museum. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his Eunice Playboys launched the Long Beach Museum of Art's annual 
summer concert series with a typically bouncy performance that provided an 
interesting complement to the art on the walls, a couple of dozen quirky works 
by Jonathan Borofsky. (Before the music, an announcer invited concert-goers to 
tour the exhibition at intermission -- something you don't hear at most zydeco 
performances.) 
</P>
<P>
 Among Borofsky's Expressionist-Surrealist works on view is a piece reflecting 
his respect for Lech Walesa. According to the wall label, "Borofsky asserts 
that artists are also involved in remaking the world, and that art and politics 
are part of the same conflicted realm." That's the same argument Nietzsche once 
made, to which Schopenhauer, I believe it was, responded: 
</P>
<P>
 "Shut up and dance." 
</P>
<P>
 And that advice was fairly easy to follow, given the infectious rhythms laid 
down by the band. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting, a grassy courtyard between two brick buildings that house the 
museum and gift shop, is casual and picturesque, overlooking the ocean and 
framed by palm and bottlebrush trees. The space was packed by nearly 1,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone familiar with Delafose's recent history wouldn't have been surprised 
when he turned virtually the entire first set over to his son, Geno. Indeed, 
given that John underwent major heart surgery last year, fans probably should 
count themselves lucky to hear him playing at all anymore. According to concert 
promoter and booking agent David Gaar, John has, at 55, all but retired from 
touring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Delafose the Younger is an engaging front man and an increasingly accomplished 
accordionist. As a singer, he lacks a voice with the richness and character of 
his father's. That may come with time. 
</P>
<P>
 Once John took the stage Wednesday, his playing and singing was understandably 
restrained. He engaged in enough accordion squeezing to keep the dancers going 
but rarely displayed the kind of melodic and rhythmic wizardry that can make 
zydeco soar. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the second set, however, during the R & B swing tune "Make 
Me Yours," he managed some transcendent vocal moments. And he finally generated 
some instrumental sparks with an exceptionally zippy run-through of the zydeco 
national anthem, "Les Haricots Son Pas Sales." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, a good portion of those in the crowd -- whose picnic baskets 
with wine and cheese gave the proceedings the aura of a Hollywood Bowl for 
roots music fans -- were up and two-stepping. Some even tried jamming the 
square peg of the Electric Slide line dance through the round hole of a zydeco 
waltz. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess that's what happens when art and zydeco are part of the same 
conflicted realm. Next up in the museum's weekly series is Afro-Nicaraguan 
reggae singer Raymond Myers, who plays Wednesday.

 The California Arts Council has lowered from 4- to 3+ the grant ranking of the 
Orange County Philharmonic Society, which will wait for an explanation of the 
action before deciding what to do, the society said Thursday. "We'll wait and 
see what they say," society executive director Dean Corey said."If we can 
appeal it, we certainly will." 
</P>

 Council officers were not immediately available Thursday to comment on the 
reduction. In 1992 the society successfully appealed the exact same drop in 
rank to receive a $39,051 grant, more than double the amount it had originally 
been awarded. Before that, OCPS had received the top rank of 4 for five of the 
previous six years. The council uses the rankings to determine grant amounts.

U-ROY: 'TOASTING' HIS WAY TO TOP OF JAMAICAN CHARTS; POP MUSIC: THE RECORDING 
ARTIST'S UNIQUE CARIBBEAN STYLE IS MAKING WAVES IN THE UNITED STATES. HE'LL 
APPEAR AT FESTAC IN LONG BEACH ON SUNDAY.

 "When I was young," says Jamaican deejay and recording star U-Roy, "I didn't 
think I would ever live in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked just how he came from the Kingston ghetto of his youth to an 
apartment complex in Santa Ana, he is a little hazy on details. He has music 
business friends in Los Angeles and, well, he just kind of settled in about 
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He does his best to simulate some comforts of home. Every morning, for 
instance, he drives to Newport Beach to shop for fresh fish. "I just chill and 
make the best of life," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 U-Roy will be part of a packed lineup of attractions at FESTAC -- the Festival 
of African and Caribbean arts and music -- Sunday at the Rainbow Lagoon in Long 
Beach. Others on the bill include Trinidadian soca star David Rudder, a quartet 
of salsa veterans billed as the Salsa All Stars, African reggae singer 
Mutabaruka and Zairean soukous star Tabu Ley Rochereau, a veteran of the 
original FESTAC in Lagos, Nigeria, in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 U-Roy (born Ewart Beckford) may make his home in Orange County these days but 
Jamaica remains close to his heart. He travels back often ("If I don't go back 
to Jamaica, it's like I turn my back on my country") and owns a sound system 
there, a mobile deejay set-up that travels to various neighborhood dances 
throughout the island nation. Such systems were a fixture in Jamaica in the 
'60s; U-Roy, now 52, first became involved with one as a deejay at age 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The deejays at that time were local stars in their own right, adding 
flamboyant introductions to the records and "toasting" (which is believed to 
have influenced rapping) over the instrumental sections. U-Roy's big break came 
when he was heard by King Tubby, who owned one of the most successful sound 
systems in Jamaica. Tubby is credited with inventing "dub," the spacey, 
echo-heavy, bass-driven remixes of top reggae hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when things started picking up for me," U-Roy recalls. The dub 
versions allowed him to toast at length, and the inventiveness of his raps 
quickly earned him a reputation. Record producer Duke Reid heard him at a dance 
and wasted no time getting him into a recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
 His first three releases were huge hits in Jamaica, holding down the top three 
spots on the chart for six weeks. "Wear You to the Ball," which went to No. 1, 
recently was covered by UB40. 
</P>
<P>
 U-Roy was surprised to find himself a recording star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before that, the deejay business was not something that people take 
seriously," he says, his thick patois intact despite his time in the States. "I 
didn't really took it serious. . . . People weren't really used to this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 His rhythmic sense and distinctive voice, with its gravelly exclamations of 
"Wow" and "Yeah," have been much imitated but international success has been 
elusive for U-Roy. Still, he continues to have breakthrough spells, and his 
recent recordings for Washington-based RAS Records have been well-received. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, he is widely recognized for his pioneer role in the breakthrough 
of toasting, the precursor to modern "dancehall" music (the biggest dancehall 
star, Shabba Ranks, is a graduate of U-Roy's Jamaican sound system). 
</P>
<P>
 In his own lyrics, "I just talk about unity with people. I don't really try to 
put down people or anything like that. Violence is very ugly and love is very 
lovely. I never been to college or anything like that, but I have some common 
sense, and what I learn I just make the best of it, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 * FESTAC takes place Sunday from 11 a.m. to dusk at the Rainbow Lagoon on 
Shoreline Drive near the Long Beach Convention Center. $10-$18. (310) 474-8685.

STUDIO CAFE TO OPEN IN HUNTINGTON 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A second Studio Cafe restaurant and nightclub, modeled after its predecessor 
in Newport Beach, will open July 1 in downtown Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The new restaurant, at 300 Pacific Coast Highway, will feature live jazz and 
pop and is in the same complex that housed Peppers Golden Bear, a live music 
club that closed in 1991 after creating too much noise for movie theater in the 
same complex. The Studio Cafe does not share any walls, ceiling or floor space 
with the theater, as Peppers did. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio Cafe owner Albert Chammas said the new location's bandstand and small 
dance floor have been constructed to reduce "vibration and transmission of 
noise." (714) 675-7760. ZAN DUBIN

SUMMERTIME; COVER STORY; THE RIGHT PLACES; FROM COFFEE SHOPS TO CANINE CLUBS, 
HERE'S WHERE THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY'S FAMED FACES HANG OUT TO FEED THE TROUT 
AND SPEND THE SUMMER.

 OK, so some Valley notables we talked to were a little stumped when we asked 
them to name their favorite places in the San Fernando Valley to hang out or to 
take out-of-town visitors in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 True, we got answers like "Price Club" and "collapsed apartment buildings." 
But there also were plenty of enthusiastic describers of some little-known 
enclaves, where they can escape from the traffic, smog, stickiness and hubbub 
of summer without going very far from home. 
</P>
<P>
 If you go to the coffee shop at Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City for breakfast 
on a Saturday or Sunday, you might get a coffee warm-up from Emmy-nominated 
actress Marion Ross (late of "Brooklyn Bridge"), who lives in Woodland Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 No, she isn't a waitress -- her critically acclaimed CBS show having been 
canceled (critically acclaimed and canceled do so often go hand in hand). She's 
in an upcoming Danielle Steele NBC miniseries, "A Perfect Stranger," and plays 
comedian Louie Anderson's mom in the pilot for a sitcom. It's just that the 
hotel coffee shop is her favorite weekend hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bring my 3 1/2-year-old granddaughter. There are a lot of old actors around 
there, and they have breakfast and tell jokes," she said. "The waitresses 
practically order for you. They bring you what they think you should have. 
Everybody talks to everybody. Sometimes I'll get up and get the coffeepot and 
maybe serve a few people. Every time I go there, I think, gosh, this place goes 
on and on. No matter how sophisticated the Valley is getting, the Sportsmen's 
Lodge stays very homey. I took my children there for the trout, now I'm taking 
my granddaughter."  
</P>
<P>
 The trout? "We take some bread, and we go and feed all the trout. There's a 
big trout pond and swans there." 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Isabella Hofmann (of NBC's "Dear John"), who lives in Sherman Oaks, 
was loath to mention her favorite breakfast spot.  
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, when people come to visit me, they tend to want to go to the ocean 
or the mountains, and we'll make a day trip out of it, which means we have to 
nourish ourselves before we leave," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called Nat's Early Bite (at Hazeltine Avenue and Burbank Boulevard), and 
it has the best breakfast in town, as far as I'm concerned. It looks like a 
dive-y coffee shop, but I had a hankering for a coffee shop sort of atmosphere, 
so I went in one day about five years ago and never left." She did leave long 
enough to have a role in the current Danny DeVito picture, "Renaissance Man." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rock Store," North Hollywood resident Rick Overton answered without 
hesitation.  
</P>
<P>
 The what?  
</P>
<P>
 "The Rock Store. It's up on Mulholland. I don't know the exact number, I just 
know how to get there. It's a legendary motorcycle hangout on Sundays. It's 
this place built up on a hill made out of piled-up rocks. There's an old gas 
pump out front that doesn't work anymore, one of those classic Route 66-style 
tin pumps with the skinny hose that just sort of flops around in the wind, and 
a little greasy-spoon restaurant, you know, all part of the legend and lore, 
and The Rock Store, where you can grab a beer or a pair of sunglasses or a soda 
or whatever, and it just loads up with bikes until you can't even move on 
Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Overton, who recently appeared in "Mrs. Doubtfire" and was about to go on the 
road with his stand-up act, has four bikes himself. "Anytime a friend comes in 
and they're on a bike, I go, well, you gotta catch a little piece of history. . 
. . Steve McQueen used to hang out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, a lot of people seem to find summer easier to bear in the 
mountains that surround the Valley. (Like we expected them to be hanging out at 
transmission shops on Victory Boulevard?) 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Zack Norman (of the current film "Babyfever" and Showtime's "Lush Life") 
hikes the mountaintop trail where Mulholland becomes a dirt road, near Encino 
Hills Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I drive over there from my house in Sherman Oaks and begin walking," said the 
Boston native. "I walk seven miles, 3 1/2 miles each way. The views are 
absolutely magnificent. In five minutes from my house, I am in the middle of a 
place that is absolutely quiet and pristine on one side, and cosmopolitan but 
magnificently beautiful from my vantage point on the other."  
</P>
<P>
 Actress-comedian Caryl Kristensen (one of "The Mommies" on NBC) and her 
10-year-old son found "a little piece of heaven in L.A.," she said, also in the 
Santa Monica Mountains -- Solstice Canyon, near Pepperdine University. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really cool. Back in there, it's just gorgeous. A naturalist will lead 
you through the park and show you, like, all the things about the park, and it 
was wonderful," she said. "It's great for a city kid to go up there and spend 
the day." 
</P>
<P>
 "We just shoot right up to the grounds of Mt. Wilson observatory, because it's 
so close, and it's pretty dramatic," said novelist David Noonan ("Memoirs of a 
Caddy"), who lives in Toluca Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up above everything, but it's literally a half an hour from where we 
are. I mean it's one of those places where you're instantly transported out of 
Los Angeles and into the mountains, because it's real winding, winding, a real 
mountain situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Gail Harris, who lives in Sun Valley and was once named "best Valley 
girl with a British accent" by drive-in movie critic Joe Bob Briggs, likes to 
go to the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank. "I go there for the horse 
shows, mainly, because I ride myself," said Harris, who rides hunter-jumpers. 
"But there's a lot of things for other people to do who aren't particularly 
into horses, like the shops and the restaurant. There's rental horses. And you 
can take the kids. Other movie stars go there -- Loretta Swit and William 
Shatner. Horse people are just a nice class of people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harris runs a small publishing business with her husband when not acting. 
Right now she's starring in the Jim Wynorski-directed pictures "Hard to Die" 
and "Sorority House Massacre II." 
</P>
<P>
 "Should I let them know about our secret favorite place?" Bruce Belland called 
to his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone just falls in love with it -- Hidden Valley."  
</P>
<P>
 Belland, a TV writer and producer best-known as the lead singer for The Four 
Preps, was referring to that area south of Westlake whose name is often 
confused with the gated community Hidden Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "You enter this little valley with the most immaculately manicured white 
fences," he said. "We were out last weekend, and the spring colts are out, and 
there are sheep, and there's this one ranch with the biggest brown bulls and 
rolling green pastureland. At the end of the valley, there's a little turn-off 
road, and there's a white adobe windmill with a red tile roof set among these 
pastoral oak trees, and you sit under one of those and take out a picnic lunch 
and watch the thoroughbreds run around. Everyone is just amazed by the fact 
that it's about 20 minutes from where I live in Encino, and it's out of this 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 To enjoy a scenic drive to Hidden Valley, take Westlake Boulevard, or 
California 23, south. Go through Westlake, turn right on Potrero Road, across 
the county line, then left on Lake Sherwood Drive. Drive around Lake Sherwood 
to meet up with Potrero again. Go left, taking the road across the valley, 
about 3 1/2 miles, to Hidden Valley Road, then turn left. The road ends about a 
mile down. Park along the road, making sure you don't trespass. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Cynthia Heimel, whose latest book of essays is "Get Your Tongue Out of 
My Mouth, I'm Kissing You Good-Bye!" suggested (besides Price Club) going to 
Laurel Canyon Park, where owners can legally let their canines run off-leash 
after 3 p.m., creating a sort of furred chaos for every breed of dog. Or, as 
Heimel said, "A friend of mine said it was like going to the Star Wars bar." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Creeks, who plays Fred Flintstone in "The Flintstones Show" attraction at 
Universal Studios Hollywood this summer, likes to patronize the patio dining of 
Los Toros Mexican restaurant in Chatsworth. "They've got the best bean dip in 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Screenwriter June Roberts ("Mermaids") may have summed up summer in the Valley 
best when she said, "I never leave the house." Favorite Hangouts

 Despite cuts in the city's arts budget and galleries forced to close because 
of damage from the Jan. 17 earthquake, we can still look forward to stimulating

</P>
<P>
 Begin tonight with two opening receptions in Burbank that are a stone's throw 
from each other.

by Valerie Gates. The show ends Aug. 6. 
</P>

 In the wake of the earthquake, Cal State Northridge has chosen to exhibit a 
most unusual student art show. 
</P>
<P>
 When the campus Fine Arts building, with its three art galleries, was closed 
after the earthquake, the university set up an art annex in a trailer near the 
intersection of Nordhoff Street and Etiwanda Avenue. To help heal the wounds of 
a devastated campus and student body, the call for entries for the annual 
student art show, usually restricted to art students, was opened to any CSUN 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 All 120 submissions were displayed on campus for one weekend. Viewers were 
asked to vote for their five favorite pieces. The 30 most popular works are on 
exhibit until the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN Art Annex 116, near Nordhoff Street and Etiwanda Avenue, Northridge. Open 
10 a.m. through 4 p.m. weekdays through July. (818) 885-2226 or (818) 885-2156.

 In August, the Orlando Gallery in Sherman Oaks will present the "Orlando 
Gallery Collection, 1960-1989," the gallery's own collection of its artists' 
paintings, drawings, prints and books. These are "diversified early works by 
artists prominent today," said Bob Gino, gallery director. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Urban Landscapes" of Candace Mooser Foster and Stephen Olson will be at 
Orlando through July 1, and the "New Paintings" of Chris Mooradian and Scott 
Sandusky will show from July 8 through 29.

 Throughout the summer, the special exhibitions gallery of the Gene Autry 
Western Heritage Museum in Griffith Park will delve into "The Mask of Zorro: 
Mexican Americans in Popular Media." Presented in English and Spanish, the show

 The summer of 1994 should be an unusually rousing season for music in the San 
Fernando Valley and surrounding areas. Fans of pop, jazz, classical and folk 
will find a wide variety of concerts in the coming months, from singer Sue 
Raney's jazzy tribute to the music of Henry Mancini tonight at Le Cafe to Janet 
Jackson Aug. 9 at the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raney tribute to the late composer is just one highlight from a busy 
schedule for the Sherman Oaks venue, located in a neighborhood hit hard by 
January's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Le Cafe was fortunate enough to be left standing, and is now celebrating its 
15th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of really die-hard fans," said co-owner Dale Jaffe of the club 
that has seen such popular jazz and pop artists as David Benoit, Don Grusin, 
Strunz and Farah, and others pass through early in their careers. "Obviously, 
Sherman Oaks doesn't have as many people living here as there were before. But, 
hopefully, by the end of the year the population will be back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 As ever, the Universal Amphitheatre in Universal City will be site to many of 
the area's most spectacular musical events, including the Tony Award-winning 
stage adaptation of The Who's 1969 rock opera "Tommy," composed by guitarist 
Pete Townshend. That production runs July 13 through Aug. 14. Other summer 
events at Universal include a country music concert by Reba McEntire and John 
Michael Montgomery on July 1; the WOMAD music festival, with the bands Primus, 
Arrested Development, Midnight Oil, Live and Caifanes, on July 10; folk pop 
from the Indigo Girls on Aug. 26 and 27, and Jackson Browne with John Hiatt on 
Aug. 31.

 The Country Club in Reseda has postponed its live schedule until September, 
and will fill its calendar with a variety of dance music nights, with the beat 
provided by DJs. But other local rock, pop and country venues plan to stay busy 
through the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palomino in North Hollywood has returned to its country music roots, with 
plans to fill its evenings with local country acts. 
</P>
<P>
 The venue, located at 6907 Lankershim Blvd., is "under old management," joked 
Sherry Thomas, who has retaken control of the club once owned by her late 
husband, Tom Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some great bands out there," said Thomas, who recently bought out her 
nephew Bill Thomas' interest in the club, "but there hasn't been a place for 
them to showcase what they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Thomas is hoping to change that by eliminating hard rock from the 
schedule. "I'm just getting away from that screaming," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 That much should be obvious just from tonight's performance by traditional 
country band Reward. On Saturday, the Blazers, Chris Gaffney and Beto Lavato 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Other shows include roots-country from the Shivers on July 6, and from Paul 
Bowman on July 7; roots-rocker and funnyman Country Dick Montana brings his 
Petting Zoo band, including Rosie Flores and Katey Moffatt, on July 8, and Rip 
Master performs rockabilly July 9. Ronnie Mack's "Barndance" will continue on 
Tuesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket prices vary. For more information, call (818) 764-4010.

</P>
<P>
 In Calabasas, Pelican's Retreat again offers a wide variety of pop music, from 
reggae to hard rock to folk. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the bands that play here are A-league," said Dave Hewitt, who books 
entertainment at Pelican's. "In the summer, the younger people come back from 
school and they want to see bands on the cutting edge. They don't want to drive 
all the way down to Hollywood, which is kind of scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled shows at the club, located at 24454 Calabasas Road, include the funk 
pop act Sublime on July 9; the all-woman hard-rock act (and Geffen recording 
artists) Phantom Blue on July 15; rockabilly from the Dave and Deke Combo on 
July 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is free Mondays and Wednesdays, and $5 all other nights. Call (818) 
222-1155. 
</P>
<P>
 At FM Station in North Hollywood, bands dress up in polyester and wigs for the 
'70s-themed "Boogie Nights" on Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at 11700 Victory Blvd., the club also features blues on Thursdays, and 
the usual rock mixture the rest of the week. Admission prices vary from $3 to 
$7, with Tuesday nights free. Call (818) 769-2220.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, live musicians continue to crowd area coffeehouses-turned music 
venues, from the Common Grounds in Northridge, to the Coffee Junction in 
Tarzana, to Bookgrinders in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Coffee Junction, co-owner and musician Sharon Bernson will herself play 
violin with the band Cornerstone on July 9 and 18. She will also perform 
original songs with singer-guitarist Kathy Crown on Aug. 11 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard," Bernson said of performing in her own club (co-owned by Linda 
Sherlin). "The hardest part is that if I perform by myself, I start worrying 
about people being seated and stuff like that. It gets crazy. That's why I 
don't do it that often." 
</P>
<P>
 At Bookgrinders, located at 13321 Burbank Blvd., jazzman Chris Blondal 
performs tonight; jazz guitarist Chris Standring plays Saturday; and jazz 
keyboardist Julie Homi performs an instrumental concert Aug. 11 and 25. 
Admission to all performances is free. For more information, call (818) 
988-4503. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Big Band Salute to Benny Goodman," with the Four Aces, the Four Lads, 
Gisele MacKenzie and others, will be presented Saturday at the Alex Theatre, 
216 N. Brand Blvd., in Glendale. Former Goodman vocalist Polly Podewell will 
also perform. Tickets are $21.50 to $24.50. For information, call (800)

Los Angeles concert appearance July 11. The American musician will play music 
by Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff and Copland with the Moscow Philharmonic, 
conducted by Vassily Sinaisky. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 12, the Los Angeles Philharmonic will be joined at the Bowl by 
conductor John Williams, violinist Itzak Perlman and singer Linda Ronstadt for 
an eclectic evening of music, from Tchaikovsky to Nelson Riddle's pop 
arrangements. For information on Bowl concerts, call (213) 850-2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greek Theatre is also presenting a variety of musical styles, including 
Foreigner and the Doobie Brothers on Aug. 2 and 8; country singer Alan Jackson 
on Aug. 3; and Al Jarreau, Joe Sample and Roberta Flack on Aug. 6 and 7. For

SUMMERTIME; THEATER; ROCKIN' THE HOUSE; 'THE WHO'S TOMMY' AT THE UNIVERSAL 
AMPHITHEATRE LEADS THE LOCAL STAGE LINEUP. MANY VENUES ARE STILL REGROUPING 
AFTER JANUARY'S SHAKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

theater for The Times.

<P>
 In spite of the gradual decline in aftershocks after the January quake, 
there's still a lot of shaking going on in the San Fernando Valley theater 
community.  
</P>
<P>
 Some theaters are putting out a helping hand to their natural rivals, and the 
spirit of the "fabulous invalid," an especially appropriate nickname for the 
theater in this time and place, is not at all dampened. The show goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a number of theaters are quiet during the next two months, busy with 
community projects and planning their fall seasons, a wide variety of summer 
theater events is available. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest tremor probably will be caused by the Universal Amphitheatre's 
July 13-Aug. 14 run of Pete Townshend's "The Who's Tommy." This Des 
McAnuf-directed production with an oversize stage floor built in New York for 
this production, began its life at the La Jolla Playhouse and went on to 
Broadway, where it won five Tony awards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Originally scheduled to close July 31, the show's the immense ticket demand 
has brought about the two-week extension. This is the first time local 
audiences have had a chance to see McAnuf's re-creation (he also wrote the 
book) of The Who's rock classic. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the theaters most affected by the quake was Actors Alley, which was 
ready to open its first production in a new mid-size home at North Hollywood's 
El Portal Theatre on Jan. 21. El Portal was done in on the 17th. The company 
opened the play "The Audit" at L.A. Valley College, using the same space for 
its second production, James Thurber's "The Male Animal." 
</P>
<P>
 On July 13, with El Portal still being righted, Actors Alley will open its new 
season with a summer production of Jim Geoghan's "Light Sensitive" in an 
immense green and white tent erected on the Academy Plaza, at the intersection 
of Magnolia and Lankershim boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The play, directed by Everett Chambers, concerns a blind New York cabby who 
has drifted into alcohol and self-pity, until a Lighthouse for the Blind reader 
enters his life and turns it around. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Alley may be accused of loitering within tent, so to speak. The group's 
entire season will be staged at the same location, with Alan Ayckbourn's "Round 
and Round the Garden," directed by Marcia Rodd, beginning its under-the-canvas 
previews Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Another venue sadly affected by earthquake damage, American Renegade Theatre, 
is recovering in time to open Layce Gardner's "Under the Moon" on July 29 for a 
six-week run. The drama, set in the South of 1958, explains some of today's 
headlines by outlining the tale of a white mother whose daughter is seeing a 
young black man. The mother's anguished racism hides the fact that the 
daughter's father was black and is an attempt to keep the girl from making what 
the mother feels would be the same mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 When Renegade's sizable musical "Knockin' 'Em Dead" was displaced in the 
January shuffle, Ed Gaynes' West End Playhouse in Van Nuys opened its doors to 
the production, a good-neighbor gesture that has typified Valley theater in 
recent months. Unaffected by the quake, the West End forges ahead with a 
production of Deborah Shaw's "The Cosmic Pull," a psychological drama about a 
woman coming to terms with her best friend's imminent demise. Under Pamela 
Hall's direction, the production opens July 7 and will run through Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The always active NoHo district also will see an evening of two one-act 
comedies at the Limelight Playhouse: "Eight Minutes of Unpredictability" by 
Brett Pearson, and Nicole Montgomery's "There Is No Happy Medium," under the 
umbrella title of "An Evening of Hostility," playing July 8 through Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Limelight honcho Dan Hirsch's other North Hollywood space, the NoHo 
Studios, J. Tom Graham's hit comedy about matrimony in Texas, "For Marrieds 
Only," will have its West Coast premiere Aug. 5, playing through Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Out west, in Topanga Canyon, Will Geer's Theatricum Botanicum, probably the 
area's busiest summer theater arena, will end its run of "Macbeth" on July 22. 
In the group's usual true repertory style, a new English translation of 
Moliere's "Educated Women" opens July 3 and runs through Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to repeat the success of last season's critically acclaimed production 
of Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire," that production's director, 
Heidi Davis, will be staging Williams' "The Glass Menagerie," with Ellen Geer 
as the tyrannical Amanda. "Menagerie" will open Aug. 13 and play through Sept.

 The Fourth of July is America's best holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fourth is parades and red, white and blue bunting draped from everything 
that will hold it.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fourth is picnics and bands and hot dogs. But, most of all, the Fourth is 
fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can deny the uniquely American pleasure of consuming a hot dog and a cold 
drink, basking in a rocket's red glare while bombs are bursting in air?  
</P>
<P>
 These are the nearby places on the Pacific Rim where you can do just that:

 Temperatures are heating up, but rather than ducking inside, check out the 
offerings that are going on in the great outdoors. For entertainment under the 
sun -- and occasionally under the stars -- local venues offer everything from 
hikes to hoedowns, disco to mariachi, classical concerts to classic films.

 Michael Marks from the Santa Clarita Parks Recreation and Community Services 
Department says the fifth season of that city's summer concert series is more 
eclectic than ever. Organizers for all the local outdoor concerts encourage 
members to bring a picnic and a blanket because most of the seating is on the 
grass. Gail Stewart of the Burbank Park and Recreation Department suggests 
tickets be reserved for the large popular concerts planned this summer at the 
Starlight Bowl.

SUMMERTIME; BEACHES; OVER THE MOUNTAINS, ACROSS THE SAND TO THE OCEAN THEY GO, 
EVEN IF THEY ARE LANDLOCKED VALLEY DWELLERS. THEY ALL HAVE THEIR FAVORITES, TOO 
. . . BEST SURF . . . BEST DIVING . . . OR MAYBE JUST BEST FOR HANGING OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sea breezes may stop short at the Santa Monica Mountains but, come summer, San 
Fernando Valley dwellers still catch the allure, if not the scent, of the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley teen-agers, for example, have long made Zuma Beach their hangout. One 
of Southern California's oldest surf shops is Val Surf & Sport. And Willie 
Morris, a top-ranked professional surfer in the mid-1980s, hailed from the 
decidedly dry Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Landlocked as it may be, the Valley is closer to the beach than many other 
areas of the city. Malibu and Zuma are just a half-hour's drive from Van Nuys. 
A pleasant cruise over Topanga Canyon Boulevard lands West Valley residents at 
the coast in less time. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is a quick guide to Valley-convenient beaches, beginning at the 
intersection of Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Pacific Coast Highway and moving 
north. BEST SURFING: Beach at Malibu Point and Topanga State Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Few surfing spots on the planet boast the orderly, machine-perfect waves that 
curl across this point toward the Malibu Pier. This is a hallowed spot, the 
former stomping grounds of the legendary 1960s surfer Mickey Dora. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfrider is actually divided into three areas. The northernmost area, or 
third point, offers a variety of waves. Second point runs fast and furious, 
well-suited for the acrobatics of surfers who prefer agile short boards. At 
first point, long-boarders can tuck into a trim and ride all the way to the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
 This beach also can provide the worst surfing. On a warm summer day when a 
south swell gets cranking, the waves can be as crowded as Santa Monica Freeway 
at rush hour. And the surfers are surly. 
</P>
<P>
 So beginners are advised to seek less-crowded spots beginning at Topanga State 
Beach and heading north to the county line. 
</P>
<P>
 But for experienced surfers -- and surf watchers -- Surfrider is the place. 
BEST FOR SCUBA DIVING: Point Dume State Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A tough one. The north county is hardly a mecca for coastal sea life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just not a lot out there," said Steve Vogel, the education curator at 
the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro. "It is mostly sandy bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Divers prefer a rocky sea floor. That is where the vegetation grows, and fish 
and other interesting sea creatures feed. 
</P>
<P>
 At Point Dume, such conditions exist in scattered patches that are 
identifiable by the beds of kelp that rise to the surface of the water. Similar 
spots are present at Malibu and Leo Carrillo. Divers need to be choosy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vogel sees one advantage to diving on these beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good place to start," he said, "if only because there are lifeguards." 
BEST FOR TEENS: Beach Park 
</P>
<P>
 "Between lifeguard towers 6 and 7 -- that's the hip section," said Allan 
Peters, 18, of Reseda. "This is where the kids hang out. It's a very social 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 This broad, flat beach allows plenty of room for strolling and volleyball and 
whatever else teen-agers do at the beach. Fast-food stands supply the basic 
food groups -- burgers, chips and soda. And the waves come in strong enough for 
bodysurfing. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a family section, down by tower 5, but that's dullsville. This is 
a spot for the young. 
</P>
<P>
 "You come here to see people you know," Peters explained. "It's like a fashion 
show where we see who can wear the least clothes and get away with it." BEST 
FOR PRIVACY: Westward and the Northern State Beaches 
</P>
<P>
 A short walk south of Zuma lies Westward beach. Out of sight and out of mind, 
it tends to run empty along a row of cliffs leading to Point Dume. It is 
tailor-made for romantic strolls, with rarely more than a dozen people dotting 
the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more private are a trio of beaches to the north. El Pescador, La Piedra 
and El Matador state beaches nestle beneath the bluffs along Pacific Coast 
Highway. If you can find your way to these spots, you're not likely to bump 
into many others. BEST TIDE POOLS: Leo Carrillo State Beach 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see things that you don't see a few miles south," explained Vogel of 
the aquarium. "The water is colder and it's a bit farther from L.A. The coast 
is starting to look a little like Central California." 
</P>
<P>
 So, at low tide, observant beach-goers can spot sea hares, starfish and a 
variety of seaweed including the tall, fronded sea palm. Lobsters and octopuses 
also roam close to this stretch of rocky shore. As a bonus, the park rangers 
and lifeguards at Leo Carrillo know their marine life. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very informative," Vogel said. 
</P>
<P>
 But tide-pool watching requires patience. On a recent afternoon, clusters of 
kids on a field trip from the Valley Alternative School in Van Nuys weren't 
having much luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I found was a clam shell," said one of the students. "And it isn't even 
alive." BEST FOR BARBECUES: Sycamore Cove 
</P>
<P>
 Located in Point Mugu State Park, several miles beyond the Los Angeles County 
line, this is the only beach close to the Valley that allows barbecuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees grow along the edge of a sandy stretch, providing shade for a handful of 
grills and picnic tables. The wooded Sycamore Canyon lies just across the 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go for a hike and then come back to the beach and make sandcastles," 
said Misty Ysais, who came with her husband and two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Sycamore Cove is open from 8 a.m. to sunset, so there is plenty of time for a 
full day's activities. SAFEST FOR KIDS: A Toss-Up 
</P>
<P>
 Another tough one. Beaches in the north county face south and west, which 
means that during the summer months they catch the brunt of seasonal storms 
that rage south of the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu, for instance, is likely to have big waves and strong currents from 
June through August. Dan Blocker State Beach, a few miles north, is relatively 
calmer but has its bad days as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every beach will have its times when it's safe and it's not so safe," said 
Lt. Steve Wood, a Los Angeles County lifeguard. "The point we try to get across 
is for people to swim near a manned lifeguard tower." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood suggests that beach-goers check with lifeguards before diving into the 
water. "The lifeguards will be happy to tell you if it's a safe place to swim," 
the lieutenant said. Surf Beckons

SUMMERTIME; TAKING NATURE IN STRIDE; YOU AND YOUR FAMILY CAN ESCAPE THE CITY BY 
JOINING A VARIETY OF HIKES, WALKING TOURS AND WILDLIFE PROGRAMS.

<P>
 Are the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers the only rangers your kids know? Is 
retrieving the newspaper from the driveway your primary outdoor activity? Is 
stepping over a snail your most recent wildlife encounter? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's time for you and your family to get back to nature. "The outdoors 
is the perfect setting to spend leisure time," said Brad Childs, executive 
director of the Wilderness Institute, an Agoura Hills environmental 
organization. "You get into the fresh air and trees, away from noise, 
congestion and long lines. It's relaxing, stress-reducing, therapeutic and 
educational." 
</P>
<P>
 Even very young children can benefit from a day in the wilderness, according 
to Janeen Parker, a spokeswoman for the William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom, 
which holds family walks at Franklin Canyon. "We try to get parents to bring 
their kids as early as possible, so the child grows up with love and respect 
for the natural world. Kids who start early feel more comfortable interacting 
with animals in ways that won't hurt the child -- or the animal." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who want to commune with nature in a structured, safe setting can choose 
from a variety of hikes and programs geared to people of all ages and 
abilities. Here are some summer outings that will give you and your family a 
chance to stretch your legs, smell the sage and watch the wildlife: HIKES 
</P>
<P>
 You can have your hash browns and hike them off, too. Through Sept. 11, the 
lodge at Camp Hollywoodland in Griffith Park serves an all-you-can-eat Sunday 
brunch, followed by ranger-led hikes. Brunch is served from 8:30 to 11 a.m. 
Easy nature walks begin at 10 a.m., strenuous hikes at 11 a.m. Breakfast is $6 
for adults, $4.50 for children under 12. Hikes are free. Camp Hollywoodland is 
at 3200 Canyon Drive in Hollywood. Call (213) 467-7193. 
</P>
<P>
 If a lavish brunch isn't your idea of getting back to nature, how about 
dandelions for breakfast? The Wilderness Institute holds a "Wild Edibles" hike 
in the Santa Monica Mountains from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. July 2. You'll find, 
prepare, cook -- and eat -- wild plants. $15, or $50 per family of four. Call 
(818) 991-7327. 
</P>
<P>
 Short and easy hikes for families with infants, toddlers and preschoolers are 
held in parks throughout Southern California by Nursery Nature Walks. Children 
learn about animals, sniff plants, touch trees and listen to the birds. Walks 
-- many stroller-accessible -- are held daily. A donation of $5 per family is 
requested, and reservations are required. Call (310) 364-3591. 
</P>
<P>
 The William O. Douglas Outdoor Classroom sponsors a variety of day and evening 
hikes at Franklin Canyon Ranch. Depending on which walk they select, hikers can 
bird-watch, try their hand at nature photography, practice tai chi or learn 
Native American ways. Walks are free, but some require reservations. The ranch 
is at 2600 Franklin Canyon in Beverly Hills. Call (310) 858-3090. WILDLIFE 
</P>
<P>
 Tortoises, owls, possums, snakes, rats, lizards and hawks are part of the 
animal show at 1 p.m. Saturdays at the Placerita Canyon Nature Center. An 11 
a.m. nature hike precedes the presentations. Free (except for $3 parking). The

</P>
<P>
 Walking tours of the Wildlife Waystation, a refuge for ill, injured and 
orphaned animals, start at 10 a.m. the first and third Sunday of each month. 
Lions and tigers and bears -- as well as leopards, jaguars, birds, reptiles and 
primates -- are among the caged menagerie. After the tour, visitors can feed 
ponies, sheep and bunnies at the on-site petting zoo. Reservations are 
required. $4.50 adults, $2 children 2 to 11. The compound is at 14831 Little 
Tujunga Canyon Road in the Angeles National Forest. Call (818) 899-5201. 
</P>
<P>

SUMMERTIME; CLUB SCENE: SPIRALWEST DOESN'T SKIP A BEAT 
</P>

 SpiralWest takes over the Country Club in Reseda each Thursday night during 
the summer, and turns it into a club aimed at teen-agers from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m., 
with a $10 cover charge. Imagine a huge high school dance without the math 
teacher chaperon. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: A light show surrounds dancers in the theater-like club, with a 
bar, lots of tables, a stage beyond the dance floor and a balcony with two pool 
tables and a bar. The two bars in the club don't sell alcohol, but offer soft 
drinks, water and some food. Despite the crowd's young age, the club fills with 
as much cigarette smoke as any over-21 club. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: The age ranges from 13 to 18, with the average hovering at 16. 
Dress is casual, mostly jeans, oversized and tight. A SpiralWest dress code is 
enforced -- shirts must be tucked in and no hats (except SpiralWest's) allowed. 
"Basically, dress to impress. If you look like you're a gangbanger, you're out. 
But we don't assume everyone is, because not all kids are bad," said Scott 
Nemes, 20, co-owner of SpiralWest. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MUSIC: DJ Bozzo keeps the several hundred club-goers dancing with rap, 
retro, disco, hip-hop and house. Artists include Anita Ward, Beastie Boys, Salt 
'N' Pepa, Us3, Ace of Base and A Tribe called Quest. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: The promoters make sure the club is safe, security is tight and 
noticeable. "It's the hippest club in the Valley because it's an all-age 
group," said Avi Zeulun, 17, of Grant High School, "There are no guns, it's 
just happening."  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel more secure here than the last place," said Nannette Lyons, a 
17-year-old Granada Hills High School student, referring to the original 
SpiralWest venue in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: Regulars said the new location doesn't measure up to the former club. 
"I like the other place on Ventura better; it was more happening," said 
Kristina Kovacs, 17, a student at Granada Hills High School. "The dance floor 
was smaller, but people were dancing more." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft High School student Jennifer Mintz, 16, added: "The crowd was a little 
more energetic there. Here, the girls are dancing and the guys are just 
standing around checking it out."  
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: "Oh my God, we stayed out till 2:30 last night," said one girl to 
her group of friends. "What are we gonna do when summer school starts?" 
</P>
<P>
 "If I take you guys where you wanna go, will you leave me alone?" said a girl 
who had the misfortune of being the only person who drives in her group.

 Generations would have starved were it not for the humble sandwich, two pieces 
of bread thrown together with whatever we found to stick in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Late 20th-Century America has elevated the sandwich to an art form. It is hard 
to believe the rest of the world once turned up a collective snoot at the 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiches today represent many countries and cultures -- France, Italy, even 
China. I've been busy eating sandwiches in various parts of the San Fernando 
Valley and have come up with 10 personal favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 There are too many sandwich shops and restaurants out there for me to 
pronounce this a 10 best list, but rest assured that all these candidates, in 
their individual ways, are worth a detour. If you have favorites of your own, 
please drop me a line. I'm always ready to eat another good sandwich. 1. THE 
BURGER 
</P>
<P>
 Hamburgers are without a doubt our most popular sandwich. The Valley is rich 
in terrific burgers: In-N-Out Burger (with a handful of Valley locations); any 
number of small neighborhood stands; and upscale, high-priced burgers to be had 
in such tony restaurants as Bistro Garden at Coldwater. 
</P>
<P>
 To join this august company, I'm nominating the original oak-wood grilled 
burger at the wonderful Crocodile Cafe, available in Glendale and now in the 
chain's new Burbank store. This is a thick (one-third of a pound), smoky burger 
perfumed with hardwood, served on a Good Stuff sesame-seed bun. Have it topped 
with Cheddar cheese and grilled onions at no extra charge. It's a juicy, 
complex burger, and it comes with great curly French fries. Further, the 
cheery, faintly southwestern-themed Crocodile Cafe is a pleasant place to dine. 
</P>
<P>
 Crocodile Cafe, 626 N. Central Ave., Glendale, (818) 241-1114, also 201 N. San 
Fernando Blvd., Burbank, (818) 843-7999. Oakwood burger, 5.95. 2. THE TORTA 
</P>
<P>
 The modest Dos Arbolitos, a Mexican food fest crammed into what looks no 
bigger than a converted Fotomat, may be the best place in the Valley to eat 
anything Mexican. Tortas is Mexican Spanish for sandwiches, in this case 
overstuffed slices of puffy, doughy grilled Mexican bollilos (rolls). They are 
superb, and there is no better sandwich value between here and Veracruz. 
</P>
<P>
 The eccentric chef Yayo will make you any type of torta you can dream up, but 
my runaway favorite is torta de barbacoa (pit barbecue) -- smoked, spiced, 
shredded pork, finished on a spit. This sandwich has lots of chopped cilantro, 
cabbage, tomatoes and onions to fill it out, and the spicy sauce literally runs 
out the sides as you bite in. If you want to turn up the heat, ask the waitress 
for a cupful of the chef's fiery, chunky salsa, the Valley's most intense. 
</P>
<P>
 Dos Arbolitos, 16208 Parthenia St., North Hills, (818) 891-6661. Torta de 
barbacoa, $3. 3. THE FALAFEL 
</P>
<P>
 Falafel is the most popular snack food in the Middle East, jammed with spiced, 
deep-fried balls of mashed garbanzo beans, parsley and other spices. In Israel, 
falafel are nothing short of a national pastime, eaten with tahini (sesame 
sauce) inside steamy hot pockets of pita bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Shula Amrani is chief cook at Tiberias, our top Israeli restaurant, and she 
serves the best falafel I know of. You'll get four perfectly golden and crisp 
orbs inside a pita pocket with salad and tahini. But if you ask her to add a 
little of her khouk (a grainy red hot sauce), the sandwich takes on added 
complexity. Tiberias has dark, smoky homemade pickles, briny, crisp one,as well 
as wonderful preserved turnips, beet pink with a mild, bitter aftertaste. Come 
for lunch, by the way, if you want this particular sandwich. The restaurant 
does not serve it during the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiberias, 18046 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 343-3705. Falafel sandwich, 
$2.95. 4. THE BRISKET 
</P>
<P>
 Barbecue in Texas is synonymous with beef brisket, tender, flaky meat slow 
smoked over hickory wood and flavored with a hot, sweet sauce redolent of 
cumin. At the wood and vinyl truck stop Dr. Hogly Wogly's Tyler Texas BBQ, the 
Valley's best place for smoked meat of any kind, brisket is about the only 
sandwich they don't have on their menu. Here's how to do it: 
</P>
<P>
 For $8, order the a la carte brisket, an enormous plate of the stuff served 
only with barbecue sauce. This is soft, tender brisket that falls apart when 
poked, and it is deliciously smoky and herbal. Then simply ask for a side of 
the house bread, a yeasty country white bread served in small double loaves, 
and put the sandwich together yourself. It's almost heaven, even if the two 
house barbecue sauces, mild and hot, are on the tame side. Side dishes like 
baked beans and potato salad are good, too, so you may just want to go ahead 
and order a brisket dinner for $10.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hogly Wogly's Tyler Texas BBQ, 8136 Sepulveda Blvd., Van Nuys, (818) 
782-2480. A la carte brisket, $8. 5. THE BLT 
</P>
<P>
 One of my favorite sandwiches growing up was a BLT, something most of us have 
made at home at one time or another. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino's Daily Grill serves a classic version of this homey sandwich, and it 
is as good as any I've tried. First off, the sandwich comes on enormous hunks 
of sourdough bread (you can substitute that for rye or white on request) baked 
for the restaurant by Pioneer Boulangerie of Santa Monica. A half-pound of 
crisp bacon must be in this sandwich, piled high with fresh iceberg lettuce, 
snappy slices of red tomato and a good bit of eggy mayonnaise.  
</P>
<P>
 Daily Grill, 16101 Ventura Blvd . , Encino, (818) 986-4111. BLT, $6.95. 6. THE 
MUSHROOM 
</P>
<P>
 I've often said that Studio City's Pinot Bistro and chef Octavio Becerra are 
two of the best things to happen to this area in recent years, and I stick by 
it. Whenever this restaurant creates a sandwich, expect something special. 
</P>
<P>
 The lunch menu changes weekly at Pinot. Look at the insert toward the bottom, 
and you will see something the restaurant calls its "metamorphosis menu," which 
contains, among other things, a noodle, fish and sandwich of the week. The 
sandwich might be anything -- smoked salmon with sun-dried tomatoes, prosciutto 
with goat cheese, whatever Becerra and his brigade dream up. But if you are 
lucky, you'll come the week he is doing one with those steaklike Portobello 
mushrooms. They are fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an opulent sandwich, the sort of thing that demands a flute of 
champagne or perhaps an earthy red wine to wash it down. Meaty slices of 
Portobello mushrooms come piled on a fresh, domed rosemary bun accompanied by 
grilled red onion, Valley greens and a rich, roasted garlic mayonnaise.  
</P>
<P>
 Pinot Bistro, 12969 Ventura Blvd., Studio City, (818) 990-0500, Pinot 
sandwich, $11.50. 7. THE COMBINATION 
</P>
<P>
 Factor's Famous Deli in Encino is a breezy, movie-star-themed clone of the 
original Factor's on West Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles. Until Art's reopens, 
it's where you'll find me whenever I'm in the mood for corned beef or pastrami. 
</P>
<P>
 You can have your corned beef and eat it too, if you have the stomach to order 
one of Factor's legendary combination sandwiches. I belly up to the gaudy No. 
9, a triple-decker consisting of corned beef, pastrami, tongue, Swiss cheese, 
Russian dressing, lettuce and tomato, all jammed between steamy slices of 
Factor's exemplary deli rye bread. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a huge portion, perhaps big enough to serve three at lunch, and it 
comes with sides of good coleslaw and potato salad. You'll also get all the 
half-sour pickles you can eat, a choice of mustards and, what I'd describe as a 
perverse joke, the option to substitute a reduced-fat cheese. Now that's what I 
call wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Factor's Famous Deli, 16348 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 386-2626. No. 9 
Combination, $9.95. 8. THE SUB 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo's is a top-notch Italian market, but it also serves terrific subs, the 
best around. They'll make any type of sub you request, grainy Italian sausage, 
ham and Swiss, Italian-style tuna, providing they have the raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The sub of choice here is a robust Italian cold-cut version, made on a French 
roll from Baccarat or, my preference, fresh mini-loaves of Italian bread from 
Italia bakery in Granada Hills (owned by a brother of the proprietor of 
Domingo's). 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo's brushes the bread with a delicious homemade dressing made from 
virgin olive oil and fresh herbs, then adds such piquant meats as thinly sliced 
capicolla, mortadella, provolone cheese and red roasted peppers. It's a soft 
sandwich with a yielding bite that must weigh a good pound and a half. And 
what's more, the cold cuts are always sliced to order, never pulled out of 
plastic wrap, as is the case with lesser sub makers throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo's, 17548 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 981-4466. Submarine sandwich, 
$4.25. 9. THE CUBAN 
</P>
<P>
 Encino's Versailles is the best known Cuban restaurant in the Valley, but I 
favor the food at Glendale's La Cubana, a drab stucco building with 
stained-glass-window panels that could pass, from the outside anyway, as a 
men's club somewhere in the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 The star dish is similar in spirit to a submarine sandwich. It's called 
Sandwich Cubano, and it is an entire meal for just $3.95. The sandwich is 
served warm, filled with thin sliced ham, lechon -- succulent roast pork -- cut 
equally thin, Swiss cheese, mustard, mayo and butter. The bread, in this case, 
is butter-grilled Cuban, a sweet, dry French baguette that goes perfectly with 
the meats inside. Ask for the sandwich with the restaurant's zippy homemade 
pickles, which the Cubans call a "media noche," because it makes such a perfect 
midnight snack. 
</P>
<P>
 La Cubana, 720 E. Colorado St., Glendale, (818) 243-4398. Sandwich Cubano, 
$3.95. 10. THE LOX 
</P>
<P>
 I was reared in a family that religiously consumed bagels, Philadelphia cream 
cheese and deliciously salty Nova lox every Sunday for breakfast. Taken warm 
with slices of Bermuda onion and, in particularly indulgent fashion, ripe 
tomato, the sandwich remains one of my favorite comfort foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent's Deli in Northridge gets bagels fresh daily -- about 10 different 
varieties -- from the very good Western Bagel Co. of Los Angeles. I have a 
particular weakness for the sandwich on a poppy seed bagel, but you get to name 
your own poison -- garlic, onion, rye, water, egg or whatever is on hand. The 
salmon is smoked troll king salmon, and it is hand cut. The cream cheese is 
from Newton's, double whipped on the premises, making for an extra light 
feeling biting in. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent's, 19565 Parthenia St., Northridge, (818) 349-9850. Bagel with lox and 
cream cheese, $7.45.

 Looking back on the summers of your childhood, what do you remember? Long days 
of crafts at summer camp, a family vacation, day after day at the beach? 
</P>
<P>
 You can give your children the opportunity to "remember when" by visiting area 
museums, which offer extensive summer programs, from a day of hip-hop at the 
Kidspace Museum to workshops on robots or rockets at the California Museum of 
Science and Industry. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, children will learn to cook like 
pioneers and make the sort of toys once played with in the American West, in 
keeping with the museum's philosophy to "provide a hands-on history 
experience," said Noel Toal, the museum's assistant director of education. 
</P>
<P>
 Not wild about the constant mess summer brings home? Take the kids to the Los 
Angeles Children's Museum, where they can burn energy building a structure of 
straws and paper clips. At the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum, there 
are weeklong workshops for children with a scientific bent. After exploring the 
real bugs and bones, imagine the tales they will tell. GENE AUTRY WESTERN

SUMMERTIME; TAKING A FLING AT FLY FISHING; A TRUNKLOAD OF GEAR, THE CASH TO 
AFFORD IT AND A LOT OF PATIENCE -- THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO GET HOOKED ON THE 
FASTEST-GROWING SPORT IN AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If you want to fill a bucket with trout this summer -- and who doesn't? -- 
just plunk a worm onto a hook and fling it into any area lake. Castaic. 
Casitas. Pyramid. Even that new swamp hole in the park in Encino will do. 
</P>
<P>
 And then wait. And wait. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the fishing equivalent of being dead, without your relatives being gouged 
by funeral expenses and you having the eternal guilt of sending six close 
friends to a chiropractor with back problems from lugging you to the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you want to do some real fishing this summer, then arm yourself with 
the latest fly-fishing gear. First, though, a word of caution. Fly-fishing can 
get stunningly expensive. And so, we offer a suggestion: We certainly do not 
recommend that you knock off a Brink's truck to be able to afford the $100 to 
$500 graphite rods, the dazzling reels, the $40 fly line and the trunkload of 
other gear you'll need. Better to let your nincompoop brother-in-law Elston 
pull off the actual heist; you can be the wheel man. 
</P>
<P>
 That done -- and hopefully you didn't get caught, because the quality 
fly-fishing experiences available at Folsom have nearly vanished; the prison 
tackle shop, for example, has recently been converted to a weight-lifting room 
-- let's go fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, let's try to convince a trout in, let's say, nearby Piru Creek, 
that a tiny hook covered with fur and feathers floating over his head would 
make a fine snack. This quest has become the fastest-growing sport in America 
in the past 10 years. As proof, surveys conducted during the World Cup soccer 
matches show that nearly all of the 16 billion people who filled the Rose Bowl 
actually came to the United States to buy fly rods and went to the soccer games 
on a whim. 
</P>
<P>
 Really. 
</P>
<P>
 And, just like a man in a wide-eyed, frantic search for a bathroom, it all 
begins with the fly. This can be overwhelming to the novice. There are hundreds 
of varieties of flies, from dry flies (they float) to streamer flies (they look 
like tiny fish) to nymphs (they're nice to have along when the fish aren't 
biting; OK, just kidding). Nymphs are flies fished deep, imitating the emerging 
form of an insect. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the seemingly endless variety of flies have their place in fly fishing. 
That place, unfortunately, is often the tip of the angler's nose, which -- and 
this is not just a theory -- causes a grown man to hop up and down, shrieking 
and yelling bad words. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the needle-sharp point of the hook doesn't always embed itself in 
the fly angler's nose. The ears are also popular targets. The reason for this 
is called "the presentation," which basically involves waving a 9-foot rod and 
30 feet of line with above-mentioned sharp hook attached madly over your head 
in brisk winds until you can somehow lay the whole mess down on the water, or 
anywhere else it might decide to stop. See nose . 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, if all the shrieking and hopping and swearing hasn't startled 
the fish -- and it will -- the fly angler lets the fly drift in the current, 
waiting for a trout to snatch it. When the fish does take the fly, the general 
idea -- and this comes from years spent not only observing but of actually 
doing it -- is to yelp sharply and jerk the rod and fly violently backward, 
yanking the fly away from the hungry, frightened fish. 
</P>
<P>
 These fish are then referred to as "finicky." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if the trout is faster than the fly fisherman and hooks itself before the 
human is able to rip the fly away from him -- and believe me, it can happen; 
rumor has it that a man named Pete in Montana experienced this during the Ford 
Administration -- the next thing the fly angler does is to break the line. It's 
most commonly accomplished by tugging on the line with roughly the same force 
suggested for wrenching the Queen Mary's anchor from the mud. If that doesn't 
work, a more advanced technique is employed. This involves giving the fish just 
the right amount of slack line so he can wrap it around a rock and break it. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish that are hooked, even briefly, before the fly fisherman snaps the line 
are known as "huge" fish. 
</P>
<P>
 OK. Now you have the basics. And you're wondering, "Where can I, a dazzling 
urbanite, go to yank fake flies away from hungry trout?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you can go to Piru Creek, near the town of Castaic. Or a few of the tiny 
creeks in Los Padres National Forest in Ventura County. Or the Angeles National 
Forest above San Bernardino. Or you can go to Montana or Colorado or even 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 See, that's the greatest thing about fly fishing. No matter how close, no 
matter how far, you still have about the same chance of actually catching a 
trout as you do of catching Al Gore dismantling a party with a series of 
outrageous, off-color jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 And, surprising as this may sound, fly fishing isn't for everybody. Why, just 
a few years ago, a group of men who believe trout look best with lemon wedges 
on them, men apparently frustrated by the complexities of fly fishing -- or the 
constant pain in their noses -- strung a gill net across Piru Creek, from bank 
to bank. They snared hundreds of small trout, dragged them onto the bank and 
whacked them dead with sawed-off mop handles. 
</P>
<P>
 They were arrested, of course. Because not only is a thing like that illegal, 
well, it's just not very sporting, either.

SUMMERTIME; RESTAURANT REVIEW; IT'S HIT OR MISS AT RAVIOLI'S; INDULGE IN 
ANTIPASTI, SALADS AND SOUPS BECAUSE OTHER DISHES SUFFER FROM EXCESSIVE SAUCES 
AND TOPPINGS.

 Ravioli's owner seemed almost contrite. He had come over to our table to 
apologize for having run out of balsamic vinegar pork chops and Florentine 
beefsteak, two of the more delicious-sounding items on his menu. "I'm in the 
process of changing butchers," he told us. "Try the veal piccata instead," he 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 We did, and wished we had waited for the new butcher. Ravioli's name implies 
that you have the chance to order lots of pasta at this restaurant, and take it 
from me, that's a chance you should probably take. Pastas, especially the 
various ravioli preparations on this menu, are tasty. 
</P>
<P>
 This airy place is a converted Reuben's, with a style I'd describe as 
comfortably sterile. The white paneled walls showcase an array of neutrally 
decorative posters, just like ones commercial designers use in hotel dining 
rooms. There's plenty of brick here, an exposed kitchen that gleams with brass 
and steel, a nice, earthy tile floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Diners have a choice of several areas in which to sit, even if one does look 
pretty much like the other. One dining area affords a view of the kitchen and 
pizza oven. Another is hidden toward the back of the building, away from most 
of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceedings get off to a robust start. The waiters bring a basket filled with 
squares of steamy focaccia bread, then pour balsamic vinegar and a yellowish 
olive oil into a glass bowl, so that you can dip. The antipasti, salads and 
soups offer a few things you won't see on just any suburban Italian menu. I'd 
advise you to indulge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravioli fritti are crunchy, golden, deep-fried cheese ravioli, sitting atop a 
creamy tomato sauce. They make a great snack. Papa al pomodoro might be the 
restaurant's best dish. This Tuscan soup is a hearty, satisfying bowlful of 
fresh tomatoes, herbs and vegetable stock, in which old bread has been allowed 
to soak overnight. It is amazing just how good this simple dish can be, even in 
the hands of an average chef. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpaccio is fine, too, though oddly dry. Most restaurants dribble a little 
olive oil onto this appetizer of raw beef sliced razor thin, to complement the 
capers and shaved Parmesan cheese that make it so savory. Maybe the kitchen had 
a lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravioli's bruschetta is tasty enough, though, in a generic way. The rounds of 
toasted filone bread are smothered with checca (chopped tomatoes and basil), 
maybe even smothered to death. Like most of our Italian restaurants, this one 
does not hold back on the sauces and toppings. I wish they would. 
</P>
<P>
 The pizzas are inconsistent, the pastas less so, though there's some of that 
overkill in the sauce department. The classic pizza Margherita -- topped with 
tomato, basil, mozzarella and a touch of oregano -- is from the thin-crust 
school and clicks on all cylinders. The pizza quattro formaggio (four cheeses), 
however, sputters because of deadly excess. There is just too much cheese on 
this pie.  
</P>
<P>
 Good, properly chewy pastas range from a classic alla checca , with chopped 
tomatoes, garlic and basil, to a saucy, messy lasagna Bolognese, an enormous 
casserole dish brimming with a good meat ragu.  
</P>
<P>
 Ravioli is, understandably, where the restaurant gets creative, and the 
kitchen doesn't disappoint. Turtei con aragosta e ricotta is a bright red 
noodle pocket with a lobster, ricotta and leek filling -- wonderful, though 
they could do without all the creamy lemon sauce on top. 
</P>
<P>
 There are mezzaluna al salmone affumicato , crescent-shaped, black in color, 
with a delicate smoked-salmon filling. Ravioli di verdura con salsa di noci 
acida are spinach-filled ravioli in a rich pine-nut and walnut sauce, maybe the 
richest dish in the entire Italian repertory.  
</P>
<P>
 Grilled and main-dish specialties fall far short of outstanding. The veal 
piccata is thick and not so tender, sauteed in a gluey lemon and caper sauce. 
Grilled breast of chicken has an equally thick garlic sauce, served with good 
spinach and oily roasted potatoes. Italian sausage with good stewed peppers is 
probably the best of the meat dishes. They are the firm, grainy type, nicely 
browned. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts come from a huge glass pastry case by the front door. Later, 
white-chocolate-covered strawberry cake box, creamy Napoleon, chocolate-covered 
cannole and stiff, New York-style cheesecake will be brought to your table on a 
serving tray. None of them make a big impression, pretty to look at as they 
are. But you can count on the restaurant's moccacino , a well-crafted chocolate 
cappuccino. Too bad they haven't got chocolate ravioli. Where and When

 Vote totals -- An article June 17 incorrectly reported the vote on Measure Z, 
a proposed tax to support the Port Hueneme Police Department. Of those casting 
ballots, 64.7% voted in favor of the measure, 35.3% were opposed. The measure 
failed because it did not get the two-thirds majority required for adoption.

 Theater conference -- The Times reported incorrectly in Thursday's Calendar 
section that a conference July 9-10 at UCLA sponsored by the Audrey 
Skirball-Kenis Theatre and the S. Mark Taper Foundation will address the need 
for more mid-sized movie theaters. In fact, the conference addresses the need 
for more mid-sized theaters for stage productions.
