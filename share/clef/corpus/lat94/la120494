TV REVIEW; 'RED HOT + COOL' BLENDS JAZZ AND HIP-HOP ON PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no longer such a novelty, but the ongoing merger of jazz and hip-hop 
continues to offer dynamic alchemy in tonight's PBS special "Stolen Moments: 
Red Hot + Cool," which includes, among other things, six genre-bridging 
matchups between rappers and boppers filmed live at the Supper Club in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Digable Planets, meet Joe Sample; Me'Shell NdegeOcello, get funky with Joshua 
Redman; Last Poets, let Pharoah Sanders' people blow; etc. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hour itself is a hybrid too: part galvanizing concert special, part 
sober AIDS-awareness edutainment documentary. Between the two, don't expect any 
chat about the music itself -- beyond the Pharcyde's opening comment that "Jazz 
brings to hip-hop a spiritual plane." Both the music and discussion are 
urgently plague-centered. 
</P>
<P>
 In this intense focus, the special -- airing in tandem with a just-released 
GRP album featuring different performances -- differs from the previous four 
benefit projects put together by the Red Hot Organization (the Cole Porter 
tribute "Red Hot + Blue," "Red Hot + Dance," "No Alternative" and the recent 
"Red Hot + Country"). Here, nearly all the lyrics are in-your-face AIDS-themed, 
which is appropriate given a medium that's more message than massage, although 
the shortage of lyrical levity undoubtedly narrows what could've had mass 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The best non-musical segments involve average HIV-positive folks of color 
commenting on their predicaments in bits that are brief but poignant. Less 
engaging are the moments when a couple of the young hip-hoppers resort to the 
ever-popular conspiracy theory to explain away what's too horrible to explain: 
"They don't want to cure the disease," says a member of Digable Planets, "they 
made it." He also offers the rather arguable theory that African Americans have 
been reluctant to use condoms because condoms are manufactured by the 
government. Huh? 
</P>
<P>
 It's up to black author and historian Cornel West to offer some token balance 
to the Planets' otherwise uncontested rambling. Lack of equilibrium and 
unsupported agitprop aside, the sense of exigency in disproportionately 
afflicted minority communities does ring through as intended. 
</P>
<P>
 And the performances, although sometimes crude (including a tasteless slap by 
the Last Poets at Diana Ross), have been excitingly filmed, thanks largely to 
music-video-vet photographer Kevin Kerslake. The kinetic but not hyperkinetic 
camera work and editing put you right on stage and also, almost, on that other 
plane the Pharcyde talks about. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool" airs at 11 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28.

SEASON'S READINGS; EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES; IN THIS SEASON OF SUMPTUOUSNESS, A 
REMINDER THAT THE GOODS ARE NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED; MATERIAL WORLD, A GLOBAL 
FAMILY PORTRAIT BY PETER MENZEL , (SIERRA CLUB BOOKS: $30; 256 PP.)

<P>
 Everything about this time of year drives a person to disgust or despair over 
the amount of stuff we all have -- and by stuff I mean material possessions, 
not mental baggage. What to offer as a gift to the person who already owns 
every item known to man? (A donation card? Don't you hate getting those notices 
yourself? Don't you wish people would give to charities in silence?) How to 
keep from wincing at "God bless you, Merry Christmas" from the panhandler as 
you drive away in your warm car? How to make a little space in the closet for 
visiting relatives? Can Goodwill come collect before the holidays? How can you 
own so many towels and have none that are presentable?  
</P>
<P>
 Now imagine that a photographer rings your doorbell and says: "I would like 
you to drag everything you own out of your house and arrange it on your front 
lawn, so I can shoot a picture of it. Then we'll make a list of your 
possessions -- would you be so good as to tell me the one item you value the 
most? -- and we'll print it in a book about what people own in different 
societies all over the world. Oh, you'll have to pose in the picture, too. Just 
try to look normal and ignore the moving crew, please." 
</P>
<P>
 Would you scream and slam the door shut? Fortunately, enough people accepted 
this lunatic proposition that Peter Menzel, genius of the project he calls 
"Material World," could put together a book that compares the worldly wealth of 
30 families in as many countries. His photographers fanned out over the globe, 
from Iceland to Africa, Mongolia to Mexico, to spend a week with each family 
documenting their daily lives. The week's visit would culminate in "The Big 
Picture," the portrait of the entire household: people, possessions, pets, 
everything the family considered its material wealth.  
</P>
<P>
 The method of the project, which was funded by organizations such as the World 
Bank and the United Nations, was to seek "typical" families in each country. In 
addition to the itemized list of the family's possessions, each section 
includes statistics about the family (how many members, size of house, length 
of work week, percentage of income spent on food, etc.) and about the general 
population of the country (density, fertility rate, life expectancy, rank of 
affluence among the members of the U.N.). 
</P>
<P>
 The set of Big Pictures is the heart of the book, and they are endlessly 
fascinating. Besides the curiosity factor, these include some photo gems. The 
portrait of the Kuwaiti family is perhaps the most spectacular, an aerial shot 
taken at sunset with the city lights coming on behind them and a pink glow 
illuminating their possessions grouped by room on rich rugs laid out on the 
sand, ending with four cars and a 45-foot sofa.  
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli family, in order to be seen outside their house, is hoisted by 
crane to balance on a platform outside their fourth-floor apartment with all 
their possessions -- including their car. The neighbors gawking up at this 
procedure add a nice detail, and incidentally provide a small sidelight on the 
community this family lives in. Few of the other portraits include outsiders -- 
with the notable exception of the Bosnian family, which poses outside their 
heavily damaged building guarded by two United Nations soldiers.  
</P>
<P>
 On the poor end of the spectrum -- Uzbekistan, Ethiopia, Guatemala -- you scan 
the picture for what is there and what is missing. (Those Uzbek quilts and rugs 
are spectacular, and would cost a fortune here, but that's about all the family 
does own.) And there is also something curiously missing on the rich end of the 
spectrum: junk. Yes, the Texans have a wallful of family portraits on display, 
and a shelf of stuffed animals. But where are the masses of rubber bands and 
bits of string? The jars of condiments used once and forgotten? The broken 
garden shears? The not-yet-discarded tennis shoes? The leftover tile from the 
kitchen remodel? The more stuff a family owns, the less junk they bothered to 
put on display. Only the Chinese family appears not to have had the services of 
the Architectural Digest house-cleaning crew before the shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 The family sections are punctuated occasionally by photo spreads of global 
comparisons: meals of the world, toilets of the world. The food segment mostly 
demonstrates that in between plum exotic assignments like this one 
photographers probably make their living shooting advertisements; these meals 
are improbably and uniformly appetizing. The toilets, on the other hand, are 
not.  
</P>
<P>
 A third set of comparison photos is entitled "televisions of the world." We 
know that everyone in the world gets CNN, so we're not surprised that TVs are 
everywhere, even in the portable Mongolian home. The few households represented 
here that do not have television usually have radio instead -- to keep in touch 
with soccer, but that should not surprise us, either, after last summer's World 
Cup education.  
</P>
<P>
 While the ubiquitousness of the media surprises no one any more, there are 
more subtle shocks of the familiar, and this is where the book's humanity works 
its deepest magic. To my urban, North American mind, the almost entirely 
handmade world of the Natomo family in Mali -- baked mud walls, wooden 
utensils, hand-knotted fishing nets -- is exotic and incomprehensible. This 
family includes on its slender list of possessions a broken clay pot. Is this 
still a useful possession, I wonder? Why not throw it away? But also on their 
list I find an item that offers me a glimmer of familiarity: a plastic washtub. 
In that negligible plastic item -- which, after all, needs to be purchased 
somewhere -- I can suddenly read the familiar decision-making about household 
details: Do I really need another tub, or can I scrub the old one and make do 
until next spring? That gives me a greater feeling of connection with the wife 
in this family -- with the two wives, actually -- than the less surprising 
knowledge that their husband, like mine, spends his free afternoons with his 
ear bent to the ballgame.  
</P>
<P>
 What is not answered in these pages is the question of happiness. Are people 
with more stuff happier? Are people with less stuff happier? There is in the 
end no Big Picture here, just glimpses at stray bits of facts from odd angles. 
But there is enough to set anyone's mind wandering over the issues of material 
possession. And who knows? -- perhaps the monk, the last family member on the 
right in the Bhutan photo, will inspire someone to give up the Land Rover and 
home entertainment center. But then, that monk probably came to visit with the 
family just while Peter Menzel's crew was there; after all, everyone the world 
round values entertainment. Maybe the real wisdom, then, is not to be too 
attached to anything . . . even to one's distaste for wealth? *

SEASON'S READINGS; OTHER WORLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM PARKS, Tim Parks' most recent book is Goodness: A Novel (Grove 
Atlantic). He is also the author of Italian Neighbors: Or a Lapsed Anglo-Saxon 
in Verona (also Grove-Atlantic). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was just back from one of the world's longest and most famous expeditions. 
He'd seen it all: the deaths of the heroes, the fall of Troy. At home, he trod 
the purple of a royal welcome, but shook his head: "The mortal cannot go 
fearless through these many-coloured beauties," he said, or at least that's how 
Aeschylus' version has it. Sure enough, a few moments later his wife was axing 
him to death. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But Agamemnon was wrong. You can go fearless through those beauties, or watch 
other people going through them. You can see handsome Vietnamese children 
crossing dangerous rivers on nothing more than an elegant tracery of bamboo 
poles suspended 20 feet above. You can watch an Israeli teacher toting a 
machine gun as he takes a group of little girls on a spring hike along the 
Jordan. You can admire a Bombay prostitute as she giggles in her shack, 
beautiful as Helen, though unlikely to be launching any ships (the photographer 
records a blind beggar stumbling by, a dirty yellow grating, then passes on). 
Or you can see the smiling faces of the Challenger crew and the explosion that 
blew them to bits a few moments later. That was the trip you don't need to envy 
anybody. And in the bizarre royal palaces of India, the villas of Tuscany, the 
stately homes of London and of Dublin, you can see how other generations before 
us enjoyed contemplating other images of life's many-colored beauties and 
dangers. Frescoed horses seem to explode from Cinquecento ceiling for the rape 
of young Persephone. In the Rajput fort a Kota, princess and maharajah ride 
after a great black boar in the center of a mural that whirls with boats and 
elephants and wrestlers and dancers and. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You're looking at the pick of the new photo-books out for Christmas. They can 
take you anywhere, show you anything, with no risk whatsoever, unless perhaps 
to your bank balance. But in return for your 40 or 50 or 90 dollars, the 
quality of these books -- their print and design and paper -- is superb. And 
they give you a sense of quiet contemplative control you will never get from TV 
or video. You can touch the pages' grainy or glossy surfaces, examine them 
under different lights, savor their extraordinary colors, meditate on other 
lands, other lives. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the crop are better than others. The Smithsonian Institute's huge 
history of space exploration contrives to be at once lavish and dull, packed 
with pictures you've seen before and tedious reflections of the value-for-money 
conundrum and NASA's approach to the press. How much more rich and exotic are 
the human scenes of Rick Smolan's Passage to Vietnam: a girl sitting on a 
buffalo under heavy rain, a group of half-naked fishermen walking through the 
surf on stilts, a woman leaning into her oars as she crosses the Mekong at 
twilight. This is one place I must go some day. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all the books have a problem with their texts. They are too long, too 
factual, too determinedly informative. I shall gloat for hours over the 
magnificent Villas of Tuscany, its wonderful, wonderful gardens, grottoes, 
gazebos, but I'm hanged if I shall read more than a page or two or its dry 
stilted prose. Likewise the people who put together the fine images of A Day in 
the Life of Israel could have spared us the condescending tone of their 
comments and the visual irritation of having to see a famous photographer's 
name in bold block capitals under every single picture. 
</P>
<P>
 But the poverty of the writing perhaps alerts us to why we buy these books. At 
the simplest level, their images satisfy our atavistic fantasies of escape. 
Therein lies their commercial success. But as if this were somehow unhealthy, 
their texts seek to disguise the fact. With their plodding research and 
mountains of worthy information, they seek to reassure us that we have not 
wasted our money on a mere collection of photos. And perhaps we are reassured. 
Perhaps we don't want to admit, even to ourselves, that we are not really 
interested in the fact that the Mekong is 2,000 miles long and splits into nine 
separate channels before emptying into the South China Sea. The text becomes an 
alibi for what really fascinates us: the expression of grit and hope on this 
woman's face as she thrusts her boat forward, the wonderful precariousness of 
human beauty in wide open water under lowering skies. 
</P>
<P>
 For the irony is that the photos need no apology. In an essay on myth in this 
month's edition of Artes, the Italian writer Roberto Calasso remarks on the gap 
between written commentaries and pictorial illustrations of Ovid. The scholars 
debunk the myths, explain them away in scientific, sociological terms. 
Paintings and sculptures endorse and exalt them, keep their ancient intuitions 
alive and potent. Something of the same gulf opens up in these books. For as we 
surrender our fantasy to their images, thinking to escape, so they begin to 
speak to us with directness beyond anything in the text, offering a knowledge 
that goes far deeper: a particular way men and women have of being together, an 
intimate sense of our place in the landscape. Perhaps this is why the best of 
these books is the only one that has the courage not to include any text: 
Raghubir Singh's Bombay. Seething with a life that comes together for just that 
fraction of a second the shutter clicks, his images have a perilous luminous 
fullness about them, an awareness and wit that goes far beyond any political or 
social comment on the city he is photographing.  
</P>
<P>
 I pick up another book from the floor. Here is a man on a camel speaking into 
a mobile phone. Here is a newborn's crib, plastered with images of bearded 
rabbis, here a Bedouin shepherdess, mouth covered by her head-scarf. In a time 
when PC is just the tip of a great iceberg of orthodoxy, it seems there is a 
sort of knowledge only images can convey. Over a grim lunar landscape an 
astronaut photographs a splendidly blue and pink planet hanging in the sky. It 
is the earth, Agamemnon's earth after all, many-colored, beautiful, 
treacherous.

FOCUS; BEWITCHED BY 'THE LOOK'; HBO CASTS A '50S TECHNICOLOR SPELL ON A MOVIE 
BEING TOUTED AS MAGICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Director Paul Schrader describes his latest movie -- "Witch Hunt," premiering 
Saturday on HBO -- as a film blanc.  
</P>
<P>
 Set in 1953 Los Angeles, 'Witch Hunt" finds a world that is magical -- quite 
literally, in fact, because magic is part of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 Shamus Phillip Lovecraft (Dennis Hopper) is one of the few people who doesn't 
use magic, even when a glamorous starlet (Penelope Ann Miller) asks him to find 
out who is sabotaging her career. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheryl Lee Ralph stars as a licensed witch and friend of Lovecraft's; Alan 
Rosenberg plays an egotistical studio head; Eric Bogosian is a Joe 
McCarthy-like senator who heads up the Congressional Committee on Unnatural 
Activities, and Julian Sands plays Lovecraft's archenemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Joseph Dougherty, "Witch Hunt" is a sequel to his 1992 HBO thriller 
"Cast a Deadly Spell." 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers tuning in and expecting to see a detective thriller filled with the 
film noir trappings of that era -- shadows, darkness and smoke -- will be in 
for a big surprise. "Witch Hunt" owes it look to the lushly beautiful 
Technicolor movies of the '40s and early '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose someone will call it a film noir simply because of the limited 
vocabulary of writers and reviewers, but it certainly isn't," says Schrader, 
who has directed such visually evocative feature films as "Cat People," 
"American Gigolo" and "Mishima." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not quite sure what it is," he adds. "It is fresh. It is hip and I don't 
think there has been anything quite like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Schrader says he "assiduously avoided all the cliches of film noir. Film noir 
parodies have become a genre unto their own, like (Showtime's) 'Fallen Angels.' 
There is no life left in those parodies. I needed to do something fresh, so I 
took it into 1953 and into the world of international style and architecture, 
what they called the 'New Look,' which was sort of the '50s Miro-shaped coffee 
tables and color schemes." 
</P>
<P>
 This look, he adds, also was referred to as "California cool" -- the world 
inhabited by such jazz artists as Chet Baker and Dave Brubeck. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition," he says, "we used a special lighting package to try to emulate 
the three-strip Technicolor look, where you get these very, very saturated 
colors which would just pop off the screen as they did when they had 
Technicolor." 
</P>
<P>
 The system, called Kino-flow, is a pattern of color Florissants, "which if you 
have one really bright color and an essentially monochromatic background, that 
color will just jump. Kino-flow also gets rid of shadows, so you don't have 
shadows which is the stock and trade of film noir." 
</P>
<P>
 "Witch Hunt" marks the second time costumer designer Jodie Tillen has 
collaborated with Schrader. She previously designed costumes for his 1987 film 
"Light of Day." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has such a visual sense," Tillen says with enthusiasm. "The interesting 
part is that I read the script and then came in for my first creative meeting 
with him. He walked in and had a stack of books on film noir. He threw them 
down on the desk and said, 'You see all of this. I don't want any of this.' He 
had a completely different take." 
</P>
<P>
 What he did want was something more akin to the rich images found in the 1945 
Technicolor film "Leave Her to Heaven." That Gene Tierney vehicle, Tillen says, 
"had these saturated primary colors. The skin had that airbrushed, solid, 
perfect skin look and that is what he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Tillen design the clothes, she also designed hair and makeup. "He 
lets you design the graphic of the person, the whole person, which was 
fabulous," she says. "The wrong hairdo and makeup can kill it all. He had a 
vision. We also made all of Penelope's clothes so we had a chance to really 
control the graphic of what he wanted to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The actresses' outfits are saturated in color. "They are the flowers of the 
piece and the men are sort of the background," she explains. "They are sort of 
a tone. The women are the focal point, which is not how they do things today. 
The use of makeup -- it was like pancake. We had these flawless skinned-control 
shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our color palettes were, like, saturated primaries and black and white and 
gray," Tillen adds. "There were a couple of pictures of Chet Baker when he was 
burned out and young, and that is sort of how he based the look of Dennis 
Hopper on. So it was more, instead of like '50s music, it was like the birth of 
jazz in Los Angeles. It was a real hot time of jazz and Chet Baker was part of 
that. He based Julian Sands' character on Dave Brubeck. Look at the glasses. 
And Eric Bogosian is Richard Nixon in the '50s when he had, like, a pompadour." 
</P>
<P>
 Production designer Curtis A. Schnell ("Defenseless") designed more than 30 
location sets and 11 studio sets. "The fun part was to try to get the same 
feeling of those films in the '50s that were dark in character, but what we 
wanted to do was create something new and different and liven it up a bit," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 One way he achieved that goal was that he "pulled way back in the color of the 
walls of the structures and dropped in a lot of shadow lines with the 
architecture -- over-accentuating certain trims. We brought in bits of color 
here and there." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnell's designs also have a sense of humor, especially when it comes to the 
film mogul's office. "If you look closely at the film, all of the contour lines 
point at his desk, so subconsciously that your eye is traveling to him. The 
furniture and the architecture were absolutely correct (for that time), but how 
we applied them is that we tweaked with your head a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 "Witch Hunt" airs Saturday at 8 p.m. on HBO.

SEASON'S READINGS; BOOKS FOR GROWN-UPS; HOW 'GRIFFIN AND SABINE'S' CREATOR GOT 
INTO POP-UP BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICK BANTOCK

<TEXT>
<P>
 P op-up is an unfortunate term for a genre of books. The very word pop evokes 
insubstantial fashion and slightness of fad. That's a cruel handicap for any 
form that would take itself half-seriously. I wonder to what extent pop has 
kept pop-ups trapped as lightweights in the bookish arts. Suppose the same 
person who christened the Chinese game Mah Jong (roughly translated as the 
twittering of sparrows, after the noise the tiles made while being mixed), had 
also named pop-up books. They might now be called something like rising leaves. 
Would we not have a little more respect for their artistic potential, or am I, 
a defender of the faith, just waxing pretentious? 
</P>
<P>
 I began my own assault on the pop-up universe in 1989 with two title 
proposals: "The Old Lady" and "Zodiac." "The Old Lady" was a small, humorous 
and quirky idea, based on the traditional sick verse, that quickly found a 
publishing home at Viking and sold very well as a children's book. But 
"Zodiac," which had a lot of potential for rich artwork, never made it off the 
ground because it was unashamedly an adult art book. It was perceived that 
adults wouldn't buy pop-up books for themselves, they had to have a child lined 
up for surrogate ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 I contested the point, but in my pre-"Griffin and Sabine" days I was without 
power. I gave up on the notion of creating a cross between paper-sculpture, 
painting and text. Instead I indulged myself by having enormous fun making 
another four small, dark humored pop-ups, plus a couple of nature education 
pop-ups based on animal locomotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after finishing the third in the "Griffin and Sabine" trilogy, I 
decided to use my newfound market power to resurrect my theory that an 
aesthetically pleasing and dramatic adult pop-up would be of interest to a lot 
of real live grown ups. 
</P>
<P>
 All my pop-ups have been made with Intervisual, the Santa Monica-based book 
packager, and they have been very supportive of my odd notions. When I told my 
editor about my mission (it wasn't really a mission, it was more of a 
bloody-minded determination to make a good idea work), she became enthusiastic. 
We put our heads together and came up with Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem, 
"Kubla Khan" as recipient of "the creative treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 I chose "Kubla Khan" because it was both old and futuristic -- it could, at a 
push, claim the title as the first science-fiction poem. It emanated an air of 
decadence that made me think of heaped Persian cushions, the thick aroma of 
incense and the indulgences of the Victorian Orientalism. I also picked it 
because the text was the right length for six spreads, and the narrative was 
sublimely ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of conceiving and constructing a pop-up is unlike anything else 
I've ever been involved in. It's both torturous and infinitely entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Having picked my subject, I begin with a series of scribbles that transmogrify 
themselves into a set of graphite drawings, one for each of the spreads. I 
photocopy them, glue them to a thin card, then begin snipping and hacking with 
scalpel and scissors. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, I start bending, folding and sticking the bits together with glue 
stick or double-sided tape. The result is a mess. But it gives me a sense of 
where I'm going. 
</P>
<P>
 I repeat the process, building a more substantial pop-up. If I'm happy with 
what I've come up with, I glue the pages together to make a full dummy of the 
book, which I send to the paper mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper mechanic is to me what the Formula One racing car mechanic is to the 
local garage repairman! Over the next month or so he'll consistently turn my 
paper inexactitudes into fine, smooth-running creatures. He sends his white 
card version back to me. I play again making further cuts and twists. He 
refines. If all is well, he sends me a large sheet that has the parts of the 
pops opened out and neatly nested together. Then comes the tricky part. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to do the color art to fit this higldy-pigldy flattened out jigsaw 
pattern. The first time I was faced with the task I thought it nigh on 
impossible, but having been through the problem a number of times I find it 
marginally less overwhelming. It requires a little retraining of the brain, 
much like an old-fashioned typographer learning to read the metal type back to 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 When I've completed the art, the paper mechanic color photocopies it and 
rebuilds it yet again. I make my final changes to both the art and the cuts. 
Color separations are made of the art, and the nesting sheet is drawn up for 
the printers. Then away it all goes to print in Hong Kong or Colombia with a 
wing and a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 After a while, the proofs come back and small adjustments to color and die cut 
can be made, but mostly -- what you did is what you get. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kubla Khan" was even more complicated because the art was only partially 
figurative and the cuts had to read as drawn edges, so they had to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to that headache, I used a lot of gold powder in the painting, and 
we had to battle to get the really strong printed color we wanted. After a good 
deal of toing and froing it came together, and I admit to being proud of the 
result. I just hope to hell I was right in principle and there are enough 
adults out there willing to buy a painted paper sculpture version of "Kubla 
Khan," with or without the surrogate kid.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kubla Khan " was published this month by Viking. Also just published: "Averse 
to Beasts" (Chronicle), a box containing an illustrated book and live tape of 
Nick Bantock reading his dark animal poems to an audience of 500 wild animals.  
</P>
<P>
 And other pop - ups by Nick Bantock: "There Was an Old Lady," "Jabberwocky," 
"Solomon Grundy," "The Walrus and the Carpenter," "Robin Hood . " The above are 
all by Viking.

ON VIEW; FAITH, LIES AND REDEMPTION; TNT'S 'JACOB' IS A TESTAMENT TO PERSONAL 
GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Peter Hall, the renowned British stage and opera director, acknowledges that 
he's not a religious man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no religion," says Hall, who devoted 30 years of his career to running 
England's two leading national theater companies -- The Royal Shakespeare 
Company, which he founded in 1960, and the Royal National Theatre, where he 
succeeded Laurence Olivier. He currently overseas the commercial theater 
troupe, the Peter Hall Company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a worried agnostic," he adds with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Being agnostic, however, didn't stop him from directing "Jacob," which 
premieres Sunday on TNT. The Old Testament parable about redemption and faith 
is the second in a series of Bible stories TNT is dramatizing for the small 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jacob," an international co-production with Germany and Italy, features an 
equally eclectic cast: Matthew Modine as Jacob, Lara Flynn Boyle as Rachel, 
Irene Papas as Rebekah, Giancarlo Giannini as Laban, Juliet Aubrey as Leah, 
Joss Ackland as Isaac and Sean Bean as Esau. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my agent rang me up and said that Turner would like me to do one of 
their Bible, Old Testament movies, I said, 'Don't be silly,' " recalls Hall, 
who directed the 1990 TNT movie "Orpheus Descending" with Vanessa Redgrave and 
Kevin Anderson. "He said, 'Look at "Abraham," which they had just made." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, 64, was impressed with the miniseries "Abraham," which starred Richard 
Harris and Barbara Hershey. "I thought it had a great texture because of where 
it was shot (Morocco). I actually believed (the characters) were looking after 
those sheep. In most biblical films, you feel that the sheep have been asked to 
cross camera from one side to another." 
</P>
<P>
 He had little knowledge of the Jacob story when he was asked to direct the 
film. "I must confess, all I could remember about Jacob was that he was a twin 
and that Esau was a hairy man and Jacob was a smooth man. And that Jacob had 
conned his blind father Isaac into giving him the inheritance, the leadership 
of the tribe, by deception, by putting kid (goat) pelts on his arms. His blind 
father feels them and says, 'Esau.' I also remember something dimly about 
ladders, Jacob's ladder. But I couldn't remember anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 So he refreshed his memory by reading the Old Testament. Much to his surprise, 
Hall discovered the parables to be extraordinary stories. "Without wishing to 
belittle them at all, they have to be thought of as metaphors like the great 
myths -- collective stories of mankind." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob, Hall says, "is a wonderful story about paying for deception. Jacob is 
the story of a very, very weak deceiver who is very neurotic. He is a human 
being. He suffers as a consequence and he turns into something rather 
extraordinary. It is the classic story of sinner to saint." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall hopes he has given the story a human texture. "For starters, this isn't 
an epic," he explains over a cup of tea at the St. James Club bar in West 
Hollywood. "They don't speak in an old-style English as if they wandered in 
from an antique shop. They are not Shakespearean. I tried to get a cast that 
was very modern in its sensibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 As in the case of the very American Modine, who has starred in such films as 
"Full Metal Jacket," "Birdy" and "And the Band Played On." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Hall, Modine knew very little about the Bible. "When I try to do research 
for something like this, I try to read everything I can," says Modine in a 
phone conversation from New York City. "It is interesting, whether it is the 
story of Jacob or Abraham, it is always a story of a person's search for 
something. Usually, the search leads them to something inside. I believe Peter 
and I felt that it was a journey of looking inwardly. If you think of the 
events in Jacob's life, not the religious overtones, and say he is living 
today, what you have is a man who spends his life feeling terribly guilty for 
things he should not have done. And then he spends all of his time in penance." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jacob" was filmed earlier this year in Morocco. "It took 27 days and we 
worked around the clock," Hall recalls. "We had a wonderful Italian crew. On 
the last day we did 43 (camera) setups, with Matthew in all of them. The only 
problem was the heat. It was quite often 95 and 100 degrees and we shot from 8 
in the morning until 7 at night, six days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Modine has been making movies for more than a decade, he knew how to 
pace himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those people who did the costume changes and in the hair and makeup 
departments were the best I ever worked with," Modine says. "All of those 
beards the guy applied hair by hair by hair. We would come in at 5 in the 
morning to start putting the hair and makeup on and then you'd spend the whole 
day filming until the sun went down and then you have to get all of that stuff 
off. There were times I wish I would have just left it on and gone to work the 
next day. But you feel so horrible with the dirt and the makeup. So you would 
go back to the hotel room and soak in the tub to get it off and leave a 
horrible mess in the hotel's bathroom!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Jacob" airs Sunday at 5, 7 and 9 p.m.; Wednesday at 5 p.m.; Saturday at 5 
p.m.; Dec. 11 at 1 p.m.; Dec. 14 at 7 p.m. and Dec. 17 at 11 a.m. on TNT.

Books / Harcourt Brace & Co.).

<TEXT>

 The mind, with its desire to understand and to organize, meets nature: 
canyons, leopards, insects, forms of all sorts and forces of all kinds, laws 
and inter-relationships invisible and unbendable, thickets, sequoias, turtles 
that swim and turtles that trudge -- in other words, all our bountiful and 
astonishing world. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Henri Fabre, as a young boy, happens upon a bird's nest in a field; he is 
amazed at the little eggs therein and of course he wants to own such a sky-blue 
pleasure, so he takes an egg and with it in hand begins his run home. Then he 
meets something even more wonderful: The village curate, out walking, by 
happenstance sees what he is about. The curate admonishes him -- but not too 
crabbily -- for taking the egg from the bird's nest, and he offers the boy two 
significant pieces of information: first, that it is wrong to interfere with 
the bird's plan to brood and hatch the egg; and, second, that the bird has a 
name, it is a stone-chat, the Saxicola. Fabre's mind was fired, he says, 
telling this story decades later; thus did he realize, for the first time, that 
wilderness is a place of purpose and passion, and that its portions are orderly 
enough to have names -- thus did he begin to change from an interfering boy 
into a fascinated observer of the natural world. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the lucky intervention of such an adviser, what is this world but 
beauty and chaos? And what shall we look to, or have our children and friends 
look to, if the curate is not likely to pass our way? Books, of course -- those 
spokesmen for forbearance and organization, those containers full of enthusiasm 
glossed with intelligence (as many as there are paths for the shining ant 
across the summer field!). 
</P>
<P>
 365 Days of Nature Discovery, subtitled Things To Do and Learn for the Whole 
Family is colorful, friendly and full of scintillating information. The book, 
approximately six inches by six inches, presents a page for each day of the 
year; there is a Bean Day and an Anteater Day, a Swan Day and a Moon Day. Also 
there is Cabbage, the only title I could find without the appendage -- 
something special at last for old, humble cabbage. The text is specific, 
fact-filled and never condescends to the subject or to the reader; also the 
text suggests activities, things to think about, other books to read. The 
illustrations are informative and do not lapse into cuteness or bland beauty. 
If I had eight nieces and nephews, I would want nine copies of this neat book, 
to satisfy all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Africa: Spectacular World of Wildlife is a splendid book. It is the 
result of a call to wildlife photographers for their best work, and so we are 
given the "viewpoints" -- I mean by this positions of intent as well as actual 
views -- of many photographers. Without the particular "signature" of a single 
artist, the world here appears less interpreted, more itself. Also, as we turn 
the large and lush pages, there is no hint of the traveler -- not a human 
person or shadow appears. If we are there at all perhaps it is in the gaze of 
many of the animals, who have turned with curiosity, but no panic, toward the 
lens. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult these days to look at any TV wildlife show without being 
greeted almost instantly with the hunt -- as though that is all wild animals 
do, from the rising of the pink sun to the rising of the white moon, and 
beyond. It is, of course, not so -- but the hunt is more marketable than other 
activities. In Southern Africa animals hunt occasionally -- naturally they do. 
More frequently the lions and the elephants, the baboons, monkeys, and the 
vivid birds, the great eagles, even the chameleon are pictured sleeping, 
waking, browsing, running, playing, leaping, grooming or simply gazing about 
their fantastic world. If the editors of "Southern Africa" hoped to convey 
their world with the least amount of interference, they have succeeded. The 
text is nicely informative; also offered are maps of the sanctuary areas and 
useful information for travelers or would-be travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Open Country's text and photographs by Jay Dusard, we enjoy exactly what 
would have been a detriment to the Southern African enterprise -- the 
"signature" of a single discerning eye. Dusard's photographs of the American 
West witness a landscape ruled by time and light; he addresses the great 
creations -- space, rock, clouds. But he gives attention also to the presence 
of man; fragile against the backdrop of mountains appear ranch buildings, a 
drover with startlingly expressive mustachios, a barbed-wire fence careening 
across a seemingly endless field. (It is as though in the cosmology of Dusard's 
work there are both major gods -- the natural forces -- and minor deities -- 
the men and women who lounge against fences in their dusty and luminous 
heaven). Luminous is the important word here; the photographs, many cropped so 
that the horizontal reach has powerful impact, are full of pools and crevices 
of silvery light. Forceful and serene, they marry the mighty to the tender, the 
moment that is breaking down even as we witness it against the distant sky, 
which is half stone. "Open Country" is the work of 20 years, and I tip my hat 
to a man so patient and deliberate. Such patience is not at all usual, and 
neither is this book. It is pleasant to make the acquaintance of the 
photographer in the brief, engaging text, and the judicious use of quotations 
from other writers is a sensitive accompaniment. 
</P>

 There was in Germany, at the beginning of the 17th Century, an extraordinary 
garden cultivated around a castle; the name of this garden was Hortus 
Eystettensis, and the same name was given to "a great book" depicting its 
multitudes of plants. There were a number of these books eventually, copied by 
hand, some in black and white, others hand-colored. All of this I learned from 
Hortus Eystettensis: The Bishop's Garden and Besler's Magnificent Book, which 
gives us both history and reproductions of the graceful and imposing colored 
plates. As one cannot look at the curvaceous, detailed glass flowers in 
Boston's Peabody Museum, one cannot look at these pages of opulent leaves, 
stems and blossoms without marveling over the hand that patiently modeled them; 
the diligence and humility of such work is staggering. For those who have 
appetite for the fine and unusual among gardens, this book is a true feast. 
</P>

 The coyote population has been rising and for many people -- including myself 
-- living with this animal has suddenly become very real. So it was with 
special interest that I took up The World of the Coyote. Wayne Grady has 
written a valuable text, in which coyotes are neither heroes nor villains, but 
their own astonishing and toothy selves, thriving on this green planet in spite 
of the denigrations and deadly campaigns of man. The photographs reveal neither 
the silky devil nor the waggish dog, but an animal whose intensity, 
playfulness, power, musicality and integrity is undeniable. "The World of the 
Coyote" is an instructive book, and a timely one. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons, leopards, coyotes, chameleons, flowers diverse and gorgeous -- these 
things are our world. Insofar as we are strangers to the world, we abuse it, 
for we know no better. Respect begins, therefore, with knowledge, and that 
knowledge with attention. In all of this, books play the biggest part, with 
their ability, through text and photographs, to impart knowledge without 
destruction or intrusion. As usual no one has said it better than Emerson; in 
his poem "Forbearance" he asks, "Hast thou named all the birds without a gun? 
Loved the wood-rose, and left it on its stalk?" Books make it possible. If you 
wish, you can give a coyote for Christmas, or the luminous expanse of a 
prairie, or a Flamingo Day, without a dimple of harm to the earth. Good and 
happy gifts!

COVER STORY: A COLE CHRISTMAS; NATALIE'S GIFTS: SINGING ON PBS AND ACTING IN 
USA MOVIE

 Grammy Award-winning Natalie Cole is celebrating Christmas in a big way this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 She's recently released her first Christmas album, "Holly and Ivy," in which 
she performs new songs as well as traditional holiday favorites. Of course, one 
of those Yuletide standards is the unforgettable "The Christmas Song," which 
her father, the late, great Nat (King) Cole made famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, 44, also headlines a "Great Performances" special on PBS -- "Natalie 
Cole's Untraditional Traditional Christmas" -- which premieres this week. Taped 
at SUNY Performing Arts Center in Purchase, N.Y., the show features Cole 
performing holiday songs with the help of the New York Restoration Choir and 
"Sesame Street's" adorable Elmo. 
</P>
<P>
 She seems most excited, though, about "Lily in Winter," which premieres 
Thursday on the USA Network. In the heartwarming holiday drama, Cole plays Lily 
Covington, a maid and nanny working in New York City, circa 1957. When she 
finds herself in a desperate predicament, Lily escapes on a train bound for her 
Alabama hometown. Unbeknown to her, though, her young charge Michael (Brian 
Bonsall) has come along for the ride. When Michael's parents think Lily has 
kidnaped their son, the FBI gets into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lily in Winter" marks Cole's movie debut and is directed by veteran Delbert 
Mann, who won an Oscar for 1955's "Marty." 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Lily in Winter" is set in New York, the production is being filmed in 
Los Angeles. Today, a stately old house on Adams Boulevard is doubling for the 
New York brownstone where Lily lives and works. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole made her first foray into acting nearly two years ago on the acclaimed 
1991-93 NBC series "I'll Fly Away" as an educator who opens an alternative 
school in the pre-civil rights South. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting, she says, is something she's contemplated for a long time. "I just 
wanted to make an impact," says Cole, who is dressed in black overalls, white 
blouse and matching black-and-white oxfords. "I didn't want to start up and do 
little sitcoms or cameo things. I really wanted to play a character." 
</P>
<P>
 And she definitely didn't want to play a singer. Her father made several 
movies, including "Cat Ballou" and "Istanbul," but was rarely cast in a 
non-singing role. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was my biggest beef," she says. "I got offers: 'Do you want to act? We 
have got a role for a singer.' I didn't want to do that. It wasn't much of a 
stretch for me." 
</P>
<P>
 A fan of "I'll Fly Away," she approached the producers. "I said, 'I would sure 
like to do your show. Do you think you could find a character for me that 
doesn't require me to sing?' It took about a year and they found a story." 
</P>
<P>
 Cole says she wasn't too nervous her first time in front of a film camera. "It 
was neat," she says, smiling. 'I'm sure I was nervous, but the people I was 
working with were so professional. Quite a few of them had thought I had acted 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 Her guest shot on "I'll Fly Away" led to "Lily in Winter." She says she 
immediately felt a real kinship with Lily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kind of slip into her," Cole says. "When I first got made up and they 
put all the clothes on and the hat, I didn't know if I should laugh or cry. I 
thought it was the funniest thing I had ever seen. There was a part of me that 
said, 'I could be her.' I was Lily for the first week more than I was Natalie. 
That took some getting used to for my family. I didn't know who I was at the 
end of the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Lily, Cole explains, "is a lady who, somehow or other, wanted to have more for 
herself than when she was living down South with her family. She found herself 
in a situation where she had a child at a very young age. She does end up in 
New York and has a good job. It's almost like she's substituted this family for 
her family back home. She really does love this little boy, but she also has a 
little girl that she has to pay attention to. She hasn't done that for many 
years. Lily is someone who is very loving, just a little naive. She means well. 
She doesn't always make good choices, like many of us." 
</P>
<P>
 By the drama's conclusion, Cole says, Lily grows up. "She makes some decisions 
that she wasn't ready to make for whatever reason. Now, she makes some really 
smart decisions. They are tough decisions because basically she sacrifices a 
way of life. Michael gets a little lesson, and Michael's parents get a lesson 
because if they hadn't been so busy, Michael wouldn't have run away with the 
maid. It's really kind of neat." 
</P>
<P>
 Cole considers herself blessed working with a director of the caliber of 
Delbert Mann. "He is a charm," she says with enthusiasm. "He knows what he 
wants, which I really like." 
</P>
<P>
 Mann has nothing but praise for his star. "She carries the whole picture," he 
says. "She was totally professional, well-prepared, easy to work with, joyous 
to work with. She certainly doesn't have great experience as an actress, but 
she has been a performer and subjected to rigid discipline of her profession. 
That carried over into her professionalism on the set. Beyond that, she has 
very good instincts as an actress. It is a lovely star performance." 
</P>
<P>
 And Cole can't wait to act again. Next time, though, she wants to play someone 
more contemporary. "I would like to do something with a little action. I would 
like to play a cop or a tough lawyer and just totally move away from this. I 
don't want to be typecast." 
</P>
<P>
 "Great Performances: Natalie Cole's Untraditional Traditional Christmas" airs 
Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on KCET and KPBS; 8 p.m. on KOCE and Thursday at 9 p.m. 
on KVCR . "Lily in Winter" airs Thursday at 9 p.m. on USA; it repeats Dec. 11 
at 8 p.m. and Dec. 17 at 4 p.m.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; A 'SHOWCASE' EFFORT MAKES SUNDAY 
MORNINGS REALLY SHINE ON KCET 
</P>

<P>
 For the next two Sundays, local PBS station KCET sets out to show just what 
makes its children's programming fun and educational. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really one of the toughest challenges of any TV producer, the concern 
for creating entertaining shows that kids will enjoy and yet give them a chance 
to explore and watch other people work out situations and learn from them," 
says Steve Kulczycki, KCET senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the purposes of its Sunday Morning Showcase is to bring together 
parents and children. "We thought this was a great collection of shows for 
young children that would work well for the kids to watch with their parents," 
Kulczycki says. 
</P>
<P>
 The showcase offers two new shows, "Showstoppers From 'Barney Live! in New 
York City' " and the popular "Road Construction Ahead," previously available 
only on video. All other programs on the "Showcase" have aired in regular time 
slots but are shows KCET believes best demonstrate the station's quality 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Road Construction Ahead" was originally taped by a father who found that his 
2- , 3- , and 4-year-olds were enraptured by road construction and big road 
machines at work. 
</P>
<P>
 The new "Barney" show features excerpts from a concert by the popular purple 
dino at New York City's Music Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's lineup includes Shalom Sesame: Alpha-Bet Television Discovering the 
Hebrew Letters, in which violinist Itzak Perlman appears (7 a.m.); Shalom 
Sesame: Kids Sing Israel (Grouches Don't) (7:30 a.m.); Showstoppers From 
'Barney Live! in New York City' (8 a.m.); The Magic Schoolbus Plays Ball (9 
a.m.); Road Construction Ahead (9:35 a.m.); Storytime with Hector Elizondo and 
Mara (10 a.m.), and Lamb Chop's Play Along (10:35 a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli television show "Shalom Sesame," which is an English adaptation of 
Israel's version of "Sesame Street," is designed to introduce American families 
to Israeli culture. It airs Sunday to celebrate the end of Hanukkah. The first 
episode features Jerry Stiller ("Seinfeld") and Perlman; the second offers 
Sarah Jessica Parker ("Honeymoon in Vegas"). 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 11, "Sunday Morning Showcase" will feature Sesame Street (7 a.m.); Put 
Down the Duckey (8 a.m.); Barney & Friends (9 a.m.); Kids Love Trains (9:30 
a.m.); Storytime (10 a.m.), and Lamb Chop's Play-Along (10:35 a.m.). For kids 
age s 2 to 8 and their parents. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Smack in the middle of the season for angel visitations comes a show that's 
not actually holiday oriented, but definitely for the kids: "Magical Makeover," 
an ABC Afterschool Special (Thursday 3 p.m. ABC). It features "All-American 
Girl's" B.D. Wong as an angel named Johnny who's been sent to grant Christine's 
(Amy Hargreaves) wish to get attention from the school hunk (Mark 
Brettschneider). 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny arranges for Christine to awaken in a different incarnation every 
morning. One day she's a cheerleader, the next a heavy metal fan and, finally, 
a glamorous model. Despite Johnny's insistence that she'd be better off as 
herself, Christine's convinced that her new personas will work -- until they 
begin to go awry. She's also not entirely ready for her feelings toward Johnny. 
Can you fall in love with an angel? For ages 8 and up.

 Sherman Hemsley guests as a bitter toy inventor on this week's Lois & Clark:

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Thomas

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Boorman's 1990 Where the Heart Is (KTLA Sunday at 7 p.m.) is a fairy tale 
about riches, poverty, art and the power of family that is to some extent split 
against itself. The rapturous visuals, Boorman's specialty, clash with his own 
stiff screenplay -- co-written with his daughter Telsch. This cautionary comedy 
about extraordinary reversals of fortune is constructed like the Arthurian 
legends of Boorman's "Excalibur." Superficially, it's the tale of a demolition 
tycoon (Dabney Coleman) who, incensed at his children's arty radicalism, exiles 
them to a Brooklyn tenement, slated for demolition but also eligible for 
landmark status. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manhattan of Terry Gilliam's 1991 The Fisher King (NBC Sunday at 8 p.m.) 
is a monumentally grungy den of iniquity, a vision of New York as a medieval 
fortress. This all seems appropriate to the story, which is a modern variant on 
the search for the Holy Grail. Jeff Bridges plays Manhattan's top shock deejay, 
now reduced to a disheveled, guilt-ridden obscurity; Robin Williams is a 
half-mad wastrel who rescues Bridges from muggers. The subtext of their 
friendship is that love conquers all, but it doesn't connect with the film's 
full-blown weirdness and its spasms of knockabout lunacy. With an Oscar-winning 
Mercedes Ruehl as Bridges' vivid, hard-pressed lover; Amanda Plummer as a shy 
young woman Bridges tries to pair Williams with, and Michael Jeter in a 
show-stopping drag number. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Dern and Diane Ladd became the first mother-daughter Oscar nominees for 
their performances in Martha Coolidge's luminous 1991 Rambling Rose (KTLA 
Tuesday at 8 p.m.), Calder Willingham's adaptation of his autobiographical 
novel set in the 1930s South. Dern plays a sweet, sexy teen-ger who comes to 
work for Ladd and her husband, Robert Duvall. The consequences of her presence 
are not as predictable as one might guess. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 Gladiator (KTTV Tuesday at 8 p.m.), a "Rocky"-esque fantasia, offers 
a Great White Hope scenario that plugs into race-baiting but covers its tracks 
by trying for a brotherhood-of-man effect. It combines a trashy, low-road, 
rabble-rousing spirit with high-road pretensions. To erase some of his gambler 
father's markers, a young man (James Marshall) agrees to a one-time-only -- 
yeah, sure -- prizefight. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Rogers as The Gambler III: The Legend Continues (KTLA Wednesday at 8 
p.m., concludes Thursday at 8 p.m.) is a routine 1987 TV Western in which 
Rogers and pal Bruce Boxleitner seek justice for the Sioux during the climactic 
days of the Indian Wars in the Dakota Territory. In a kind of reworking of "The 
African Queen" as a Western, the 1975 Rooster Cogburn (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.) 
teams John Wayne's crusty U.S. marshal from "True Grit" with Katharine Hepburn; 
the stars are better than their material. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't be the holiday season without It's a Wonderful Life, which airs on 
NBC Saturday at 8 p.m., the only viewing of the classic this year due to the 
ending of the film's public domain status.

CATHOLIC LEAGUE REBUTTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You printed a letter (Nov. 20, TV Times) from the Catholic League, which 
attempted to whitewash the history of Catholic destruction of American Indian 
culture. The writer asked you why your author (Wounded Knee -- "Survival of the 
Spirit") didn't portray the good side of Christian-Indian interaction, and 
whether blacks and Jews are exempt from criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that blacks and Jews did not have a program of slavery, cultural 
genocide, murder, forced religious conversion and violent parochial school 
indoctrination of Indians -- white Christians did, and in much of the world 
today, they still do.

COMMENTARY; ON-LINE AT HOME: ONE MORE WAY TO KEEP A LOYAL FAN HOOKED

<P>
 You've just finished watching "Melrose Place" and would love to dish the dirt 
about Amanda's hairdo, wardrobe or skillful abuse of men. 
</P>
<P>
 But office cooler chat is a long, bleak nighttime away. So you sidle up to a 
source of instant gratification: the computer that will carry you into 
cyberspace to meet fellow "Place" junkies. 
</P>
<P>
 Or fans of "The Nanny." Or Mike Judge, creator of "Beavis and Butt-head." Or 
Peter Jennings, who answered Election Day questions via computer. Or talk-show 
host Greg Kinnear. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, on-line services such as Prodigy, CompuServe, America Online and 
Delphi are helping TV networks open up a brave new world of marketing and 
promotion -- ummm, we mean communication. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet, a worldwide amalgam of computer networks that is free to the 
public, is also abuzz with TV chatter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives a network an opportunity to build loyalty, to have a closer 
personal relationship with viewers," says Prodigy executive Barbara Bellafiore 
Sanden, who oversees on-line services for about 40 cable and broadcast 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 And possibly attract more viewers? The recent success of the science-fiction 
film "Stargate" has been credited in part to an aggressive on-line campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little early to tell, but that's part of what we're all betting on: 
This is another promotional tool to cut through all the clutter out there," 
Sanden says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also, she notes, a way for networks to dip their toes into much-discussed 
interactivity, using computers for now instead of TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called "bulletin boards" that let computer users talk amongst themselves 
are a longtime on-line staple. In the past year, a growing number of actors, 
producers and network executives have begun sitting down for keyboard chats as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment, as much as information, is the goal. Asked by one fan if he'd 
ever had a paranormal experience, producer Chris Carter of Fox's "The X-Files" 
replied: "I was audited by the IRS once. Beyond that, I'd have to say no." 
</P>
<P>
 Fran Drescher, star of the CBS sitcom "The Nanny," offered this advice on 
breaking into show business during a recent on-line Q&A: "Start young, get into 
a play ... or have a relative with the last name Sheen or a brother with the 
last name Baldwin." 
</P>
<P>
 A producer or network may browse through bulletin board comments to sample 
viewer comment. And it can be widespread: One "X-Files" fan logs in to Delphi 
from the North Pole; others come aboard from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I get from it is a certain, immediate feedback from people who are 
watching the show, a visceral reaction to what we're doing," says Carter, a 
regular reader of computer chat. "It's like going to a good party and having a 
spirited debate," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of fun, frivolous stuff out there, like the 'David Duchovny 
Estrogen Brigade' and the 'Gillian Anderson Testosterone Brigade,"' Carter 
says, naming on-line fan clubs for his series' stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Networks are beginning to use information gleaned from the computer in 
decision-making; Fox compiles a memo for department heads based on on-line 
comments, says network executive Charles Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Networks also are pumping a stream of goodies and enticements out to cement 
the bond between viewers and programs and, in some cases, to turn computer flow 
into cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, in conjunction with automaker Ford, created a Prodigy promotion for the 
miniseries "Scarlett" that included giving away a free car. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the on-line universe is small compared to the 98% of U.S. homes 
with television. Prodigy, one of the leading on-line services, has about 2 
million members, who pay $9.95 for five hours on-line and $2.95 an hour 
thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a potent group of consumers, claims Sanden: Members tend to be 
affluent and better-educated. And when they're sitting in front of their 
computers, not watching television, is that a network cause for concern? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this probably makes people more interested in television," says Matt 
Jacobson, a Fox executive responsible for network Delphi activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the apogee of the Computer Age has come.

<P>
By CHARLES SIMIC, Charles Simic's most recent book of poems is A Wedding in 
Hell (Harcourt Brace & Co.). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two books of photographs of the war in former Yugoslavia, and specifically the 
siege of Sarajevo and Mostar from the summer of 1992 to September of 1993. We 
see sniper victims lying in the streets, people with arms and legs blown off, 
corpses wrapped in plastic, wrecked churches and mosques, crowds of refugees on 
the run, young soldiers proudly wielding their weapons, children playing among 
the ruins or selling cigarettes. Every window is broken, every street strewn 
with rubble. After every photograph the inescapable conclusion is that one is 
looking at the massacre of the innocent, the triumph of evil and stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera is the eyewitness. "Looking at a photograph, I inevitably include 
in my scrutiny the thought of that instant, however brief, in which a real 
thing happened to be motionless in front of the eye," writes Rolland Barthes. 
This is the power of a documentary photograph. One sits at the breakfast table 
sipping coffee and turning the pages of the daily newspaper only to come to a 
photograph of a child killed in the street lying in a pool of blood. Look and 
see, the photograph tells us, this really happened. The image is far more 
persuasive than the word. Seeing the dead piled up like lumber to be bulldozed 
in concentration camps liberated by the Allies at the end of World War II made 
the unthinkable suddenly believable. 
</P>
<P>
 The photograph tells the truth, we think. Still, one needs to be reminded that 
the pictures of atrocities were used and continue to be used by the media on 
all sides in former-Yugoslavia to fan the flames of hatred and enrage the 
various ethnic groups against each other. The rule of the propagandist is: You 
must never show what we did, but only what the other side did to us. The books 
under review, for instance, do not show any Serbian dead. Consequently, one 
cannot look through these photographs without ending by feeling a murderous 
loathing for the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the question of voyeurism. Who hasn't felt ashamed by one's own 
curiosity in turning the pages of such books? Many of these photographs of 
atrocities are beautiful as photographs. One finds oneself admiring the godlike 
man with the camera who sought not only to document the horror, but also 
managed to catch the aesthetic side of the human drama. There is no such thing 
as an innocent eye, of course. One frames only a part of what one sees. 
Inevitably, one makes choices. It takes skill to make a powerful image that 
"imparts humanity to the inhuman world," as Clarence John Laughlin said. It is 
the "art" in the photograph that makes the image stick in our minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilles Peress' book has more than 200 photographs without captions. Most of 
them are taken in a hurry, many from moving vehicles. We don't know where we 
are and what the people are running from precisely. Peress is very good at 
photographing crowds, conveying the panic and the bewilderment of the innocent 
caught between two sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suffering people look the same everywhere," a friend of mine said turning the 
pages of this book. It's true. A face contorted with pain or sobs is the same 
face the world over. What one remembers are the images that individualize the 
faces in the crowd, images where there is a clear sense of one life, one 
moment, one human being's tragic fate. 
</P>
<P>
 A man is pushing his grandmother in a wheelbarrow. The family photo album lies 
open on the floor of a gutted house outside of which the fruit trees are in 
bloom. It's springtime. The walls in the city are covered with obituary 
notices. A child with eyes bandaged is being led down a busy street by his 
mother. In one of the most powerful images in Peress' book, a man in the morgue 
approaches three stretchers with bodies lying on the floor and recognizing a 
friend or relative covers his face. In the next photograph the same man is 
turning away with his face still covered. The morgue attendant is 
expressionless as he stands watching. He has seen all this before. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugarman's photographs are more carefully taken. His book is less the work of 
a journalist, more the work of a portrait artist. People pause for him. His 
photographs are identified and captioned. He has a feel for the monumental. The 
clouds and the dark sky above the ruins give his images a literary quality. I 
was reminded of Isaac Babel's stories of the Russian Revolution, the way he 
juxtaposes lyrical images of nature with horrors of the war: "Fields flowered 
around us, crimson with poppies . . . lying on his back was an old man, a dead 
old man. His throat had been torn out and his face cleft in two," writes Babel. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some truly fine photographs in Sugarman's book: An old man with a 
cane and a shopping bag all alone crossing a street in Sarajevo. Three mad 
women holding each other in some unidentified hospital. A new apartment 
building with all its windows broken. A naked young woman raped and killed. A 
handsome, very young soldier observing a burial in Sarajevo. A street vendor 
selling brooms outside some ruins. People squatting under umbrellas at the 
cemetery during sniper fire; four coffins lying on the ground unattended. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the young soldiers and the children are smiling in both books. This 
corresponds to my own memories of World War II in Yugoslavia. I was 8 years old 
when the war ended and remember being terribly unhappy that I now had to go to 
school instead of roaming the streets with my buddies and having fun. As for 
the soldiers in our neighborhood, we would sit at their feet listening to their 
adventures with fascination and envy. That's probably one reason why nobody 
ever learns anything from history in that unhappy country.

 The big news in photography this year is the Robert Frank retrospective that 
opened at the National Gallery of Art in Washington on Oct. 2, and comes to the 
Lannan Foundation in March of 1996 at the conclusion of a five-venue world 
tour. Arguably the greatest photographer of the 20th Century, Frank is best 
known for "The Americans," his collection of documentary photography published 
in 1958, a gravely beautiful essay on America as seen through the eyes of an 
immigrant (Frank came to the U.S. from his native Switzerland in 1947). 
However, as is illustrated in Robert Frank: Moving Out, the splendid catalogue 
for the National exhibition, Frank has given us so much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 70, Frank has said that he's tried to make art with "less taste, more 
spirit"; he's rarely fallen short of that in any of the less known work he's 
made in the 36 years since his career was established with the "The Americans." 
There's so much love in his pictures. Intimate but never invasive, they 
celebrate the holiness of the commonplace, and nod with respect to the profound 
loneliness that afflicts us all. His pictures always feel true, yet they're 
never cruel -- what an amazing achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting the idea of the singular masterpiece, Frank developed a cumulative, 
sequential approach to photography that's very much in keeping with his work as 
a filmmaker. Indeed, there's virtually no separation between Frank's 
photography and his auteurist films (he's completed more than 25 of those), and 
he developed both art-forms in tandem beginning in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 Scorning the conventional photo essay form that reigned supreme in the 50s 
when Life Magazine was in its heyday, Frank devised a narrative structure 
revolving around irrational juxtapositions that make inexplicable sense. His 
brilliant technical innovations, however, run a far second to the moving 
emotional content of his work. A Jew who grew up in Europe in the '30s and '40s 
in the shadow of Hitler, Frank learned the concepts of mercy and compassion 
firsthand and at a young age; that sacred knowledge is at the heart of his gift 
as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothea Lange was 29 years older than Frank, but her work came from 
essentially the same place. One of the best known photographers of the Farm 
Security Administration, a U.S. government agency formed in the '30s to 
document the effects of the Depression, Lange was in fact fired from the FSA 
for being "uncooperative." Surprising facts like this turn up repeatedly in 
Dorothea Lange: A Visual Life, a refreshingly balanced book written by 
photographer Imogen Cunningham's granddaughter, Elizabeth Partridge.  
</P>
<P>
 As a child Partridge knew Lange, who was a close friend of her family's, so 
the portrait she paints of the artist (who died in 1965) is warmly personal, as 
might be expected. What makes her writing special, however, is its objectivity. 
Lange was by all accounts a difficult woman, and Partridge tells it like it 
was, but her love for Lange and respect for her work temper the 
less-than-flattering revelations she wisely includes. Partridge's fascinating 
profile is complemented by dozens of wonderful pictures; many you'll have seen 
before and will greet as old friends, while the lesser-known images Partridge 
has selected for inclusion deserve to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange's firing by the FSA's Roy Stryker is nothing compared to the scandal 
chronicled in Eakins and the Photograph: Works by Thomas Eakins and His Circle 
in the Collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Eakins, of 
course, is one of America's great realist painters and is regarded by many art 
historians as our first modern artist. What most people don't know about Eakins 
is that he was also an avid photographer who shot hundreds of pictures between 
the years 1880 and 1900. Out of sight for nearly a century, his photographs 
finally surfaced in 1985 when his friend and former student, Charles Bregler, 
donated them to the Pennsylvania Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Pennsylvania that Eakins' photographs got him into trouble, leading 
as they did to his dismissal as an instructor at the Academy in 1886. Like 
Leonardo da Vinci, Eakins was a scientifically minded artist who strove for 
accuracy and realism in his work. Inspired to investigate photography after 
seeing the motion studies of Eadweard Muybridge (whom he collaborated with on 
studies in animal locomotion in 1884-85), Eakins introduced photography to his 
students as a valuable tool in the pursuit of painting. 
</P>
<P>
 The way he introduced it was by organizing nude photo expeditions; he and his 
classes spent afternoons in the country where everyone -- Eakins included -- 
stripped and photographed each other. He had his students pose nude for one 
another in class, and exhibited nude photographs of himself and his wife at the 
Academy. Eakins' firing came in the wake of the passing of the Comstock Law of 
1873, an anti-obscenity ruling that triggered a dramatic acceleration in 
censorship; nonetheless, those naked field trips seem a bit outre, even by 
today's standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographs, though, are remarkable -- they have the casualness of 
snapshots and feel amazingly modern. They don't, however, have an erotic 
charge, perhaps because Eakins' nude sitters rarely reveal any trace of 
emotion. Much has been made by some critics of the homoerotic content of 
Eakins' photographs, but the subject never comes up in this books' overly 
polite essays. Rather, the text makes the case that Eakins found an intrinsic 
purity in the human form, and was the kind of nature boy who would've joined a 
nudist colony in the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Eadweard Muybridge pops up again in A History of Women Photographers, where 
he's quoted as saying that "the tedium of processing photographic plates makes 
the job best suited to women and chinks." Unfortunate comments like that make 
it clear why books like this need to exist. Actually, books as boring as this 
one don't need to exist; it's a valuable research tool, yes, but nothing you'll 
enjoy reading. Thoroughly researched by author Naomi Rosenblum, who trots out 
all the facts she corralled in neat, chronological order, it's the kind of dry, 
predictable book that makes you long for some crackpot revisionist theory. 
Women have yet to be accorded their rightful place in art history; 
well-intentioned though it is, drab books like this stand little chance of 
changing that. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of change, that's essentially the subject of Deborah Turbeville's 
Newport Remembered, a haunting eulogy to the gilded world of America's 
turn-of-the century millionaires who summered in homes so splendid they verged 
on parody. Juxtaposing images of old Newport mansions that continue to be 
maintained as though a horse-drawn carriage were about to approach, opposite 
pictures of the ruins of abandoned homes that read as visual metaphors for 
broken dreams, Turbeville's book has a cloistered, claustrophobic beauty well 
suited to the subject at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Also of note are Weston's Westons: California and the West, and Weston's 
Westons: Portraits and Nudes, separate volumes that serve as the catalogue for 
an exhibition of works by Edward Weston organized by the Museum of Fine Arts in 
Boston, where it opened in July. The plates are gorgeous, the text is 
informative, and both books include images that are rarely seen.

 My first memory of Art is green Jell-O and apple pie. On Sundays my father and 
I went to art museums -- neither my mother nor my brother would go. My father 
took too long for them; he lingered for hours in front of certain paintings. He 
took two steps forward and three steps back. But I was in it for the pie, the 
snack that came at the end. I had infinite patience. We started off together at 
the beginning of the exhibit. We looked at the first painting and then the 
second, and while he was still on the second I was on the third, the fourth, I 
had moved on to the next gallery. I went through the entire exhibition and then 
backward, returning to find him in the second room. He couldn't speak except to 
say, "In a little bit." I sat on a bench. I waited. I faced a painting -- 
Rubens or Rembrandt. The face of the figure was luminous, the fabric of the 
clothes unfolding. I sat watching and thought of my own efforts to draw -- to 
color. I examined the painting, the surface was smooth, the features of the 
figure delicate, there was the hint of a brush stroke, but only a hint. I 
wondered how art was made, how a painter could pull light out of a canvas. My 
father was a painter. On Wednesday nights a nude woman sat on a platform in our 
basement while my father and assorted other men and women drew pictures of 
her.I was not allowed downstairs. I was kept upstairs with my mother who made 
coffee and cut up fruit for fruit salad. On Sundays I sat on the bench in the 
museum looking at paintings, wondering what really went on in the basement, in 
all that silence with the door kept closed. People came and went, pushing 
strollers, carrying small children. Assorted strangers sat down next to me and 
sometimes their sleeves or their arms would touch mine and I would think of the 
nude woman in the basement and all the men and women drawing her and my own 
efforts -- to color -- and my stomach would growl. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quiet remove of the museum, guards hovering, my senses were heightened 
and everything became art -- the human traffic was a most modern dance. I 
learned choreography, social history. It was Pinteresque play, I picked up bits 
and pieces of dialogue. It was all a performance piece, a staged happening. I 
sat waiting for my father, for hours on end, a human camera, a recorder, 
watching. Later, when I was slightly older, more willing to wander, I took on 
the entirety of the museum, I left my father with his Realism and High 
Renaissance and went off on exploratory adventures; two new museums opened, the 
Hirshhorn and the East Wing of the National Gallery. I found Picasso, 
DeKooning, Pollock and Rothko. I found paintings and sculptures that told the 
story of who I was, who I wanted to be, articulating my impulses and 
impressions, speaking to me and for me, far better than I could speak for 
myself. 
</P>
<P>
 On my own, I raced forward through history, found the moment that was mine and 
then I went back again, back through the galleries, through history, looking 
for my father, hoping to pull him forward, to bring him with me.  
</P>
<P>
 "Almost," he'd say when I'd finally find him lost in another century, his eyes 
still fixed on a particular work. "In a minute." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fainting," I'd say. And I'd hear his stomach growl too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time for pie," he'd say, and finally there was something about which we 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 We'd go to the old cafeteria in the National Gallery -- the cafeteria itself 
as much a painting, an installation, a play, a work of art as any of the 
exhibits. It was all my father's beloved social realists and it was Edward 
Hopper, Richard Estees and Duane Hanson. And all of it from beginning to end 
was Warhol. It was pre and post and pop and old and chrome and shiny. My father 
would take a tray and go down the line, picking out first a slice of pie and 
then a piece of cake and maybe some chocolate pudding -- he always had a 
problem with cafeteria lines -- too many choices. I'd take a bowl of Jell-O 
cubes, red or green -- a delicacy, having come from a house where dessert was 
either carrot cake or zucchini bread. We'd sit at a table with cups of tea 
trying the various deserts, marveling at the colors, the textures. I'd swallow 
the Jell-O cubes, reveling in how they felt going down -- slimy but 
substantial, marvel at the idea that green and red could be flavors as well as 
colors. And when we were done, it was always late, close to closing time, and 
we'd make a mad dash for the gift shop -- this was the one moment when my 
father moved quickly, "with alacrity," he'd say. 
</P>
<P>
 My father was not a shopper, he didn't believe in buying anything other than 
what was needed, required, and as far as he was concerned almost everything I 
wanted was not required. The one exception was the gift shop -- I could have 
whatever I wanted -- these things were essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 It was late, the museum was closing, the guards had begun herding people 
toward the doors. We rushed, hurrying to gather what we could carry away with 
us; postcards, posters, reproductions and books, lots of books; exhibition 
catalogues, monographs, themed collections, biographies, all of it absolutely 
essential. We would stay until they asked us to leave, not once, not twice, but 
until the guards had to lead us out the long way -- around to the front of the 
building and through the already locked doors. 
</P>
<P>
 And while my parents' idea of a good Christmas present was big pad of paper 
and a box of pens, this year I have a few suggestions; 1994 brought wonderful 
exhibition catalogues from Willem DeKooning, R. B. Kitaj, Bruce Nauman, Robert 
Ryman, Cy Twombly, along with the playful Picasso: Sculptor/Painter, and a 
beautiful monograph on Odillon Redon -- the French painter, known as the Prince 
of Mysterious Dreams. The Andy Warhol Museum gives a behind-the-scenes look at 
how museums are built. The catalogue comes with a CD featuring bits and pieces 
of the Warhol tape archive -- the Velvet Underground rehearsing, etc. As 
companion volume -- the compulsively readable Death and Disaster: The Rise of 
The Warhol Empire and The Race For Andy's Millions by Paul Alexander, and for 
stocking stuffers, Warhol's Cats, Cats, Cats and Angels, Angels, Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the witty and ironic Prints of Roy Lichtenstein: A Catalogue 
Raisonne 1948-1993, the long awaited, The Power of Feminist Art, a true 
reference book with contributions by 18 of the movements, major figures 
including Linda Nochlin, Moria Roth, Suzanne Lacy and Arlene Raven. And 
Installation Art, the first history of one of the most significant and 
underreported -- due to the large scale and often impermanent nature of 
installation projects -- contemporary art forms. Vito Acconci by Kate Linker, a 
full-scale study of the New York-based artist best known for his early 
body/performance work. However, it is his more mature public art/sculptural 
pieces along the lines of the Adjustable Wall Bra 1990-1991, which take on 
issues of house and home and brilliantly illustrate how art at its best can at 
once be personal, political, humorous and philosophical. For the deliberately 
decorative and decorous: Stephen Calloway's Baroque: The Culture of Excess, and 
Pugin: A Gothic Passion, a scholarly and charming volume on perhaps the most 
influential designer/architect in 19th-Century Britain. Japanese Art After 
1945: Scream Against the Sky is that rare catalogue that is perhaps better than 
the exhibition. "Create what has never existed before," Yoshihara Jiro, leader 
of the Guitai association declared. With essays by architect Isozaki Arata, 
video artist Nam June Paik and others, this catalogue contains a critical 
anthology with extended citings of writings by artists and critics along with a 
glossary laying out historical events and groups essential to understanding 
postwar Japanese art. Isamu Noguchi, Essays and Conversations is eloquent and 
well-illustrated, with essays ranging from Noguchi's graceful proposal in 1927 
for a Guggenheim Foundation fellowship to his comments on his multiple 
collaborations with choreographer Martha Graham. The Museum of Modern Art's A 
Century of Artists' Books beautifully documents the history of the artists' 
books and collaborations. And for the real thing in contemporary artists' 
books, San Francisco Artspace's Real Gone, a collaboration between photographer 
Jack Pierson and novelist Jim Lewis.

 New York Dada 1915-23 by Frances M. Nauman, traces the roots and Dada in the 
New York art world to the living room of Walter and Louise Stevens Arensberg 
where writers and artists such as Marcel Duchamp, Charles Sheeler, Joseph 
Stella, congregated at the Paris salon of Gertrude Stein. This is the 
definitive volume on New York Dada -- a movement Robert Mcalmon prophetically 
referred to as "the small, sweet, forget-me-not of the war." 
</P>
<P>
 The Art Book is a kind of big art dictionary -- great for kids -- that 
suspends the timeline tradition of art history and arranges the artists 
alphabetically, one painting per artist. For those who prefer more thorough 
pondering, I highly recommend Theory and Philosophy of Art: Style, Artist, and 
Society, the latest volume of essays from legendary art historian and teacher 
Meyer Shapiro, which includes his well-known text on Freud and Leonardo da 
Vinci, also Embodied Meanings, from Arthur Danto, art critic for the Nation, 
and Making It New, a lively collection of essays, interviews and talks from the 
late Henry Geldzhaler.

<P>
 For the classicists among us -- my father included -- The Sistine Chapel: A 
Glorious Renovation, a beautiful history of the nine- year renovation of 
Michelangelo's monumental frescoes and Michelangelo: The Medici Chapel -- 
Michelangelo as sculptor with absolutely stunning black-and-white photographs 
by Aurelio Amendola. 
</P>
<P>
 Last but not least, my favorite volume of the year, highest marks for Howard 
Hodgkin by Andrew Graham-Dixon, chief art critic for the Independent in London. 
Howard Hodgkin is a painter I first encountered on one of those Sundays when my 
father cajoled me into going with him to the museums. Truly one of the most 
wondrous artists working, Hodgkin's paintings are intimate and intense, 
expressing the simultaneity of melancholia and ecstasy, representing neither 
the literal nor the narrative, but the impulses and emotions behind them. He is 
a psychological portraitist who, in describing his own work has said, "I paint 
representational pictures of emotional situations." And while nothing takes the 
place of seeing the work in person, these are the best reproductions to date of 
Hodgkin's work -- the Jell-O cubes and pie you'll have to supply yourself.

LOOK WHO'S TALKING: 'LOVING'S' DENNIS PARLATO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some actors love doing interviews, while others are reluctant or shy away from 
the press. The latter has always seemed to be the case with Dennis Parlato, who 
plays Clay Alden on "Loving." 
</P>
<P>
 Parlato turns out to be very talkative and charming, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I'm just not the best self-promoter," says the actor. "I'm not 
comfortable talking about myself. Also, I'm usually doing other projects in the 
theater so I'm just too busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Parlato, a native Californian, formerly taught high school English in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized teaching was not what I wanted to do as my primary career," says 
Parlato. "I knew I wanted to perform in some way. While teaching I sang with 
chamber concert groups. Then I began to study ballet and started to perform, 
cutting my teaching to half-time and then to substituting. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the age of 30, I came to New York City assuming I'd eventually get into 
acting. I auditioned for everything -- musicals, plays -- even ballet companies 
from Ireland and Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he studied dance, Parlato admits, "I had no training in acting or 
singing. It was all raw instinct until two years later when I was in 'A Chorus 
Line' on Broadway. Then I was making enough money to afford lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel most at home when I'm acting," he adds. "At first I worried that it 
would never be as fulfilling as dance, since dance was so engaging of the 
entire body. I was happy to discover acting engaged my entire being. I found I 
had more of a natural gift for acting. I found the career perfectly suited to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Parlato says he realized Clay Alden is one of the most multidimensional 
characters in daytime and sees his recent confinement to a wheelchair as 
another way to open Clay up -- instead of restricting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clay has been so shut out by his father Cabot (Wesley Addy)," says Parlato, 
"that he will do whatever it takes to get back into the game -- with Alden 
Enterprises and with Cabot. "When I first came on the show, I felt it was such 
a shame that Cabot was dead. Clay had so much history with him that it would 
make for dynamic confrontations. Now that Cabot is alive after all, I get to 
play all that out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd also love to play out the fact that Clay sees that his parents actually 
love Alex Masters (Randolph Mantooth), who had once impersonated Clay. It's 
maddening to Clay." 
</P>
<P>
 Parlato also has no doubt who should be Clay's leading lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwyn Alden (played by Christine Tudor), he says. "There is such rich 
understanding and humor between them. Now that Gwyn has been allowed to blossom 
and let go of Clay, it would be two different people coming together. I don't 
know how much more I can take of Deborah Brewster (Nancy Addison Altman). 
Sometimes I'd like to shove something down her throat to shut her up." 
</P>
<P>
 The actor credits the show with giving him the freedom to rework the scripts 
when necessary if he feels they are not being true to his character. He feels 
so strongly that he says, "If they refused, and if it was on something I felt 
compromised by, I'd tell them to get another actor to do it. Luckily, that 
hasn't happened." 
</P>
<P>
 "Loving" airs weekdays at 11 a.m. on ABC.

<P>
By THOMAS MOORE, Thomas Moore is the author of Care of the Soul, Soul Mates and 
Meditations: On the Monk Who Dwells in Daily Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In these days of CD/ROMs, Internet and data-retrieval systems, it's easy to 
forget that a book is a book, something to hold in your hands, keep preciously 
on your shelf and treat with some reverence. Artful covers, imagistic 
bookmarks, creative typography, textured paper, cloth binding, impressive 
spines and colorful endpapers all make a book a thing of beauty, and, along 
with other simple tools of reading -- wooden bookshelves, reading glasses and 
soft lighting -- help sustain important old values in a time of lightning-fast 
information processing. The serifs, swirls and florid patterns that animate the 
books under consideration here pleasure the heart and imagination, even if the 
mind would settle pragmatically for a clear page and plain type. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject matter of these books also marks a major turn in public concern, 
toward an intelligent, tolerant, earnest search for the sacred. In the current 
world of publishing, angels, death, chant and soul reflect what may be the 
identifying characteristic of the '90s -- a new interest in spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 What I like about these books is that they are not abstract, moralistic or 
excessively interpretive. They give us plenty of images and tell in full-bodied 
language the popular traditions, poetry and stories of religions around the 
world. This is exactly what we need today. We have enough people telling us 
what we should believe and how we should act. These books offer an enticing 
invitation to the rich images of the religious life, encouraging us to find our 
own imaginative ways to deepen our lives and tend the spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Saints: A Visual Almanac of the Virtuous, Pure, Praiseworthy, and Good by Tom 
Morgan is an owner's manual for those who want to live once again in the daily 
presence of saints. Its pages are alive with rich design, color and 
illustration; its content gives us all we need to get started on a 
saint-conscious life: a glossary of terms once much in vogue and now 
fossilized, a calendar of saints, lists noting areas of patronage (Funeral 
Directors, look up Joseph of Arimathea) and brief, wonderfully told 
biographies. 
</P>
<P>
 The book has the look and feel of a maker who is sensitive to the materials of 
this world and to the texture of words. He paints the saints he knows in vivid, 
luscious language and pictures. St. Peter Celestine, listed as patron of 
bookbinders, clearly had a hand in this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Saints: The Chosen Few by Manuela Duun-Mascetti is also filled with 
brilliantly presented illustrations and also provides a Who's Who of saints, as 
well as descriptions of rituals, pilgrimages, miracles and offerings. This book 
considers saints in a broad context -- in Islam, Judaism, Hinduism and Buddhism 
-- and suggests to me that we could each make our own catalogue of saints, 
whether from a religious tradition or from our own acquaintances, family or 
national life. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversations With God: Two Centuries of Prayers by African Americans gives us 
extraordinary examples of how language often finds blood and character as it 
serves holy rather than merely utilitarian purposes. Consider these lines from 
a 1980 sermon by James Brown: 
</P>
<P>
 We are nothing but a chaff before the wind  
</P>
<P>
 Before the wind  
</P>
<P>
 We get raindrop in the morning just as  
</P>
<P>
 Bloom of the lily.  
</P>
<P>
 By noon we cut off wilt and die  
</P>
<P>
 Die!  
</P>
<P>
 Have mercy, if thou only so please  
</P>
<P>
 O yeah  
</P>
<P>
 When our spirituality has soul, it's alive with color, deep feeling, image and 
song. For too long we've lived a split in religion of intellect and emotion, 
and its resolution is not to be found in an intellectual balancing act, but in 
a different direction altogether, where the emphasis is on image, language and 
texture. We seem to be rediscovering finally what African-American spirituality 
has long cherished: beauty and expressiveness as a path to divinity. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the choirs of angel books rushing into print, we have two. Cherubs: 
Angels of Love is a grand valentine to the putti that have added sentimental 
grace to hundreds of paintings and greeting cards. I like to see sentimentality 
contained by the beauty of these images and the special papers and textures of 
the book, rather than bleeding into our politics and our image of ourselves as 
a nation. This book is for those who love, as I do, the excessive sensuality of 
Venus and Cupid. 
</P>
<P>
 Angels: The Mysterious Messengers is the companion volume to the NBC 
television series of the same name. It's a gathering of many voices and several 
points of view, for the most part in interview format, discussing the theology 
and science of angels, as well as personal interpretations and experiences. 
This is not a panel report by serious "angelologists," but it does cover just 
about every question anyone might ask about angels, and it contains a few 
genuine insights. 
</P>
<P>
 In it Malcolm Godwin suggests that we are encountering angels today because 
"we are counterbalancing the loss of the numinous, the loss of the magical. We 
seem to have lost some essential mystery -- some deeper experience which human 
beings require." Angels are more than a compensation, and yet all of these 
books indicate that we are indeed feeling a loss of profound mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Painted Prayers: Women's Art in Village India by Stephen P. Huyler is a book 
of extraordinarily beautiful photographs of women's holy art, which has lessons 
of great relevance and importance to teach us -- that ordinary arts keep the 
religious imagination alive, that our psychological problems don't need 
analysis and change as much as they need pious expression at a spiritual level, 
and that our homes are the primary temples of everyday piety. 
</P>
<P>
 These photographs show how to live an enchanted life in a sacred world, an 
attitude obviously quite foreign to modern America, yet badly needed. I'm 
struck by the similarities between this Indian approach to art and the "natural 
magic" developed by 15th-Century European artists and theologians. It's a 
secret of ordinary spirituality lost in the megabytes of our information 
highways and our speed-driven roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The Art of Devotion in the Late Middle Ages in Europe by Henk van Os is 
another book of enthralling paintings, altarpieces and sculptures. It is 
published in connection with a current exhibit at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. 
Not only is it valuable to see from an art historian's point of view how art 
plays a central role in devotional practices, it's also helpful to be reminded 
of the place of devotion in life. We often give attention to intellectual 
analysis or technological progress, but are we devoted enough to deep values of 
the heart? Even in religion the accent may be placed on ethics and belief, 
while devotion is considered old-fashioned. Some studies even suggest that 
devotion inspired by art objects has long played a role in the spiritual 
treatment of illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Huston Smith has now published The Illustrated World's Religions: A 
Guide to Our Wisdom Traditions. As a student of Huston Smith at Syracuse 
University I discovered his passionate intellect and immense heart. He is the 
world's ambassador to religions everywhere, a role hinted at by the book's 
jacket photo, which shows him with his arm around the shoulders of the Dalai 
Lama. 
</P>
<P>
 This book is an illustrated, "refined" version of his classic "The World's 
Religions," originally entitled "The Religions of Man." He writes clearly, 
warmly and appreciatively, not about religious institutions, but about the 
vision contained in the major traditions. Sadly, as a society we have yet to 
discover the guidance and wisdom just waiting for our attention in the great 
literature, iconography and poetry of the world's religions. Faced with our 
family and social problems, I believe it would be far better to spend one 
thoughtful hour with Huston Smith's book than to hunt and search for yet 
another psychological method or sociological explanation for our distress. 
</P>
<P>
 But these books are not about distress, they are celebrations of the religious 
imagination that one hopes is making a colorful and inspiring return. Many 
still associate religion with prohibitions of all kinds and sober, intense 
belief. But these books give us joyful color, rousing poetical sermons, 
fantastic saints, comforting angels and houses painted to entice divinity. Now 
that's religion worth resurrecting.*

 "Great Art Treasures of the Hermitage Museum," a handsomely boxed, two-volume 
work that weighs in at over 20 pounds, is one of the luxury items in bookstores 
this season. In that category, however, it is a real bargain, with over 1,500 
impeccably produced color photographs and a succinct series of texts and labels 
written by the curatorial staff, full of precise and valuable information. It 
is unusual in its stress on the extraordinary diversity of the St. Petersburg 
museum holdings, rather than just on the paintings, which are the largest and 
best-known part of the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hermitage is one of the few museums -- along with the Louvre and the 
Metropolitan -- that contain not only painting and sculpture, but extensive 
archeological collections, ethnic and decorative arts: furniture, textiles, 
ceramics, glass, clothing, metal works, and so on, endlessly. The building that 
houses it, the Winter Palace of the Russian czars, is itself of historical and 
artistic importance. 
</P>
<P>
 How was such a huge collection amassed in this Northern city? The stories of 
how the pieces arrived in the collection collectively offer the reader a 
fascinating look inside the Russian empire, as they outline purchases of large, 
privately owned collections in mass by Catherine the Great, confiscations of 
private collections by the Communist Revolution, important archeological digs 
and chance discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 It is striking that, unlike most such catalogues, these volumes are very 
politically correct, not only in their emphasis on diversity and ethnicity, but 
also on their refusal to suggest any differences in value between what used to 
be called "Fine Arts" and "Minor Arts" or crafts. Another very up-to-date 
aspect is the organization of the illustrations, primarily notable in the 
section on painting, where the divisions by country and date seem rather 
loosely applied. The illustrations seem to be arranged largely by subject 
matter, juxtaposing portraits or still lives or landscapes of very different 
periods or schools, presumably for provocative comparisons. The method has its 
drawbacks. One of the most famous elements in the Hermitage is the large number 
of very fine Rembrandts, and having the illustrations of his works widely 
scattered diminishes the impact of the Hermitage's real riches in this area. 
For the general reader, however, this is almost certainly a more stimulating 
way of enjoying the collection.  
</P>
<P>
 What troubles me most about this work is that while it demonstrates 
magnificently the enormous beauty and value of this great museum to the entire 
world, it never suggests that the collection is in dire peril. With the 
possible exception of the great Antiquities Museum in Cairo, the Hermitage is 
the only truly world-class museum that is not being maintained as it should. 
The building -- and therefore everything in it -- is severely imperiled by 
damp, always a major problem in water-logged St. Petersburg. This is creating 
dry rot to a shocking degree, and opens the structure to the danger of mold and 
the disintegration of the stucco on the exterior. The whole building lacks 
fire-proofing or adequate protection. While very large sums of money and 
brilliant workmanship have been lavished on the restoration, and even 
reconstitution, of the great palaces around St. Petersburg that were virtually 
destroyed in World War II, the Winter Palace, having escaped the war's 
destruction, has been allowed very quietly to decay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hermitage has been sending out loan shows of some of its greatest 
treasures in an attempt to raise funds, as Cairo has done with its traveling 
show of the Tutankhamen treasures; but that is a lengthy process and, at best, 
a stop-gap measure. Time is increasingly on the side of disaster. Moreover, 
such shows always mean that the very things visitors go to the museum to see 
are too often not there. A second problem is that large parts of the Hermitage 
are closed to the public for various reasons, including the simple lack of 
money to keep the whole place open in financially strapped Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In looking through these volumes, I was struck by the number of pieces 
illustrated here that were simply not on view the last time I visited the 
Hermitage a year and a half ago. This included not only the "treasure rooms" 
where the unique gold objects of Scythian, Greek and Sassanid workmanship are 
kept, but also a disturbing number of fine paintings. The Rembrandts were on 
view; yet of what is called here "the largest collection of Spanish paintings 
outside of Spain" there was on display only a small group easily equaled and 
even excelled in a dozen other museums. 
</P>
<P>
 These volumes are clear evidence of just how much the Hermitage owns that is 
truly exciting but that the museum can't afford to show to the public. This is 
a genuine tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Art of all kinds requires constant care, conservation and cleaning -- 
particularly in our time, when the air itself is full of pollutants, a danger 
never faced before. The Hermitage desperately needs the kind of intervention 
that UNESCO often gives and the kind of international intervention on the scale 
of the cleaning of the Sistine Chapel by Japanese backers, the donations made 
by the J. Paul Getty Trust to such treasures as the cleaning and conservation 
of the tomb of Nefertari in Egypt, or the "Save Venice" campaign (though one 
would hope for more efficiency than that organization has shown). 
</P>
<P>
 Abrams has produced this sumptuous work and made it a valuable as well as a 
beautiful product, not simply a showy piece of conspicuous luxury. It sets out 
its information clearly and simply, avoiding value judgments and letting the 
photographs speak for themselves. It is, frankly, somewhat unwieldy and not 
designed for reading in bed, but it is a great pleasure and a book to which one 
can return again and again. We can only hope that it remains a guide and a 
reminder, not a memorial.*

SEASON'S READINGS; STEPSON OF THE GOLDEN WEST; WHO'S BUYING THE SQUARE-JAWED 
BOOKS ABOUT THE WEST? EASTERNERS LOOKING FOR MYTH? OR WESTERNERS THEMSELVES,

 "Twelfth Night" 
</P>
<P>
 Why do people in the South sing, "I wish I was in Dixie"? Aren't they already? 
I ask this question not because I intend to answer it, but to underscore my 
ignorance of the South.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm not from the South or the East, and were I the famed only-known inhabitant 
of the North Pole, I wouldn't pick my busy season to write about it. No, like 
many of you, I'm a Westerner. 
</P>
<P>
 What does the word conjure? Likely a man. On horseback, just as likely. Spare 
of speech. Sure of step, and keen of aspect. Broad of back, and hard of jaw. 
Eye of newt, and toe of just a minute here. 
</P>
<P>
 Whose West is this? Not mine, nor anyone's I know. It's the Cowboy West of a 
hundred years ago and 3,000 miles away, of dime novels and B Westerns, and 
what, beggin' your pardon ma'am, is it doing in my head? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm supposed to know better. I was born here. I catch myself saying lately, 
sounding like some nativist Wilsonista when all I really mean is, I am a son of 
the urban West. My home is here. The only wide open spaces I miss are the 
unmetered ones. Growing up I played cops and robbers, not cowboys and Indians. 
I rode bicycles, not ponies -- except at Ponyland, where patient colts gave 
skittish children slow, swaying rides until one morning the Beverly Center up 
and landed on them. (A friend told me once that these ponies narrowly escaped 
the mall and fled into the Santa Monica mountains to thrive there even today -- 
a rumor I need far too much ever to investigate.) 
</P>
<P>
 Begin again. That's what the West is for, isn't it -- new beginnings, second 
chances? About me now lie several new gift books about the West. Two of them 
have horsemen on their covers. Another shows a man in a checked shirt riding a 
wild-eyed bull. A fourth cover reproduces Roy Rogers, hands folded across his 
silver saddle, eyes fixed lonesomely on some distant point beyond the camera. 
Maybe he's pining for Dale, his co-author on yet another new book, their joint 
autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 Does America really need two books about the King of the Cowboys this holiday 
season? Who's buying them? Easterners looking to confirm their misapprehensions 
of the West? Or Westerners themselves, trying to deny the new West they live 
in? 
</P>
<P>
 In all likelihood, buyers of books about Roy Rogers and his West break down 
along generational lines, not geographic ones. They're nostalgic for their 
childhoods, something I can certainly understand. But nobody's writing gift 
books about my childhood, and frankly I'm starting to feel a little left out. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Western gift book harvest divides into two main stacks. Books 
about the Old West, and books about TV about the Old West. About the New West, 
the citified West, hardly a chirp. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of this winter's Western book crop, and unfortunately the most 
expensive, is The West: A Treasury of Art and Literature. It's a roughly 
chronological coffee-table roundup of writing, painting and photography about 
the region, and the selection is, with few exceptions, wise and well informed. 
You knew Twain and Cather and Ed "West Minister" Abbey would make the cut, and 
maybe you hoped for Leslie Marmon Silko and Larry McMurtry (both included), but 
Robert Louis Stevenson and Sir Richard Francis Burton (even if he is 
mysteriously defrocked to Richard F. Burton) are definitely gravy. 
</P>
<P>
 Editors T. H. and Joan Watkins conclude their chrestomathy with a section 
called, promisingly, "Living in the New West," and cap that section and the 
book with a Wallace Stegner essay so good it makes me want to spit. 
</P>
<P>
 It begins, "There are thousands more federal employees in the West than there 
are cowboys -- more bookkeepers, aircraft and electronics workers, auto 
mechanics, printers, fry cooks. There may be more writers. Nevertheless, when 
most Americans east of the Missouri hear the word 'West' they think "cowboy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes. Hell, yes. That's the kind of passage you hesitate to quote because 
it makes everything on either side of it look like nougat. But what do the 
Watkinses pick to share the "Living in the New West" section with it? 
</P>
<P>
 Try excerpts from "Cowboys Are My Weakness" and "Riding the White Horse Home." 
</P>
<P>
 Try "The Trail Home" and "Going Back to Bisbee." 
</P>
<P>
 Try "Blue Desert" and "The Solace of Open Spaces" and "Greetings from Wisdom, 
Montana." 
</P>
<P>
 Meet the New West, same as the Old West. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a Mecca in the West. In California, in fact. My atlas places it just 
northwest of the Salton Sea. This surprises me, since I've visited the area 
more than once, and don't remember it. Maybe Mecca is like that. 
</P>
<P>
 There's another one in the Midwest. Mecca, just north of Terre Haute, if you 
can believe it. The same Terre Haute where a journalist named Soule once 
printed a piece of advice he paraphrased from Shakespeare's Christmas play, 
only to have it taken up by another newspaperman, name of Greeley. 
</P>
<P>
 There must be others on the map, but between the names, like the sodbuster 
West I try to disavow. Try praying away from Mecca, just try. So let the cowboy 
Westerners go on misleading the rest of the world, and let the world go on 
misreading us. Whether Westward-ho signifies the wagonmaster's cry, or a 
supermarket, there are more Wests than one Westerner can ever encompass. Nobody 
ever writes about your home just how you want them to. I see that now.

THEATER; AIMING HIGH WITH 'ASSASSINS'; PETER ELLENSTEIN HAS WANTED TO STAGE THE 
UNSETTLING STEPHEN SONDHEIM/JOHN WEIDMAN MUSICAL FOR TWO YEARS, AND HIS 
PERSISTENCE PAID OFF FOR LOS ANGELES REPERTORY COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephen Sondheim may be the composer most likely to succeed -- with the least 
likely of topics. 
</P>
<P>
 From the overzealous slice-n-shaver of "Sweeney Todd" to the 
depressive-obsessive heroine of his current hit, "Passion," he has found songs 
in the hearts of the schmucky and the sickly. And that's also true with 
"Assassins," a less familiar 1991 effort getting its local professional 
premiere at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical features -- you guessed it -- such swell fellas as John Wilkes 
Booth, Lee Harvey Oswald and John Hinckley. It's not your average chorus 
line(up). Yet that's precisely the irony that makes the show go. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing fast and loose with historical chronology, Sondheim and writer John 
Weidman revel in the contradictions. The work meditates on what makes President 
killers (and wanna-bes) tick -- in a land where, as one song's lyrics put it, 
"Everybody's got the right to their dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Mary Sunshine" the show definitely is not. "It's certainly an 
uncomfortable topic for a musical," says director Peter Ellenstein, seated in 
LATC's 90-seat Theatre 4, where this Los Angeles Repertory Company staging is 
being performed as part of the first subscription season at the downtown venue 
since its resident company folded in 1991. After selling out its regular run, 
the show has just extended through Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not an easy show to watch for most people," Ellenstein says. That's 
because "Assassins," like the majority of Sondheim's most enduring works, is 
unapologetically ambivalent. "These people and the horrible acts they committed 
made them into villains," says Ellenstein, 33, who is also managing director of 
L.A. Rep. "But had they not committed those acts, they were victims -- of a 
relationship or a world that did not treat them well -- and it built into a 
desperation to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 The premise of "Assassins" is that the folks who take potshots at Presidents 
aren't so different from the rest of us. They're driven by a twisted version of 
the same American dream that prompts little kids to aspire to the highest 
office in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, they're after their own 15 minutes in the spotlight. "These 
people are trying to fulfill a backward American dream of achieving notoriety, 
success or changing the world," Ellenstein says. "Though we can and should 
condemn their acts, we need to understand that they came from the same impulses 
that we all have." 
</P>
<P>
 The musical also asks its audience to consider the context -- how people may 
be driven to violence by the conditions of their existence. "If people do 
things that you don't approve of because they are in a particular situation, to 
just dismiss them as 'bad' or 'evil' is a convenient way of not taking 
responsibility for the world that you live in," Ellenstein says. Ergo, 
crackpots are people too. "The play asks us not to be dismissive of people who 
are driven to extremes," Ellenstein says. "Al though we can condemn their 
actions, we (need to) look at the causes and the reality of what made them do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Possible motives -- and a good deal more -- are suggested over the two 
intermissionless hours it takes to perform "Assassins." The musical introduces 
us to Booth, Hinckley, McKinley assassin Leon Czolgosz, Garfield killer Charles 
Guiteau, attempted F.D.R. assassin Giuseppe Zangara, wanna-be Nixon nemesis Sam 
Byck, klutzy Gerald Ford attackers Squeaky Fromme and Sara Jane Moore and, 
later on, Lee Harvey Oswald. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these angry souls makes his or her case, and there are also scenes in 
which the characters come together across the decades. The music throughout is 
characteristically Sondheim-esque, yet it also conjures an array of American 
idioms from barbershop through folk, with the spirits of Copland and Sousa 
hovering in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assassins" premiered at New York's Playwrights' Horizons in 1991, but it 
wasn't well-received. In 1992, however, it went on to a markedly successful 
London run. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ellenstein has been after the rights ever since. "I first applied for the 
rights about two years ago and (Music Theatre International, which controls the 
rights to most of Sondheim's works, except some of his earliest efforts) said, 
'Well, we're hoping for a major production in L.A. If not, we'll talk about 
it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ellenstein then penned a letter to MTI, in which he detailed not only his 
thoughts on "Assassins," but also a bit of information about L.A. Rep, a group 
founded in 1966 by, among others, Ellenstein's father, actor-director Robert 
Ellenstein, who currently serves as artistic director. "We rehearse for a long 
time," says the younger Ellenstein. "We do workshops and take a lot of care 
with the pieces that we present." 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which has no permanent base, has a commitment to, as their 
literature states, "reviving theatrical treasures that have fallen into 
disuse." They have staged the works of writers as varied as Shakespeare, Eugene 
O'Neill, Samuel Beckett and Clifford Odets and garnered particular acclaim for 
the senior Ellenstein's 1967 and 1993 productions of Shaw's "Misalliance" and a 
six-actor "Hamlet" first mounted in 1987 and again this season. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Rep also has some well-connected supporters. One of them, veteran musical 
theater artist David Craig, put Ellenstein in touch with Sondheim's personal 
agent, Flora Roberts, and that proved essential to the "Assassins" production. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, as L.A. Rep was putting together an in-house reading of the 
musical, they learned that MTI would finally be releasing the rights in L.A., 
and that the company was in the running to get them. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with that encouraging news, they went ahead with a reading. "It had such 
a mixed reaction that it was amazing -- from people who absolutely hated it to 
people who were completely intrigued," recalls Ellenstein. "One of the purposes 
of theater is to stimulate ideas and discussion and this certainly did that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The rights were granted over the summer and L.A. Rep set to work. Sondheim did 
not participate in the production, although Ellenstein was able to avail 
himself of an MTI-provided video of Sondheim and Weidman talking about 
"Assassins." 
</P>
<P>
 He found the tape useful in furthering his own thinking about the piece, 
particularly with regard to the notion of society's collective culpability. "I 
think the authors' intent was to get people to look at an America that creates 
these kinds of people," Ellenstein says. "All you have to do is walk outside. 
Any one of those people is a potential assassin, an uncared-for person who, 
given the opportunity to seize power for a moment, maybe would." 
</P>
<P>
 A bad situation is made worse, Ellenstein feels, because we tend to see our 
actions as apart from the social fabric. "We don't look at things and ask, 'How 
is what I'm doing reinforcing the things that I like or don't like?' " 
Ellenstein says. "It's the old adage that if you're not part of the solution, 
you're part of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to move past a violent society, we have to examine the worst aspects 
of society and bring them up, because we can't move forward without them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of assassins, Ellenstein feels that neglect may well perpetuate 
the problem. Clearly, it has not gone away, as the recent case of accused White 
House assailant Francisco Martin Duran demonstrates. In fact, Duran, who is 
said to have fired on the Clinton residence, was indicted on the same day that 
"Assassins" opened in L.A. -- a coincidence that's not lost on the director. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will continue to happen, as it just did, as long as people feel 
disempowered and the only form of empowerment they can find is in taking some 
violent action," he says. "The only way these individuals have power is by 
slapping a gun in their hand. They do something that is within their power to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The task, according to Ellenstein, is to make fewer people feel so powerless 
-- whether their alienation is personal, economic or societal. "It's the lack 
of care in most of these assassins that makes them feel isolated," he says. 
"Part way through rehearsal, I realized that every one of these scenes is about 
these people's desperate reaching out for love." 
</P>
<P>
 Without that sense of belonging -- or food and shelter -- people may turn 
against the society that they blame for putting them on the outs. "People who 
don't feel safe are dangerous," Ellenstein says. "Helplessness breeds rage, and 
all of these people are helpless." 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, Ellenstein argues that assassins are not so different from 
other less-notorious criminals. "They are the extreme of a lot of people," he 
says. "The guy who robs the liquor store just chose a different way of 
expressing his frustration than the person who goes up to kill the President." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not a thesis that's going to make anyone sleep better at night. Nor is 
it standard musical theater fare. But it is what makes Sondheim tick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sondheim is not for the masses," cautions Ellenstein. "For the average person 
who's watching TV and deadening their brain cells every day, to come here and 
all of a sudden have to be on the level of a genius is hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's an effort that Ellenstein feels pays off. "You can't just walk out 
whistling it," Ellenstein continues. "It deserves a lot of chewing. All of the 
best things do. But even if they hated the show, they go out trying to figure 
it out."

PERFORMING ARTS; ON THE RECORD; FROM VERDI: 'OTELLO' AND 'FALSTAFF'

<P>
 Deutsche Grammophon's new "Otello" (439 805, two CDs) is noteworthy among 
recent Verdi recordings for the presence in two difficult-to-cast leading roles 
of singers with imposing and reliable -- not merely make-do -- voices that are 
employed to create character and to convey some of opera's grandest music and 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking about Placido Domingo in his third recorded go at the title role 
and Cheryl Studer's first recorded Desdemona. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a production dominated by a superstar conductor and his 
super-orchestra, although Myung-Whun Chung and the Orchestra of the Bastille 
Opera -- who will have parted company (Bastille's loss) by the time these words 
appear -- are positive factors, as is the lusty Bastille Opera Chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo may have lost something in amplitude and altitude since both his 1978 
RCA recording under James Levine and the soundtrack, conducted by Lorin Maazel, 
of the 1985 Zeffirelli film (on EMI Video and CD), but his portrayal here is 
even more intensely dramatic, his characterization more complex and sympathetic 
than on either earlier occasion. Some good things do get even better with age. 
</P>
<P>
 Studer's detractors credit her versatility to a lack of distinctive vocal 
timbre, while supporters, this listener among them, continue to admire the 
intelligence of her portrayals and the solidity of her instrument: no wobbling, 
no shrieking, no fudging in matters of pitch. And here, to complement 
Desdemona's compliant sweetness, Studer projects every bit of steel that 
Shakespeare and librettist Boito allow her. 
</P>
<P>
 The production would have been an outright marvel if the third principal were 
as imposing. But Sergei Leiferkus' baritone lacks the burliness of an ideal 
Iago, and he is not comfortable in the Italian language. His response to these 
shortcomings is lots of snarling and artificial voice-darkening. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's some compensation in the Russian singer's attention to Verdi's 
dynamic markings, and he even possesses a serviceable trill. Leiferkus' 
strongest moment comes in the Act III exchange with Cassio (a flavorful bit by 
tenor Ramon Vargas), where he becomes the devilishly clever schemer his 
creators intended. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung's conducting has its impatient moments, but his interpretation is 
intelligently conceived and atmospheric. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly impressive is his shaping of the all-revealing Otello-Desdemona 
confrontation culminating in "Dio! mi potevi." Chung also shows a wise regard 
for the value of holding something in reserve en route to the biggest climaxes, 
e.g., in "Si, pel ciel." 
</P>

 Riccardo Muti adds his name to the list of distinguished con ductors to record 
Verdi's last word on the subject of opera, "Falstaff" (Sony 58961, two CDs). 
This live recording employing the orchestra and chorus of La Scala, where the 
performances from which it derives took place in June of 1993, is as much 
Muti's show as the famous 1950 NBC radio performance was Toscanini's. 
</P>
<P>
 This, however, is not one of Muti's mad dashes. The pacing is varied according 
to the dramatic situation, but devoid of expressive rubato and dynamic 
subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the would-be dazzlingly witty opening sequence in the Garter Inn falls 
flat. The Merry Wives' letter-reading scene is rhythmically rigid and rushed, 
adding to Daniela Dessi's already pronounced flutter in Alice Ford's 
higher-lying music and robbing the scene of its giddy charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Roberto Frontali's Master Ford is a dramatic cipher outside the 
confines of his aria, which he delivers spiritedly, if without much vocal 
allure.  
</P>
<P>
 But what of the title role? Well, the Spanish baritone Juan Pons does more 
singing , as differentiated from vocal mugging -- and with commendable accuracy 
-- than most Falstaffs, and he is as ingratiating as his niggardly boss (Muti) 
will allow. It would be nice to hear Pons in less inhibiting circumstances than 
here, where Falstaff is too much a function of the conductor's efficient, 
joyless concept of what this most humane of operas is about.

ART NOTES; 21ST CENTURY REDESIGN FOR OLD GLORY

 San Francisco's Capp Street Project is celebrating its 10th anniversary with a 
forward-looking benefit exhibition and sale. Executive Director Linda Blumberg 
has invited 80 artists, architects and designers to redesign the American flag 
for "Old Glory, New Story: Flagging the 21st Century," on view through Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The coming of a new millennium seemed a good time to examine a hallowed symbol 
of the country and to think about possible models for the future, Blumberg 
says. She encouraged participants to create a new flag or symbol of the United 
States for the 21st Century, with no restrictions on forms or materials. 
</P>
<P>
 A widely varied array of unorthodox works fills two floors of Capp Street's 
building at 525 2nd St., near the soon-to-open San Francisco Museum of Modern 
Art. Some pieces are fairly faithful renditions of the flag, fabricated in odd 
materials. For his work, "Strikes Anywhere," Doug Hollis constructed a flag of 
matches; Ray Beldner's patchwork creation, "For Calvin Coolidge," is made of 
fabric from business suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sam, on the other hand, used a real sombrero for his canvas, painting red 
and white stripes around the brim and covering the crown with white stars on a 
blue background.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great show," says Blumberg. "It showcases an abundance of talent while 
exploring the elasticity of a 200-year-old icon."

 BUILDINGS R ART: An upcoming panel discussion on "Architects, Artists and 
Public Art" will air issues that have been a subject of hot debate during 
Culver City's ongoing deliberations over whether to consider architecture as 
art in percent-for-art development projects. Joe Lewis, an artist and arts 
administrator, will moderate the discussion with architecture critic Joseph 
Giovannini, public arts administrator Barbara Goldstein, artist Mark Allen Lere 
and architect Eric Owen Moss. Sponsored by the Southern California Institute of 
Architecture and the Los Angeles Forum for Architecture and Urban Design, the 
free event is scheduled for Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the Box, 8520 National 
Blvd., Culver City. Information: (213) 852-7145 or (310) 574-1123.

 GALLERY MOVES: The intersection of Nebraska Avenue and Berkeley Street, in a 
Santa Monica industrial zone northeast of the Bergamot Station arts complex, is 
shaping up as the Southland's newest gallery enclave. Robert Gunderman and 
Randy Sommer, formerly of Food House, have opened their second show at Acme, 
1800-B Berkeley St., featuring works by Monique Prieto,Michael Norton, Tammy 
Rosen and Tim Tattu. Just around the corner, at 3026 1/2 Nebraska Ave., Dan 
Bernier, former director of A/B Gallery, has launched a gallery under his own 
name with a show of drawings by Russell Crotty. The cooperative gallery Hello 
Artichoke has moved from Hollywood to 3028 Nebraska Ave. And coming soon is 
Marc Fox, who has left Angles Gallery to open his own space later this month at 
3026 Nebraska Ave.

 Now that you've seen "Scarlett" -- or even if you haven't -- here's a chance 
to see, minus commercials and segmenting, the most beloved American movie of 
them all. The glorious 1939 David O. Selnick production of Margaret Mitchell's 
Civil War novel has a perfect cast, headed by Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara 
(pictured) and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler. The great thing about "GWTW" is 
that it means different things at different ages; the older you get it seems 
more about survival than romance (TBS Tuesday at 5:05 p.m.).

<TEXT>

 This spirited 1991 comedy turns upon the amusing notion that the stars of TV 
soap operas have lives as screwed up and crazy as those of the characters they 
play, if not more so. Presiding over the long-running soap in question, "The 
Sun Also Sets," is America's sweetheart (Sally Field), who at 42 is beginning 
to wonder if there's more to life than tearfully saying such lines as, "I'm 
guilty of love -- guilty of love in the first-degree." Watching Kevin Kline (as 
her lecherous old flame), arguably the supreme farceur of his generation, meet 
his match in Field is very much of a treat (Cinemax, Sunday at 6:15 p.m.; 
Friday at 10:30 a.m.). Kenneth Turan

 A radiant Jessica Tandy stars in this 1991 TV movie as a widow who discovers 
the perfect way to feel useful: telling stories to children on public-access 
TV. But ambitious ad agency executive -- and single mother -- Stephanie 
Zimbalist, however, thinks the elegant elderly woman who has captivated her 
lonely young daughter (Lisa Jakub, pictured) would be perfect on a network, 
sponsored by a key Zimbalist client, a toy manufacturer. Be warned: After 
having created real people in real predicaments under Larry Elikann's brisk, 
perceptive direction, "The Story Lady" opts for an ending that is strictly 
fairy tale itself (Disney, Sunday at 11 p.m., Saturday at 7:30 p.m.). Kevin 
Thomas

CRITIC'S PICK: 'JACQUOT DE NANTES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Near the beginning of this 1993 release, which is French director Agnes 
Varda's enchanting tribute to her late husband, director Jacques Demy, Varda 
tells us that Demy's "childhood was his treasure and the source of inspiration 
for his films." She aptly describes her film as "an evocation" -- a biography 
of Demy's early years in Nantes in western France on the Loire River.It is 
seamlessly punctuated with clips from his films and with loving glimpses of the 
gaunt but still gallant Demy, who occasionally comments on his life and work. 
The heart of the matter is how as a boy Demy, who was born in 1931 and died of 
leukemia in 1990, evolved into a self-taught filmmaker by the time he had 
reached his teens. Philippe Maron (pictured, with Brigitte De Villepoix as 
Demy's mother), Edouard Joubeaud and Laurent Monnier play Jacquot at different 
ages (Cinemax, Wednesday at 8 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

ALBUM REVIEW; THE BEATLES, THE BEEB, THE BEST; **** THE BEATLES "LIVE AT THE 
BBC"; CAPITOL  
</P>

 If you loved the rowdy audio postulations of the movie "Back Beat," or even if 
you didn't, here's the real deal: The 1962-65 Beatles, in the process of 
becoming the world's greatest original pop band, still getting over being one 
of the world's coolest bar bands. 
</P>
<P>
 In this 56-song set of recordings made for BBC radio are 30 tunes they never 
cut for commercial release: 29 rock classics, plus the Lennon-McCartney "I'll 
Be on My Way" (written for Liverpool homeboy Billy J. Kramer). That means far 
more John-as-Chuck-Berry or Paul the Little Richard wanna-be than the canon 
previously could bear, plus nods to still more forebears and contemporaries, 
from "I Forgot to Remember to Forget" to "Soldier of Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 26 that do have official studio counterparts -- split between more 
non-originals and familiar early-Beatle compositions -- some are close enough 
to serve mainly as a reminder that, yes, Virginia, there was a pre-overdubbing 
era when bands sounded the same "live" as not. Others are markedly rawer, and a 
few are improvements, like a revved-up "Slow Down" and an "I Wanna Be Your Man" 
with a much more randy Ringo vocal. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that the lads cut 90 different songs in 288 versions for BBC radio, the 
faithful will debate some of compiler George Martin's narrowing-down. As with 
Prince's "Black Album," die-hard collectors already own all this material and 
then some in similar-quality bootleg form (including an exhaustive, 
unauthorized nine-CD box set released last year). 
</P>
<P>
 For them, is there any reason to pick up Capitol's condensed official release? 
You bet: Martin's selections are generally savvy, the pacing is tight, the 13 
interview extracts are quick and silly enough to add to the giddy air, and the 
non-chronological sequence helps disperse primitive recordings amid the 
pristinely preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the vast majority who've never heard this, this isn't just historical 
artifact time, it's a two-hour twist party; at the risk of sounding unduly 
consumerist, every home with a rug to cut ought to have one. 
</P>
<P>
 * New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four (excellent).

 ENGLAND SWINGS: The Stone Roses, who disappeared for the five years between 
the release of their debut album and the impending follow-up "The Second 
Coming," aren't going much more high-profile to promote the new album. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet has agreed to do just one press interview in England, choosing to 
speak only to the magazine The Big Issue, a weekly publication written and sold 
by homeless people.The magazine is currently fielding bids for syndication 
rights to the article, which could raise thousands of dollars to aid British 
street-dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the good intentions of that gesture, the band's reluctance to engage 
in any further promotional activities for the album has reportedly rankled 
executives at Geffen Records, which shelled out millions to sign the Roses. 
Melody Maker quoted a Geffen source as saying, "The Stone Roses can't even be 
bothered to turn up for meetings. There's a distinct difference between 
attitude and being downright rude." 
</P>
<P>
 But the group's comeback single, "Love Spreads," was welcomed warmly by 
British fans and press, selling about 75,000 copies in its first week. Reviews 
have been no less glowing, with Melody Maker declaring that the song, built 
around a propulsive, '70s-style boogie-rock riff, is indeed "the second 
coming." Dave Jennings

POP EYE: THEY'RE RAVING OVER 1995; THE PROMOTERS OF 'PLANTASIA' HOPE THEIR NEW 
YEAR'S EVE SHOW AT THE COLISEUM WILL BE NORTH AMERICA'S BIGGEST RAVE EVER.

 Rave is dead in Los Angeles, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, despite what some dance-world insiders have been telling us for months, 
a team of concert promoters believes there's still a lot of life left in the 
colorful, all-night party scene. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove their point, they're putting together a New Year's Eve show at the 
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum that they say will be North America's biggest 
rave ever. Titled "Plantasia," the event will feature Moby and an all-star 
lineup of deejays, plus fireworks, lasers and props including a UFO strung up 
over the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Music will come from back-to-back stages at the 50 yard line, with tents 
covering the field to keep the dancers warm. In addition, there will be deejays 
mixing on two sound systems outside the stadium, one under the Olympic torch 
and the other on the avenue next to the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have been saying that rave is dead only know what was going on a 
year and a half ago," says Philip Blaine, one of the promoters behind the 
event. "It wasn't dead, it was just in a lull and in the last five months or so 
it's been accelerating." 
</P>
<P>
 Blaine believes the scene is strong enough to bring as many as 20,000 people 
to "Plantasia," which he says would break the continental rave record of about 
12,000 set at a September event staged as background for a film shoot in 
downtown L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 The crowds at that party and at the Orbital performance Nov. 26 at the Shrine 
Exhibition Hall were impressively large and multiethnic mixes that, says 
Blaine, reflect rave culture's move away from cold, "Blade Runner"-like 
futurism to a "positive vibe" accenting community, ecology and spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it really a rave if it's in a mainstream locale such as the Coliseum? 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. rave scene was built on an underground circuit where events weren't 
announced in the conventional media, but rather promoted through word of mouth 
and flyers, with the location of parties and concerts kept secret until the 
last minute. Shows were often held without legal permits and were frequently 
shut down by police. For many people, that was half the excitement.  
</P>
<P>
 "The underground events will always happen," says Blaine. "I promoted those 
years ago and that's great. But rave, as invented in England, was truly a 
massive all-night festival and that's what this is. Yeah, it's commercial, but 
that's the whole point -- more people can be involved." Steve Hochman

 DAVE BRUBECK 
</P>
<P>
 "Just You, Just Me" 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Dave Brubeck was the darling of the college set in the '50s. But in more 
recent times he's been looked on as something of a museum piece by those who 
had heard him do Paul Desmond's "Take Five" one too many times.Now the 
pianist-composer, a pioneer in the use of unusual time signatures and ambitious 
harmonies, is ready to assume the mantle of elder statesman with this wonderful 
solo recording. 
</P>
<P>
 Filled with theme and variation, the disc plays to Brubeck's strengths -- a 
talented left hand, a beautifully realized lyrical sense and the ability to go 
two directions at once -- in a program that ranges from light, smiling ditties 
to deeply blue, melancholic confessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the rhythms infrequently border on the stodgy as Brubeck's left-hand 
stride begins to lumber, the majority of this music dances with incredible 
lightness and two-handed invention. Typical are his set of variations on 
"Brother Can You Spare a Dime?" -- an unbroken stream of ideas that ranges from 
skirt-swirling swing to stately processional. The familiar theme serves only as 
a touchstone as Brubeck plays to the pathos in the Depression-era lyric. 
</P>
<P>
 The pianist gets an amazingly surreal effect with a series of ascending chords 
on the title tune, and his composition "Strange Meadowlark" develops wittily 
from the bird's own song. His darkest statement, the Latin-tinged "Lullaby," is 
his most moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Brubeck's own notes to the album are filled with words like contrapuntal and 
polytonal , but the operational term is here is beautiful . And not once does 
the maestro hint at "Take Five." 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent).

PRIVATE LIVES: VIDEO; THE WATCHDOG IS ON THE CASE; MOVIES ON TAPE, DISC AND TV 
AREN'T ALWAYS THE SAME AS THE THEATRICAL VERSIONS. ACE VIDEOPHILE TIM LUCAS 
KNOWS WHERE THE MISSING PIECES ARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Donald Liebenson, Donald Liebenson is a Chicago-based free-lancer who writes 
about home video. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't assume that the movie you rent on video or watch on television is the 
same version that played in theaters. From shortened running times and cropped 
images to deleted or alternate footage, it's a crime what can happen in the 
transfer from film to video. 
</P>
<P>
 But videophiles can rest easy. Tim Lucas, the "video watchdog," is on the case 
-- armed with five VCRs (three VHS, one Beta and one multi-standard player) and 
one laser-disc player. 
</P>
<P>
 How do the TV and movie versions of "Amazon Women on the Moon" differ? How 
definitive is the "Definitive Collection" laser-disc edition of the "Star Wars" 
trilogy? How complete is the restored version of the 1932 classic "Dr. Jekyll 
and Mr. Hyde"? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers to these and other mysteries can be found in Video Watchdog 
magazine, bimonthly "perfectionist's guide to fantastic video" that specializes 
in horror (domestic and foreign), science-fiction, cult and B-movies and 
European art films. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas is editor and publisher of the 10,000-circulation magazine, which had 
its genesis in a column he wrote briefly for the now-defunct Video Times 
magazine. In 1985, Lucas decided he had enough material for his own magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed that a lot of films were turning up on tape in forms that were new 
and unfamiliar," he says. "But no one was out there taking notes and telling 
the public." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas has told his readers, for example, that the video of the 1974 British 
film "Frankenstein and the Monster From Hell" sports an R rating on the box but 
is in fact the "squeaky-clean" edited-for-TV version. One scene that does not 
show up on the video is one in which Dr. Frankenstein is forced to clamp an 
artery in his teeth while trying to reattach the monster's hand during surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas also alerts videophiles about something that's common on laser discs: 
Movies that were edited for an R rating in this country may show up on Japanese 
imports with the deleted footage. For example, John Landis' "Innocent Blood" is 
"even gorier," Lucas says, on the Japanese disc. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he says, the Japanese have something U.S. video companies have yet to 
offer -- comparative editions of films. A "Godzilla" laser-disc boxed set 
contains the original Japanese film, the 1956 American version with the Raymond 
Burr inserts and goodies like original storyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Video Watchdog also keeps readers up to date about bonus footage available 
only on video, such as the releases of "Star Trek -- The Motion Picture" and 
"Dances With Wolves." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Leonard Maltin's "Movie and Video Guide," "Star Trek's" original 
running time was 132 minutes. The home video version is 143 minutes. A 
240-minute "director's cut" version of "Wolves" was released in August, 1993, 
as part of a "Collector's Edition." The theatrical release was 181 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, a movie is actually shortened. Joe Dante's reworked home video 
version of "Explorers" runs 107 minutes, instead of the 109-minute theatrical 
running time. 
</P>
<P>
 Who reads Video Watchdog? 
</P>
<P>
 "People who take films seriously and who are interested in the politics that 
go into perfecting a final theatrical release version," Lucas says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest that sound too highbrow, note Lucas' excitement concerning a Japanese 
laser-disc version of the 1958 film "The Horror of Dracula" with Christopher 
Lee, which restores a staking sequence not contained on the American disc 
release (although it is included on the video). "That's something our readers 
will pay $64 to see," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who wait to see a film until it is available on video may not know what 
they're missing. For example, when the music rights are not secured for a video 
release, it can play havoc with the original score. The video version of "Blood 
Simple" robs the Coen brothers' tense thriller of one of its most potent 
running jokes, replacing "The Same Old Song" by the Four Tops with a generic 
version of "I'm a Believer." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas said that he watches an average of about two films a day (his record is 
eight). Multiple viewings have attuned him to notice even the most split-second 
discrepancies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watch the films so many times that when I see a version in which something 
doesn't quite fit in, it really stands out," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas also publishes the 392-page Video Watchdog Book and the annual 178-page 
Video Watchdog Special Edition, which reviews the year's best releases, 
presents readers' picks and includes a source directory on "where to find all 
this weird stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Being the "video watchdog" does have its peculiar rewards. It took a vigilant 
Lucas to bust Rhino Home Video after it spiced up a collection of horror films 
with intrusive rude remarks from TV's buxom fright-film hostess Elvira. A 
chastened Rhino re-released the tapes without the offending commentary. 
</P>
<P>
 His readers seem just as fanatical. One Danish correspondent recently wrote 
that the Denmark video version of David Lynch's "Blue Velvet" ended a second 
earlier than the original.

THE NEW OPERA ON CD: MUSIC IS STILL THE MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark Swed 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While multimedia may be radically changing the nature of opera, music -- 
however changed -- still remains its essence. Moreover, the best new opera can 
offer just as fulfilling a listening experience as the best of all opera, and 
an encouraging amount of it is turning up on compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be some time before Louis Andriessen's "Rosa" is recorded, but the 
Dutch master's first opera, "Materie," a collaboration with Robert Wilson five 
years ago, will be released on Nonesuch early next year. Already one section 
from it, "De Stijl" -- along with music Andreissen wrote for a television film 
by Peter Greenaway, "M Is for Man, Music, Mozart" -- was recently issued by 
Nonesuch. 
</P>
<P>
 A large representation of Philip Glass' opera and music theater is available 
on CD from Sony Classics and Nonesuch, and the latter will be issuing a 
recording of "La Belle et la Bete" in the spring. After a little practice with 
the pause buttons of video and CD machines, it should then be possible at home 
to synchronize it with a video of the Cocteau film. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new release, on Lovely Music, of "eL/Aficionado," two of the four 
short operas of Robert Ashley's "Now Eleanor's Idea" are on CD (the first in 
the series, "Improvement," is on Nonesuch). Also available from Lovely Music 
are both CD and video versions of "Perfect Lives," the seven episodes of the 
central work in Ashley's epic operatic trilogy. The first part, "Atalanta," was 
issued on LP by Lovely in the '80s but still awaits CD transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 John Moran's "Mathew in the School of Life" will be released shortly on Sony 
(not, however, by the classical division but as popular music), while Moran's 
most controversial earlier opera, "The Manson Family," is available on Point 
Music. 
</P>
<P>
 (By the way, Moran is not to be confused with Robert Moran, a onetime 
avant-gardist now turned minimalist opera composer, whose hugely entertaining 
"The Dracula Diary" has just been released on Catalyst.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tod Machover's futuristic first opera, "Valis," can be found on a recording 
produced by Bridge Records, which has also released a number of his 
technologically venturesome instrumental works. Mark Swed

NOT BY GEORGE

<TEXT>
<P>
 With reference to "Forget Jelly, George Is Jammin' " (by Patrick Pacheco, Nov. 
20) and "It's a Public With a Punch" (by Laurie Winer, Nov. 27), I would like 
to correct a now-common misconception. 
</P>
<P>
 While George C. Wolfe is indeed a writer and a director, he did not direct the 
stage production of his play "The Colored Museum" at New York's Public Theater 
in 1986.The director was L. Kenneth Richardson, then-artistic director of the 
Crossroads Theatre Company in New Jersey, where the play had its world premiere 
under Richardson's direction. He then directed the play at the Mark Taper Forum 
in 1988, and that critically acclaimed production moved to the Westwood 
Playhouse for an extended run. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson is currently a member of the Taper artistic staff.

TREK TALK

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Steven Lynn faults the makers of "Star Trek" for creating non-human 
civilizations that "are imbued with evil qualities right out of a textbook on 
racial stereotypes and prejudice" (Letters, Nov. 27), I can only conclude that 
he has been half-asleep when watching "Star Trek: The Next Generation" and its 
spinoff, "Deep Space Nine." 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to his observations, one of the most interesting developments of this 
long-running humanist morality play is the evolution of the aliens through the 
seven years of the series.Though each of the various antagonistic interstellar 
species begins as a race of undifferentiated comic-book villains, as the series 
progress, multidimensional individuals emerge, often as characters who garner 
our sympathy.

 There are plenty of alien races on the show that aren't depicted as (take your 
pick) warlike, inferior, impolite or indecent. If Lynn had the brains that God 
gave a Tribble, he would see the depth and humanity given to the Cardassians, 
the Klingons, the Romulans, etc. (and yes, even the Borg) by the producers and 
staff of all the shows, old and new.

 It was a pleasure to see the article about Jim Hanks, "the other brother" 
(Film Clips, Nov. 27).I can imagine how tough it must be for an actor in this 
town to find a professional niche of his own. How much more so when you have a 
tendency to look and sound (and run) like a well-known big star. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I should like to note a minor error in the mention of his spouse, 
Karen. Though wife of Jim, she has retained her maiden name -- Praxel -- as her 
professional name and can be seen in Pragmatic Productions' "Macbeth" through 
Dec. 17 at the Gascon Center Theatre in West Los Angeles.

 Let's assume that rock producer Brad Wood rests on the seventh day from all 
his work, and assume that the three albums you mentioned (including Liz Phair's 
"Whip-Smart") took at least three weeks each to do (Pop Eye, Nov. 20). 
</P>
<P>
 Then we calculate that the 47 other albums he said he did this year took about 
five days each for rehearsal, setting up the instruments, recording songs, 
doing all the vocals and overdubs and then mixing the record. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that the amazing Mr. Wood must complete something like two or three 
songs a day, recorded and mixed, every single working day of the year. At that 
remarkable rate, he might even burn out in a year or so.

 In response to Robert Hilburn's Q&A session with Eddie Vedder ("All Revved 
Up," Nov. 20): 
</P>
<P>
 Hilburn says Vedder is "the most passionate element" in the ever-so-popular 
band Pearl Jam. I'm not so sure of that anymore.Time and again, whether I read 
it in an article or watch an interview on TV, Vedder confesses to one thing 
that has been consistent throughout his career: "I don't want to be part of the 
whole celebrity trip." 
</P>
<P>
 He has said it repeatedly, yet it seems that the more he says it, the more 
popular he gets. I believe there is a reason for that. Vedder's songs reflect 
the alienation and anger among many young people today, so what better way to 
promote yourself than to practice what you preach? 
</P>
<P>
 Vedder has an understanding of his large audience, which relates to his music; 
if he feels alienated himself and asks not to be put in the spotlight, then his 
fans would relate to that too. Results: more T-shirts, tickets and albums to be 
sold. It's a business, and Vedder has the upper hand.

 Boring, boring, boring. I feel like I'm the only one who's sick of hearing 
about Eddie Vedder and Pearl Jam. They're so overrated it makes me sick. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite band is Queensryche, which continues to be ignored by most of the 
music press, including your paper. How about an interview with them? 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl Jam sucks, Queensryche rules Seattle -- and everywhere else. Ryche and 
roll!

 Wake up, Los Angeles! The arrival of three New York "showcases" dedicated to 
the same old boring New York artists hardly constitutes a watershed event in 
the local art community ("New York's Pacific Rim Shot," by Irene Lacher, Nov. 
27). 
</P>
<P>
 Until Los Angeles realizes that it need not grovel at the altar of the New 
York art gods, it will continue to be nothing but a second-rate version of the 
East Coast art scene.

 What L.A. does need is to become aware of itself and its own flourishing art 
culture. We have a very vital and alive art community (which is different from 
a gallery scene), as evidenced by DaDa's recent annual "Downtown Lives '94" 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 What will make L.A. a stronger art city is dealers with the courage and vision 
to begin to showcase the diversity of Los Angeles art, from the multitudes of 
Chicano artists who haven't "made it" to the many black artists working in 
South-Central, from the still active and vital downtown scene to the many 
artists on the outskirts such as the Arroyo, the Westside and even (gulp) the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no lack of talent in L.A. waiting to grow -- there is only the lack 
of an art world of vision waiting to discover them.

 CRIME: The FBI reported Saturday that last year's downward trend in serious 
crimes continues in 1994. The survey compares the total murders, rapes, 
robberies and other crimes reported in the first six months of 1994 to the same 
period last year (B1). . . . In a simultaneous report, the agency released 
crime rates in 1993, showing that Los Angeles, Palmdale and Lancaster had more 
crime than the national average, but smaller cities in the San Fernando Valley 
area had less. 
</P>
<P>
 FASCINATING: Attorney Leslie Abramson, who defended Erik Menendez at the Van 
Nuys trial, became a newsworthy figure in her own right. So much so that TV's 
Barbara Walters has named her one of "The 10 Most Fascinating People of 1994" . 
. . An ABC special on the group will air Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 S.O.S.: The dawning of the Information Superhighway, you say? Residents of the 
rural Antelope Valley would be thrilled just to have phone service and are more 
determined than ever to get it (B1) . . . Crusader Debbie Robinson nearly died 
from a snake bite recently because she could not dial 911. 
</P>
<P>
 OOPS: When editors of CSUN's literary magazine placed an ad requesting "UNSAFE 
TEXTS" for an upcoming issue, the campus newspaper goofed. Instead, the ad in 
the Sundial requested submissions on "UNSAFE SEX." . . . For the record, 
Northridge Review editor Sue Few wrote that staffers at her publication "in no 
way advocate the practice of unsafe sex." The error was corrected in later 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
 WINGING IT: Quarterback Jim Arellanes of Valley College posted four Orange 
County Bowl marks while leading the Monarchs to a 36-28 victory over Rancho 
Santiago (C12). . . . Arellanes set records of 26 completions, 425 yards 
passing, five touchdowns and 402 total yards. Crime Drop 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of serious crime decreased across the San Fernando Valley region in 
the first six months of 1994, in most cases exceeding a nationwide downward 
trend in cities of more than 100,000. Los Angeles: -13.0% Lancaster: -12.3%

AFGHANISTAN SINKS DEEPER INTO THE MISERY OF A FORGOTTEN WAR; KABUL: RIVAL 
FACTIONS CONTINUE TO CLASH DAILY IN THE COUNTRY'S BESIEGED CAPITAL. AFTER 15 
YEARS, NO END OF THE FIGHTING IS IN SIGHT.

 Call it the Kabul wake-up call. 
</P>
<P>
 Well before the sun rises over the jagged, snowcapped mountains of the Hindu 
Kush, the gunmen of Kabul fire their screeching rockets. They unleash a mighty 
thunder, jolt the population from slumber and send hearts racing into 
overdrive. 
</P>
<P>
 By daybreak, jet fighters are roaring through the skies, machine guns are 
crackling and the long-suffering people of Kabul are braced for another 
nightmarish day of urban warfare in one of the most brutal wars in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most intense day-to-day combat in the world is in the Afghan 
capital, where rebellious Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his ally, 
warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, reignited a simmering civil war with a blistering 
assault on the capital at 4 a.m. last New Year's Day. The guns have blazed ever 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the relentless rocket attacks, Hekmatyar's troops have been pushed 
back several miles to the southern and eastern fringes of the city and have 
virtually no chance of driving President Burhanuddin Rabbani from the 
Presidential Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer routine of the stalemated war is best illustrated by the daily 
battles in the southwestern corner of the city. The president's men are 
fighting from the abandoned Dehmazang Prison, separated from Hekmatyar's forces 
by a few hundred yards and crumbling buildings that now look like ancient 
ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 The acting commander of the presidential force, Syed Kadar Shah, lives and 
works in a dank, cramped former prison cell. Shafts of light filter through the 
window bars and highlight the smoke from the cigarettes that never leave his 
right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Incessant bursts of gunfire drown out his words, yet he sits like a man at a 
picnic, his legs casually crossed as he talks about the roaring battle across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is normal. The shooting has been like this here every day for the past 
seven weeks," said Shah. "When the rockets land in the streets, people are 
killed all the time. But we are safe here." 
</P>
<P>
 His words fail to reassure. Every wall of the prison has been hit. Many have 
collapsed into heaps of rubble, or have gaping holes punched by mortars and 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Shah is not worried. He pulls back his right sleeve to show several dark scars 
left by shrapnel. He points to his left shoulder where a bullet once ripped off 
a chunk of flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 37, Shah was a young man when he became a guerrilla in the war to evict 
Soviet troops from Afghanistan. That enemy has been vanquished and now he is a 
prominent commander in the presidential army. Yet Shah finds himself barricaded 
inside a prison under constant attack and without a clue as to when he will get 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a prisoner of war, a metaphor that extends to most everyone in 
Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic holy warriors, or moujahedeen , were national heroes and somewhat 
united when they drove out Soviet forces in 1989 and toppled a communist Afghan 
government in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The ferociously independent guerrillas quickly turned their guns on each other 
in a fight for control of Kabul. Nine separate factions are involved in the 
civil war, and today the fighters are widely reviled as ruthless killers by 
helpless civilians, who account for most of the city's estimated 30,000 dead 
and wounded this year. 
</P>
<P>
 No faction is powerful enough to win an outright military victory and all 
peace efforts have collapsed. All factions want an Islamic government, and the 
feud is seen as little more than a raw struggle for power among a handful of 
warlords. 
</P>
<P>
 Hekmatyar, a fiery Islamic fundamentalist, was named prime minister last year 
in an attempted compromise, but he has yet to set foot in Kabul. He wants 
Rabbani replaced as president by a neutral interim government that would hold 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbani, a reclusive, soft-spoken academic with a flowing white beard, says he 
will step down to make way for a loya jirga , or a council of leaders, who 
would choose a future government. 
</P>
<P>
 A United Nations special envoy, Mehmood Mestiri, has been flying in and out of 
Afghanistan from his base in neighboring Pakistan in a bid to reconcile the 
positions, but the forecast is for continued fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers on both sides are dug in and rarely risk ground assaults, preferring 
to heave rockets at one another from a safe distance, though they often miss 
their targets. 
</P>
<P>
 The front lines seldom change, which allows Hekmatyar to maintain his 
headquarters in Charasyab, only 15 miles south of the Presidential Palace in 
downtown Kabul. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the civilians who suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammed Ajmal, 12, has been lying in the Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital 
for a month with shrapnel embedded in his chest. He was flying a kite in his 
yard when a rocket hit. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors have no plans to operate at present because the main chest surgeon 
has left the country and the hospital lacks oxygen required for such surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't seen kindness from any of the military groups," said Shah Jahn, 
Mohammed's mother. "All the military sides are our enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 250,000 people -- one-fourth of Kabul's population -- have fled the 
city, most settling in refugee camps on rocky, wind-swept plains near the 
eastern city of Jalalabad. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all foreign organizations have pulled out of Kabul, except for a few 
determined aid groups, led by the International Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross' administrative house was so badly damaged by shelling that the 
group had to move earlier this year. Its cars have been hijacked on the 
presidential side of the front. On Hekmatyar's side, Red Cross food and 
medicine convoys have been stopped from entering the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Stocker, head of the Red Cross delegation, said his group is now out of 
30 of 180 essential items for their medical work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The knife is to our neck," said Stocker. "We spend weeks negotiating with one 
commander. Then he's not there when our trucks come through and they get held 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbani's nominal government barely functions, there is no formal economy and 
food prices have skyrocketed. The city's commercial center, along the Kabul 
River in the southeast, has been smashed into a huge pile of brown bricks. It 
is devoid of people, except for shepherds who bring their flocks to nibble on 
the grass along the river bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But Afghans are legendary survivors and have adapted their behavior to deal 
with rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 When shells begin pounding one area, a street will clear instantly. Shop 
owners close their shutters. Vegetable sellers push their carts of tomatoes and 
carrots around the corner. Three streets away, business carries on 
uninterrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main business of Kabul is still fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a soldier is the only way to make money," said Jhan Agha, a 17-year-old 
government fighter who gets the equivalent of $15 a month and makes three times 
that amount collecting "taxes" at his checkpoint.

COMMERCE, CULTURE JOIN ON ST. LAWRENCE RIVER; CANADA: THE MANY MOODS OF LA MER 
ARE FOUND ON A TRIP FROM THE THOUSAND ISLANDS TO THE SEA. THIS TURNPIKE FOR 
SHIPPING IS ALSO A REFUGE FOR WILDFOWL, WHALES.

 The icebreaker Pierre Radisson, flagship of the Canadian coast guard's St. 
Lawrence River fleet, tosses aside chunks of ice the size of cottages. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, sky and shoreline blur. Filing along behind us in a wintry convoy are 
the Federal Kumano, a bulk carrier from Manila, a tramp steamer flying a 
Panamanian flag, a Hong Kong container ship and a Canadian tanker. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Lawrence is a big-shouldered river that can challenge a navigator any 
time of the year. I would discover this when I returned in summer and chartered 
a 37-foot cutter to follow the river's 750-mile course to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 I would find a river of many moods, often sophisticated, occasionally wild and 
stormy, but never less than majestic. 
</P>
<P>
 Short as major rivers go, the St. Lawrence makes up for it in volume; its flow 
is nearly that of the Rhine, Volga and Nile combined. Its narrowest pinch, 
under the Quebec City bridge, measures half a mile; crossing the river's mouth 
is a voyage of 90 miles. There locals refer to it as la mer , the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The river spills from the eastern edge of Lake Ontario, then snakes 
northeastward, sketching the frontier between New York state and Canada's 
Ontario province. By the time it reaches Montreal, it has dropped 226 feet 
through the complex of weirs and locks of the St. Lawrence Seaway. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Seaway system, the river provides 
access as far inland as Duluth, Minn. Each year, ships make about 2,300 trips 
along the river section alone. 
</P>
<P>
 I began my summer journey in the Thousand Islands -- actually there are about 
1,800 of them -- which make a patchwork of the river as it leaves Lake Ontario. 
The islands, some hardly more than large rocks, hold farms, estates and summer 
cottages that can cost millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 On tiny Heart Island, for instance, broods a 120-room castle guarded by gates 
and turrets. It was built at the turn of the century by George Boldt, wealthy 
manager of New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Today it is a tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering Quebec Province, the St. Lawrence becomes the Fleuve St.-Laurent, for 
this is the heart of French-speaking Canada. Guiding my cutter Foxtrot through 
the final locks of the seaway, I followed the strong currents under arching 
bridges, noisy with trains and traffic pouring into workaday Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Always long on originality, Montreal's more whimsical attractions include the 
annual boat race organized by sailing instructor Yves Plante. "The rules limit 
you to $100 (about $75 in the United States) for materials. You have three 
hours to build your boat," Plante explained, "then into the water, and the race 
begins." 
</P>
<P>
 Early Sunday morning, 42 skippers and their crews arrived at the Olympic Basin 
on Ile Notre-Dame to unload plywood, plastic sheets, cardboard, old barrels and 
rope. During the busiest three hours I can remember, my crew and I cobbled 
together a dinghy of rough plywood and rigged it with a spritsail cut from a $6 
tarp. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a faint breeze, I coaxed our dinghy to the finish line, but well behind 
the winner, carpenter Alain Guibert's long, narrow outrigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy industry defines much of the upper St. Lawrence. Effluent from scores of 
paper mills, chemical plants, smelters and refineries has stained its sparkling 
waters for decades, choking local fish populations and even poisoning the 
endangered beluga whales hundreds of miles downstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal and provincial environment ministries began a major effort to clean up 
the river in 1988, targeting the 50 worst industrial polluters. The program has 
already cut their toxic dumping by nearly 75%. Yet many environmentalists are 
not satisfied, claiming that more needs to be done to restore the river to 
health. Purging the muddy river bottom of heavy metals, they say, will take 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailing toward Quebec City, Foxtrot danced along the wide river. Next day, 
docked in the city, I drove to Cap Charles to seek out the home of Delphis 
Duhamel, now retired from the furniture industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started this hobby of saluting passing ships in 1964, partly to spark our 
children's interest in geography," Duhamel said when he showed me the 
breathtaking panorama from his front yard. In lockers around us hung flags of 
all nations. A weatherproof console protected his tape player and cassettes of 
150 anthems. 
</P>
<P>
 After Quebec City, the river widens into its broad estuary and shores recede 
into distant gray lines. Here changeable weather can surprise even a cautious 
skipper. 
</P>
<P>
 The wider river becomes a magnet to wildfowl. You will see colonies of 
Atlantic puffins along a deserted island cliff or hear the thunderclap of wings 
as half a million snow geese splash into a gray morning sky. 
</P>
<P>
 On Ile aux Lievres, Jean Bedard, a specialist in duck behavior, directs a 
nonprofit organization, the Societe Duvetnor, which draws its name from the 
French word duvet, meaning the down of birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower St. Lawrence is also whale country. Foxtrot slipped now into the 
crescent harbor of Tadoussac, where Basque whalers worked the waters soon after 
Jacques Cartier, credited with discovering the river, landed in 1535. A giant 
Victorian hotel is booked up most summers as the town enjoys a new whaling boom 
-- whale-watching.

CHIMPS GET TLC IN HALFWAY HOUSE; BURUNDI: CENTER WAS FOUNDED BY FAMOUS PRIMATE 
EXPERT JANE GOODALL. IT TREATS PROBLEMS MUCH LIKE THOSE OF ABUSED CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Around the world, shelters give refuge and sorely needed love and care to 
abused, neglected and abandoned youngsters. The Halfway House in Bujumbura does 
the same for chimpanzees. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Goodall, the renowned primate researcher, set up the center three years 
ago to rehabilitate chimps traumatized by mistreatment in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent visit, little Uruhara cried out for his friend and caretaker. 
Elie Nukurikiye scooped the 5-year-old chimp into his arms and growled 
throatily. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimicking the grooming behavior of primates, the Burundian plucked at 
imaginary pests. Then he dropped Uruhara to the ground and they walked 
together. Uruhara howled in delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Uruhara, whose name means Bold in the Kirundi language, is a success story of 
the Jane Goodall Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was rescued from a cage at a Bujumbura hotel, the tiny chimp was 
withdrawn, bald and scarred by burning cigarettes. After three years at the 
center, he is becoming himself again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uruhara was a tiny baby when he came here. I took care of him. He knows me 
now. He trusts me," Nukurikiye said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some animal centers, the Halfway House does not try to return its 
charges to the wild. The institute feels they have been around humans so long 
that they cannot learn how to forage for food and defend themselves. They also 
have lost the natural caution that prevents chimps from wandering into villages 
where they might be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodall first came to Burundi in 1988 to give advice on protecting the 
remaining forests through wildlife conservation focusing on chimpanzees, an 
endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 100,000 chimps are left in the wilds of Central Africa. They are found 
from Sierra Leone in the west to Tanzania in the east. Only 400 wild chimps are 
thought to remain in Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
 While organizing the project, Goodall was appalled to learn that chimps were 
kept as pets by foreigners working in Burundi, often in dreadful conditions. 
She opened the Halfway House in an industrial area of Burundi's capital in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Debby Cox, an Australian, oversees a staff of seven Burundians in caring for 
19 chimps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some chimps come to the Halfway House looking like malnourished children. 
They're bald, their eyes bulge and their stomachs are swollen. It's very 
saddening," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Captured chimps usually are permanently scarred because they have seen their 
mothers killed. "They freak out if they see someone with a gun," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 They often have been kept in isolation, a garage or a cage, for long periods, 
so they no longer know how to socialize. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Halfway House, chimpanzees are gradually brought back to good physical 
health. The more difficult challenge is helping them recover from psychological 
trauma and teaching them to socialize. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene at the Halfway House is controlled chaos. The six adult chimps are 
kept in cages because their strength and troubled natures make them dangerous 
to humans. Five adolescent chimps are outside but on leashes to keep them from 
running away. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he was rescued by Goodall, Poco spent the first few years of his life in 
a cage suspended above a service station to attract customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he beckons visitors to his cage, smells their knees and elbows and offers 
a kiss. He likes to foot-wrestle with Cox. "He gives me full embraces through 
the bars, and with a small stick he cleans my fingernails for me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Niyonkuru, whose name means Gift From God , had a brown rather than a black 
coat when he arrived. "He did not want to be touched; he did not want to be 
held. He didn't interact at all," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day Niyonkuru was startled and jumped into a caretaker's arms. That 
was the beginning of his recovery, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all do so well. 
</P>
<P>
 Akela, 6, was kept for years in a cage at a Lake Tanganyika hotel. When she is 
returned to her cage each night at the Halfway House, she rocks -- a behavior 
often shown by abused or neglected children, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group hopes someday to give the chimps a better home in an animal 
sanctuary on Lake Tanganyika, south of Bujumbura in part of the Kigwena Forest 
Reserve.

UTAH BADLANDS MAY HAVE HARBORED OLDEST MARSUPIAL; FOSSIL: AN ANIMAL'S JAW 
DEEMED TO BE 100 MILLION YEARS OLD AND MEASURING LESS THAN AN INCH LONG IS 
RECOVERED. THE DISCOVERY REINFORCES THE THEORY THAT SUCH POUCHED CREATURES, NOW 
IDENTIFIED WITH AUSTRALIA, ORIGINATED IN NORTH AMERICA. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fossilized jaw of a chipmunk-size, 100 million-year-old animal recovered 
from the rocky badlands of Utah belongs to the world's oldest marsupial. 
</P>
<P>
 The find reinforces the theory that marsupials -- those pouched creatures 
identified today with Australia -- originated in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The earliest previous marsupial fossil, a smaller portion of a 
90-million-year-old jaw with three teeth, was also found in Utah, about a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectacularly complete, the new three-quarter-inch-long jaw contains six 
teeth, including four molars that are characteristic of marsupials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The specimen represents an extremely primitive marsupial, or it could be the 
ancestor of all marsupials," said Richard L. Cifelli, the University of 
Oklahoma paleontologist who led the 1992 summer expedition that made the find 
in central Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Cifelli named the fossil "Kokopellia" after the flute-playing mythical figure 
of Southwest Indian lore that is a frequent theme on petroglyphs in the region. 
The jaw was discovered and hand-quarried from a rocky outcrop by William J. 
May, a paleontologist from the Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
 The expedition also found well-preserved 100-million-year-old fossils of 
frogs, salamanders, snakes, crocodiles, a diversity of dinosaurs and a 
"top-of-the-notch" carnivorous lizard. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals browsed and hunted in a lush, flat landscape watered by wide, 
slow-moving streams and bedecked with evergreens, ferns and flowering plants. 
The process of mountain-making had not yet begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the fossils, the marsupial jaw has elicited the most interest. "This 
covers a new stage in marsupial evolution and fills a gap in our knowledge of 
how they evolved," commented Louis L. Jacobs, professor of geological sciences 
at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cifelli has pushed them back close to the origin of modern groups of mammals, 
when they were living in the shadows and footprints of the dinosaurs," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty important. We're tracing their roots." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsupials -- mammals seemingly forgotten by time -- use their pouches to 
shelter, carry and nurse their tiny, helpless young. They include kangaroos, 
koalas, pouched mice and possums. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of today's marsupials roam Australia and South America, but scientists 
still debate their place of origin. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent theory even suggested Asia, although none are left there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The age and primitiveness of Kokopellia, a suitable ancestor for all later 
marsupials, are important new pieces of evidence suggesting that the group 
originated in North America," said Cifelli, whose fieldwork was supported by 
the National Geographic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 According to this scenario, marsupials would have spread to South America at 
the end of the Cretaceous period about 65 million years ago, and from there to 
Australia via Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
 The three southern continents were connected until about 40 million years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scientists don't think the new jaw proves anything one way or another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've favored a North American origin for marsupials since the '60s," said 
Jason A. Lillegraven, a paleontologist and vertebrate-fossil expert at the 
University of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think the case is proven from a practical point of view. How do 
you know for sure? You need a terribly good fossil record, probably better than 
we're ever likely to have, to be really sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs thinks that the age and location of the jaw make a good case for North 
American origin. "If the geography of fossils speaks to the geography of where 
things actually originated, then this supports it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists still debate the reasons why placental mammals -- named for the 
placenta, a membrane that nourishes the embryo in the womb -- ousted the 
marsupials in North America and now dominate its animal life. 
</P>
<P>
 The only remaining North American marsupial is the possum, which still 
shelters its young in a pouch long after birth. 
</P>
<P>
 This ancient beast has not only survived among the continent's competing 
placentals, but has extended its range in recent years, spreading north to 
southern Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it has been successful, scientists say, because it will eat anything, 
live almost anywhere, multiply prolifically and treat its young so casually 
that all but the fittest are weeded out.

PUBLIC-RELATIONS ETHICS QUESTIONED AS SOME AGENTS POSE AS JOURNALISTS; 
INFORMATION: DECEPTION VIOLATES PR CODE, BUT CRITICS SAY IT'S COMMON 
NONETHELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Late last year, two lobbyists from a top Washington firm teamed with a camera 
crew to get interviews in India's volatile Kashmir region. The Indian 
government says they were posing as journalists with Cable News Network. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, Paul Manafort and Riva Levinson, arrived in India on tourist visas 
that gave no hint they were working for the Kashmiri American Foundation, a 
group New Delhi views as a front for rival Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the public relations field and some veterans of the field say such 
deception happens too often and is symptomatic of a system in which public 
relations goals justify questionable means to sell an idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can afford professional PR services, and the increasingly 
sophisticated technology they offer, gain tremendous advantage in the public 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 They are able to win television exposure, impact news coverage and use the 
mail to circulate pictures, statistics and data favorable to their positions. 
The current debate over health care, for example, has brought a business boom 
to Washington's public relations firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But the data circulated may carry few clues about the financial interests 
behind it -- knowledge that could help an information-soaked audience sort out 
just what to believe about an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Practically the entire foundation of public relations is, to a degree, to 
deceive," said Susan B. Trento, author of a book on public relations giant Hill 
& Knowlton. 
</P>
<P>
 "They try to secretly manipulate people's opinions and views, and the 
government's reaction or response to it," Trento said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manafort and Levinson, of the firm Black, Manafort, Stone & Kelly, deny they 
posed as CNN reporters, and a colleague said their footage was never used. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Indian government publicly protested and formally notified CNN's 
Atlanta headquarters. Network officials say they have no reason to doubt the 
episode occurred, and a regional journalists' association passed a resolution 
deploring it. 
</P>
<P>
 One prize public relations target is hearings on Capitol Hill. They not only 
attract extensive news coverage, but also offer the imprimatur of an official 
source -- Congress. For lawmakers, the forums are a chance to air questions 
about policy issues and get a little publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if the information isn't true? 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, an anonymous Kuwaiti teen-ager tearfully testified to the House of 
Representatives about invading Iraqi soldiers removing babies from hospital 
incubators. She was later revealed to be the daughter of Kuwait's U.S. 
ambassador, and her story could not be substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager's testimony was arranged by Hill & Knowlton for the group 
Citizens for a Free Kuwait, which was seeking to build public support for using 
U.S. military force against Iraq. The "citizens" turned out to be the Kuwaiti 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Such discoveries of outright deception are rare, in part because the industry 
has a strict unwritten code of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Gotschall felt its sting. After she left her job with the Washington firm 
Robinson Lake Lerer & Montgomery, she wrote a magazine article telling trade 
secrets, including how she had ghost-written letters to the editor on clients' 
stationery. Her boss told her to "make sure you leave no fingerprints," she 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm "threatened to sue me unless I quit talking about" the article, 
Gotschall recalled recently. But in general, she said, public relations firms' 
products are insidious because "the public can't discern where it came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Gotschall's experience illustrates why stories like hers are rare. But 
interviews with several longtime public relations practitioners, who all 
demanded anonymity, brought out numerous stories illustrating how they keep 
their own activities out of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not uncommon, those in the business say, to send junior-level employees 
out to gather intelligence on a client's opponents. The work can range from 
posing as a student writing a paper to get information in the mail, to the more 
daring, and rare, step of infiltrating opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Being able to carry out such an assignment is almost a rite of passage at some 
firms, said one public relations executive. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stauber, an industry critic, saw the tactics firsthand. In 1991, as an 
activist fighting drug companies over use of a hormone that stimulates greater 
milk production in cows, he organized a meeting in Washington. Among those who 
showed up was a woman who said she was with a Maryland consumer group. 
</P>
<P>
 Stauber said he later discovered she worked for Burson-Marsteller, an 
international public relations firm that represented Monsanto and Eli Lilly -- 
makers of the dairy hormone. The woman, Diane Moser, said she went to the 
meeting out of "my own personal interest" and said it was unrelated to her work 
at the firm. She since has left Burson-Marsteller and now works for another 
public relations company. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime public relations practitioners also say one common practice is to 
attend opponents' news conferences, sometimes signing in as a free-lancer or a 
reporter for an obscure trade publication, to eavesdrop or ask hostile 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 It also can work the other way, they say: posing as a reporter at your own 
news conference to ask friendly questions that will guide the press to the 
client's message. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest PR trade group, the Public Relations Society of America, 
has a code of ethics that bars deception. "You can't say you're one thing while 
actually serving another," said Joseph Vecchione, the society's president. But 
the rules are hard to police, and many in public relations don't belong to the 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like sin," said Suzette Heiman, who teaches public relations at 
the University of Missouri School of Journalism. "You know it's wrong, but 
people continue to sin every day."

SYDNEY HARBOR UNLOCKS ITS CONVICT PAST; AUSTRALIA: NO LONGER ASHAMED, CITY 
TOUTS ITS FOUNDING FATHERS -- OR CRIMINALS -- AND FUELS A TOURISM BOOM.

 A landmark in the middle of Sydney Harbor, where the rotting corpse of a 
convicted murderer once swung from the gallows, now attracts tourists and 
super-models as the city promotes its convict heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ft. Denison, built on a rocky outcrop to protect Sydney from attack and to 
confine its worst convicts, is undergoing dramatic renovations to satisfy a 
boom in tourists seeking out Sydney's colorful past. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, super-model Claudia Schiffer and a dozen other models held a 
party at the fort, once called "Pinchgut" after the emaciated bodies of 
convicts chained to its walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the fort's attractions are more pleasurable. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated opposite the white fins of the Opera House, the fort has panoramic 
views of Sydney Harbor and has been called the best address in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in fashion now for Australians to discover their convict history," local 
historian and tour guide Maureen Fry said during a tour of Sydney Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will pore over history books in libraries to find out if they were 
related to a convict on the First Fleet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a generation ago, the mere mention that one had convict blood was a major 
faux pas.  
</P>
<P>
 In Sydney's "the Rocks" -- the oldest part of the city, cradling the site 
where the first white settlers landed their convict-filled schooners in 1788 
and built on a rusty sandstone promontory -- tourism is up 25% in the last 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Mitchell, executive director of the Sydney Cove Authority, which oversees 
the development of the Rocks, said a 23-year plan to restore the area is close 
to completion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll be able to see the entire area refurbished, to be as close to original 
conditions as you can get," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The area was settled by the 759 convicts that Captain Arthur Phillip brought 
into the harbor in January, 1788, in 11 ships. Phillip, his crew and about 200 
soldiers settled on a shoal across from the Rocks that now overlooks the Opera 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrow lanes of the Rocks, which snaked around brothels and taverns filled 
with drunken sailors, are now far more innocent and swanky than they were in 
the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 A fight by a band of Sydney residents in the early 1970s to ward off 
development and preserve the historic flavor of the area appears to be paying 
off. The Rocks is now the most popular tourist destination in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
 The area, settled and built by convicted British felons, remains a model of 
early 19th-Century architecture. The brothels, however, have been replaced by 
small boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism, one of Australia's most lucrative industries, has been given a new 
push by politicians after Sydney's successful bid in mid-September for the 2000 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Mevissen, a spokesman for the New South Wales Tourism Commission, said 
the state expects 1.5 million tourists over the next 10 years, almost double 
current levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1981 and 1991, tourism in Sydney jumped 130%. 
</P>
<P>
 But visitors aren't the only ones swelling Sydney's inner streets. The local 
population is also experiencing a sharp increase, largely due to increased 
immigration from Asia, the Pacific and many non-Anglo-Saxon European countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer increase in Sydney's population, which is expected to reach 4.5 
million by 2011, up from the 1991 census figure of 3.7 million, prompted the 
state government to issue a plan in late October called "Sydney's Future." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan recommends a curb on growth in Sydney's urban fringes, an emphasis on 
higher-density housing such as townhouses and villas, and improved 
transportation links.

 Danes will soon be able to ride through Copenhagen on bicycles dispensed by 
coin-operated machines, and they'll get their money back at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hopes to have nearly 5,000 Bycykels, Danish for "City Bikes," on the 
road by 1996.The City Bikes are free for riders, paid for partly by advertising 
on their frames. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents with a 20-kroner coin, worth about $3.30, for the deposit will be 
able to ride the bikes as long as they like. They'll get the money back when 
they return the bike. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are promoting Bycykels as a way to cut pollution and curbing bike 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Several cities have shown interest, among them Aspen, Colorado, and Adelaide 
in Australia, said Morten Sadolin, the businessman behind the private venture.

CARTOONISTS WELCOME NEW SUBJECTS FOR SHARP NEEDLES; SATIRE: NOT ONLY DO THEY

 Get ready for more caricatures of a politician with grayish, big hair and a 
pudgy face. Except now Newt Gingrich, not Bill Clinton, may be dominating the 
editorial cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be great drawing a Speaker of the House named after a lizard," laughed 
Steve Benson of The Arizona Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, actually a newt is an amphibian. But this isn't rocket science. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newt's cut out of the mold cartoonists like. There's that shock of hair, and 
he speaks his mind without much forethought," Benson added. "We have a whole 
new cast of characters. This is going to make great and invigorating upheaval 
on the editorial pages." 
</P>
<P>
 Even conservatives like Benson are enjoying the upheaval that put the 
Republicans in control of the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do they have Clinton and the liberals for fodder, but Gingrich and 
Sens. Bob Dole, Alfonse D'Amato and Jesse Helms are now at center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's morning in America for me. I've been born again professionally," said 
Signe Wilkinson, a Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist for the Philadelphia Daily 
News and a self-professed liberal. "The electorate never lets us down." 
</P>
<P>
 In her cartoons, Wilkinson draws Pennsylvania's Sen.-elect Rick Santorum with 
a chain saw because he wants to cut government. Santorum unseated Clintonite 
and health care champion Sen. Harris Wofford in the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The satirists who spoof politicians are gleeful because the crowd taking 
control of Congress is straightforward about what it stands for. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those looking to underscore the folly and foibles of political policy, 
clarity is a plus when your medium is usually a single-panel cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Polarization makes for easy targets," said Rob Rogers, an editorial 
cartoonist for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette who is syndicated by United 
Features. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the hardest things about drawing Clinton was you never quite knew 
where he stood. With these guys, it's pretty black and white. They tend to be 
caricatures of themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 For an idea of what the new leaders will look like in print, Rogers sees 
Gingrich as "the Pillsbury Doughboy meets Donahue," while the eye-brow heavy 
Dole "looks like Boris Karloff or Dr. Jekyll." 
</P>
<P>
 Newsday's Doug Marlette, who packaged his Clinton cartoons into a book called 
"Faux Bubba," sees the Republican leaders as "a cast of gargoyles. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "A cartoonist looks at national trauma the way a plastic surgeon looks at 
crow's feet or cellulite." 
</P>
<P>
 The new crowd in power has already felt the sting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich, the fiercely partisan Georgia congressman who will ascend to House 
leadership next year, described as "vicious" and "offensive" a Mike Luckovich 
cartoon that appeared in The Atlanta Constitution in early November. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said the newspaper will be banned from his appearances until it runs 
a retraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The cartoon depicted the congressman flanked by two brazen-looking beauties 
labeled "D.C. highrollers," with the three of them hovering over the hospital 
bed of a sickly looking woman labeled "Georgia constituents." The overline: "I 
want a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the paper, Gingrich discussed divorce with his first wife while 
she was in the hospital recovering from cancer. The episode became a issue in 
Gingrich's 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have invited his office to write a letter or to make a statement putting 
forth his concerns," said Ron Martin, editor of the Constitution. He added that 
the newspaper will still cover Gingrich.

TRIBE COULD GROW ALONG WITH CASINO; GAMBLING: THE MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT INDIANS 
OPENED THE FOXWOODS HIGH STAKES BINGO AND CASINO IN LEDYARD, CONN., IN 1992. 
SINCE THEN, PEQUOTS HAVE BEEN POPPING UP ALL OVER TO CLAIM THEIR SHARE.

<P>
 Suddenly, there are a lot more Narragansett Indians -- and not because of more 
babies or fewer deaths, or because new aboriginal villages have been discovered 
in the wilds of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Since the tribe announced plans to open a casino that could 
produce hundreds of millions of dollars annually, would-be Narragansetts have 
come out of the woodwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say we're inundated, but we are seeing more come forward," said 
Ella Sekatau, the tribe's medicine woman and genealogist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are definitely not Narragansett, but we'll have to expect some liars and 
cheats when we're living in a country where God is green." 
</P>
<P>
 It's something the Mashantucket Pequot Indians have learned already. Since 
1992, when the tribe opened its Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino in 
Ledyard, Conn., Pequots have been popping up all over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get about eight to 10 people a week coming in here saying they think 
they've got some Indian blood in them," said Joey Carter, a Pequot. "Some of 
them aren't even close. Everybody wants a piece of the pie. We're the rich 
little Indians." 
</P>
<P>
 The Foxwoods casino was expected to take in $800 million in 1994. And in 1995, 
Connecticut officials expect revenues to hit $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only about 300 Pequots -- 50 to 75 previously unknown members have 
been located since the casino opened -- and each gets a portion of the take. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of the share depends on the size of a family and the age of the 
Indian. For instance, tribal elders get an increased share, according to a 
distribution plan filed with the federal Indian Gaming Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who is married with three boys and a baby on the way, said his share 
for 1994 would be between $85,000 and $160,000, depending on actual casino 
profits. That's on top of his salary for working at the casino -- something 
every Pequot must do to qualify for a share -- and his wife's income. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real millionaires will be the children, who get their share every year 
from birth and will have quite a lot built up by the time they're 21," Carter 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter said he's gotten calls from people as far away as England. Women have 
called inquiring about eligible Indian men. They've even asked about the 
consequences of getting pregnant on the reservation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call the unmarried men 'The Elite Few,' " Carter said. "We have to tell 
them to watch out, especially the ones coming of age. There are people out 
there who would do things for money." 
</P>
<P>
 Under tribal rules, applicants may be accepted only if they have at least 
one-sixteenth Pequot blood and are descended from one of five sisters who lived 
on the 200-acre reservation around 1900 -- the last pure-blood Pequots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Narragansetts also go back about 100 years to define themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 When English colonist Roger Williams came to Rhode Island in 1636, there were 
about 100,000 Narragansetts, the largest tribe in southern New England. 
Disease, war and other factors reduced that number. 
</P>
<P>
 All existing Narragansetts trace their heritage to a list of 324 people living 
on the tribe's Charlestown reservation in 1881. The list was created by the 
state's General Assembly, which decided in 1880 to put up for sale all but two 
acres of the reservation and pay those living on the land $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was to eliminate the Narragansetts as a nation. Instead, it may have 
ensured their survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be a tribal member, you must trace your ancestors to that list," 
Narragansett first tribal member Matthew Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in 1881, most Narragansetts weren't full-blooded. Many had married whites 
or blacks and, over time, their ancestors' Indian blood has thinned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They labeled us black, mulatto, coppers, Negroes, anything that would further 
the goal of genocide," said Sekatau, the medicine woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash forward more than a century, and hear developer Donald Trump complain to 
Congress about the special advantages given to Indian-operated casinos like 
Foxwoods. He points out that its operators are far from full-blooded. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal officials say that isn't their concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't look at whether tribe members descend from full-blooded Indians," 
said Holly Reckord of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Narragansetts have converted to Christianity and lost much of their 
culture, they remain a political unit as defined by the federal government. 
Every year, a Thanksgiving festival is held on the tribal land. The tribe also 
has a council of leaders and a church. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lathel Duffield, chief of the bureau's Tribal Enrollment Branch, said many 
people make the mistake of believing today's Indians should look and act like 
Indians of old. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could Indians remain aboriginal in a modern world?" he asked.

FUTURE FARMERS CHIEF BREAKS NEW GROUND; AGRICULTURE: COREY FLOURNOY IS THE 
FFA'S FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT AND ITS FIRST LEADER TO COME FROM AN URBAN AREA. 
BUT RURAL LIFE IS NOT IN HIS PLANS.

 Corey Flournoy grew up in a rough part of Chicago, and only grudgingly went 
off to the Chicago High School for Agricultural Sciences when it was the only 
public magnet high school to accept him. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Flournoy, 20, is the national president of the FFA, once known as Future 
Farmers of America -- the group's first urban president and its first black 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 In his old neighborhood, an 11-year-old was killed this summer by members of 
his own gang, who wanted him out of the way after he accidentally killed a girl 
when he shot at members of a rival gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that it could have been either of my children," said Flournoy's 
mother, Barbara Flournoy, who raised him with another son and a foster 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Flournoy's background inspires other students, FFA spokesman Bill Stagg says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corey has shown them that no matter who you are or where you come from, you 
can excel and succeed in the FFA," Stagg said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sophomore at the University of Illinois College of Agriculture, Flournoy got 
involved in the FFA because in high school, enrollment was required. Less than 
5% of the FFA's members are black, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured if I had to pay $7.50 for dues, I might as well be active." He 
began to travel on FFA projects, evaluating dairy cattle, judging beef 
carcasses and tasting milk samples, and spent six weeks working on a farm. 
</P>
<P>
 He was named president Nov. 12 at the FFA convention, selected from a pool of 
39 candidates after a grueling, months-long process that included interviews 
and tests. 
</P>
<P>
 At the convention, his mother put her camera away after the lesser officers 
were announced, sure he would leave in disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then his name was called. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept hearing someone yelling 'Thank you, Jesus,' " she said. "Someone told 
me it was me." 
</P>
<P>
 After this semester, Flournoy will take a year off for his FFA duties, which 
include meetings with officers of agricultural companies, a possible meeting 
with President Clinton and a trip to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Flournoy still doesn't want to be a farmer. He's studying 
agricultural economics with an eye toward marketing, but he really wants to 
found his own motivational company.

SCIENCE POPULARIZER SAGAN STILL A HIGH-WIRE ACT; STARGAZER: BETWEEN LECTURES 
AND SYMPOSIUMS AND ROBOTIC MISSIONS, HE'S TURNING HIS NOVEL "CONTACT" INTO A 
HOLLYWOOD SCRIPT. HE IS ALSO WRITING ANOTHER NOVEL, A "LOVE STORY," WITH HIS 
WIFE, ANN DRUYAN.

 If space aliens ever show up for real, don't expect them to even begin to 
resemble the middling monstrosities on "Star Trek." 
</P>
<P>
 "Time for us to revise our views of repulsive!" said Carl Sagan, among the 
most energetic and eloquent of stargazers. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer grandeur of the cosmos and the riddle about whether humankind shares 
some distant crossroads or voyages alone have bewitched this Russian garment 
worker's son since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience is that kids are natural-born scientists. First of all, they 
ask the deep scientific questions: Why is the moon round? Why is the sky blue? 
What's a dream? Why do we have toes? What's the birthday of the world? 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time they get into high school, they hardly ever ask questions like 
that. My conclusion is that everybody starts out as an enthusiastic potential 
scientist and then has the science beaten out of them by society." 
</P>
<P>
 Sagan said his parents ("who didn't know anything about science") not only 
nurtured his sense of wonder, they also instilled a healthy skepticism. That 
mixture, he said, is the key to being a scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with mental agility and a flair for elucidation, it begins to explain 
his success in astrophysics, as researcher and popularizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of "Cosmos," one of the most-watched series in the history of 
American public television, and "The Dragons of Eden," which won him a Pulitzer 
Prize in 1978, scans the future of space exploration in his 29th book, a 
recently published "Cosmos" sequel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pale Blue Dot" visualizes mankind "100, 200, 300 years from now and why it is 
in fact central for our survival that we be in space," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not just whizzing around in spacecraft. Actually settling other worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagan himself, who just turned 60, is still performing on the high wire. 
</P>
<P>
 Between lectures and symposiums and robotic missions, which he's been helping 
design for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration since the late 
1950s, he's turning his novel "Contact" into a Hollywood script and writing 
another novel, this one a "love story," with his wife, Ann Druyan. 
</P>
<P>
 When he gets stuck on one project, Sagan moves on to the next, allowing his 
subconscious to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come back, you find to your amazement, nine times out of 10, that 
you have solved your problem -- or your unconscious mind has -- without you 
even knowing it." 
</P>
<P>
 At Cornell University's Laboratory for Planetary Studies, which he set up in 
1968, space-mission data go into lab simulations to draw lessons about dust 
storms on Mars or the greenhouse effect of Venus. 
</P>
<P>
 Organic molecules, the kind that life on Earth is dependent on, "seem to be 
almost everywhere in the solar system beyond Mars," suggesting that "life and 
intelligence ought to be in lots of places," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But extraterrestrials would "almost certainly not" bear any physical 
resemblance to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you started the Earth over again, absolutely identical 4 1/2 billion years 
ago, and just let random factors operate -- when a cosmic ray would hit a gene, 
which gene gets mutated -- you might wind up with intelligence of great moral 
virtue, but they would not look anything like us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While detection techniques are limited to spacecraft and radio telescopes, 
finding out whether mankind is alone, or not alone, "is one of the most 
important issues you can imagine," Sagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to convince earthlings of that is not always easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trouble often is, you can't just invent something, you have to have 
underlying science," Sagan said. "It is foolish for us not to encourage at 
every level in the educational system better support for science education and 
for the encouragement of young scientists. From the most practical 
self-interest, if you care about anything else, our policy is foolish." 
</P>
<P>
 Who's to blame when science takes a back seat? Parents and teachers. 
Politicians who emphasize short-term solutions over long-term ones. Newspapers 
that publish "hokum" horoscopes in place of science columns. 
</P>
<P>
 "When's the last time you had an intelligent unprompted remark on science by a 
president of the United States? Put that all together and you can see that 
there's a problem that just runs up and down the society." 
</P>
<P>
 As for UFOs, lost continents and the like, the world can ill afford such 
pseudoscientific twaddle, Sagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody would be more interested than me if we were being visited by 
extraterrestrials, but I demand reasonable standards of evidence, just as I do 
in searching for radio signals," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sometimes pretend something is true not because there's evidence for it 
but because we want it to be true. We confuse reality with our hopes and fears, 
and that is dangerous not just on the borders of science but in politics and 
lots of other places." 
</P>
<P>
 Not least when it comes to deeply held beliefs about our origins. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if the universe is infinitely old?" he asked. "Then there's no reason to 
posit a creator because it wasn't created." 
</P>
<P>
 Then what is meant by "God?" 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a wide range of things that are called God, from the outsized, 
light-skinned male with the long white beard who sits on a throne in the sky 
and tallies the fall of every sparrow, to the kind of God of Einstein and 
Spinoza, which is something like the sum total of the laws of nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who could deny that there are laws of nature that apply everywhere in the 
universe? So, whether you say 'Absolutely, of course, there's a God!' or 'What 
are you talking about, there's not a smidgen of evidence for a God!' depends in 
a very deep way on what kind of God you're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Sagan said he has encountered "surprisingly little" hostility from people who 
equate evolutionary research with the devil's work to undermine religious 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most people appreciate having a little -- clarity maybe is too strong 
a word -- but anyway, a different point of view which makes them think. Many 
people realize I am searching for the same thing they are," he said.

INTERN PROGRAM TAKES WING AT RAPTOR REFUGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY SANCETTA, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the jagged outcropping of rock known as Owl's Head, the lush farmland 
wedged between the ridges of the Kittatinny Mountains stretches out hundreds of 
feet below. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, a red-tailed hawk catches an air current and glides noiselessly 
past at eye level. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Brett rests against a rock and scowls out at the scenery. The curator of 
Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in central Pennsylvania explains his weekly trips to 
Owl's Head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's supposed to come out here, but they do sometimes. Camp sometimes. 
Mess it up. . . . So I try to get out here and check it every Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he grins, "And it's a good way to start a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett, who oversees the 2,226-acre raptor sanctuary, is a character -- not to 
mention conservationist, adventurer and mentor. 
</P>
<P>
 A former biology teacher in nearby York County, Brett also spent some time as 
a research biologist, writing impact statements for nuclear power stations. He 
was about to enter Cornell University to work on his Ph.D. in nature 
interpretation when he took the Hawk Mountain job 24 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 During migration season, from August through December, Brett, 54, spends at 
least a few days a week perched for hours at a time on the sanctuary's North 
Lookout, counting raptors, keeping records and chatting with the regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett also does research, organizes programs and acts as teacher to the young 
interns he recruits from Pottstown, Pa., to Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're cutting edge," he says proudly of his internship program. "We have two 
black interns from Africa, one Hispanic from Ecuador and Annette." 
</P>
<P>
 Annette Edwards of Trinidad was hired by Brett recently to coordinate the 
sanctuary's internship program. He had met Edwards on his travels, liked her 
and pursued her until she accepted the job. 
</P>
<P>
 She returns the admiration. "He's such an inspiration . . . he's wonderful," 
said Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 Several seasonal interns also are accepted from the United States, including 
three this year from New Hampshire, Massachusetts and Michigan. Brett works as 
hard to recruit those students as he does the foreign interns. As a result, the 
program has become known worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brett, there are no days off. His work on and off the mountain is more a 
lifestyle than a career. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep himself fresh, he leaves the mountains of Pennsylvania for up to 12 
weeks a year and travels around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1995, he has trips planned for Panama, Israel, India and Africa. He's been 
invited to attend the first Jordanian Hawk Watch next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, Brett's travels to Tanzania, South America, the Middle East and 
Asia are for finding possible interns and speakers, leading what he calls 
"eco-tours," planning exhibits and raising money for Hawk Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Unofficially, he says, "If I don't go away every once in awhile, I go whammy." 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, Brett met the Dalai Lama in the Sinai Desert with a group from the 
Society for the Protection of Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about mutual understanding of the planet," he said with 
uncharacteristic reverence. "It was so provocative. . . . It was the aura. I 
don't get turned on by that stuff usually, but that did something to me. 
Sitting high above the Red Sea, and the wind was blowing, and behind this holy 
man was this huge flock of black storks, and he said, 'This is what we need to 
protect.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole moment transcended that particular time and place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett pauses briefly, then puts his binoculars up to his eyes and scans the 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get him here. I'm working on that," he added simply.

 As the scorched Achille Lauro sank Friday into the Indian Ocean, a surviving 
passenger blamed the crew for dropping inflatable rafts on top of a crowded 
lifeboat, injuring one man who later died. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was one of two elderly passengers who died as a result of the fire 
on the Italian luxury liner. The 979 passengers and crew who survived were 
headed for three African and Middle Eastern ports aboard 10 rescue vessels, 
including freighters and U.S. warships. They abandoned the blazing ship 
Wednesday.

GHOSTS WROTE BEST-SELLERS, AUTHOR SAYS; AFTERWORLD: BRAZIL'S MOST CELEBRATED 
SPIRIT MEDIUM CREDITS MORE THAN 500 DEAD AUTHORS AND POETS FOR HIS OUTPUT. HIS 
BREADTH OF STYLES AND SUBJECTS IS TERMED ASTOUNDING.

<P>
 Chico Xavier is a best-selling author of more than 380 books, but he says they 
all were ghost-written -- by real ghosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier, 74, is Brazil's most celebrated spirit medium. In a field famous for 
charlatans, many people believe he is the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 In three celebrated cases, Xavier was called as a defense witness in murder 
trials. The "messages" he claimed to receive from the victims were accepted as 
evidence to acquit two defendants and reduce the sentence of a third. 
</P>
<P>
 His writing amazes and wins over skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, Xavier is Brazil's most prolific writer. His hundreds of titles 
range from poetry and historical novels to scientific and medical treatises. 
</P>
<P>
 But he claims the books are really the work of more than 500 dead authors and 
poets. All he does is write them down, like dictation. Many were written in 
public sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I am writing in trance, I can see, hear and feel the spirit who is 
moving my arm," said Xavier, a rail-thin man with dark glasses and a black 
toupee constantly askew. 
</P>
<P>
 The breadth of styles and subjects is astounding for a retired civil servant 
who left school when he was 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier says his first contact with the afterworld came at age 5, when he saw 
the spirit of his dead mother. 
</P>
<P>
 In elementary school, he won an honorable mention from the state government 
for a historical essay. Xavier told his teacher he had seen a man who stood 
beside him in class and dictated the essay. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Xavier claimed he "received" messages from recently departed souls 
wishing to communicate with living relatives. His modest home in Uberaba, about 
530 miles northwest of Rio, became a mecca for admirers and miracle-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier directed the royalties from his books -- more than $20 million -- to 
charity, creating orphanages and distributing food to the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, angina has forced Xavier to give up most of his public 
writing sessions, but he continues to write in private.

WALL GONE, BERLIN'S FREEDOM PAINS; GERMANY: FIVE YEARS LATER, CONSTRUCTION 
CRANES SILHOUETTE THE SKYLINE. BUT DANGER UNKNOWN IN COLD WAR DAYS LURKS BY 
NIGHT, WITH ROBBERY AND MURDER ON THE RISE.

 "You've learned what freedom is. Don't forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 The artist's inscription appears on the longest stretch of the Berlin Wall 
still standing -- a 1.3-mile collection of murals. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years after the Wall opened, the city that once symbolized the divide 
between Western democracy and Soviet autocracy has learned freedom is a messy 
chore. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction cranes 20 stories high now silhouette Berlin's skyline. But 
danger unknown in Cold War days lurks by night, with robbery and murder on the 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
 A bicycle tour along the wall's former route tells the story of a city in 
flux. 
</P>
<P>
 The "East Side Gallery" of murals and slogans on the Wall section has lost its 
luster. Paint is chipping. Graffiti mocks the art. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby is a BMW dealership, its shiny symbols of west German manufacturing 
prowess parked against a background of prefabricated, Communist-era apartment 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The East German everyman's car, the two-stroke Trabant, is all but gone. But 
easterners couldn't trade in their drab apartments or save jobs in closed 
factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 175,000 east Germans now work in west Berlin, compared to 20,000 west 
Berliners commuting to jobs in former east Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the East Side Gallery, on the Spree River's eastern bank, a few hundred 
squatters live in ramshackle trailers, tolerated by the same city officials who 
evicted them from the Kreuzberg district three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the river is Kreuzberg, once a low-rent western district in the Wall's 
shadow. Now it borders a booming city center and property values have shot up. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of penthouse apartments around here were refurbished and are standing 
empty because the prices are too high," said Oliver Schattel, who helps run a 
small farm that Kreuzberg squatters started along the wall in 1980. City 
officials want to bulldoze the farm. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the yuppie influx prompted Kreuzberg extremists to bomb an upscale 
delicatessen and a few developers' luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars sometimes seem useless in the city of 3.47 million people. Traffic crawls 
as streets are torn up and rebuilt, subway lines renovated, long-severed bridge 
and rail links re-established. 
</P>
<P>
 About $30 billion in building projects are in the works, most slated for 
completion by 2000, when the government's move from Bonn should be in full 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian and Allied soldiers left Berlin last fall, and as they moved out, the 
world moved in. Eastern Europeans account for most of the 25% rise to 395,000 
foreign residents since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the new arrivals are burglars and car thieves blamed for much of an 
alarming rise in crime. Murder and attempted murder nearly doubled to 735 cases 
in Berlin in 1993 from 1992. Police say Russian mobsters are a key factor.

AMA CALLS FOR LAWS ON HEAD PROTECTION; HEAD WEAR: IN A NEW REPORT, RESEARCHERS 
FIND THAT THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF MOTORCYCLE CRASH IS HEAD-ON, TYPICALLY WITH A 
CAR. THE CRASHES ARE LIKELY TO CAUSE SKULL FRACTURES.

<P>
 The American Medical Assn., citing a report that helmet-wearing motorcyclists 
are less likely to die or suffer severe head injuries, wants more cyclists to 
ride with their heads covered. 
</P>
<P>
 An AMA position statement, and a key study that paved the way for it, appear 
in a recent issue of The Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The study looked at the change in deaths and injuries after California adopted 
a law mandating helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers examined police reports and death certificates for 1991, before 
the law -- and 1992, after it. 
</P>
<P>
 After the law, fewer people died, fewer of the deaths were from head injuries, 
and head injuries in general were less severe, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the law, crash fatalities dropped by more than 37%, to 327 in 1992, said 
researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles and the Insurance 
Institute for Highway Safety in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Head injuries were lower both in those who died and those who lived, said the 
researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who died, the proportion in which the head was the most severely 
injured body region decreased by almost 25% after the law. Among those who 
lived, the decrease was close to 31%. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA researcher Jess F. Kraus had publicized his findings in 1993, but ran 
into opposition from a statewide anti-helmet group that contended that the 
legislation violates their rights. Some opponents of the helmet law also 
asserted that the drop in deaths was a result of rainy weather and of riders 
giving up biking rather than have to wear a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs, which wrote the AMA position 
statement, the reason for the drop in deaths and injuries is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common type of motorcycle crash is head-on, typically with a car, the 
council's report said. The crashes are likely to cause skull fractures. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, the council said, it makes sense for modern road warriors to 
protect themselves as did warriors of old, with helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorcycle helmets are "designed to cushion and spread the severe forces of 
head blows in crashes," the position statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is to get more motorcyclists to wear them, the council said. 
</P>
<P>
 More states should pass laws that make helmets mandatory, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the last year for which the AMA had publishable data, 23 states and 
the District of Columbia required helmets of all riders, and 24 required 
helmets of some, typically those under 18, it said. The others had no 
requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, use went up from 48% before the law to 99% a year after, the 
council's report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers in the California study found those riders who did not wear 
helmets after the law took effect accounted for almost 15% of those killed or 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA report also calls on motorcycle manufacturers and insurance companies 
to help -- perhaps with discounts or vouchers to purchase helmets.

 A Czech provincial court sentenced two skinheads to one year in jail for 
deliberately causing the death of a Gypsy, the CTK news agency reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Tibor Danihel, 17, died in September, 1993, in Pisek, 65 miles 
south of Prague, after a gang of 18 skinheads -- armed with baseball bats, 
chains and sticks -- chased him into the freezing waters of the Otava river and 
prevented his rescue.

HEAD START CENTER OFFERS HAVEN OF HOPE TO MIGRANT WORKERS' CHILDREN; FAMILIES: 
THE PARKSLEY, VA., FACILITY PROVIDES FOOD, HEALTH CARE AND A CHANCE FOR MINDS 
TO GROW. ITS EXPANDED PROGRAM MAY BE A MODEL FOR THE FUTURE. 
</P>

 Every morning before dawn, four school buses circle the migrant camps of 
Virginia's eastern shore, picking up babies and preschool children and bringing 
them to a cinder-block building fragrant with baking bread and fresh laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 Many arrive filthy, sometimes with cockroaches in their shoes or lice in their 
hair, so the first stop of the day is the bathtub in the Parksley Migrant Head 
Start Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Once bathed, the children will spend the next 12 hours at the center, a refuge 
from crowded houses and shacks of the migrant camps, a place where everything 
is cooked from scratch and the toys are geared to each stage of their 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government wants more Head Start centers to look like Parksley. 
It's filled with babies, toddlers and preschoolers, offers full services and is 
open all day. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Head Start centers also offer comprehensive child-development 
services to low-income children, but enrollment is generally limited to 4- and 
5-year-olds and most programs are half-day. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, Congress voted for the first time to expand Head Start to 
infants and toddlers. The decision reflects a growing recognition that the 
first three years of life lay the foundation for all that follows, and that a 
healthy start depends on a stable environment that is also stimulating, 
responsive, protective and loving. 
</P>
<P>
 A small percentage of Head Start's overall budget -- $106 million out of $3.5 
billion in 1995 -- is devoted to programs serving children from birth to age 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Migrant Head Start, a $130-million system of 400 centers nationwide, has a 
25-year history of working with infants and toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, who are taking control of Congress, have vowed to take a close 
look at all of the anti-poverty programs. Head Start won't be exempt from the 
scrutiny, but the program has been widely popular with both Republicans and 
Democrats during its 29-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parksley center has become so popular among the Mexican-American migrants 
that it is often their first stop when they arrive in trucks to pick vegetables 
on Virginia's eastern shore, a narrow peninsula of graceful pines and silty 
fields between the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which serves a maximum of 88 children and operates on two shifts, 
fills up quickly, and at the height of the season there are often 60 children 
on the waiting list, says center director Joyce Dix. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members say the children are taught good eating and health habits and 
given a daily health check before their baths. After family-style meals are 
served, anyone old enough to hold a toothbrush gathers around the sink to 
brush. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff is trained to spot any developmental problems, physical 
disabilities, and emotional and behavioral problems among the children. They 
look for children who aren't crawling on time, learning to walk properly or 
able to hold a pencil as they get older. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they haven't developed these skills, nine times out of 10 they'll be left 
behind," Dix said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dix said the parents, who work in the fields all day and in the packing sheds 
at night, may not have the time or experience to notice problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't reach them in the first three years, we're going to lose a lot of 
them," said Jenni Stewart, program coordinator for the Virginia Council of 
Churches, which runs the Parksley center and four other Migrant Head Start 
programs in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor dental hygiene is one of the most common problems of the children at 
Parksley, and the center occasionally arranges dental surgery for children 
whose baby teeth have rotted into painful splinters. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Allshouse, a licensed practical nurse who is the center's health and 
disabilities coordinator, says she also sees frequent ear infections, 
occasional lice and, in years past, identified total deafness in children whose 
parents were unaware of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Dix says this generation of children seems better off than their parents -- 
some of the preschoolers are nearly as tall as their mothers -- and Allshouse 
says it may be due in part to all the vitamins and good cooking they get in 
Parksley. 
</P>
<P>
 The families come from Texas and Florida, and have usually worked in Georgia 
and the Carolinas before they arrive in Virginia. When they finish on the 
shore, some head north to harvest cranberries in Massachusetts and blueberries 
in Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 Migrants are among the poorest-paid workers in the country, with median 
earnings of $5,000 in 1991, according to Monica Heppel, associate professor of 
anthropology at Mount Vernon College in Washington. She is a farm-labor expert 
who lived for a year in the camps on Virginia's eastern shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the children travel long distances, Stewart says, they often know 
little about the outside world. The Parksley center tries to make up for the 
frequent upheavals in their lives and takes them on field trips to places like 
pet shops, pony farms and zoos. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to build up their confidence," said teacher Regina Pettit as the 
children sleep on their cots, covered in identical green blankets. "You're the 
person they look to when they're afraid or sad. It makes us feel good that they 
have a place like this to come to. We know they're safe here."

POWER RANGERS -- THE BIGGEST THING SINCE CABBAGE PATCH KIDS; WISH LIST: NEXT TO 
THE MIGHTY MORPHINS, VIDEO GAMES ARE FADING. AND BARBIE STILL IS THE 
BEST-SELLING DOLL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five helmeted action heroes have karate-kicked Sega off Santa's list. The 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, those evil-battling figures based on a hit 
television show, are the most sought-after toys this Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the most unbelievable phenomenon we've seen in the toy industry -- as 
soon as we get them in, within a day or two, they've all sold out," said 
Michael Goldstein, chief executive officer of Toys R Us Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a full year now (that they've been on the market) and it's bigger than 
anything we've seen since Cabbage Patch Kids," Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Power Rangers are the talk of the toy stores, video games are fading, 
giving makers of traditional toys a chance for bigger sales. Barney is past his 
prime. But Barbie, who appears to have discovered the fountain of youth yet 
again, still is the best-selling doll. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein said many shoppers will be lucky to find Power Rangers, simply 
because demand is so strong. Bandai America, which makes the toys, has 16 
factories turning them out, but there still may not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no near-riots have been reported in toy stores among parents 
scrambling to get Power Rangers, unlike the Cabbage Patch dolls, which set off 
several highly publicized fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone selling anything with the Power Rangers name, such as clothes, books 
and games, will do well. Tyco Toys expects $1 million in sales of Power Rangers 
Viewmaster slides. "We can't make enough of them," spokesman Bruce Maguire 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Power Rangers' success has spilled over to other products in the action 
figure lineup, giving lines like Batman, X-Men, Samurai Warriors and Biker Mice 
from Mars a boost, Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts agree that the Power Rangers, who mutate into gladiators 
that save the world, are what's known in the industry as a megahit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's consuming the industry like nothing has for years," said John Taylor, 
who tracks the toy business for L. H. Alton & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Some big stars of past holiday seasons aren't showing up on wish lists this 
year, especially video games. After peaking with an estimated 35% of the 
overall toy market, video's share is now about 20% by some estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, video games have been displaced by computer games, especially 
those available in the fast-growing CD-ROM format, which are growing in 
popularity with children as well as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 But video is still a billion-dollar business and still has big hits, including 
Super Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country game and Sega's Sonic and Knuckles. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinosaurs, whether they're the Jurassic Park variety or plush Barney dolls, 
are also in retreat this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barbie, a perennial best seller, "is literally off the charts," Goldstein 
said. Manufacturer Mattel has found another winning formula for Barbie, making 
her pose-able. Even My Size Barbie, as tall as a little girl and selling for 
more than $100, is doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 Among baby dolls, Taylor found no single standout, although he said Tyco's My 
Pretty Topsy Tail and All Star Toys' Tattoodles are particularly popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the Power Ranger success is due partly to their unisex appeal. Two 
Power Rangers are girls. Bandai America, in addition to the regular action 
figures, sells dressable dolls with long, flowing hair based on those 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taylor said sales of traditional dolls haven't been hurt by the Power 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiger Electronics said its Talkboy tape recorder, featured in the movie "Home 
Alone 2," likely will sell out for a second holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, children also love gross and disgusting stuff too. So another big 
seller is Tyco's Doctor Dreadful mini-laboratories to make edible worms and 
warts.

ANGRY RETIREES BATTLE BIG BUSINESS TO KEEP THEIR HEALTH CARE; MEDICINE: 
COMPANIES ARGUE THAT THEIR OWN FINANCIAL WELL-BEING IS ENDANGERED BY THE RISING 
COST OF BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After nearly 26 years, two heart attacks and a stroke, Harry Ellis retired 
from his factory job in March, too sick to work anymore. He clung to one oasis 
of security -- his medical insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last summer, he learned he could lose that. Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. 
announced it was terminating health benefits for retirees, saying rising 
medical costs had become intolerable and jeopardized the company's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Ellis now fears his own future. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I worked here, I believed it straight out they'll take care of you for 
the rest of your life," said the 56-year-old former welder, his voice rising, 
his face flushed pink with anger beneath his pastel-print railroad cap. "I 
thought all I have to do is bury myself. Now I might not have nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis is not alone in his anger; he is at the center of one of the most 
rancorous labor-management disputes of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate reverberates in workplaces across America as more companies -- 
heavyweights like General Motors, Unisys and Navistar, among them -- slash or 
eliminate medical health insurance for more retirees. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with spiraling health care costs and growing numbers of retirees, 
companies argue their own financial health is at stake. Changes in accounting 
rules have forced them to subtract the projected cost of retiree health 
benefits from profits -- a drain on the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirees, meanwhile, say they were promised protection, sometimes explicitly 
in contracts, and it's illegal to abandon them at this vulnerable time in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 So they go to court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirelli Armstrong case is in the hands of a federal judge in Nashville, 
Tenn.; he will decide by Dec. 15 whether the company has the right to cut off 
benefits to 3,200 retirees and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 They claim they're being betrayed because they accepted smaller wage increases 
in lieu of health care insurance and were told in exit interviews they would be 
protected until death -- an intent they insist also was clear in their 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people were promised lifetime benefits," said Chuck Armstrong, an 
attorney for the United Rubber Workers Union, which filed the suit. "Many of 
them are uninsurable. Many of them are living on marginal incomes and they 
couldn't pay for benefits even if they could get them." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like when you buy a life insurance policy and then the insurance company 
comes along and says it can't afford to pay," said Hank Grant, 72, a Des Moines 
retiree. 
</P>
<P>
 But at trial, Pirelli Armstrong argued that there is no written agreement 
providing lifetime coverage, that it has the right to adjust or terminate 
benefits and that it should not be held responsible for commitments made 
decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also cites its shaky financial status: An audit showed a 
$61.1-million loss in 1993; a letter to retirees said it anticipates losing an 
additional $55 million this year, including retirees' medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If our company continues to lose money, then it will reach a point where it 
will fail and then it won't be able to pay (any) health benefits or salaries," 
said Bob Newman, Pirelli Armstrong's public relations director. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said retirees' health insurance is a generous package that cost the 
company $30 million last year, amounting to more than $7,000 per family. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 survey of companies by Foster Higgins & Co., a benefits consulting 
firm, found the average cost of a retiree's health benefits was $2,735, though 
it was almost twice that for those under age 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical care for retirees "is a real drag on employers," said Deborah Chollet, 
associate director of the Alpha Center, a Washington, D.C.-based health policy 
think tank. "It represents a fixed cost, no matter how they manage the work 
force or production." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 13 million retirees over age 55 receive health benefits from former 
employers, she said, and more than a third of those -- about 4.5 million -- may 
be especially at risk of losing coverage because companies wrote escape clauses 
into their benefit plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But understandably, every time a company has tried to wield the ax, it has met 
with resistance: 
</P>
<P>
 * In February, a judge said General Motors must reinstate full coverage and 
pay back benefits for 50,000 salaried early retirees, who filed suit in 1989. 
That ruling has been appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Fay, an attorney for the GM retirees, said that in these kinds of 
cases involving union contracts, retirees have won about half the time; for 
salaried retirees, companies have been mostly victorious. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unisys, the computer maker, is phasing out retirees medical care by 1996, a 
move estimated to save $100 million annually; that's still in litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Navistar settled a class-action lawsuit with retirees with a plan that cut 
their medical benefits but gave them stock equal to a third of the company, a 
spokeswoman for the truck maker said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Pirelli Armstrong is a small company, a division of Pirelli SpA 
of Italy, which purchased Armstrong Tire Co. in 1988. It has plants in 
California and Tennessee. The case also affects retirees from plants that 
closed in Connecticut and Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has offered a settlement to its retirees, but Armstrong, the 
attorney, said it would create a hardship for many: A couple with a $750 
monthly pension, he said, would end up paying a third of that for medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Tire Corp., which bought the Iowa plant from Pirelli Armstrong this 
summer, also offered the Des Moines retirees $1,000 annually for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There ain't no way in the world I'll take it. I don't think it's fair," said 
Ellis, a blunt-spoken man, one of 21 children of a coal miner. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said he and his wife, Patty, who has asthma and lung problems, have 
prescription bills alone of $740 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolly Coan, whose husband, Charles, died of cancer in October, says she 
depends, in part, on his $400 pension to help support a 24-year-old mildly 
retarded daughter, who has cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have to put out $500-$600 in health insurance, where would that leave 
me?" the 61-year-widow asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Ellis says if he loses his insurance, he'll have to find another job, 
even though his doctor advised him not to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job was probably the most important thing in my life," he said. "I also 
thought if you work hard and take care of your family, you'd be taken care of . 
. . I don't believe that anymore."

EAST TIMOR INDEPENDENCE ACTIVISTS FULL OF ZEAL; SOUTHEAST ASIA: THE UNITED 
NATIONS NEVER RECOGNIZED ITS ANNEXATION. BUT INDONESIA INSISTS ON ITS 
INTEGRATION WITH THE REST OF THE ARCHIPELAGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "Viva Timor Leste! Long Live East Timor!" 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden shout across the grounds of the Roman Catholic cathedral 
transformed what had been a quiet congregation waiting outside for Mass into a 
mob of excited political protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-government banners unfurled, and chants of pro-independence slogans rang 
out. Fights broke out. Rocks and bottles arched through the air. Then riot 
police moved in with clubs and tear gas to rout the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 East Timorese independence activists have been escalating their protests since 
international attention focused on a meeting of leaders of Pacific Rim nations 
in Indonesia early in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Indonesia forcibly annexed East Timor two decades ago after 400 years of 
neglectful Portuguese colonial rule, millions of dollars have been spent on 
sorely needed development. But while they have more today than before, many 
people in East Timor still demand self-determination and independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people must keep their dignity and their identity," said Bishop Carlos 
Belo, the territory's spiritual leader and a critic of rule by Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations never recognized East Timor's annexation. But Indonesia's 
government in Jakarta insists the predominantly Catholic region be integrated 
with the rest of the Muslim-dominated archipelago in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been halting steps throughout 1994 toward reconciliation between 
the government and some independence activists. Gov. Abilio Osorio Soares, a 
native of Timor, suggested a form of "special area" status be granted to the 
territory as a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 But Indonesia is unlikely to ever agree to self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indonesia wants us to be good little Indonesians. But for us, integration 
never," said one student protester, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Such comments are dangerous talk in a place where the international human 
rights group Amnesty International says authorities are guilty of torture, 
arbitrary killings and wrongful imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia denies that charge, but soldiers shot dozens of unarmed civilians to 
death during a protest march three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 An official inquiry said about 50 people died in the shooting at the Santa 
Cruz cemetery in Dili, the provincial capital, on Nov. 12, 1991. An additional 
91 were wounded and 57 were missing, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend more than 200 people may have died in the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indonesian government allowed foreign journalists into East Timor for a 
rare visit coinciding with the third anniversary of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dili is a hot and dusty town where suspicion and frustration weigh as heavily 
as the tropical humidity. Almost everyone, from cab drivers to hotel porters, 
talks of informers and spies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are being watched all the time," said one activist who has joined students 
in demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the anniversary of the cemetery shooting, protesters rampaged 
through Dili's streets after a Timorese man was murdered by a new settler from 
another Indonesian island. Houses and stores owned by other newcomers were 
stoned and burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-sponsored influx of people from other crowded parts of 
Indonesia is a sore point. They number about 100,000 in a total population of 
720,000. Locals complain they take the cream of jobs and money created by 
Indonesia's development effort. 
</P>
<P>
 High in the mountains of the rugged interior, Indonesian soldiers search for a 
small band of armed rebels who have been fighting a limited guerrilla campaign 
since the invasion two decades ago.

<P>
 Their leader, Xanana Gusmao, was captured in 1992. He was later convicted of 
subversion and is serving 20 years in prison on another island. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia has governed the western half of the island of Timor since 1945, 
when it won independence from the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 It annexed East Timor in 1976, after intervening in a civil war among rival 
political factions that broke out the previous year when Portugal suddenly 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal profited for generations from sandalwood and coffee exports but did 
little to better the lives of the Timorese or prepare them for self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Since invading, Indonesia has built roads and other infrastructure and 
improved education and health care. Houses are being built and some jobs 
created although unemployment remains high. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Indonesian-built university is a center of dissent for young 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter how many bridges, roads and schools Indonesia builds, the 
Timorese people need to keep their culture and beliefs and their souls," Belo, 
the bishop, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The army says seven of the eight infantry battalions based in East Timor are 
assigned to construction projects and only one is designated for combat duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Belo previously called for Indonesia to hold a referendum on East 
Timor's future, he seems more concerned now about encouraging calm. 
</P>
<P>
 He is guarded in his comments and condemns recent protests and violence.

SHOW MY AGE? NO WAY, INSIST DANCING SENIORS; DANCING: TEACHER, 70, BEGAN THE 
CLASS ON A WHIM, OFFERING A THREE-MONTH SESSION FOR JUST $10. IT QUICKLY CAUGHT 
ON AND NOW THEY COME REGULARLY TO HER BRIGHTLY LIT STUDIO. AND ALL OF HER 
STUDENTS ARE ENTHUSIASTIC.

<P>
 Every Friday, the Young at Heart dancers kick up their heels in a tiny studio 
here where the motivational message from their 70-year-old instructor is: Age 
is only a number. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is for dancers who are at least 55 and want to stay young by keeping 
fit. The oldest is 82, the youngest 63. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people come to me and ask 'Are you still dancing?' I say 'Why not?' " 
said Ilsetraut Dinshah, a German-born dancer who began teaching the class 
several years ago. "Dancers are ageless." 
</P>
<P>
 Dinshah, who began dancing when she was 15, also teaches younger students five 
days a week. But she looks forward to the hourlong class with her peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real special group," said Dinshah. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinshah began the senior dance class on a whim, offering a three-month session 
for just $10. It quickly caught on and about a dozen women now come regularly 
to the brightly lit studio in the basement of Dinshah's home in this rural 
Gloucester County community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would only last for a few weeks," said Dinshah, a former 
ballerina who has been teaching for 22 years. "But they kept coming." 
</P>
<P>
 The dancers come from varied backgrounds and most have never danced seriously 
before now. They became local celebrities after they were featured on a 
television program. The group performs regularly for older people and disabled 
veterans groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of fun," said Daisy Buchanan, 70, a retired nurse who joined 18 
months ago. "I really enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 The dancers say the class has made a difference in their lives. Most were not 
physically active and wanted a way to get in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted the exercise," said Dot Renshaw, 67, who joined the group two years 
ago after back surgery. "Before I came here, if I bent down I couldn't get up 
on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 The class is open to men and women, but Dinshah's husband, Cyrus, 70, is the 
only man who participates. He helps newcomers or partners his wife when the 
group does a polka dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me," said Cyrus Dinshah. "I'm comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of a recent class, Dinshah put a Scott Joplin album on an old 
phonograph as the dancers took their positions on the wooden floor in front of 
a mirrored wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The other walls are painted bright yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 After warm-up exercises, Dinshah, wearing low-heeled pink ballet shoes, guided 
the class through stretching routines to loosen their joints, especially the 
hips. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you can still stretch, you have it made," said Dinshah. "It makes you 
feel young." 
</P>
<P>
 Dinshah began dancing in her native Berlin where she performed with a troupe 
entertaining troops during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 When she became too old to dance professionally, she took odd jobs as a 
waitress and a saleswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, Dinshah moved to the United States after her marriage. She began 
dancing again when she opened a studio here in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said 'Oh I can dance again,' " recalled Dinshah, her blue eyes sparkling. 
"This is my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Dinshah keeps the mood light while instructing her senior students. 
</P>
<P>
 When their faces turn somber as they concentrate on the steps, she tells them 
to smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "This keeps me limber," said 82-year-old Betty Rein, a retired seamstress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get arthritis like old people have." 
</P>
<P>
 Comfortably dressed in loose-fitting clothing, the dancers perform routines 
that include line dancing. Some wear ballet shoes, others fuzzy bedroom 
slippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She also tells us to look sexy," yells Alice Fellenbaum, 63, a retired school 
teacher and the youngest in the group. "It's our only chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The group tries to keep up with their svelte instructor. The 5-foot, 132-pound 
Dinshah is barely winded as she moves through the routines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want you to overdo it," cautioned Dinshah. "We just want you to see 
what possibilities you have with your bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Some occasionally miss a step, but perfection is not the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make a lot of mistakes," said Adeline Fiocchi, 74. "But it's fun anyway."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: GUNNING FOR NEWT, BILL AND BETTY CROCKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today we break the usual long-winded mold and announce the first sporadic 
Square Pegs List, a compendium of comments, overreactions and complaints about 
items that don't fit anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Lee will be thrilled: It has come to our attention that a Kansas City, 
Kan., businesswoman has founded a group called the Burned Out Business Women's 
Assn. (BOBWA) that meets once a month to vent and banter. No pantyhose allowed. 
No networking either. "I just want women to have a realistic view of 
themselves," founder Marcia Hines told a local newspaper. "Women's magazines 
show a cream cheese dessert on the cover and have articles on how to lose 20 
pounds in three weeks. And models look good, but they work out three or four 
hours a day. I can't do that; I'm trying to earn a buck." 
</P>
<P>
 Hines plans to market a bumper sticker: "Betty Crocker Is Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newt won't be too happy either: We have apparently failed to show the proper 
respect for incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and thus have received some 
angry mail from gloating Republicans. Besides displaying an unhealthy degree of 
adoration for Gingrich, they also reveal a very unpatriotic disdain for their 
commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we realize that President Clinton is on the "Out" list at the moment, but 
we were heartened to receive a copy of "Dreams of Bill" (Citadel Press), a 
compilation of dreams about the President by ordinary Americans, edited by 
Julia and Bruce Miller. Bill Clinton plays a starring role in the subconscious 
of a startling number of Americans, such as Jill Draper, a 36-year-old Missouri 
mom: 
</P>
<P>
 I was invited to go on one of the (campaign trail) bus tours, but instead of a 
bus, they traveled in an airplane that taxied down the interstates. At one 
point, Bill approached me and asked if I wanted to go upstairs, he had 
something to tell me. When we got upstairs, he said, "You want to know a 
secret?" I said, "Sure." He said, "When I raise all those rich people's taxes? 
It's really going to make them mad."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What would Dan Quayle say?: Speaking of Newt, is it just us, or is anyone else 
out there more than mildly amused at the extraordinarily un-family values-ish 
past of the Speaker-to-Be? We're partial to the widely reported story of how 
his first wife threw him out of her hospital room the day after she underwent 
surgery for uterine cancer in 1980 because he wanted to talk about their 
divorce settlement! Even his former minister questions the sincerity of Newt's 
conservative "ideals": "He sees what will help him," the minister recently told 
a newspaper reporter, "whether he believes it or not, he uses it." 
</P>
<P>
 What can we say -- except Amen to that, Reverend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of Mice and Mozzarella: One of our passions, we admit somewhat sheepishly, is 
perusing the monthly "Restaurant Closures" feature of The Times, which lists 
eateries closed by the county Department of Health Services for various code 
infractions. We look for the greasy spoon ethnic restaurants our husband likes 
to patronize, taking special care to circle them in red ink and post in a 
prominent place in the kitchen. Plumbing failures don't faze us. It's other 
pesky sanitary problems that really gross us out. But every once in a while, we 
actually get a laugh. Is it just us, or is there something richly ironic about 
last Tuesday's list, which featured the temporary closure of a local Chuck E 
Cheese's pizza restaurant for . . . vermin infestation? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't Worry -- Jesse Helms is on the Case: In the interest of bipartisanship 
-- and we are not, we insist, kissing up to Newt -- we note that some dreamers 
of Bill did experience nightmares, such as Genevra Leo, a 25-year-old 
hairdresser from Orange: 
</P>
<P>
 I was going to my mother's to house-sit for the weekend. After I got to her 
home, I sat down to watch some movies I rented. I fell asleep and when I awoke, 
I noticed I had been stabbed repeatedly. When the police arrived, they 
suggested I go to the hospital, but I refused, because my friend was coming to 
pick me up to go to Ben and Jerry's to get ice cream.  
</P>
<P>
 The police let me go with her and she didn't seem to care that I had multiple 
stab wounds. She dropped me off at home where I called my gram. I told her I 
had been stabbed, and she said to me, "I warned you about him." I asked, "Who?" 
She replied, "Bill Clinton. He's been going around stabbing people who have 
relatives in Arkansas."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, he can tune up our toenails: We note with dismay allegations of 
sexual discrimination by a group of men who worked for Jenny Craig Inc. in the 
Boston area. And we certainly hope this is not some cagey tie-in with the movie 
"Disclosure." But we take this opportunity to emphasize our own lack of gender 
bias in business dealings. When we arrived for a manicure appointment at a nail 
salon last week, we were pleasantly surprised to see that our nails were to be 
painted by the first male manicurist we have encountered. We would fault him 
for just one thing: the grease under his nails, but since, as he explained, he 
had been working on his transmission that morning, we certainly understood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bad reaction to popcorn?: Allegations of movie-inspired blood sucking have 
begun in the wake of the release of the movie "Interview With the Vampire." In 
San Francisco last week, a man was arrested for stabbing his girlfriend then 
drinking her blood. "I was influenced by the movie," the suspect said. "I 
enjoyed the movie. But I cannot sit here and blame the movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Just to be on the safe side, we'd like to suggest this man never be allowed to 
rent the movie "Alive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That explains why no one understood the health care plan: We leave you with a 
final dream of Bill. It belongs to Wendy Vorce, a 40-year-old gardener in 
Oregon: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm an observer at an outdoor party. A waitress asks the President if he'd 
like a drink. "Yes," he says. "A kangaroo, and make it orange."

GALLERY: INNER VISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIENNE M. JOHNSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether within us as naturally and inseparably as breathing or infused in us 
by a deity, the spirit dwells. No matter that it is invisible, it is there. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Times photographer Chester Higgins Jr. has seen it and captured it in 
many forms. In his new book, "Feeling the Spirit" (Bantam Books), he culled the 
images of a 26-year journey across the African diaspora -- Central America, 
Europe, the Carribean and the American South. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to look for what is apparent," he says. "But what is in front of me is 
not always what you can see -- it's what you feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his work includes many ceremonies, he believes spirit precedes 
religion. It defines us. "We have to find a way to appreciate what is," he 
says, "and what is, is pretty great. Life is the main event." ADRIENNE M.

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: VOCAL CHORDS; THOSE WITH A SONG IN THEIR HEARTS 
OR A TUNE IN THEIR HEADS FIND FUN AT THE ROUND TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Jones and Tony Bennett have risen again. Frank Sinatra and Bono record 
duets. Lo and behold, the lounge lizard is back. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes it a good time to rediscover the piano bar at the Round Table in 
Santa Monica. This is the real stuff, a savory miracle that has been quietly 
persisting on a dreary stretch of Wilshire Boulevard for 41 years. Sure it's 
something of a fantasy trip through time, but the Round Table is neither kitsch 
nor camp. 
</P>
<P>
 No, call it the thinking man's Dresden Room. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior runs to Bavarian cocktail lounge, with lots of red and black 
vinyl, a low-beamed ceiling, and faux brick walls -- the kind of authentic 
period decor that makes set designers salivate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like going into a time warp," says pianist Dick Leslie. "People who have 
been gone 15 years come in and they say, 'My God, it's exactly the same.'  
</P>
<P>
 "Jeanne, you can verify this," he says to bartender, Jeanne Matten. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah," Matten jokes. "It never changes; they just die." 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas twinkle lights line every window and rafter, although Matten is 
quick to point out that the holiday trimmings haven't gone up yet. "Last year 
we had 33 Christmas trees in here." 
</P>
<P>
 She gestures to a small tree on the bar behind her. "We have that tree up 
year-round because Bob (Hatten, the owner) thinks every day should be 
Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 There's nary a twentysomething in sight, nor even a yuppie. This is an older 
crowd, dressed for success, although everyone has a touch of individual style. 
It's a good place to come if you've forgotten just what can be done with a suit 
and tie. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast of regulars include many who come to flex their vocal cords. 
</P>
<P>
 "They enjoy coming here to 'do the thing.' It's an expression here," says Tony 
Briggs, a dapper Englishman who sells Jaguars for a living and stops in three 
nights a week to listen.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a character about this place. There are places with more 
sophistication, but places with character are dwindling. And the food is 
superb.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jeanne," he calls to the bartender in his Yorkshire lilt, "maybe you can talk 
me into a Glenlivet if you try." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Tuesday, an intimate clique of vocalists sits together at the bar 
that wraps around the grand piano, listening intently to one another's 
performances and chatting convivially in between. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Hanna, an impeccably mustachioed gent, sings "Fools Rush In" in a voice 
that is polished and full. "My lady and I both sing here four nights a week. 
This is a lovely place. People are ultra-friendly. If you came here twice you'd 
find that everybody starts to say hello to you. And the steaks are absolutely 
the best in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Things heat up on the weekends. "Friday and Saturday nights are when it's 
really interesting and happening and fun," says pianist Leslie, who welcomes 
anything from jazz to rock. "But it's pretty much a cattle call, with so many 
singers that I have to limit everyone to two numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie is the soul of the Round Table, the reason so much singing talent 
continues to show up, even on a lonely Tuesday night like this one. "I started 
my 25th year here on Thanksgiving," he says with a sigh. "It's almost a steady 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to play for people with taste," says Leslie, who welcomes singers of 
every stripe. "There are only two kinds of music, and that's good and bad. 
There's good rock and there's bad rock, and good pop and bad pop.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I mean by taste."

 Tatou will soon be putting its mark on the Century City space now occupied by 
Tripp's. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills cabaret / restaurant / nightclub will "move the spirit of 
Tatou but not the name" to the new location this spring, said the club's 
creative director Rudolf. The new venue, which will also be owned by Mark 
Fleischman, will be called the Century Club. Tatou's current location on 
Beverly Drive will remain open as a dance club with the same owners and 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 The new space will have three restaurants, including a 400-seat main dining 
room that will feature live entertainment, much as the current locale does. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something clubs have to do to stay fresh," said Rudolf. "There were 
many, many people bidding on the Tripp's space. They all wanted to open 
something that would be competition to Tatou. So now we have the space and 
we're our own competition."

Kerrigan, plays a waitress who ends up with Mafia money.

 Harding will be doing scenes involving skating, arguing with a boyfriend about

 On Jan. 20, new management will open Fantasy Island on the site. A

 In a sense, a tradition carries on: Patrons will still be seeing ribs at what

WESTSIDE WATCH: LOCAL POOCH IS TOP DOG TO CHASE AFTER CHUCK WAGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yeehaw! Purina Chuck Wagon Stampede dog food is making a comeback. And the 
poster dog, who like his predecessor will chase a tiny, horse-drawn covered 
wagon brimming with kibble, is a Westside pooch. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rags-to-riches story, a former pound dog named Sage (French for 
intelligent and pronounced sahj ) won a nationwide competition in which 1,000 
would-be cover canines auditioned via videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 The rival dogs included a border collie and an Australian shepherd -- highbrow 
purebreds next to the beardie mix Sage. But Sage won because he had that "just 
really cute" look, according to a Ralston Purina Co. spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 After chasing an electronically operated plastic wagon around bales of straw 
during his audition, the shaggy dog, who looks a lot like the original 1970s 
Chuck Wagon pooch, jumped up on a Hollywood studio stage and cocked his head at 
the cameraman. "And the cameraman said, 'Ahhhhh . . . he sat right on the 
mark,' " said Sage's "mom," Julie Fulton, a West Los Angeles actress. Sage 
received 40 pounds of Chuck Wagon Stampede kibble and $1,000, Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company says it decided to resurrect the dog food after focus-group 
research revealed that people "had an unbelievable recall" of the TV ads for 
the product, in which a dog chased a miniature chuck wagon around the kitchen. 
</P>

 CLOSE SHAVE: Remember when Robert Gruenberg, a.k.a. the Venice Beach chain saw 
juggler, announced in a buzz of publicity recently that he was retiring his 
cutting-edge act? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a part of the story you may not have heard. 
</P>
<P>
 After weeks of hype, the fearless juggler planned a final stunt on Oct. 23 
that threatened to risk his very manhood: revving up the Sears Craftsman in the 
nude. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the advance publicity, Gruenberg said, police who patrol the 
boardwalk warned him they would cite him on several charges, including indecent 
exposure and incitement to riot. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gruenberg ran to his performance perch, wearing just a G-string beneath his 
trench coat, he saw dozens of young children waiting in the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 So, tipping his hat to family values, he said, Gruenberg opted not to take it 
all off. He juggled but kept the G-string in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe people brought their kids," he said. "I decided I didn't 
want to be remembered that way; I'm not that desperate." 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing his act, Gruenberg finally packed away his chain saw -- under 
the kitchen sink. He says he occasionally performs on the boardwalk -- but only 
to practice for the comedy club career that he hopes lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you juggle a chain saw, nobody hears anything you say," he said. "Now I 
realize I can hold a crowd without it. . . . The tongue is stronger than any 
weapon."

BIRTH OF THE BLUES; WEST HOLLYWOOD: THREE TIMES A WEEK, THE NIGHTSPOT BECOMES A 
CLASSROOM AND MUSEUM. IT HELPS TRACE THE LINEAGE BETWEEN AFRICAN AND AMERICAN 
CULTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a softly lit nightclub stage, backed by a rhythm guitar, bass and drums 
playing a driving blues riff, Adriane Michel grasped a microphone in her two 
small hands and belted out the "Schoolgirl Blues." 
</P>
<P>
 "Woke up this morning, and I didn't know what to do  
</P>
<P>
 So I decided to sing the blues  
</P>
<P>
 Then I called my friends  
</P>
<P>
 But they were out at the mall  
</P>
<P>
 and I didn't have any breakfast  
</P>
<P>
 so that's why I'm singing the blues . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 The other fourth- and fifth-graders from Manhattan Elementary School in South 
Los Angeles clapped and laughed as Adriane, 9, and a few others shyly walked up 
to the microphone on the House of Blues stage. They told their tales of lost 
shoes, too much homework and fights with playmates -- facts of life that give 
kids the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times a week, House of Blues, the hot West Hollywood nightspot, becomes 
a classroom and museum. Storytellers, educators, musicians and art experts lead 
groups of students from Los Angeles Unified schools on a cultural history tour, 
using the club's African masks and contemporary folk art to trace the lineage 
between African and American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of three hours, the students had been led back 300 years to West 
Africa, to learn that rites of passage and religious ceremony centered around 
the drum. Storytellers act out experiences of black slaves in the 18th- and 
19th-Century American South, telling how slaves created an intricate 
communications network using work songs and spirituals. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, explained the musicians and educators, lay the foundation for a true 
American music form: the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 The educational program is run by the International House of Blues Foundation. 
Last year, the foundation held similar programs for students at House of Blues 
clubs in Cambridge, Mass., and New Orleans. Another will start next year in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 With arts and music programs disappearing in most public schools, programs 
like this are desperately needed, said Issac Tigrett, chief executive officer 
of House of Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty extraordinary that entertainment is our biggest export, but no 
arts or music are being taught in the schools," he said. The program on the 
blues, he added, "plant seeds, try to promote dignity. Most kids don't even 
know about the contributions African Americans have made over the years. So 
when they find out these men and women created this music and art, it really 
turns them on." 
</P>
<P>
 During the program, students learn that the air-conditioner and the baby 
stroller were among many inventions created by African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Blues Foundation's board of directors developed the education 
program last year in Cambridge, Mass. The board includes educators from Harvard 
University, the Boston and Cambridge school systems, the Berklee School of 
Music and the University of Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 William Ferris, director of the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at 
the University of Mississippi, said that the absence of blues education in 
schools leaves children in the dark about an important chapter of American 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, classical music was appropriate to teach to children, and we 
turned our backs on our own cultural heritage," said Ferris, whose center 
houses the largest blues and Southern culture archives in the nation. Now, he 
said, "the blues are no longer just the music of rural Southern blacks, but an 
American art form that has inspired and shaped everything from gospel to rock 
'n' roll, and more recently, to rap." 
</P>
<P>
 To further blues education in the schools, the University of Mississippi will 
hold a summer course co-sponsored by House of Blues to help selected Los 
Angeles teachers develop their own blues curriculum. The foundation will also 
award $4,000 college scholarships to four Los Angeles students next year. 
</P>
<P>
 At one of the recent classes, the students toured the House of Blues, then 
returned to the stage area. The curtain rose, and the band "Black Coffee and 
Jam," played an Elmore James tune called "Dust My Broom." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know what the blues are?" asked Sheldon Strickland, the band's front 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's old-time music," volunteered one child, as the others giggled. Not true, 
explained Strickland. Then the band got the kids dancing when they played 
"Lucille" by Little Richard and Jimi Hendrix's "Purple Haze." That music, he 
told the children, had its roots in the blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Lena Roberts, a parent of a fourth-grader, was wary of an education program 
sponsored by a blues club. "I expected to hear a lot of blues, but I didn't 
expect the teaching of culture," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she headed back for the bus, 9-year-old Felicia Francis said she had 
gained a new understanding of the blues. "When he was playing you could feel it 
in your heart," she said. "It felt like your heart was keeping the same beat."

ART; A HEAVENLY SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's something about looking at a bleacher filled with 1,000 bright magenta 
angels sitting cross-legged, wings folded behind them, that has to make you 
smile. Especially since they conjure up the memories of their 4,687 street 
cousins -- 12-inch plaster angels placed around the city for a year by artist 
Jill D'Agnenica as an act of personal prayer after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The new generation of 1,000 angels are visiting the Robert Berman Gallery in 
Santa Monica's Bergamot Station for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agnenica, a UCLA graduate with a degree in history, is an installation 
artist. Her work is temporary and usually site-specific, such as when she 
filled an abandoned Downtown Los Angeles building so full of tropical plants 
that they burst through cracks and broken windows, accompanied by a stereo 
system playing sounds of a rain forest. So the gallery environment is something 
new to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "My work is usually outdoors, where people wouldn't expect to experience art 
-- they kind of stumble upon it," she said. "For a split-second, I'm going to 
get someone in a state of disbelief where they can't intellectualize something 
as art, but rather experience it with a sense of wonder." 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of her work was an installation she recently completed in an oil-rich 
area of New Mexico. She calls it the Miracle Well -- a hole dug into the ground 
that spews bubbly black water while the trees she rigged emit animal and nature 
sounds one minute and sounds of technology the next. "I change a small portion 
of someone's day because they have no choice but to demonstrate some reaction," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's precisely what happened when D'Agnenica, 10 assistants and 90 
volunteers randomly distributed the plaster sitting angels around Los Angeles. 
Each angel was stamped with a number, documented with a photograph and 
inscribed with its exact location in a ledger. Many people felt so delighted by 
the angels that they took them, which was just what D'Agnenica hoped for. She's 
managed to keep track of the whereabouts of 400 of her creations, thanks to the 
more conscientious patrons who called after they adopted an angel. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we placed 30 in the parking lot of a GTE building, a television crew 
came out and put it on the air. The next day I got a call from an employee who 
told me she hasn't stopped talking about finding the angels and that they made 
everything a little brighter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were less inspirational moments, such as the time a restaurant owner 
chased a volunteer across four lanes of traffic on Ventura Boulevard, yelling 
at her for not getting his permission to leave an angel outside his 
establishment. Or the woman who gnashed her teeth at the sight of three angels 
blocking the way into her earthquake-ruined building. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallery owner Robert Berman was visiting another artist when he happened upon 
D'Agnenica's Downtown Los Angeles studio and saw a bunch of angels. "It was a 
burst of color. For me, it's the art of the '90s, something that can change the 
moment. When I walk through a museum I expect to be uplifted, but walking in an 
alley Downtown and seeing a magenta angel perched on a telephone booth -- 
that's unexpected and exhilarating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although D'Agnenica received close to $5,000 in grants for the project from 
the Rockefeller Foundation and the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, 
among others, Berman says she is $10,000 in debt, which is why each of the 
newly cast angels costs $100. A book is planned featuring photographs of the 
original casting. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Partyka, an architect who attended the opening night of the new casting 
of 1,000 angels, described them as "innocent souls in the L.A. environment, 
like many of the people who come to the city invigorated and then face the grim 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The angels just sat there with their magenta wings folded around them and 
stared right back, defying the very idea of grim. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Berman Gallery, Bergamot Station, 2525 Michigan Ave., Building C2, 
Santa Monica. Hours: 11 a.m. to 5 p.m, Tuesday through Saturday. Information:

BRIEFLY: GRANTS: HERB ALPERT FOUNDATION GIVES $500,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Herb Alpert Foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds charities and 
is headed by the famed jazz artist, has donated $500,000 to the National 
Conference of Christians and Jews for its work on race and ethnic sensitivity 
programs for high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Conference of Christians and Jews received two matching grants of 
$250,000 for its Los Angeles Youth Education Programs. The programs include the 
Brotherhood-Sisterhood Camp, which is intended to ease racial, ethnic and 
gender divisions among high school students by exposing them to personal 
discussions on prejudice and fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The achievements of the National Conference always appealed to me as the most 
important form of raised consciousness in our society," Alpert said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; ARRAIGNMENT SET IN TORTURE-DEATH CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two homeless men accused of the torture and fatal beating of another transient 
in an abandoned Hollywood building last week are scheduled for arraignment 
Wednesday on capital murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Edward (Scarface) Fernandez and Brian James (Snoop) Snook, 
allegedly members of a gang of homeless youths, could receive the death 
penalty, the district attorney's office said.The arraignment had been scheduled 
for Nov. 30, but was moved to Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The two defendants, both 20, allegedly orchestrated a three-hour attack on 
Robert Lee Bryant that began late on the night of Nov. 26, after Bryant made 
comments supporting white supremacy, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 15 youths watched or participated in the brutal beating inside the 
dank, condemned building in the 1800 block of Wilcox Avenue, where dozens of 
homeless youths lived and used drugs, said Los Angeles Police Detective Andrew 
Purdy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant, 34, was badly beaten with a wooden pole and other objects, burned with 
cigarettes, lighters and candles, choked and urinated on, Purdy said. He died 
about 1 a.m. Nov. 27 of multiple blunt-force injuries, according to a spokesman 
for the Los Angeles County Coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are searching for three additional suspects, all of whom are 
juveniles and have been identified by their legal names or street monikers, 
Purdy said. SUSAN STEINBERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; RESTAURATEURS SAY COUNCILMAN DOUBLE-CROSSED THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica restaurateurs have accused City Councilman Tony Vazquez of 
double-crossing them by casting the deciding vote in favor of a restrictive 
anti-smoking law. 
</P>
<P>
 Eatery owners said Vazquez promised to back them at a hastily called 
fund-raiser he initiated a week before the November election. Vazquez, who 
despite a last-minute infusion of cash from the restaurant owners lost his 
reelection bid, denied he broke a promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't promise anybody votes," Vazquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greg Lee, co-owner of the Broadway Bar and Grill, recalls otherwise. Lee 
said he viewed his $250 contribution -- the maximum amount that can be given 
under city law -- as a quid pro quo for Vazquez's support on the smoking ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said (to Vazquez), 'I'm giving you this check on the basis that you have 
agreed to support us,' " Lee said. Vazquez's response, Lee said, was, "Fine." 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange, Lee said, took place on Oct. 31 at a meeting and fund-raiser 
organized by Tony Palermo, co-owner of "Teasers," a Santa Monica restaurant, 
and president of a downtown restaurant association. 
</P>
<P>
 Palermo said Vazquez called him days earlier, saying his campaign needed 
thousands of dollars for last-minute expenses and asking Palermo to contact 
restaurant owners to raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant owners, most of whom did not contribute to other City Council 
candidates this year, knew a vote was imminent on a tough ordinance that would 
have banned smoking in all restaurants and free-standing bars. They were 
already lobbying council members to keep city smoking regulations in line with 
a less restrictive statewide measure that goes into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law allows restaurants and free-standing bars two years either to 
ban smoking or make strides toward installing ventilation equipment that would 
remove smoke from the air. 
</P>
<P>
 At the fund-raising meeting, Vazquez said he sympathized with the economic 
concerns of the restaurateurs, who want the same smoking rules as other cities 
to keep clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 Vazquez acknowledges telling the owners he could support a compromise measure 
that would give establishments two years, instead of four, to become 
smoke-free. Palermo said Vazquez later reiterated this support privately at a 
Nov. 15 City Council hearing attended by dozens of restaurant, hotel and bar 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 But a week later, when his motion for a two-year grace period failed for lack 
of a second, Vazquez cast the deciding vote to mandate smoke-free 
establishments in one year. This vote, restaurant owners say, was the 
double-cross. If Vazquez had not cast it, the statewide guidelines would apply 
to Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Palermo said he fielded many calls the next day from irate restaurant owners 
who had donated money to Vazquez after he had promised to back them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can only take a man at his word and his word doesn't mean a thing," 
Palermo said. 
</P>
<P>
 All may not be lost for the restaurant, bar and hotel owners, however. 
Councilman Robert T. Holbrook said he would move to reconsider the law after 
the new City Council is sworn in this week. And with Vazquez and Kelly Olsen, 
the prime supporter of an immediate smoking ban, no longer on the council, 
Holbrook looks likely to prevail.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; FARMERS MARKET MOVES TO TEMPORARY SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills Farmers Market is loading up its fruits and vegetables and 
moving one block south of its usual site, to the 200 block of North Canon 
Drive, for this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to move the market came after several retailers in the 300 block 
complained that easy access to the stores is blocked by shoppers who crowd the 
farmers market on Sundays, said Cindy Aller-Sterling, executive assistant in 
the Beverly Hills city manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Aller-Sterling declined to identify the retailers who have complained, but 
added that some expressed concern that the market would conflict with business 
now that some of the retailers are open on Sunday for the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the move is being called temporary, the city may consider permanently 
shifting the weekly market to the 200 block of North Canon Drive if feedback 
from nearby retailers is positive, Aller-Sterling said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 farmers participate in the market, selling fresh produce, plants and 
flowers from stalls set up in the street.

FOR SENIORS; PASSION FOR TRAVEL KEEPS THE ZEST IN THEIR MARRIAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virginia and Harry Wolff Jr. fell in love for all the right reasons. For him: 
It was her matzo balls. For her: his 1938 Ford coupe. Fifty-five years later, 
they get up every morning and thank God they have each other. Says Harry: "We 
have one of the most beautiful lives there is." 
</P>
<P>
 These two haven't been documented on one of those television shows about the 
rich and famous. But if ever people are recognized for turning their life 
together into their own personal art, Harry and Virginia are definitely 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Harry, 82, was a young man in Chicago, he not only tried to live by 
the Ten Commandments but he also developed a few rules of his own. Number One: 
"Marriage is not a 50-50 proposition; it's 100% or nothing." After all these 
years, the Wolffs have more than an enduring marriage. They have a zesty 
friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very smooth life together. We understand each other, read each 
other's minds. We argue, sure, but we make up, too," said Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Harry is mad at Virginia, 81, because she's wearing thermals to 
bed. A few terribly inelegant moments pass as the question hangs in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Virginia says: "Ask the question. Sex? It's here." She pointed to her 
head and Harry finished her thought. "Yes," he said, "we still have sex, but 
it's more compassionate, loving, affectionate. We're secure together." 
</P>
<P>
 A long time ago Harry Wolff Jr. was anything but secure. It was 1932. His 
mother had died, the Depression had wiped out his father's savings and Harry's 
dream of becoming a great doctor would never become a reality. He quit school 
and went to work for a department store cleaning toilets, shining the brass 
plates on the fire hydrants outside and shoveling coal for a total of $100 a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody else would work at those jobs. But I wanted more out of life than the 
$14 a week the WPA was offering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later he bought himself a Ford 60 coupe and he was sent to 
Northwestern University by the owner of the department store, who saw a great 
deal of promise in the self-confident Harry. Harry had a habit of making 
suggestions that made sense and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Life was going well for Harry when he met Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think we would marry," said Virginia. "I was going with another 
boy." But Harry knew. "It was immediate love. We were married six weeks later. 
She made matzo balls with walnuts inside them just like my mother did." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposites may attract but compatibility and the love of travel have kept the 
Wolffs together. In 1964, after the couple had been married 25 years and raised 
two sons, Harry, a successful wholesale business representative, suggested that 
they travel for three months. When they returned from their three-month Pacific 
voyage, he sold his business and they became world travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 They've been to all 50 states, sailed aboard 33 cruise ships and 17 freighters 
and visited every country in the world except India. It was when they traveled 
aboard freighters that they got into the habit of putting messages inside of 
bottles, corking them and throwing them overboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our 27 years of high-seas travel we have received 18 replies from our 225 
bottles," Harry said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Wolffs' outings have included riding with four grandsons in a Goodyear 
blimp on Virginia's 70th birthday, and spending 43 days on the longest train 
trip in the world, a 9,331-mile odyssey from London to Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Their home in Century City is a miniature museum of relics from their trips. 
They also have a collection of autographed photographs and personal letters 
from world leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry has some rules about traveling: Do what comes natural -- don't live like 
a bum if you come from a fine home. No matter where you are in the world enjoy 
a cocktail hour. But perhaps his most important rule comes from his 
coal-shoveling days. If you use soft coal you get a sluggish fire, so only put 
the best food in your stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 In their spare time, they write letters to famous people and keep a travel 
journal, which they would like to publish. Meantime, Virginia is scanning the 
travel magazines planning their next adventure.

 Next month, the 68-year-old Hotel Sainte Claire in San Jose formally becomes 
the Hyatt Sainte Claire. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean Hyatt has bought the property? Or has taken over management? No 
and no. In fact, Hyatt Hotels Corp. owns no hotels. The Sainte Claire will 
continue to be owned by Hotel Sainte Claire Partners and managed by Mobedshahi 
Hotel Group of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 What the new name means is that the international name game among the world's 
largest hotel companies -- a game that was already being played far over the 
heads of most travelers -- just got even more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Jose deal is the first in "a limited number" of franchise agreements 
that will confer the Hyatt name on hotels that are neither owned nor managed by 
Hyatt. (Hyatt is owned by the Pritzer Family Trust, which does have interests 
in many hotels.) For Hyatt officials, who manage 166 hotels and resorts for 
independent owners worldwide, this means a chance to expand their name's 
presence in the marketplace without the trouble of actually managing a 
property. For the hotels' owners and managers, it means drawing on benefits of 
the Hyatt marketing and reservation network, so long as they meet Hyatt 
standards. Many other chains, including Holiday Inn, Howard Johnson and 
Marriott, have been franchising hotels for years. 
</P>
<P>
 For many travelers, a hotel's name makes no difference, so long as there's a 
clean and comfortable room when you need it. But when it comes time to lodge a 
complaint or a compliment, it helps to know that the name you see in lights is 
probably not the name of the hotel's owner, and may not be the name of the 
hotel's management company, either. Here's a score card on some familiar hotel 
industry players: 
</P>
<P>
 Best Western. Best Western International Inc. is essentially a membership 
organization. Its 3,400 member and affiliate hotels worldwide, each 
independently owned and managed, may be budget-oriented, mid-priced or high-end 
operations. But all must meet common standards and pay an annual membership fee 
in exchange for benefits from centralized marketing, reservation services and 
supplies. A spokesman reports that 99% of Best Western properties 
"re-affiliate" every year; in other words, it's rare for a hotel to drop out or 
be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Biltmore. The original Biltmore was an 1895 mansion built for George 
Washington Vanderbilt near Asheville, N.C. Before the economic collapse of 
1929, Vanderbilt allowed hotelier John McEntee Bowman to use the Biltmore name 
on a series of luxury lodgings, which reached New York, Los Angeles, Santa 
Barbara, Phoenix, Coral Gables and elsewhere. But the chain fractured, and the 
properties that remain today have no ties to each other. The Santa Barbara 
Biltmore is managed and principally owned by the Toronto-based Four Seasons 
hotel management company. The Los Angeles Biltmore is controlled by Japanese 
owners. Hotel representatives say that as far as they know, any lodging can 
declare itself a Biltmore. Hence, 100 miles south of the landmark Los Angeles 
Biltmore (nightly rates: $185-$450), a traveler on La Jolla Boulevard can roll 
up to an utterly unrelated 17-unit motel with rates of $28-$42 nightly: The La 
Jolla Biltmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton. In 1967, Hilton Hotel Corp. sold off its international subsidiary, but 
held on to its U.S. hotel business. As 1994 began, there were 23 U.S. Hiltons 
owned or leased long-term by the parent company, about 160 U.S. Hilton 
franchises run by independent owners and management companies (who must meet 
Hilton standards and pass a percentage of revenues on to Hilton, as in most 
hotel franchise deals), and eight independently owned, Hilton-managed 
international properties that operate under the name Conrad Hotels. Meanwhile, 
the entirely separate Hilton International, owned by Ladbroke Group Plc. of 
England, manages 55 Hilton International hotels worldwide, and has minority or 
majority ownership in about 50 of those. Hilton International also manages the 
Kahala Hilton on Oahu and five hotels in the eastern United States under the 
brand name Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday Inn. Of 1,925 Holiday Inn properties worldwide on Sept. 30, 1,754 were 
franchise operations and 171 were company-managed hotels. Some of the 
company-managed hotels, including 58 in North and South America, are 
company-owned as well. Holiday Inn Worldwide is owned by the conglomerate Bass 
Plc. of London. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Johnson. There are about 615 Howard Johnson and HoJo Inn hotels 
worldwide -- up about 65 from a year ago -- and all are franchise operations. 
The hotel name is owned by the publicly held global giant Hospitality Franchise 
Systems Inc., which also franchises Ramada (750 hotels), Days Inn (1,550 
hotels) and Super 8 (1,200 hotels). 
</P>
<P>
 Marriott. Last year, Marriott Corp. split into two companies. One is Marriott 
International, which manages or franchises about 850 properties worldwide, 
including the brands Courtyard by Marriott, Fairfield Inn by Marriott and 
Residence Inn by Marriott. Of the roughly 250 full-service Marriott Hotels, 
Resorts and Suites worldwide, Mariott International manages about 175 and 
franchises another 77. Meanwhile, the old other half of Marriott Corp., Host 
Marriott, owns 34 full-service Marriott hotels.

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: WHAT'S NEW IN VACCINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New vaccines to protect travelers against hepatitis A and typhoid fever could 
be on the U.S. market soon, and other vaccines to prevent other travelers' ills 
are under study. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a rundown on what's new in the vaccine race, along with expert advice 
on how travelers can best protect themselves from disease. 
</P>
<P>
 * Havrix, a hepatitis A vaccine developed by SmithKline Beecham, is awaiting 
federal Food and Drug Administration approval before it can be sold in the 
United States, but industry experts predict approval could come within the next 
few months, possibly before the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hepatitis A, one of five known variants of the disease, is a common problem 
for travelers in developing countries. It is marked by liver inflammation, and 
symptoms include swelling, fatigue, fever and muscle and joint aches. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease is transmitted through a variety of foods and drinks, including 
contaminated water, ice and shellfish. 
</P>
<P>
 The vaccine works by stimulating the body's defense mechanism just as a 
natural infection would, but without causing an infection. Two injections are 
required, according to Sharyn Arnold, a spokeswoman for SmithKline Beecham, and 
it takes effect about two weeks after the last dose. Based on clinical trials, 
it's expected to be 97% effective. 
</P>
<P>
 This, the newest of a new breed of hepatitis A vaccines, is considered 
superior to the immune globulin injections currently used to protect against 
hepatitis A because it is expected to confer longer-lasting protection. 
</P>
<P>
 * VAQTA is another hepatitis A vaccine. It was developed by Merck & Co., which 
has not yet filed for FDA approval, according to a spokeswoman. In a study of 
519 subjects published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1992, the 
vaccine was found to be 100% effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidelines on who might benefit from the new hepatitis A vaccine are being 
drafted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to Dr. 
Beth Bell, a medical epidemiologist in the hepatitis branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideal candidates will probably be people under age 50 who have never had 
hepatitis A and who travel overseas frequently to areas where it is prevalent, 
said Dr. Stuart Rose, an emergency medicine physician in Northampton, Mass., 
and author of the "International Travel Health Guide" (Travel Medicine, Inc., 
$17.95). (It is thought that people over 50 are more likely to have been 
infected with hepatitis A because they have probably traveled more 
extensively.) 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers who don't know whether they have been exposed and as a result have 
developed immunity, can get a blood test to find out, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Typhim Vi, a typhoid fever vaccine, is awaiting FDA approval, said Linda 
Mayer, spokeswoman for Connaught Laboratories, Inc., Swiftwater, Pa. The 
inactivated (or "killed") vaccine is given in one injection, Mayer said, and 
was developed by Connaught's parent company, Pasteur Merieux Serums & Vaccins 
in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Typhoid fever is caused by Salmonella typhi, a type of salmonella bacteria, 
and is transmitted by contaminated food or water. The first symptoms are 
flu-like, including chills, fever and vomiting. It is prevalent in many 
countries of Africa, Asia and Central and South America, according to the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
 An existing oral vaccine and several different types of injected vaccines 
against typhoid fever are about 70%-90% effective, according to the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
 The oral typhoid vaccine currently on the market requires four doses over 
eight days, Rose said. Travelers take three doses home and must store them in 
the refrigerator. Such variants as storage temperature might reduce 
effectiveness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Typhim Vi is also about 70%-90% effective, said Mayer of Connaught 
Laboratories. But its single dose is more convenient than the oral vaccine, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new cholera vaccine, called CVD 103-HgR, is under study by Dr. Robert 
Edelman at the University of Maryland's Center for Vaccine Development. It is 
effective against classical cholera and El Tor cholera, he said, but not the 
newer strain, Bengal (or 0139), first recognized in India about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working on a vaccine for this (Bengal) strain now," he said. "We hope 
to add something to the vaccine we've got so it will cover all (types of) 
cholera." 
</P>
<P>
 The CVD 103-HgR is an oral vaccine that protects against classical and El Tor 
cholera within eight days, Edelman said. The current cholera vaccine is not 
considered effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Cholera is caused by toxin-producing bacteria called Vibrio cholerae , found 
in contaminated food and water.  
</P>
<P>
 The disease usually responds well to treatment, which includes rehydration and 
antibiotics. Often, cholera is mild and produces few or no symptoms. But if 
large amounts of bacteria are ingested, symptoms can be severe, including 
watery diarrhea, muscle cramps and vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on destination, travelers -- particularly the elderly -- should also 
ask their physician if they should be vaccinated against influenza and 
pneumonia, Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel medicine physicians agree on another point: While vaccines provide 
protection against diseases, none are perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 That's reason enough for travelers to follow common-sense precautions, such as 
avoiding food or drink that might be contaminated.

 Travel may not be all fun and games, but having some diversions along can make 
slack times a lot more entertaining. Whether intended to educate youngsters or 
taken just for some fun on a rainy day, the following items -- from classic 
games to innovative new products -- are handy to have around, and make nifty 
gifts as well. Prices do not include shipping and handling: 
</P>
<P>
 Barbie and Ken might have their Dream House, but Globie Jam and his four wood 
friends have a traveling home of a more worldly nature. The 3 1/2-inch-high 
magnetized wood characters reflecting different ethnic groups come with a 
plastic carrying case and 31 flexible magnets representing a particular 
country's famous sites, recreation, foods and sports. The starter set of 
magnets, which contains play pieces representing the United States, includes 
the Statue of Liberty, Mt. Rushmore, a NASA spaceship, Southwest Indian 
pottery, a scarecrow in a cornfield and a cheeseburger with French fries, among 
other items. The idea is for kids to stick the magnets to the magnetic inside 
of the case and learn about the country on the go, supposedly guided by 
"Globie," a magnetic play piece himself, with a head in the shape of a globe. 
Additional sets of magnetic pieces, available at an extra cost, cover France 
(croissants, Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triomphe); Kenya (elephants, Masai villagers, 
drums) and Japan (sushi and pagodas). Magnetic clothes appropriate to the 
culture and a story card with poems and game ideas come with each set.Future 
destination sets are planned for Australia, Brazil, China, England, India and 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Globie Jam is designed for 4- to 10-year-olds, and is a nifty no-mess way to 
encourage imaginative play on the road. Children will learn more with the help 
of a grown-up who can explain the meaning of the various ethnic play pieces, 
but even if they just enjoy the colorful magnets, having Globie Jam along may 
forestall the Are-We-There-Yets for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Globie Jam starter set with plastic carrying case and U.S.A. magnetic play 
pieces is $24.99 from the manufacturer, I Dood It; (800) 745-6243. Additional 
magnetic sets for France, Kenya and Japan are $18 apiece.  
</P>
<P>
 A more traditional take-along toy is the Kids' Travel Tote, a folding cotton 
carrying bag, filled with old-time favorites: a coloring book and crayons, a 
Muppet puzzle, "The Little Mermaid" storybook, a pack of cards for playing 
Crazy Eights, with each card depicting a different jungle animal, pipe cleaners 
and more. An included lapboard makes a firm play surface. The 12-inch by 12 
1/2-inch tote comes with the child's name embroidered in yellow (up to eight 
letters/spaces). This simple idea, aimed at children age 3-7, totally 
captivated the 5-year-old I tested it on, and there's room in the tote for more 
small books and games to keep junior entertained even longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids Travel Tote (item No. 728865) is $23.98 from Just Between Us, a division 
of the Miles Kimball mail-order company; (800) 546-2255. Learning a foreign 
language may not seem like much of a game, but the Berlitz Jr. illustrated 
storybook and 60-minute cassette program makes the process more than the usual 
grind for youngsters. Aimed at children ages 4 and up, the sets come in 
Spanish, French, Italian and German. Music and sound effects augment the spoken 
phrases, which kids repeat, following along in the storybook. For a family 
planning a trip to a country where these languages are spoken, this is a great 
way to get junior into the lingo of the place. He can practice on the plane or 
in the hotel room -- and he might even come in handy as a translator. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlitz Jr. language storybooks and audio cassettes in French (703606), 
Italian (933106), Spanish (703906) or German (933906) are $19.95 at bookstores 
or from Lillian Vernon, a mail order company; (800) 285-5555. It's always nice 
to have a chess and checkers set around, and this travel version from Lands' 
End is the classiest one I've seen. Inside a zippered khaki canvas carrying bag 
is a zippered mesh pocket for chess and checkers pieces and the folding 
chess/checkers board. Closed, the bag measures 12 inches by 6 inches by 2 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Chess and Checkers to Go (2629-6G1X) is $45 from Lands' End; (800) 356-4444. 
The problem with Scrabble is that even the slightest movement sets the letters 
out of whack, making words that are even stranger than those some sneaky 
players try to pull off as real. This travel version can withstand even the 
bumps of a moving car. The hard plastic case snaps open to reveal a 
standard-looking Scrabble board with a raised letter grid to keep the wood 
tiles in place. A storage area holds the 100 letters and four racks. The game 
measures 11 inches by 6 1/2 inches when folded and weighs about a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Deluxe Travel Scrabble (DA738) is $24.85 from Magellan's; (800) 962-4943.  
</P>
<P>
 Gear & Gadgets appears the first week of every month.

BACKPACK & BUDGET: SWISS KNOW-HOW ON A MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Europe-bound budget travelers who hope to ski this winter can get help finding 
budget accommodations in Swiss winter resorts in a free publication called 
Know-How '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Know-How '94 is actually a detailed map of Switzerland that includes a listing 
of the country's 80 youth hostels. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing about hostels helps because the staff can arrange roommates so you pay 
economical shared-room rates. Most hostels also offer economical meals, and 
some even have kitchens that the guests can use. The staff are usually 
knowledgeable on where to get the best value in the area for everything from 
equipment rentals to grocery shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Each listing includes the hostel's address, telephone and fax numbers, rates 
and facilities, and indicates what types of travelers the hostel is best suited 
to accommodate -- sports and leisure-seekers, families, groups and transit 
hostels (for those who want longer opening hours for night life). 
</P>
<P>
 The Swiss Youth Hostel Assn. says ski equipment (skis, boots and poles) is 
available at shops at an average weekly rate of $115. If alpine skiing is not 
in your budget, cross-country skiing and other winter activities are available 
at most of the resorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The charming village of Grindelwald is a favorite stop for backpacking 
travelers. The chalet-style hostel with its large open fireplace is a major 
draw. In addition to alpine skiing, travelers can also enjoy swimming, skating, 
tobogganing and an active night life. 
</P>
<P>
 Public transportation will get you to the front door of most Swiss hostels, 
but the 113-bed Grindlewals Hostel is an exception. The hostel is a good 
20-minute uphill hike (up Terrassenweg) from the train station. It has been 
closed for the late autumn and is due to open for the winter session Dec. 19. 
The price for bed and breakfast is $17.50. There are kitchen facilities. You 
can contact the hostel by fax at 011-41-36-53-5029. 
</P>
<P>
 In trendy, expensive St. Moritz, the 190-bed youth hostel is due to open for 
the winter season on Dec. 9. It's located at Via Surpunt 60, fax 
011-41-82-38046. The price for bed and breakfast is $29.26. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Moritz, which is known for most every type of winter sports activity, 
offers 236 miles of ski slopes and is situated in the Engadine Valley, where 
each year up to 10,000 cross-country skiers participate in the Engadine 
Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Klosters is the Swiss resort that has gained world attention because it's 
favored by the famous, including Prince Charles and Princess Diana. Its 84-bed 
youth hostel is at 73 Talstrasse, fax 011-41-81-695209. Beds are available for 
$11.90. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swiss Youth Hostels accept reservations in writing or by fax. For a free 
copy of Know-How '94, contact the Swiss National Tourist Office at 222 N. 
Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 1570, El Segundo, Calif. 90245; telephone (310) 
335-5980.

TAKING THE KIDS: WHEN THEY DON'T WANT TO SKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Barry Fieldman, please report to the children's ski school," the announcement 
blared over the din of the crowded slope-side cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldman turned pale, dropped his burger in mid-bite and raced over to 
Northstar-at-Tahoe's ski school where his 6-year-old son was enrolled. "I was 
sure Michael had gotten hurt," he explained later. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing so dramatic had happened. When Fieldman, a Las Vegas developer, 
arrived at the Northern California ski school breathless and his stomach 
churning a few minutes later, he found Michael all in one piece and grinning 
from ear-to-ear. "I just don't want to ski anymore," the kindergartner told his 
dad. The instructors hadn't been able to persuade Michael otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 So Michael, my nephew, spent the afternoon happily playing in the snow near 
the condo where his family and mine were staying. "You can't make a kid ski," 
says Fieldman, himself an avid skier. "It would just aggravate you and ruin 
your vacation. Find something else that's fun for kids to do at the ski area." 
</P>
<P>
 Children's ski instructors around the country say he is right on the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making sure the kids are happy in the winter environment should be parents' 
first goal," explains Rick Devos, director of Steamboat Ski School in Steamboat 
Springs, Colo., where half the 50,000 lessons given each year are to children. 
"Forcing it won't work. Too many parents have unrealistic expectations for 
their kids," sighs Devos, himself the father of two young children. (Call 
Steamboat at 800-922-2722 and ask about its Kids Ski Free program, which 
enables one child 12 and under to ski free the same number of days as his or 
her parents when they ski five days or more, except during Christmas week.) 
</P>
<P>
 Younger children, the experts explain, may be the most reluctant skiers in the 
family, though older ones certainly have their moments too. They may be tired 
after traveling or unaccustomed to the altitude. Some may never have seen snow. 
And like my nephew Michael, they may come from parts of the country where they 
never need to wear winter clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents forget how much kids have to go through before they even get to ski 
school," says Sue Way, who oversees Aspen's programs for younger children. 
(Call the Aspen Ski Company at 800-525-6200 for details on the Tiehack 
Mountain's First Time on Skis/Snowboard three-day package, which includes three 
days of lessons and lift tickets for $129. It guarantees all beginners will be 
able to ski the mountain by the end of the program, or they'll get a fourth day 
of lessons free.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let ski school be their first experience with organized day care," 
urges Way. That, coupled with so many new faces and trying to learn to navigate 
on skis, may simply be too much for many preschoolers to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, parents paying $50 and more a day for their kids to learn to ski can't 
help but get frustrated when the kids refuse to try. 
</P>
<P>
 That's all the more reason to invest some time beforehand preparing the 
pint-sized skiers-to-be in your family for the experience. Explain that ski 
school will be a lot like nursery school, day care or kindergarten, with ski 
lessons thrown in. Tell the older ones how much fun they'll have exploring the 
mountain with kids their age. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you plan to rent the kids' equipment at the mountain (always a good 
idea in case something gets broken or doesn't fit properly), visit a ski shop 
near your home and let the kids clomp around in skis and boots, instructors 
suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Have a "dress up" night at home to try on ski clothes. They'll need waterproof 
pants, layered shirts and sweater, windproof jacket, heavy socks, hat and a 
neck gaiter rather than a scarf for warmth. Don't forget goggles and sunscreen. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread out the trail map on the kitchen table -- some areas such as Aspen now 
have special children's trail maps -- and talk about the most fun runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when you arrive, take it slow. Check out the facilities with the kids 
late in the afternoon the day before you plan to start skiing. Let the kids 
talk to some of the instructors. Buy some new goggles, a pin for their hat, a 
wool headband with the mountain's name or a new Chapstick. 
</P>
<P>
 If the kids still balk at the ski school door, suggest they at least try for 
the morning. Promise to check in at lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Rest assured that ski resorts have ways to reach parents on the mountain if 
necessary. For example, at Vail, there are boards at the top and bottom of 
every lift where messages are posted. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once the kids get going, they usually have a great time," says Vail's 
John Alderson, who leads workshops across the country on teaching kids to ski. 
(Call 800-4-SKI-KID (475-4543) to ask for Vail's Family Fun Pack, which 
includes the new "Guide to Kids Winter Vacations in the Vail Valley.") 
</P>
<P>
 No matter, it's never easy to leave a nervous child. Just ask Carolyn Hinckley 
Boyle, a communications consultant who lives in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 6-year-old daughter Amanda was so nervous that she threw up outside the 
ski school at Breckenridge, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle, worried but convinced that Amanda was just scared, not sick, persuaded 
her daughter to at least give ski school a try. "I came back and she was out 
skiing, smiling away," Boyle says. "She thanked me for making her go." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears the first and third week of every month. "Taking the 
Kids to the Great Southwest," "Taking the Kids to Sunny Southern California" 
and "Taking the Kids to Northern California" by Eileen Ogintz (HarperCollins 
West, $9.90 each) are now in bookstores.

CRUISE VIEWS: GORGING ON YANGTSE RIVER SIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For three days we have been walking, floating and standing in places that will 
be under water in about five years, when the SanxiaDam, an unprecedented 
$20-billion hydroelectric and flood control project on the Yangtse River, 
begins to fill what will be a 370-mile reservoir, taking the water up 606 feet 
from its present level. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere we've been and everything we've seen during this Regal China 
Cruises sailing will soon be history. The famous gorges will turn into low 
rocky banks around a yellow-brown lake that will probably be lined with the 
high-rise apartment blocks that will help alleviate the country's housing 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 Whole cities and towns are moving downstream, beyond the dam, with more than 
1.2 million people displaced. The groves of orange and grapefruit trees growing 
in neat vertical lines along the banks will be gone, along with some of the 
richest agricultural land in China. 
</P>
<P>
 While the environmental and social implications of the project have alarmed 
many critics, local guides and tourism officials are cheerfully looking at the 
short-term gains as more and more tourists flock to the river to cruise through 
the famous gorges one last time. 
</P>
<P>
 Qutang, the shortest and farthest upstream, is also the most dramatic of the 
three gorges, as the boat squeezes through openings between rock cliffs as 
narrow as 30 feet. Wuxia Gorge straddles the border between Sichuan and Hubei 
provinces, while Xiling Gorge, is the lushest of the trio, its edges lined with 
farms and citrus orchards along the banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The cruise, four days downstream or five days upstream, sails between the ugly 
inland city of Chongqing (formerly Chungking), with its choking industrial 
smog, and traffic-clogged Wuhan. 
</P>
<P>
 It includes a call at Jingsha City, where the local museum houses a mummified 
"2,000-year-old man" named Mr. Sui, looking none the worse for wear in his 
sealed plexiglass case of formaldehyde. Buried 2,152 years ago, he was found in 
1975 suspended in a fluid of Chinese herbal medicines in the innermost of three 
watertight wood coffins, along with 500 funerary objects that are also on 
display. 
</P>
<P>
 Shore excursions from the boat were fascinating, ranking right up there with 
the scenic transit of the three gorges. One morning we ineptly manned the oars 
in splashy dragon-boat races in Zigui. Another day we rode the rapids of 
Shennong Stream in a pea-pod-shaped boat maneuvered by sinewy boatmen who wield 
a steel-tipped bamboo pole to keep us from crashing into the rocks. To reach 
the starting point, we rode two hours along a dusty dirt road past farms that 
are still worked as they were in the 16th Century, then picked our way down 
about 700 precarious stone steps to the boat landing. There was the dubious 
alternative of riding down in a sedan chair carried by a couple of men who 
trotted briskly down the steps with the poles on their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 The three small gorges on Shennong Stream have until 1998 before being 
inundated with 240 feet of water, our guide Julia says pertly. Our river boat 
is the Princess Sheena, one of a trio of luxury vessels built in Germany in 
1993 and certainly the most comfortable way to cruise the Yangtse, judging from 
the other vessels we've seen along the river. Carrying 258 passengers, the 
shallow-draft boat rides very smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 All cabins are on the outside with big picture windows. Ten top-deck suites 
are the grandest, with separate living room, dining table, bedroom, spacious 
bathroom with tub and even a small kitchen with wet bar and refrigerator. Two 
categories of 114 double staterooms are considerably smaller, with two beds, 
built-in wall cabinets, double armoire closet and bath with shower, while 10 
singles are scarcely wider than the bed and dresser. All are prettily 
furnished. 
</P>
<P>
 Atop the vessel is a sunbathing and observation area with plastic chairs and 
tables. On the same deck is the show lounge, where crew members perform a 
charming evening of song and dance. Private mah-jongg and karaoke rooms can 
also be rented for an optional fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The boats have two dining rooms, a more formal restaurant where Chinese meals 
are served course by course, and a larger informal restaurant that serves both 
Western and Chinese buffets for breakfast, lunch and dinner. "Western" buffet 
choices always included fried rice at lunch and dinner and boiled cauliflower 
at breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the river was low beyond Jingsha City, all the passengers were 
transferred to Wuhan by bus to spend the last night of the cruise on the sister 
ship Princess Jeannie, where we found the food delectable, with much more 
eye-appeal to Western tastes.  
</P>
<P>
 The third boat in the trio is the Princess Elaine. All are virtually 
identical.

HIKING: MALIBU: THE TRAIL LESS TRAVELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Malibu Creek State Park has a trail everyone takes and a trail nobody takes. 
</P>
<P>
 The well-worn path, Crags Road, is everyone's idea of a family hike -- a 
mellow ramble alongside Malibu Creek through the heart of the Santa Monica 
Mountains. The path rarely taken, Lost Cabin Trail, is as obscure as its name 
suggests. Directions to trail head: From Pacific Coast Highway, turn inland on 
Malibu Canyon Road and proceed 6 1/2 miles to the park entrance, one-fourth 
mile south of Mulholland Highway. If you're coming from the San Fernando 
Valley, exit the Ventura Freeway (U.S. 101) on Las Virgenes Road and continue 
four miles to the park entrance. There is a $5 state park day-use fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: From the parking area, follow the wide fire road. You'll cross 
Malibu Creek. The road soon forks into a high road and a low road. Go right and 
walk along the oak-shaded high road, which makes a long, lazy left arc as it 
follows the north bank of Malibu Creek. You'll reach an intersection and turn 
left on a short road that crosses a bridge over Malibu Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll spot the Gorge Trail. For an interesting side trip, follow it upstream 
a short distance to the gorge, one of the most dramatic sights in the Santa 
Monica Mountains. Malibu Creek makes a hairpin turn through 400-foot volcanic 
rock cliffs and cascades into aptly named Rock Pool.  
</P>
<P>
 Continue on the high road and bear left toward Century Lake. As the road 
ascends you'll be treated to a fine view of Las Virgenes Valley. When you gain 
the crest of the hill, you'll look down on Century Lake.  
</P>
<P>
 You can call it a day here and hike back via the park visitor center.  
</P>
<P>
 Lost Cabin Trail-bound hikers will continue on the fire road past Century Lake 
toward the location of the now-removed set for the "MASH" television series. 
The prominent Goat Buttes tower above Malibu Creek.  
</P>
<P>
 A bit more than half a mile past Century Lake, look left for an old road (Lost 
Cabin Trail) that climbs a low divide. The road soon drops to the banks of Lost 
Cabin Creek, a tributary of Malibu Creek. Crags Road, Lost Cabin Trail Where: 
Malibu Creek State Park Distance: From parking area to Century Lake is 4 miles. 
Lost Cabin Creek is 6 miles round trip. Terrain: Rolling hills, dramatic gorge 
of Malibu Creek. Highlights: Heart of the park and a more obscure area. Degree 
of Difficulty: Easy to moderate. Precautions: Beware of poison oak along Malibu 
Creek. For More Information: Malibu Creek State Park, 287754 Mulholland 
Highway, Agoura, Calif., 91301; tel. (818) 880-0367.

 Regarding "Zanzibar: Adventure on Tanzania's Spice Island" by Jessica 
Misuraca:  
</P>
<P>
 I visited Dar es Salaam in March. Ms. Misuraca's description of it as 
"delightfully unspoiled" is misleading. The city is a dangerous place for 
tourists. The merchants close their businesses before darkness sets in because 
the streets are unsafe at night. In fact, there is not much, if any, in the way 
of night street lighting. During the day, the streets are dangerous, especially 
for tourists foolish enough to carry backpacks, cameras, purses, luggage or 
anything of value.

 I was born in Zanzibar and have spent most of my life in Zanzibar and Dar es 
Salaam. It appears that Ms. Misuraca and group did not meet the right person or 
guide to take them around and show them good hotels, good restaurants and 
places of interest.  
</P>
<P>
 Zanzibar has a number of good hotels, among them Hotel Bwawani, Africa House, 
Zanzibar Hotel, Narrow Street Hotel, Uroa Beach Hotel, High Hill Hotel and 
Hotel International. All have restaurants. There are also a number of guest 
houses and beach hotels with accommodations that serve food.

 I have traveled extensively in Africa on many "offbeat" safaris over the 
years, including much bush walking, hiking around the southern rim of Lake 
Turkana, crossing the Sahara in the east and west, and spending weeks in the 
mud of the Sudd. I have traveled to more than 80 countries around the world and 
nowhere else quite competes with Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 I am planning a year and a half safari by four-wheel drive across Africa. We 
will cross the Sahara, explore the cultural delights of West Africa, crawl 
through the Zaire forest, track game in East and Southern Africa, and learn 
about the new democracy in South Africa. This trip will be much more 
comprehensive and run at a slower pace than the commercially available trips.

1930S REDUX IN BOSNIA; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ALLOWED THE AGGRESSION OF 
THAT ERA TO CONTINUE UNCHECKED. ARE WE REPEATING THE SAME MISTAKE NOW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gaddis Smith, Gaddis Smith, an historian of U.S. foreign policy, is director 
of the Yale Center for International Studies. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The international attempt to curb the murderous program of the Serbs in Bosnia 
and facilitate a peaceful settlement appears to be over. The United States, the 
North Atlantic Treaty Or ganization and the United Nations are close to 
capitulating to defiant use of brute force by the aggressors. The message 
delivered to the victims, the Muslims of Bosnia, is that they must either 
surrender and accept whatever shred of autonomous territory, if any, the Serbs 
will permit or suffer more death and starvation with no hope of outside succor. 
</P>
<P>
 This sickening situation is similar in many respects to the pitiful and 
portentous failure of the League of Nations, predecessor to the United Nations, 
and of major governments to deal with aggression, violence and contempt for 
international obligations in the 1930s. Those who would dismiss the tragedy in 
Bosnia as of no consequence except to the Bosnians should be required to study 
the earlier disgrace and ponder its consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 The debacle of the 1930s involved four events: the failure of the League of 
Nations to have the slightest effect on Italy's conquest and annexation of the 
independent nation of Ethiopia; the acquiescence by Britain and France of the 
illegal military occupation of the Rhineland by Adolf Hitler's Germany; the 
passive acceptance of the overthrow, aided by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, 
of the Spanish government by Gen. Francisco Franco, and the infamous 
appeasement at Munich, where Hitler was allowed to seize part of 
Czechoslovakia. The United States played a minor role in the events of the 
1930s, not being a member of the League of Nations and with isolationist 
congressional and public opinion viewing events in Europe as of no concern to 
America. But if today's trends continue, that difference between then and now 
may diminish. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's attack on Ethiopia, in 1935, was unequivocal aggression. The League of 
Nations did impose an embargo on arms sales to Italy -- which had all the arms 
it needed -- but did not block the delivery of oil, the one commodity that 
could have crippled the Italian attack. Italian forces used tanks, air power 
and poison gas against untrained and ill-equipped Ethiopians. In spite of 
Ethiopia's eloquent pleas in the League of Nations, the British and French 
governments decided it was more important to stay on good terms with Italy than 
to save a backward, uncivilized African nation. In 1936, the conquest was 
complete -- and the League of Nations was dead, for all practical purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler's March, 1936, military occupation of the Rhineland, the region between 
the eastern border of France and the Rhine River, did not involve the use of 
lethal force, but its strategic consequences were immense. In 1925, Germany had 
willingly agreed that the Rhineland would not be fortified -- thereby avowing 
an intention not to commit aggression against its neighbors. If Germany 
violated the treaty, Britain and France had a right to resist with force. But 
Hitler believed Britain and France were spineless and would accept a fait 
accompli even though they were militarily superior to Germany at the time. He 
was right. There was hand-wringing in London and Paris -- but nothing more. 
Hitler's gamble was successful and he was emboldened to press on with 
rearmament and further challenges to international order. 
</P>
<P>
 The year 1936 also saw the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, with Franco's 
attack on the republican government in Madrid. Franco was well-armed with 
German and Italian weapons and assisted by German and Italian "volunteer" 
troops. The British and French, however, sought to isolate themselves from the 
conflict by forbidding arms deliveries or other assistance to the contending 
sides in Spain. The result was similar to the arms embargo for Bosnia in the 
1990s: The victim was denied arms, the aggressor was well-equipped. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States participated in the arms embargo not by international 
agreement but through a law forbidding the export of arms to any nation engaged 
in international or civil war. The only outside assistance to the Spanish 
government came from the Soviet Union and from communist and other left-wing 
international volunteers. Neither side would consider serious negotiations for 
a peaceful settlement, and the killing went on and on -- until an estimated 
million lives were lost before Franco's triumph in January, 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the best known of the four events took place in Munich in 
September, 1938, where the British and French governments, intimidated by 
Hitler's threat to go to war to seize a large part of Czechoslovakia, gave what 
was not theirs to give. Czechoslovakia was partitioned. A few months later, 
Hitler took the rest of Czechoslovakia, and a year later, he attacked Poland 
and ignited World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the parallels between the 1930s and the 1990s are not exact. The 
ruthless methods of the Serbs are similar to those of Nazi Germany, but the 
Serbs, in themselves, are not a threat to the security of Europe, as a whole. 
But neither was Italy's conquest of Ethiopia, nor the militarization of the 
Rhineland, nor the blood bath in Spain, nor the elimination of Czechoslovakia. 
British and French politicians in the 1930s saw these events as separate, 
regrettable but not as catastrophic. They congratulated themselves for 
containing the spread of violence -- until they were overwhelmed by the 
greatest violence of the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten or 20 years from now, the failure in Bosnia may be recalled with the same 
despair as were the events of the 1930s during and after World War II. The 
historians of the next century may write that the triumph of Serbian 
aggression, confirmed by the withdrawal of NATO and U.N. forces and by the 
incoherence of U.S. policy, was a dark turning point. 
</P>
<P>
 They may have to write that Bosnia was followed by the self-destruction of the 
United Nations as an instrument for the prevention and punishment of 
aggression, and the return of the United States to irresponsible isolationism. 
They may have to chronicle a succession of Bosnias perpetrated by people ready 
to find rewards through killing others, with violence spreading and coalescing 
across Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, Africa and the Middle East -- 
violence employing ever more destructive weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a horrible scenario is obviously speculation. The Bosnian example may not 
occur elsewhere. But for leaders to dismiss the possibility, to do nothing to 
engage the citizenry of all countries in serious discussion leading toward a 
willingness to act, is to make horror more likely. A city built of tinderbox 
homes and without a fire department may escape a great fire. Just don't count 
on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step toward a resolution in Bosnia should be to take all necessary 
steps for the fulfillment of the peace plan proposed earlier this year by the 
United States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia -- and accepted by the 
Bosnian government. This means resolute rejection of the fatalistic arguments 
that it is too late to save the victims of aggression in Bosnia, or that 
domestic political constraints in the United States and the other NATO 
countries are insurmountable, or that the United States and Western Europe 
should not risk discord with Moscow, or that the United Nations is the problem 
and not the solution. Rejecting fatalistic arguments requires that leaders, 
parliaments and general publics be aware of how their counterparts in the 1930s 
behaved and with what consequences.*

12-STEP PROGRAM FOR RECOVERING DEMOCRATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Guy Molyneux, Guy Molyneux, a public-opinion pollster, is the president of 
the Next America Foundation, an education organization founded by Michael 
Harrington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first step on the road to recovery is to: 1) admit you have a problem. 
Denial is a sweet temptation for Democrats in the face of last month's 
devastating defeat, but they should not indulge. The party has been given 
another wake-up call, and it is time to stop hitting the snooze alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats need to make a simple but profound admission: They are not the 
nation's natural majority party. What's more, they have not been for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Democrats have long held a majority in the House and often in the Senate 
-- but often in name only. The last major wave of social-reform legislation 
ended with the elections of 1966; since then, a moderate-conservative coalition 
has ruled more often than not -- and, of course, Democrats have won the White 
House only twice, once with 51% of the vote, the other with 43%. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic weakness was disguised because many white voters, especially in the 
South, voted Democratic for historical reasons while being philosophically much 
closer to the GOP. If the "emerging Republican majority" predicted by Kevin 
Phillips never quite emerged in partisan terms, it did ideologically. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 election represented a fragmenting of that majority under the 
pressures of deep economic change. Some Democrats thought a new majority had 
arrived, when, in fact, the party had only been given a window of opportunity 
to construct one. The electorate has now shut that window -- on Bill Clinton's 
and the Democrats' heads -- and the Republicans have their chance to try. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping the consolidation of a renewed Republican majority will be hard work. 
Actually constructing a governing Democratic majority will prove harder still. 
But Democrats can get there, if -- and only if -- they acknowledge where they 
start from. Then they can move on to the other steps of this 12-step program 
toward a healthy Democratic body politic 
</P>
<P>
 2) Stop defending the past. One benefit of retroactively surrendering power is 
that Democrats need not defend the past 30 years. Rep. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) 
says the country has been in trouble since 1967 -- who are Democrats to 
disagree? Force Republicans and conservatives to defend the bad old days, which 
they presided over. And when Republicans blame government for every social 
problem, remind people that we live in an era of government retrenchment and 
unfettered free enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important is staying focused on the future rather than refighting the 
old wars. Let Gingrich date himself with talk about the "counterculture" and 
"McGovernicks," but don't take the bait. The elites of both political parties 
love to fight about the 1960s -- but voters care about the 1990s and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Act like outsiders -- after all, you are. Even when they have political 
control, Republicans are smart enough to sound as though they do not. Political 
outsiders are always rewarded in America's populist culture, especially in 
times of general dissatisfaction. Democrats reverse the formula -- acting like 
they are in charge even when they are not -- and get the worst of both worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much for reasonable people to be angry about in 1994 America -- 
social breakdown, economic insecurity and a seemingly detached and ineffective 
politics. Democrats must recognize and validate that anger, then give it 
political direction, just as Republicans have. Clinton, in particular, must 
regain his voice as a social critic. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Let the Republicans lead. Clinton has given some signs that he feels he 
must compete with the Republicans for attention, perhaps by giving a major 
December speech. But Democrats should welcome the move of the spotlight to GOP 
leaders, and give them all the rope they need. 
</P>
<P>
 We have already learned of Gingrich's family-values plan to take poor children 
from their mothers and place them in orphanages, and watched the spectacle of 
Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), prospective chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, promoting national security through threats on the life of the 
commander in chief. The Republican presidential contest is especially promising 
-- with Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas and Bob Dole of Kansas in the field, networks 
will have to schedule debates after 9:00 p.m. to avoid scaring young children. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Fight for the center, but also fight to redefine it. The party's "New 
Democrats" are right when they say Democrats must win the political center -- 
that is what political struggle is always about. Democrats must communicate 
that they got the message and are committed to a more modest, pragmatic and 
non-bureaucratic approach to solving problems. But the party's liberals are 
also correct in saying that Democrats must frame a clear choice between the 
parties, and give people positive reasons to vote Democratic. Democrats must 
give middle-class voters a reason to believe government still matters to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Building a political majority depends not on an opportunistic shift to some 
pre-existing center, but in successfully redefining where the center is. 
Fortunately, Republicans seem ready to help by radically overreaching -- 
confusing a call for more efficient government (and no new taxes) with a 
"mandate" for dismantling the welfare state. This allows Democrats to stake a 
claim to the mainstream, in opposition to GOP extremism. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Observe the "Lestat rule. " The extent of this defeat has only intensified 
the debilitating blame game between the "New Democrats" of the Democratic 
Leadership Council and the party's liberal wing. But the factions should stop 
scapegoating: The party lost power because of major cultural and economic 
changes -- not because of mistakes by either liberals or New Democrats.  
</P>
<P>
 Democrats should emulate the vampires of Anne Rice's novels, who occupy a 
hostile world, loathed and hunted by the larger society. They have only one 
ethical law: Never destroy your own kind. If Gramm, Gingrich and the threat of 
GOP control of both houses of Congress and the White House cannot bring the 
Democrats together, nothing can. 
</P>
<P>
 7) Don't wait for social issues to save you. Some Democrats look to the "Pat" 
solution -- meaning Robertson and Buchanan. They expect the Republicans to 
embrace a radical right-wing social agenda that turns off moderate voters. 
Forget it. It's not gonna happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have already made clear they will not restrict access to abortion; 
Dole has even slowed down momentum for school prayer -- which is more popular. 
Republicans will sell out the religious right -- as they always do -- because 
they know while its language of traditional values is popular, its agenda goes 
too far. This can be a plus for Democrats, who cannot win over this 
constituency but want to see it demoralized and demobilized. If Democrats go 
out of their way to harp on the religious right, they will help the GOP keep 
their disgruntled troops in line. 
</P>
<P>
 When Republicans do step over the line and pander to the religious right, 
Democrats should whack them. But the party should worry more about persuading 
voters that it does respect and share their core values. 
</P>
<P>
 8) Dance with the one who brung ya. Democrats must return to the core economic 
themes that won them the White House in 1992. Clinton essentially declared 
victory over the economy in mid-1993, and other Democrats followed -- the 
single biggest mistake the party made. Clinton never puzzled over an automated 
checkout counter, but he appeared nearly as removed from people's economic 
anxieties as George Bush once did. 
</P>
<P>
 It is said of Gramm that every morning he asks himself what he is going to do 
that day to get himself elected President. Clinton should ask: What am I going 
to do today that communicates to a 29-year-old, high-school-educated man that I 
understand his life and concerns and am working to improve his security? 
</P>
<P>
 9) Don't be afraid of class warfare. One sure area of GOP excess is putting 
the needs of the wealthy and business ahead of ordinary people -- which created 
the Democratic majority that died in 1968. Already, Republicans are promising 
to cut back on job-training programs and occupational-safety and health 
programs. This is exactly the ground on which Democrats want to defend 
government -- where it does something important to help working- and 
middle-class people -- and in these debates they should not be shy about asking 
"Which side are you on?" Older voters need to be reminded, and younger voters 
need to learn, that the GOP is dedicated to comforting the comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 10) Deficit, schmeficit. Democrats will be tempted to attack the Republicans 
for their hypocrisy on the issue of the budget deficit, and to position 
themselves as more fiscally responsible. But the party should learn from 
Clinton's experience: What $500 billion in deficit reduction buys you these 
days is -- with another 75 cents -- a cup of coffee. Deficit reduction proved 
the same political plus for Clinton as it did for Republicans when they made it 
their focus -- in the 1930s and 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, with taxes and defense off the table, real deficit reduction has 
to entail serious cuts in programs for the middle class. If Republicans want to 
inflict pain -- as opposed to the painless 1980s conservatism of tax cuts and 
lavish defense spending -- let them do it. But Democrats should not collaborate 
with a GOP assault on middle-class living standards. The last thing they need 
is for the middle class to become more convinced government does nothing for 
them.  
</P>
<P>
 11) Make the honoring of work your Golden Rule. The concept of work must be at 
the core of all that Democrats do and say. This is the thematic glue that 
brings together concern for the middle class and respect for traditional values 
-- and exposes the Republican's greatest weaknesses.  
</P>
<P>
 A fine current example is the debate over capital-gains taxes. Democrats must 
go beyond pointing out that cuts in capital gains benefits the wealthy, and 
join a philosophic battle. Republicans believe unearned income should be taxed 
only half as much. Democrats should say to working Americans: "We think the 
money you bring home from hard work is just as worthy as that earned by rich 
people selling assets. We will never agree to the idea that investing is better 
or more important than your hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 12) Take the long view. Rebuilding a true Democratic majority will not be 
achieved by 1996, or even by the end of the century. The burden of proof is on 
Democrats to show they can make government work for working- and middle-class 
people -- and that will require both regaining control and then using it 
effectively. For now, Democrats need to focus on preventing Republicans from 
tearing down all that has been built over the previous half century. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't try to do everything immediately, but take one election at a time. 
Acknowledging weakness will be painful. But it can also be liberating. If 
Democrats will face the world honestly, they can give up the rationalizing and 
the backbiting, focus on their real enemies and get to work. The truth can 
indeed set you free.*

HELMS: A CONTRARIAN WHO NEVER FORGETS, OR FORGIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Podhoretz, John Podhoretz, TV critic of the New York Post, is author of 
Hell of a Ride: Backstage at the White House Follies 1989-1993 (Simon & 
Schuster). He is writing a book on the Republican ascendancy, to be published 
by G.P. Putnam's Sons.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Every couple of years, it's always Jesse Helms, inspiring fear and loathing in 
elite circles -- elites Democratic and Republican. For liberals, he is the 
demonic face of conservatism; for managerial Republicans, he is the frightening 
face of backwoods populism; for Jay Leno, he is a fringe figure easy to make 
fun of, because hardly anyone will be offended by his Helms joke. 
</P>
<P>
 All taken, the senior senator from North Carolina plays a part on the U.S. 
political stage he has written and designed for himself, a role he occupies 
with gusto and relish. A self-appointed scourge of the Establishment, a 
needler, tweaker and provocateur extraordinaire, Helms is one of the key 
figures of another important American Establishment. Call it the 
anti-Establishment Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-Establishment Establishment is like the Internet, for, by definition, 
it has no leaders, no membership directory and no central philosophy. Its 
members are people who live polemically -- what their enemies are for, they are 
against; and what their enemies are against, they are for. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the editorial pages of the country's leading newspapers react with disgust 
to Helms' assertion that President Bill Clinton is unfit to be 
commander-in-chief? Well, then, a week later, Helms will make a crack about 
Clinton needing a bodyguard if the President should tour a North Carolina 
military installation. That was, in case you missed it, a joke, a comedian's 
shtick, and it meant this: "They scorn me, but I wear their scorn as a badge of 
honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Did the arts community react with horror to his condemnation of the federal 
money given to a Robert Mapplethorpe photo exhibition? That's exactly what 
Helms wanted to hear. Has Big Tobacco, the most important industry in his 
state, become an all-purpose American villain? Helms, who sides with all 
cultural underdogs, enjoys being a warrior on behalf of the industry most 
despised by "them." What makes "them" uncomfortable makes him happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Them" is the Establishment, and "they" can be defined in rather simple terms: 
the Ivy League, the major media and the old-line, semi-official American 
institutions like the Council on Foreign Relations and the Business Roundtable. 
</P>
<P>
 It would thus be a mistake to think that Helms is primarily a Republican 
activist. His enemies do not break down neatly by party line, as Helms' own 
uneasy history in the GOP proves. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, when the Republican Party had control of the U.S. Senate, 
foreign-policy officials in the Reagan Administration -- people often viewed as 
radical right-wing ideologues by their opponents -- reacted with fear when 
sitting Foreign Relations Chairman Charles H. Percy lost his Illinois Senate 
race. Not because they liked Percy, who was far too moderate for them, but 
because Helms was next in line for the job. (He did not take the chairmanship, 
as he will in the coming Congress, because he had promised his North Carolina 
constituents he would take agriculture instead.) 
</P>
<P>
 Helms was deeply suspicious of Ronald Reagan's foreign policy; he believed 
Reagan the cold warrior had ceded control of the anti-communist cause to a 
bunch of Establishment sell-outs. George P. Shultz, Reagan's secretary of 
state, was indeed as Establishment as you could get, and no matter how tough 
Shultz was, it was always assumed that he was looking for a way to sell out -- 
to give communists victories at the diplomatic table they could never win on 
the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the key to Helms' bizarre support for Salvadorean junta leader 
Roberto d'Aubuisson and Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet: They were 
anti-communists whom even the anti-communist Reaganites could not stomach -- 
which is why Helms could not only stomach them, but champion them. And the 
unrelentingly hostile treatment D'Aubuisson and Pinochet received in the media 
only strengthened his commitment to them. 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, Helms and his foreign-policy staffers -- brilliantly effective 
guerrilla fighters named Christopher Manion, James P. Lucier and Deborah 
DeMoss, all of whom he has since replaced -- fought a rear-guard action against 
their own President. By making use of some peculiarities in Senate rules, Helms 
himself put ambassadorial appointments on permanent hold when he disliked some 
aspect of Reagan's foreign policy and was unable to get it changed. It was a 
form of blackmail that drove the State Department crazy -- so, of course, Helms 
enjoyed the hell out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though Reagan stalwart William J. Casey was head of the Central 
Intelligence Agency, Helms' own foreign-policy ideas were as anti-CIA as Oliver 
Stone's. The CIA determined that Nicaraguan Contra leader Eden Pastora was 
unreliable, and even though Pastora himself was the farthest left of all the 
Contras, Helms supported him because of the CIA's opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because in his eyes, the CIA was an Establishment outfit, ruled by a 
permanent bureaucracy recruited out of Yale University by founding director 
(and staunch scion of Old Eli) Allen Dulles. 
</P>
<P>
 The loathing Helms feels toward the Establishment is the guiding principle of 
his political life, forged as it was by his anger at the moral superiority the 
Establishment asserted over people like him during the civil-rights revolution. 
Call a proud Southerner a backward, racist Yahoo, and he will justifiably 
consider it an act of Northern aggression, he will always remember it and never 
forgive it. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as he will not forgive, so he will never be forgiven. Democrats made his 
ouster their top priority in the 1984 Senate races. With Jewish groups 
concerned by Helm's opposition to foreign aid leading the way, a staggering $11 
million was spent against him; Helms himself spent $12 million, and, per 
capita, that race is still considered the costliest in Senate history. (Helms 
may be an extremist, but he's also a politician -- at the conclusion of the 
race, he sued for peace by changing his tune on aid to Israel. One of his newer 
foreign-policy aides, Danielle Pletka, is a staunch supporter of Israel.) 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely enough, though Helms is about to become chairman of the Foreign 
Relations Committee, he has never been a more marginal figure in his own party. 
The vote on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last week was proof. 
GATT is everything Helms detests -- an international agreement with a governing 
body made up of elitist bureaucrats -- and, of course, he voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was oddly quiet in the days leading up to the vote, which passed by a 
margin of 76-24. Even his fellow North Carolinian, Lauch Faircloth, whom some 
consider the most conservative member of the Senate, voted in favor of the 
agreement. Now that Helms is a major figure in U.S. foreign policy, he may be 
struggling to find a new place for himself on the political spectrum -- it's 
difficult for the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to play 
the role of the bomb-throwing backbencher. 
</P>
<P>
 Helms has found unexpected support in the last few weeks from Republicans 
initially irritated by the "shocked, shocked!" expressions of outrage that 
greeted his remarks about Clinton. He is being judged guilty by a standard that 
seems only to apply to Republicans and conservatives: After all, there was a 
popular joke in Washington Democratic circles that the Secret Service had a 
standing order to assassinate Dan Quayle should anything ever happen to George 
Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The amazing thing is that, after all this time, the bombs Helms throws still 
have the capacity to injure his Establishment enemies.*

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; A WHITES' TRADITION HELPS BLACKS GAIN NEW POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thanassis Cambanis, Thanassis Cambanis, a junior majoring in history, is 
editorial page editor of the Daily Tar Heel, the student newspaper at the 
University of North Carolina. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The selection of a college homecoming queen, deeply rooted in the Southern 
white debutante tradition, has become the South's latest battleground of racial 
symbolism. 
</P>
<P>
 The homecoming-queen role itself is strictly ceremonial, but black students at 
the University of North Carolina have used it to assert their leverage and 
unity. In doing so, they have won some significant campus victories. 
</P>
<P>
 UNC, which is 90% white, has elected a black homecoming queen every year since 
1988 due to bloc voting by its black students. The campus reaction has ranged 
from alumni grumbling that black homecoming queens "don't really represent the 
school" to vandalism -- in 1991, the homecoming queen's car tires were slashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Year after year, the athletic association, which oversees the queen's 
selection, has tried to change the rules to thwart the Black Student Movement's 
bloc-voting tactics. This year, it greatly complicated the application and 
interview process, which the association administers. Currently, student votes 
count for two-thirds of a finalist's score, the application and interview the 
remaining one-third. Still, a black was crowned homecoming queen. 
</P>
<P>
 The underlying assumption by unhappy whites is that something must be wrong 
with the homecoming tradition if a  
</P>
<P>
 majority-white school consistently elects black homecoming queens. But the 
string of black homecoming queens has bestowed a positive purpose on a 
ceremonial and symbolic post by getting black students, who must feel 
overwhelmingly outnumbered, more involved in campus life. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students don't care who is chosen to "represent" the university at the 
homecoming game. The queen doesn't do anything, nor does she have important 
duties or responsibilities. But the sense of power and strength among black 
students generated by the homecoming-queen campaign has led to far greater 
achievements: a free-standing black cultural center on campus, the first black 
student-body president, elected last year, and a black speaker of Student 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever black students begin to take power or become more visible in 
positions of authority, someone is going to complain. Even mainstream students 
have suggested that the homecoming-queen ritual be abandoned because a black 
always seems to win. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sense of black empowerment created by the homecoming-queen streak and 
embodied in more black student leaders has give an old Southern tradition a new 
-- and better -- reason to continue.*

THE WORLD; NIGERIA MUST FACE THE MUSIC: ITS OIL MUST BE EMBARGOED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Adonis E. Hoffman, Adonis E. Hoffman, an international trade lawyer, is a 
senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and formerly 
director of the Africa Committee in the House of Representatives.

<P>
 Three months ago, a U.S. embargo against Nigerian oil imports was not even on 
the policy-option table. Today, this drastic, albeit overused, sanction is 
under serious consider ation as one of the remaining options the United States 
could pursue to dislodge the repressive military government of Nigerian Gen. 
Sani Abacha. Everything else -- cessation of foreign aid, diplomatic 
castigation and outright threats -- has failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The international community's apparent toleration of continuing human-rights 
</P>
<P>
 abuses in Nigeria is incomprehensible. Nigeria is Africa's most populous 
nation. It has the potential of being both a regional and continental military 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Libya's decision to restrict its oil production in 1973, Nigeria 
became Africa's leading producer of petroleum. Since the Arab oil embargo in 
the '70s, it has consistently weighed in as the second- to fifth-largest 
supplier of crude oil to the United States, accounting for about 10% to 18% of 
U.S. imports. Petroleum and its related products account for more than 85% of 
Nigeria's foreign earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a long history of foreign exploration and exploitation of Nigeria's 
oil reserves. Multinationals are present in a big way. Royal Dutch Shell, 
British Petroleum, Elf Aquitaine and Agip Francaise are among the major 
players. American oil companies -- Chevron, Mobil, Texaco and Ashland -- 
provide the largest portion of fixed U.S. investment in Nigeria. Also, most of 
the major oil-field service and supply firms are doing business in Nigeria as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of Nigeria's human-rights crisis, this cozy relationship between U.S. 
oil interests and the highly nationalized Nigerian oil industry is especially 
disturbing. By omission, if not commission, the companies have traceably dirty 
hands in the repression of Nigeria's pro-democracy movement. Their connections 
to the government have been so close that Abacha gave them a special paean in 
his Aug. 17 address, in which he unilaterally suspended striking Nigerian oil 
unions. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. companies defensively assert that their interests are purely commercial. 
They claim that showing sympathy for the pro-democracy movement could result in 
retaliatory measures against them by the Nigerian government, to the advantage 
of British, French and Asian oil concerns. Good business, they say, means not 
interfering in Nigeria's internal affairs. This casuistry has provided a 
convenient cover for their inaction in the face of brutal repression, but their 
continued acquiescence makes them as culpable as their Nigerian benefactors. 
</P>
<P>
 Once it became clear that the Nigerian government was pursuing a program of 
corruption and tyranny, U.S. oil companies could have reacted by becoming 
responsible corporate citizens. The industry should have recognized that it was 
in its own best interest to oppose Abacha. Not only would it have earned the 
goodwill of Nigeria's pro-democracy movement, the industry could have been a 
standard-bearer of responsible corporate conduct in the developing world. 
</P>
<P>
 When the National Security Council signaled that an embargo of Nigerian oil, 
perhaps accompanied by the freezing of Nigerian assets, may be in the offing, 
Abacha's reaction was typically arrogant: There are more American assets in 
Nigeria than the other way around. Thus, multilateral compliance with a U.S. 
embargo will be necessary to exert effective pressure on Abacha. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the paradoxes of Nigeria's political crisis is that an oil embargo 
could be the one measure that preserves the country's valuable but fragile 
petroleum industry. Given the downward economic spiral caused in no small part 
by the government's corruption, repression and inefficiency, oil production 
could see further declines. It may only be a matter of time before a pumping 
station or storage facility explodes, spreading substantial and, perhaps, 
irremediable financial loss to the infrastructure and operation of foreign 
companies. If U.S. companies are not seen as part of the solution, they will be 
seen as part of the problem by the pro-democracy forces who, if left 
unattended, have no stake in the presence or profits of unsympathetic 
foreigners.*

THE WORLD; A DISPUTE OVER WHO IS GOVERNOR MAY BRING CHIAPAS BACK TO A BOIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Victor Perera, Victor Perera is the author of Rites: A Guatemalan Boyhood 
(Mercury) and co-author, with Robert D. Bruce, of The Last Lords of Palenque: 
The Lacandon Mayas of the Mexican Rain Forest (California). His next book, The 
Cross and the Pear Tree: A Sephardic Journey, is due out from Knopf this 
spring.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Four days before the new governor of Chiapas takes office in Tuxtla Gutierrez, 
two men are expected to claim the seat: the Institutional Revolutionary Party's 
governor-elect, Ed uardo Robledo Rincon, who officially won 51% of the vote 
last August, and maverick newspaper publisher Amado Avendano Figueroa of the 
Democratic Revolutionary Party, who garnered 34% but insists that fraud 
committed by the PRI robbed him of his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Robledo and Avendano have rallied their followers to fill plazas and provoke 
clashes in Tuxtla, Comitan and San Cristobal de las Casas. Aligned with 
Avendano, who is still recovering from injuries incurred when his campaign 
vehicle was struck head-on by a trailer truck last August, a collision he 
claims to have been a veiled assassination attempt, are the PRD's defeated 
presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and Subcomandante Marcos of the 
Zapatista Army of National Liberation. Behind Robledo is the PRI's powerful 
party machine and conservative cattle ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
 If Robledo takes office this Thursday, huge, statewide protests could make 
Chiapas ungovernable, and President Ernesto Zedillo, who insisted in his 
inauguration speech that the electoral results in Chiapas must be respected, 
may heed the rising clamor from his party's right wing and call on the 
thousands of army troops stationed in Chiapas to enforce constitutional order. 
If Avendano succeeds in blocking Robledo's inauguration, the results could be 
equally explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Lacandon forest, which remains encircled by army troops since a 
cease-fire with the Zapatistas was negotiated last January, Subcomandante 
Marcos has emerged to reclaim leadership of his movement after being stung by 
allegations that his bellicose rhetoric and posture had scared many of his 
sympathizers into voting for the PRI. Two weeks ago, he was presented by his 
followers with the staff of command, consisting of the national and the 
Zapatista flags, a rifle, a bullet, blood and fistfuls of corn and earth. The 
staff, which he last received preparatory to the Jan. 1 uprising, signals the 
Zapatistas' renewed commitment to armed resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the election of Zedillo as president by nearly 50% of the vote has 
temporarily muted militant opposition in most of Mexico, the root causes of the 
Zapatista uprising keep the pot boiling in Chiapas. In the Highlands, a 
counterpart of the Zapatista army, calling itself the Francisco Villa Popular 
Peasant Union, has seized several German-owned coffee plantations; the Mayan 
campesinos threaten to take over thousands more hectares unless their demands 
for land are heeded by the government. Insurgent groups have sprung up in other 
parts of Chiapas, among them the Emiliano Zapata Peasant Organization, which 
last week freed six of its members from a jail in Tapachula, on  
</P>
<P>
 the Guatemalan border. Mass demonstrations have also broken out in the 
neighboring oil state of Tabasco and in southern Veracruz, where the PRD has 
denounced voting irregularities in gubernatorial and mayoral elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The fissures in the Institutional Revolutionary Party created by the 
assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio have been aggravated by the murder of PRI 
Secretary General Francisco Ruiz Massieu and by the resignation of his brother, 
Deputy Atty. Gen. Mario Ruiz Massieu, who accused a nucleus of high-ranking 
party officials of conspiring in his brother's murder to block democratic 
reform. The charge that drug dealers from the Gulf coast state of Tamaulipas 
participated in the plot against Massieu also resonates in Chiapas, whose 
coastline has become a staging area for the transshipment of Colombian cocaine 
from neighboring Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's political skills will be tested  
</P>
<P>
 during his first week in office. On the positive side, his new Cabinet 
includes, as secretary of agriculture and natural resources, Arturo Warman, a 
member of the national human-rights commission and a skillful negotiator with 
campesino groups in Chiapas. On the other, the new president appointed the 
old-guard PRI President Ignacio Pichardo to his Cabinet, whom Mario Ruiz 
Massieu has accused of obstructing justice in the assassination of his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the olive branch he extended to the Zapatistas, and his promise of 
social justice for Chiapas' landless campesinos , an inexperienced Zedillo, 
already hobbled by the power struggles within his party, may lack the foresight 
of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and his mediator, Luis Camacho 
Solis, who staved off all-out civil war in Chiapas by making key concessions in 
the peace negotiations. After the elections, Salinas claimed he had defused the 
Zapatista threat by encircling them militarily, then socially, a boast that 
ignited Marcos' angry charges that Salinas had grown psychotic with power lust. 
The vast infrastructure of patronage that permitted the PRI to co-opt voters 
with last-minute handouts will not work in Chiapas, which has never reaped the 
fruits of Mexico's revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 This past week, Camacho Solis' replacement, Jorge Madrazo, resigned his post 
in light of the Zapatistas' return to a war footing. Another outbreak of 
violence in Chiapas would be more difficult to contain, because of the 
proliferating rebel groups and the rising frustration of the peasants. Marcos 
may have lost some of his media glamour and loquacity, but he has not lost his 
historical sense. His latest proclamations from the jungle reflect his pique 
with the fickle media and President Bill Clinton's nomination of Salinas to 
head the World Trade Organization. But Marcos comprehends the depth of the 
despair of the campesinos in Chiapas and, beyond them, of the 40 million 
impoverished Mexicans who will derive scant benefit from the North American 
Free Trade Agreement or the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 After Cardenas paid Marcos a return visit in his jungle stronghold three weeks 
ago, and urged him to lay down his arms and join his cause, Marcos remarked to 
a reporter: "Cardenas is in the same struggle as the Zapatistas, but he relies 
on the ballot and peaceful means, while the Zapatistas rely on violence." As to 
his disaffection with the media, much of which has turned downright hostile, 
Marcos warned sullenly, "If the paper war is over, we still have our arms, and 
if the media once helped to prevent war, now they will provoke it by denying us 
a forum." 
</P>
<P>
 With a PRI intent on cannibalizing itself and with a new president who lacks 
the political instincts of his mentor Salinas or of the still mourned Colosio, 
Chiapas appears certain to remain explosive, and a catalyst for continuing 
unrest in the republic.*

THE NATION; STREETS VS. MALLS: THE MODERN DILEMMA OF URBAN PUBLIC SPACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fred I. Kent III and Kathleen A. Madden, Fred I. Kent III is president and 
Kathleen A. Madden is vice president at the Project for Public Spaces, a 
national nonprofit corporation dedicated to improving urban public spaces.

 The increasing backlash against retail giants like WalMart in cities across 
the country makes an important statement not only about the type of stores but 
also the type of communi ties that people want and don't want in the future. 
The WalMarts and other warehouse retailers, and the development they represent, 
have nibbled at and now seem to have gobbled up many of America's communities, 
replacing them with something less than we had before. The trend toward 
suburban, free-floating retail unconnected to a downtown shopping district is 
making communities less convenient, less personal, less diverse and less safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in New York, we feel lucky. Though it may come as a surprise to some, 
the neighborhoods of New York are, for the most part, convenient, diverse and 
safe. They are places where vitality is drawn from the street and the people 
who use the street. They are places where retailers know their customers. For 
example, after frequenting a coffee shop for three days, the waiter will 
inevitably have the coffee ready before you've even opened your mouth to order 
-- you've become a regular! Or the greengrocer who, as you walk into his store 
four years after having moved away and then back again, asks "Where ya been?" 
</P>
<P>
 In these neighborhoods, service is a necessity because of the challenge of 
competition at a scale that is far smaller and more personal than the level at 
which places like a mall or WalMart function. In these ways, New York's 
neighborhoods are more like small towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is different. During the past two years, we have spent a lot of 
time working in Los Angeles and feel the need to sound an alarm. The city seems 
to be giving up on its streets and, in doing so, may be closing the door to 
becoming a more "urban" city. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Los Angeles seems to be creating an endless number of privately 
owned, highly controlled real-estate developments. Although these developments 
lure large numbers of people, they are isolated pockets of exclusivity -- not a 
part of the city's fabric. They are not the places from which real cities 
evolve. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes good cities and how can they continue to evolve as places where 
people want to be? Just look at where people dream of spending their vacations 
-- strolling the boulevards of Paris, sipping espresso at an outdoor cafe in an 
Italian piazza, even coming to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A good city is about experiencing diversity -- even if that means simply 
walking on a street to observe people who are not like you. In good cities, 
there are also public places -- places that are part of the city, that show you 
what a city is all about and give it a heart. Sometimes, these places are a 
grand avenue or a large plaza. Whatever, they are an important part of people's 
daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 A good city cannot exist without good streets. Can you imagine Paris without 
its boulevards? In fact, Paris has just widened the sidewalks along the Champs 
Elysees to better accommodate the social and economic life and the joie de 
vivre that the city is famous for. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to identify a great street. Notice who is there and who isn't. A 
good street has variety: seniors, teen-agers and children. It is a good sign if 
there is about an equal mix of men and women: Women are more particular about 
choosing a street to use than men. How fast are people walking and what are 
they doing? Are people meeting each other, stopping to talk with people they 
know and just happened to run into? Strolling and a lot of socializing is 
another indicator of a good street. 
</P>
<P>
 Good streets are thought to be "owned" by the people who use them: customers 
who come back time after time, and retailers who are continually monitoring a 
street's problems. Even if they are not shopping, people feel they "belong" on 
a good street. They know the short cuts and secret parking spaces. They have 
accrued memories of experience that become part of their sense of identity in a 
community. They are concerned when something happens that would change the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to cities that focus on the street as their social and economic 
cornerstones, Los Angeles seems to be focused on creating "experiences." In 
places like CityWalk, the Beverly Center and the Westside Pavilion, the term 
"ownership" takes on a different meaning than it does on a good street. These 
places are thriving as a "place to go" and seem, on the surface, to have many 
of the qualities of a good street. CityWalk, designed to look like a street, is 
walkable, with convenient parking, larger-than-life retail facades, fountains 
for kids to play in, a multitude of places to eat, movies to see and even a 
theme park. But it is not "owned" by a community who would rally to its defense 
if it were threatened by, say, redevelopment or by a proposed freeway cutting 
through it. It is a real-estate investment, owned by its investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The differences between a good street and a real-estate investment are more 
obvious at a mall. One drives to the mall, parks in a large parking lot and 
enters an internalized, climate-controlled environment. Inside, it is 
comfortable and more or less predictable, because the stores are owned by 
chains that provide the same type of products and prices everywhere. The 
chances of personal service or knowing the store owners by name is fairly slim. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of these retail "experiences" has not been without consequences to 
the streets and public spaces that should be the real livelihood of a city. In 
Los Angeles, once prime shopping streets -- for example, in the Miracle Mile 
district along Wilshire Boulevard -- have been abandoned. As people drive to 
get to the malls, traffic engineers have widened streets and sped up the 
traffic flow, destroying any remnant of pedestrian life. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are some hopeful signs that cities can "nibble back" at the 
qualities that have been negated by development insensitive to streets and to 
people. Two California cities whose downtowns, only a few years ago, had ceased 
to be places to go, have now begun to "nibble back." 
</P>
<P>
 In Riverside, the area around the Mission Inn is being brought back as an 
"urban resort" -- as the city focuses on improving the streets, the alleys and 
the existing exquisite and human-scaled buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 10 miles away, San Bernardino, whose downtown has been afloat in a sea of 
parking lots for several years, is bringing back its downtown incrementally. 
Last year, they built a central square that has now been used as a site for 
hundreds of events -- including several weddings. They have slowed down traffic 
and added angled parking around the square. Across the street, the shopping 
mall, built on the old Main Street in the 1960s, is planning to renovate its 
entrances to improve its access to downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, one of the most innovative programs in the country is 
currently under way, the Los Angles Neighborhood Initiative, with plans to take 
back the streets and public spaces of neighborhoods throughout the city. This 
program begins with the people of a neighborhood making small changes -- 
"nibbling back" to create a sense of community for themselves. Little things 
that can be done right away are the focus -- such as bus stops that are safe 
and comfortable, small outdoor markets, slower traffic and better crosswalks 
and stop signs -- changes that bring the community back to the street. It is 
grass-roots measures like this that's needed to "nibble back" Los Angeles.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; KLAUS MULLER; DOCUMENTING GAY LIFE UNDER NAZIS FOR 
HOLOCAUST MUSEUM -- AND HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Bronski, Michael Bronski is author of Culture Clash: The Making of 
Gay Sensibility (South End Press). He is now writing a book about the politics 
of gay and mainstream culture. He spoke with Klaus Muller by phone from 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1993, when Klaus Muller began working as a consultant on gay and lesbian 
life in the Nazi era for the Holocaust Museum in Washington, one of his first 
projects was to find enough documentation of the life of a gay male survivor of 
a concentration camp to be able to include his name on the museum's I.D. 
Project -- a program that allows visitors to follow an individual, survivor or 
victim, from the rise of Nazism through its fall in 1945. Before his research, 
documentation of specific gay survivors had been difficult to obtain. Now, the 
museum has eight lives documented. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller, who teaches at the University of Amsterdam when he is not curating the 
museum's artifacts, documents and oral histories about the lives of gay men and 
lesbians in the Third Reich, has been working on this subject for almost a 
decade. Muller, 34, who grew up in a small village in the Westphalia region of 
Germany, came out to his parents and fellow students while attending the 
University of Munster. Seeking to understand his own sexuality and its place in 
his life and the world, he focused his studies on gay themes. While still in 
college, he published "Literary (Self) Definitions of Gay Men in the Weimar 
Republic," an examination of gay male life in 1930s Germany. In the late 1980s, 
when the Holocaust Memorial Museum was being developed, he managed their 
collection of gay-related artifacts and written materials and was a consultant 
in shaping exhibitions on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, Muller has been conducting on-location research in 
archives, registries and government offices throughout Western Europe, 
attempting to document gay and lesbian life under the Nazis -- particularly by 
finding and interviewing gay male concentration-camp survivors. Beginning in 
1934, large numbers of German gay men were arrested under Paragraph 175, a law 
interpreted so broadly that not only was homosexual contact forbidden but a 
"lewd glance" could cause arrest. (Lesbians were not mentioned in Paragraph 175 
and were, for the most part, not targeted.) From 1934 to 1944, nearly 60,000 
men were arrested under Paragraph 175; many were interred in concentration 
camps, where they were forced to wear a pink triangle, an official marking that 
identified them as homosexual. Although it is difficult to ascertain exact 
numbers, between 5,000 and 15,000 died in the camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Muller's research has uncovered a wealth of information about lives of gay men 
under the Nazi regime, and has raised important questions about how we view and 
use the past. In a time when Holocaust analogies are commonly used to "explain" 
current political realities, and the pink triangle has become an accepted 
symbol for lesbians and gay men, Muller's research is more resonant than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: There seem to be few detailed records of gay men interred in camps. 
For years, we heard there is little documentation for the existence of gay 
prisoners. Have you had a hard time finding and interviewing men?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There is actually quite a lot of documentation of the lives of gay 
male camp survivors. After the war, some men even went to the German government 
asking for reparations, along with other camp survivors, but their requests 
were denied because anyone arrested under Paragraph 175 was thought to still be 
a criminal. Because Paragraph 175 was in existence before the rise of National 
Socialism, it was not considered part of Nazi ideology, so postwar Germany did 
not simply "forget" gay camp survivors but actively continued to persecute 
them. It is no surprise that we have not heard many men's stories, and now so 
many are elderly or already gone. 
</P>
<P>
 When I started this project, I thought I would be happy to contact one or two; 
now I have contact with fewer than 10 people. I assume that within the next 
year more will come forward but always we will stay in that range -- 10, 15, 20 
-- but it won't be big numbers anymore. It is too late and we missed our chance 
to approach them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How was it for you to be working so intensely on this project and finding 
resistance from other historians and Holocaust studies people?  
</P>
<P>
 A: At the Holocaust Memorial Museum, I have actually found great support. They 
are completely behind this project. In Europe, it is more complicated. We have 
just had a conference with German memorials, and the younger generation of 
historians clearly see that this is something that has to be worked on and 
included. At most of the German memorials, you find little documentation of the 
persecution of homosexual men and there is little sense that this has to be 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that too many people who do Holocaust studies are very 
accustomed that gays are automatically excluded, and they don't understand that 
that, purely from a historical point of view, is unacceptable. But I am in a 
very good position to deal with this as a historian working at the Holocaust 
Memorial Museum, which has some reputation -- so people listen to me. But am I 
surprised that to even mention homosexuals in documentation centers at 
concentration camps is still an issue now. This should have been done 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is this simply homophobia?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It is not so much clear homophobia. That is difficult to express for anyone 
who is seriously interested in Holocaust studies. To be that homophobic is 
pretty outrageous. But what I'm confronted with in Europe is more of a lack of 
historical knowledge. A lot of people just don't know the history, or they know 
very little. Even people who work in the field, sometimes. Often they know very 
little about the gay and lesbian community before 1930. The books are there; 
you can read them; it is not that we don't know anything. It is all documented. 
So after all these years of systematic exclusion, of course there is a lack of 
historical knowledge, and it will take time before this is changed so that 
people will know what they are talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Perhaps one reason people don't think of homosexuals being victims of 
Nazism is they don't understand the connections between sexuality, race and 
anti-Semitism in the Nazi imagination.  
</P>
<P>
 A: That's right. If you look at the persecution of Magnus Hirschfeld, an early 
sexologist, who was both Jewish and homosexual, these connections become 
clearer. Hirschfeld and his Institute of Sexual Science were attacked very 
early by the Nazis. His involvement with the sexual reform movement -- he was a 
precursor to Kinsey -- made him an obvious target of National Socialist 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Hirschfeld's homosexuality was portrayed as typical Jewish sexuality. With his 
research -- which included work on homosexuality, marital counseling, 
transvestism -- he also symbolized a new approach to sexuality, one which broke 
from very traditional thinking on sexual behavior and gender roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany at this time was a clearly gender-dominated society, very male-biased, 
and population politics was a very important issue for the Nazi Party ideology. 
They felt that for the propagation of the so-called Aryan race, it was vital to 
have strongly defined gender roles. In such a gender-defined society, there was 
no place for any deviation from heterosexual behavior. It is no surprise, then, 
that male homosexuality was seen as a fierce threat to raising the birthrate. 
Lesbians, like all other women, were seen as potential child bearers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that the issues of homosexuality and abortion were linked when the 
government founded the Federal Security Office for Combating Abortion and 
Homosexuality. In the Nationalist Socialist mind, they were seen as real 
threats to the birthrate. The charge of homosexuality was also used against 
those seen as enemies of the Third Reich. Catholic clergy and independent youth 
organizations were seen as breeding grounds of homosexuality. Homosexuality was 
used as justification for the killing of Ernst Roehm and other SA members, who 
were conspiring against Hitler. Some of those men were homosexual -- but Hitler 
used the charge of homosexuality to cover up what was essentially a intraparty 
purge. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Charges of homosexuality have always been used in the political arena and 
have been effective. Recently, Scott Lively of the Oregon Citizen's Alliance, a 
group that has sponsored anti-gay referendums, claimed the Nazi Party was made 
up of homosexuals. As a Holocaust historian, how do you respond to that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The Holocaust Memorial Museum has a policy of not responding to Holocaust 
revisionism -- and I consider it revisionism to claim that one group were not 
victims but perpetrators. From a European background and the perspective as a 
historian, this statement is so outrageous and dumb. In the first place, you 
don't want to believe that people would ever consider this statement having any 
truth in it. But what we do know from all forms of Holocaust revisionism is 
that -- from the classic forms, such as that the gas chambers didn't exist, to 
a statement like Scott Lively's -- they work by raising doubt and are wildly 
successful, especially when the media think that there is some discussion to be 
had. I've received a lot of phone calls about the statement, and have simply 
said that there is no discussion here. This is purely propaganda and 
disinformation. There is no discussion to be had when people are not telling 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The impulse behind the quote is to use the Holocaust to vitalize and inform 
an aspect of contemporary politics. You see something of the same thing when 
liberals or progressives claim that what is happening in the U.S. now is 
parallel to what happened to Germany in the 1930s and the rise of the Nazis. 
How do you feel about such analogies?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The more you look back and do research on Nazi Germany, the difference 
between what happened then and what is happening now in the U.S. is completely 
obvious. I find it indeed very important to realize the difference and learn 
from it. We don't learn from imagining ourselves victimized in the same way as 
gay people and other groups in Nazi Germany were. What happened in 1945 was 
that for certain groups, such as Jews, homosexuals, gypsies and the disabled, a 
particular type of persecution stopped, specifically, the persecution under 
National Socialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Those groups continue to face persecution today, but it is not the same 
persecution. The point of making historical comparisons is to learn from them, 
and I don't see what we can learn from such easy comparisons that politics 
today in the U.S. are like those in 1930s Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But when someone like writer-activist Larry Kramer says AIDS is our new 
Holocaust, many people respond. That is probably because both the Holocaust and 
AIDS are bewildering, but the emotional resonance is there.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Comparing AIDS to the Holocaust is burdening us with a double burden which 
I find very unnecessary. AIDS, in itself, is something difficult to understand, 
but it is not getting more understandable by comparing it to the Holocaust. By 
constructing an eternal victimization for homosexuals, you are confusing what 
we know historically -- because in all times and all places, homosexuals were 
not victimized. Why would we want this history? It is unbearable to live with a 
history that never existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What lessons can we learn from the work you've done on gay survivors? What 
can we learn about the past and can use now and in the future?  
</P>
<P>
 A: One thing you clearly learn from Nazi Germany -- from how the whole 
operation of persecution developed -- is that when one group is excluded from 
basic human rights, there is a clear tendency to exclude more and more groups 
for very different reasons. You see this in the late 1930s, in Germany, with 
what were called "asocials." These were groups ranging from alcoholics to 
people who didn't work enough by Nazi measures to unmarried women with 
children. It become a very wide group. If we allow persecution of one group, 
are other groups safe? The answer is -- no, they aren't. In that sense, this is 
a very clear message for us today: Basic human rights are for all people, or 
for no one. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holocaust is a unique event in the 20th Century, and we always come back 
to it because it takes away our optimistic belief in the progress of humankind 
-- a belief we will never get back. The naive question, "How could this 
happen?" is over. We saw that it happened; and we see similar actions have 
happened again. 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, it is very much in the center of culture and history, and will 
stay there. Since it is so important, we have to be careful how we document and 
remember it. We can't go on excluding victim groups -- not only homosexuals, 
but the disabled or gypsies. We need to have accurate historical documentation 
. . . .*

WHY THE NUCLEAR QUESTION STILL HAUNTS THE WORLD; THE COLLAPSE OF THE SOVIET 
UNION AND THE END OF THE COLD WAR HAVE GREATLY RAISED THE RISKS OF 
PROLIFERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The aim of the nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty is straightforward. It seeks 
to freeze at five the number of states that have nuclear weapons. By no 
coincidence the five -- the United States, Russia, Britain, China and France, 
which also happen to be the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- 
had all exploded nuclear devices before the NPT was signed in 1968. That 
assured their claims to membership in a club whose exclusiveness they were and 
still are eager to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Signers of the treaty, now numbering 164 countries, endorsed a document that 
looked forward both to an end to the big-power arms race and to eventual full 
nuclear disarmament. Lending special urgency to that hope were widely accepted 
forecasts that within a relatively short time as many as 20 states would be 
able to develop their own nuclear weapons. The concern, in short, was that 
world stability and peace could soon be put at risk by a host of small regional 
nuclear powers. THE NPT BY ITSELF IS NO BARRIER TO PROLIFERATION 
</P>
<P>
 That concern has not been realized, in part no doubt because of the NPT. 
Indeed, the number of "threshold" states that were thought to be working on 
nuclear weapons shrank markedly by the late 1980s. South Africa abandoned its 
program. Argentina and Brazil bilaterally agreed not to pursue nuclear weapons, 
and both joined the regional treaty that makes all of Latin America a 
nuclear-free zone. South Korea and Taiwan, under U.S. prodding, seem to have 
opted out of the nuclear race. More recently Ukraine, which fell heir to the 
world's third-largest nuclear arms stockpile when the Soviet Union was 
dissolved, has agreed to divest itself of these weapons and join the NPT. Other 
states, however, have not been deterred from pursuing an independent nuclear 
course. India, Pakistan and Israel -- none of them members of the NPT -- are 
all believed to have built or to be building nuclear arsenals. 
</P>
<P>
 A conference scheduled for next spring in New York will decide whether to 
extend the NPT and, if so, for how long. But, as the world learned to its 
dismay in the last few years, the treaty by itself is no barrier against 
proliferation. Iraq and North Korea are members of the NPT, yet both were able 
to pursue nuclear weapons programs clandestinely and successfully. Only after 
Iraq was defeated in the Persian Gulf War in 1991 did the full and frightening 
dimensions of its nuclear subterfuge emerge. North Korea's quest for nuclear 
arms may -- or may not -- have been suspended by the recent controversial and 
costly U.S. agreement to supply it with alternative fuel sources, including two 
new light-water nuclear reactors. Meanwhile, Iran and Libya are suspected of 
trying to acquire a nuclear arms capability. And there are few who believe that 
Iraq, despite its recent setback, is ready to permanently forswear nuclear 
weapons. CONCERN ABOUT NUCLEAR SPREAD IN THE THIRD WORLD 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, says Leonard Spector, a senior associate at the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace, we no longer face "proliferation in the 
abstract." We have instead a renewed threat that nuclear arms will spread in 
the Third World. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Galen Carpenter, director of foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, 
is one of those who believes that "the non-proliferation regime is slowly 
unraveling and that in a decade we will have a significant number of nuclear 
states." Worse, the system is breaking down "asymmetrically," with the 
countries that seem most bent on acquiring nuclear weapons precisely the 
countries that are most likely to contemplate using them. Meanwhile, "the more 
peaceably inclined nations remain non-nuclear -- and entirely dependent on U.S. 
protection. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Spector and Carpenter agree that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end 
of the Cold War have greatly raised the risk of proliferation. As Spector sees 
it, "Russia has lost control over its nuclear materials, creating a situation 
that should be our number one concern." Evidence of that concern -- and welcome 
evidence of a readiness to respond to it -- came recently when the United 
States quietly negotiated a deal for the secret removal of about half a ton of 
highly enriched weapons-grade uranium from Kazakhstan. The material, stored at 
a poorly protected site, could have become the target for black marketeers or 
terrorists. By arranging for its storage at the nuclear complex at Oak Ridge, 
Tenn., the United States eased that concern. But worries continue about leakage 
of weapons-quality nuclear material from the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Seth Cropsey, director of the Asian Studies Center at the Heritage Foundation, 
shares Carpenter's pessimism that proliferation is inexorable. The key question 
now, he argues, is not how to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons but how to 
prevent their use. 
</P>
<P>
 This fatalistic approach is by no means universally accepted. Proliferation 
specialist Spector, for one, cautions against the political paralysis he 
believes the "post-proliferation" school of thinking invites. And, indeed, 
there's little to commend the notion that the United States and other 
anti-proliferation leaders should passively accept the inevitability of 
proliferation. If anything, in the aftermath of nuclear developments in Iraq 
and North Korea, efforts to control the spread of nuclear weapons should be 
intensified. At the same time, however, there's a compelling need to develop a 
policy -- and the military means to support it -- to deal with the implicit 
threats presented by hostile states with nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Spector is right in arguing for continued strong U.S. support for the NPT, and 
for maintaining strict export controls on materials and technology that could 
have nuclear weapons applications. A strong proponent of a comprehensive 
test-ban treaty, he similarly urges a continued emphasis on bilateral diplomacy 
with potential nuclear states, and points to successes with Ukraine, Belarus 
and Kazakhstan. Cato's Carpenter would have the United States and international 
agencies encourage regional nuclear-free zones. He also proposes good-offices 
aid to India and Pakistan to help those two antagonists develop fail-safe 
command and control systems that would lessen the chances of one or the other 
accidentally setting off a nuclear conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The agenda could be extended. Monitoring of threshold nuclear countries -- 
Iran, Iraq and North Korea especially -- should be stepped up, and Russia 
should be helped in any way possible to tighten its controls over nuclear 
materials. Edward Luck, president of the U.N. Assn. of the United States, 
proposes an additional step: creation of a U.N. Commission on Nuclear 
Proliferation under the Security Council, to act as a watchdog and contingency 
planner and play a more active role than that now taken by the sometimes 
cautiously bureaucratic International Atomic Energy Agency, based in Vienna. 
None of these steps, of course, obviate the need for the United States to have 
a strategic policy to defend itself and its allies if political and diplomatic 
efforts to arrest the spread of nuclear weapons fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts agree on the need for what Spector calls a light missile shield 
as part of a comprehensive anti-proliferation policy. At a minimum, some 
feasible defense against the kind of intermediate-range missiles that such 
would-be nuclear powers as Iran, Iraq and North Korea would most likely use as 
delivery systems is a must, although no such system could be regarded as 
foolproof. There's also general agreement about the folly of undertaking 
preemptive strikes against the nuclear facilities of threatening states. Such 
strikes would be both dangerous -- spreading radioactive fallout and inviting 
conventional, unconventional or terrorist retaliation -- and quite possibly 
ineffective, given the difficulty in clearly identifying suspect sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Cropsey of the Heritage Foundation argues instead that the best deterrent 
could be the threat to attack with conventional weapons the military 
infrastructures that are universally the key props of authoritarian regimes. 
</P>
<P>
 If proliferation does occur in the Third World, the immediate danger, by 
definition, will be regional, and that raises a basic question for American 
policy-makers: Should the Cold War doctrine of extended deterrence, under which 
the United States either formally or implicitly placed friendly non-nuclear 
countries under its protection, continue as a matter of policy? In a 
potentially multipolar rather than bipolar nuclear world, in other words, is 
the United States ready to accept the risks it would run if it were drawn into 
a regional conflict that might be only peripheral to its national interests? 
And if Washington rejects that kind of exposure -- if it is not to act 
automatically where nuclear threats might arise -- does that increase the 
incentive for other states, friendly or hostile, to try to get their own 
nuclear arsenals? STRATEGIC PLANNING REMAINS A PRIORITY 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the Cold War, U.S.-Russian agreements to reduce their nuclear 
arsenals and the overall shrinking of American military forces have plainly not 
ended the need for careful strategic planning and decision making -- or for 
informed strategic debate. The policy of the United States should be to 
continue doing all that it can, along with like-minded states, to prevent the 
spread of nuclear weapons. Forceful diplomacy and maintaining and extending 
controls over weapons-related exports are two essential features of such a 
policy. Beyond that, there's little choice but to focus planning on what 
Cropsey calls attention to: Where proliferation fails, the compelling need is 
to keep new nuclear states from using the weapons they have acquired.

L.A. HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Nov. 22 you published "Livable Doesn't Mean Slums" (by Lauren Saunders, 
Commentary). There is no doubt that some landlords, like the one Saunders 
describes, are unscrupulous. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interest of balance, you should also note that there are many 
destructive, dishonest tenants. Saunders feels the courts and Health Department 
favor landlords, but malicious tenants can use the Health Department to harass 
a landlord, and the delays of the court system guarantee at least two rent-free 
months to those who decide to stop paying rent. Although the landlord will win 
a monetary judgment in such cases, it is meaningless if the tenant is on 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Our society needs low-cost housing, but as problems with government-run 
projects show, this cannot be achieved without tenant pride and responsibility. 
We can ill-afford abuses by landlords or tenants. The laws and administrative 
procedures designed to protect hard-working poor people may have been 
appropriate when they were established, but they should be reconsidered in a 
time of drug abuse, moral breakdown, meaningless judgments and high vacancy 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be constructive if you were to present a balanced, in-depth review of 
this question.

GROWTH OF ENTITLEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Limits Now to Keep Economy Sound," by Eric Hunter, Commentary, Nov. 22: 
</P>
<P>
 The "relentless" growth of entitlement programs does not loom as a major 
obstacle to the long-term health of the U.S. economy. Taking the economy in the 
aggregate, there is no major obstacle to its long-term health. Our productivity 
is growing very rapidly. Within a couple of decades we will have a totally 
automated industrial base, full of robots and empty of people. Industry is well 
able to supply the needs of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a threat to our country's goal of social justice. As human workers 
are replaced by machines, owners of industry no longer provide a livelihood to 
those workers. Workers become much poorer, while owners become much richer. 
Inequality is a great threat to the well-being of this country. Properly 
financed entitlements are beneficial because they alleviate the inequality in 
our society. We need more entitlements, not fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Please note, however, that I said properly financed entitlements. And the only 
proper way to finance them is through taxing the rich. If human workers are 
going to disappear, then Social Security can obviously not be paid for by 
taxing younger workers. According to your paper (Oct. 7), since 1968 the middle 
class has lost 9% of its share of income to the wealthiest Americans. Obviously 
we need lower taxes on the middle class and much higher taxes on the rich.

 * Is Hunter for real? Too many times have I read articles and editorials 
wanting to implement changes in our government -- only to be disappointed by 
the proposals for change. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter begins by making faulty generalizations, such as: "Over the last 25 
years, expenditures for Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare have expanded 
dramatically."  
</P>
<P>
 The deficit is government's most menacing problem. Until this problem is dealt 
with, Hunter cannot fairly use facts such as, "The average person retiring in 
1990 will receive back more than 2 1/2 times what he or she contributed in 
Social Security payments plus interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, people are living longer than expected. But, this is a contributory 
problem -- not a substantial one. The problem with government as a whole, 
including the three targeted programs in Hunter's column, is the exponentially 
growing deficit.

 * It's deja vu time again. Every few years Hastings Keith rises up 
(Commentary, Nov. 28) to bash federal pensions as a big cause of the federal 
deficit. I note with interest that Keith apparently has made no effort to turn 
down or return any of the four pensions he receives. 
</P>
<P>
 I repeat my comments made in a letter to the editor the last time he wrote: 
Most federal pensioners do not receive three or four pensions as he does. Some 
do get a Social Security check in addition to their civil service pension 
check, usually a relatively small amount since it is frequently based on a 
part-time job covered by Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 I really have no objection to his basic idea of limiting the cost-of-living 
adjustments to these few fat-cats receiving such large total pension amounts, 
but I do object to his general message that retired federal employees are 
living off the fat of the land.

L.A. CITY BUREAUCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hooray for "A City Worker Protection That May Have Outlived Its Usefulness" 
(Opinion, Nov. 27)! In all the brouhaha over streamlining Los Angeles city 
government and reduction of the city's work force, only Xandra Kayden has 
pointed the finger in the direction of a major problem that costs the city 
dearly, the civil service system.  
</P>
<P>
 The problems Kayden related regarding lack of accountability, inability to 
reward and inability to terminate extend throughout the city to all 
employees.Supervisors and managers at all levels have no supervisory control. 
They are unable to directly hire the employees that they will supervise and 
have very little opportunity to fire a problem employee, once hired or 
promoted.  
</P>
<P>
 The rigid job classification system combined with constrained advancement 
practices causes the promotion of supervisors and managers selected from a very 
small pool of existing employees. The result is a large number of supervisors 
and managers are ill-equipped to carry out the responsibilities of their new 
position. The losses due to poorly run sections, departments and divisions can 
hardly be accounted for, not to mention the loss of morale on the employees' 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Riordan and the City Council must work together to wholesale revamp the 
bureaucracy of the civil service system. Accountability will not work only at 
the top, but must be implemented throughout the work force. If the bureaucracy 
can be revamped, Mayor Riordan and the City Council will be pleased to find a 
cost-effective and hard-working group of employees that is presently hidden 
underneath a mountain of mind-numbing, outdated and senseless bureaucratic 
muddle.

SEN. THOMAS KUCHEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for providing front-page coverage to the sensitive obituary by 
Kenneth Reich on Sen. Thomas Kuchel (Nov. 23). In the arena of today's 
political circus, it is easy to forget that our nation occasionally produces 
representatives of true heroic proportion.Perhaps increased media focus on 
these few individuals of unwavering principle would help us view the future 
with more optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 I have registered with party selection only once, and that for the privilege 
of supporting Kuchel in his primary race against Max Rafferty. Although always 
thereafter a "decline to state," I have considered myself a "Kuchel Republican" 
at heart.

 * As a lifelong liberal, I have often been asked by co-workers if I have ever 
voted for a Republican. I have always answered that, yes, I did vote Republican 
once. That vote was for Kuchel, who I considered a principled man who stood for 
something. That those younger colleagues say "Thomas who?" only indicates how 
long it's been since there was a Republican who deserved my vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Your excellent obituary confirmed my belief that he truly earned my 
confidence.

RETIRE THE SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE TEST; EDUCATION: COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SHOULD BE 
BASED ON MORE ACCURATE MEASURES SUCH AS ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE COFFIN, Lee A. Coffin is senior associate director of admissions at 
Connecticut College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the granddaddy of college admission criteria still has a pulse, last 
rites are in order for the Scholastic Aptitude Test. Already, 192 colleges and 
universities have abandoned the SAT as a required element of their selection 
process. My own institution joined them last month. It's time for the rest to 
embrace this movement. 
</P>
<P>
 During my recruiting visits this fall, I was amazed by the degree of 
frustration secondary school professionals expressed toward the College Board 
and its SAT. So it was not surprising how many embraced the new SAT-optional 
policy at Connecticut College with a heartfelt "Amen!" 
</P>
<P>
 To them, the SAT is a burden. They spend too much time explaining the test's 
implications, regulations and fee structure to bewildered students. When 
students fare poorly, counselors are hounded by parents seeking untimed testing 
opportunities for newfound learning disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 This chorus of consternation includes college admissions officials, who 
question the wisdom of recent SAT reforms that removed much of the "standard" 
from standardized testing. Test-takers have the "option" of using calculators 
in the math sections, but colleges will not know which scores were produced 
with such technological aid. It is especially troubling to think of 
disadvantaged inner-city and rural high school students who don't have access 
to this "optional" edge on a test already accused of cultural bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Cries of "foul" also cloud the College Board's decision to raise the combined 
verbal and math median score from about 900 to 1,000, which would artificially 
inflate scores. (The so-called "median" is the College Board's designation and 
a misnomer since the top score is 1,600.) 
</P>
<P>
 These "enhancements" compound longstanding objections: Allegations of gender 
and cultural testing bias have haunted the College Board for years. Legions of 
students earnestly profess that they "don't test well" and in fact, many of the 
very best students do not. The rapid expansion of test preparation courses 
fueled the idea that the exam rewards preparation, not just aptitude. People 
fear the consequences of a low score and clearly see the benefits of a high one 
and a cottage industry developed around this twin perception. There is money to 
be made by both the College Board and the test prep companies, but these 
expensive courses aggravate the disparity between affluent and disadvantaged or 
unsavvy test-takers. 
</P>
<P>
 What began in the 1940s as an aptitude test for the nation's elite has evolved 
into a phenomenon that consumes the college admission process. Curricular 
issues are secondary. In fact, the SAT does not reinforce the work of teachers 
or a rigorous curriculum, it circumvents them. Its dominance suggests that 
quick-fix opportunities like one three-hour exam can compensate for inadequate 
student performance over the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a mandatory SAT, the attention of admissions officials and students 
returns to more substantial academic considerations like the strength and depth 
of the high school course of study, the level of academic achievement and rank 
in class, personal recommendations, the quality of writing samples and even 
standardized achievement tests, which gauge performance in subject areas and 
are more directly tied to curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 In admission committees, these factors generate considerable commentary about 
a candidate's intellectual curiosity, intensity and vigor. While perhaps more 
subjective than a "standardized" test, these credentials anchor the admission 
review process in the classroom, where it belongs. It is much harder to invoke 
the "I don't test well" disclaimer for a C in English than for a 480 verbal 
score. Admission officers come to be less like "deans of denial" fixated on 
numbers than counselors reviewing academic performance. The burden of proof 
remains squarely -- and justifiably -- on each student.  
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, some students are well-served by the SAT. An optional admission 
policy accommodates the talents of strong test-takers and "late bloomers" with 
modest transcripts but innate ability. But the majority of college applicants 
-- and we who work with them -- are equally well-served by an admission process 
that once again places an academic orientation clearly and unequivocally at its 
core.

COLUMN LEFT / ROBERT SCHEER: PULLING UP BY BOOTSTRAPS TAKES TIME; MEET 
VERONICA, WHO'LL MAKE IT IF SHE SURVIVES GINGRICH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer is a former Times national correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I knew that if I searched long enough, I'd find Newt Gingrich's poster welfare 
mom. You know the kind, someone who got off the dole before the congressman 
felt compelled to throw her off. Veronica fit the bill. I met her Thursday at 
the Harbor Interfaith Shelter, an oasis in San Pedro that puts up homeless 
families for two or three months until they can get it together to rent an 
apartment of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica, a fortysomething African American (who didn't want her last name 
used), had benefited mightily from the Harbor Interfaith program and was back 
now, two years later, to thank the people working there. She has an apartment 
and a job; she is enrolled in a training program for a better job, along with 
her eldest daughter, and her two younger children are doing well in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most women on welfare, she hadn't wanted to be there. She had managed two 
years of college and always worked hard. But business slowed for the trucking 
company in Wilmington and she lost her receptionist job. Around the same time, 
she broke up with her husband and was evicted from her apartment. They say in 
the welfare business that many of us are only two paychecks away from 
homelessness; in Veronica's case, that proved true.  
</P>
<P>
 Her unemployment insurance supplemented by Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children didn't leave enough for the necessities plus rent, let alone a deposit 
on an apartment. Desperate, three kids in tow, she went first to the YMCA in 
Wilmington and just sat there crying. One of the volunteers took pity and 
referred her to Harbor Interfaith, which has converted an old Army barracks 
into 17 tiny one-room apartments, each with a fold-out bed.  
</P>
<P>
 Problem was that Harbor Interfaith had a waiting list of 250, and Veronica and 
her kids had to get in line. For months, they stayed in rundown motel rooms 
until they got their shot at a safe environment. For three months, they lived 
rent-free at the shelter while Veronica saved enough from her AFDC check for a 
security deposit. But that was only the first step.  
</P>
<P>
 There was no way she could afford the rent even in the most rundown 
neighborhoods. Fortunately, the Harbor Interfaith people were able to help her 
get a Section 8 housing grant, which means her landlord gets $371 a month from 
Veronica and $579 from the federal government. Once situated, Veronica started 
working part time for a janitorial service cleaning office buildings. 
Eventually, it became a full-time job. She went off AFDC, and she now earns 
$250 to $300 for a six-day work week. What keeps her going is the hope that 
through a federally sponsored six-month job-training program she will be able 
to actually move out of poverty.  
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully hers will be a success story. But contrary to the assumption of 
Gingrich and the other welfare-bashers, it's a tribute not only to Veronica's 
resolve but also to the AFDC program, food stamps, child care, job training, 
Section 8 housing and other government safety-net programs. Most of those 
programs need to be expanded for welfare reform to work. For example, Section 8 
housing is available to only 10% of the people on welfare.  
</P>
<P>
 The Harbor Interfaith Shelter, her first lifeline, typical of not-for-profit 
charities, gets the majority of its money from government sources. But, 
strapped for funds and swamped by applicants, the shelter has stopped keeping a 
waiting list. In all of Los Angeles County, there are only 2,900 shelter beds 
available for families. That's now, before the cuts everyone expects the new 
Congress to impose. "It's great to be able to help somebody like Veronica," 
said Beth Steckler, the director of client programs at Harbor Interfaith. "If 
Gingrich's welfare carnage passes, what we do will make no difference at all -- 
we'll be totally overwhelmed with lines of homeless families going around the 
block." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, The Times editorialized that welfare reform must come soon because 
"America's patience is running out." Odd, given that the AFDC program, which 
keeps more than 9 million children alive, costs the federal government $15 
billion a year, compared to $174 billion in interest on the Reagan/Bush run-up 
of the national debt. And the patient voters have just granted the 
supply-siders a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the patience of all the Veronicas who persist against monumental 
odds with very little support? And what about the patience of the wonderful 
folks at places like the Harbor Interfaith Shelter who persevere despite 
cynical politicians to help people get back on track? What nerve for members of 
Congress, with all their taxpayer-supported benefits and perks, to lose 
patience with the poor.

PERSPECTIVE ON SCHOOLS; WHEN RELIGION IS USED TO EXCLUDE; FOR ONE CHILD, THE 
HARM WAS NOT IN THE PRAYER ITSELF BUT IN THE HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT THAT IT 
CREATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH ROSEN, Ruth Rosen, a professor of history at UC Davis, writes regularly 
on political culture. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Republicans debate whether school prayer was just a swell sound bite or 
a solemn campaign pledge, the public needs to consider more than abstract 
constitutional arguments. We need to ask: How does state-enforced prayer affect 
children whose national or religious backgrounds mark them as stigmatized 
minorities? 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in a small rural village largely dominated by Lutherans. A big 
yellow school bus delivered me to a school that had students from kindergarten 
through 12th grade. Every morning we said the Lord's Prayer, followed by the 
Pledge of Allegiance. At all school events, we again bowed our heads and 
repeated the Lord's Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the early 1950s. There was nothing unusual about this ritual, except 
that I happened to be one of two Jewish children in the school. 
</P>
<P>
 I've tried to recapture how this so-called voluntary prayer affected me. When 
I was very young, I didn't know the difference. At home we said one prayer; at 
school, we said another. 
</P>
<P>
 I first understood that I belonged to a minority group at about the age of 7. 
But school prayer wasn't how I learned about my "difference." Many children 
went to religious instruction after school. I was stunned when some classmates 
suddenly accused me of killing Jesus Christ. At Brownie scout meetings, I found 
myself friendless. Embarrassed and confused, a few girls confided that they 
weren't allowed to play with Jewish children. After school, kids sometimes 
pelted me with snowballs and ethnic slurs I didn't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, it was this social awakening, not the school prayer, that hurt 
so much. How could I know that prejudice caused such stigma? I didn't, and for 
a long time I wondered what terrible and unacceptable personal trait had caused 
such social rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, the Lord's Prayer had taken on new meaning. This was the prayer of 
people who hated me. I refused to say it any longer. While others bowed their 
heads, I held mine high and stood in silence. Naturally, everyone noticed and 
my "difference" was only further reinforced. I became increasingly estranged 
and alienated from my schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Jews of the post-World War II generation grew up in more urban, tolerant 
and less anti-Semitic communities; my experience was unusual. School prayer in 
itself did not harm me. The real injury came from the hostile environment in 
which I had to say it. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps my daily ritual of dissent even strengthened my character. From years 
of daily civil disobedience, I learned the hard lesson of nonconformity. 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't wish this experience on millions of other children. Regrettably, a 
hostile environment still exists, especially for the children of recent 
immigrants. I worry about the Islamic, Buddhist or Hindi children who already 
face hostility from their schoolmates. Enforced school prayer would only deepen 
their sense of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider some of the experiences my students have had in the United States. 
One young woman is from Iran. In 1980, during the hostage crisis, classmates 
attacked her. "They threw stones at me and called me an Islamic terrorist." A 
Pakistani student, who is Muslim, was assailed by her junior high classmates 
for belonging to a family of "terrorists." Then there is a young Mexican 
American who grew up in a largely white Protestant community and was the victim 
of relentless xenophobic attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 If schools wish to introduce a quiet moment for reflection and meditation, I 
can't argue against the idea. Most Americans begin their days in a frenzy of 
activity. A moment for quiet reflection would allow each of us to calm down and 
reflect on our sense of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is not what the Republicans have in mind. They want local communities 
to have the right to impose particular prayers in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from our constitutional guarantee of separation of church and state, 
this is a terribly divisive proposal. In a nation that grows more multicultural 
every year, no one prayer is appropriate for children who represent all the 
world's major religions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will school prayer enhance our nation's spiritual life. That will occur 
when we resist rampant consumerism, learn to respect each other's humanity and 
regard poverty in the midst of plenty as a violation of our collective 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, that day is still far off.

BEHIND L.A.'S HOMELESS CRISIS: HOUSING CODES DESIGNED FOR THE '60S

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Planning & Development Report, a monthly newsletter. His book on the politics 
of urban growth will be published next year by Solano Press Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan's proposal to build what amounts to a "Homeless Bowl" 
near Downtown represents the latest attempt to grapple with the seemingly in 
tractable problem of what to do about people who will not or cannot live 
indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal -- which calls for a fenced-in urban campground for 800 people -- 
has received warm support from Downtown business interests and a predictably 
chilly response from advocates for the homeless. In other words, the idea has 
been dragged into the political quagmire usually associated with homelessness, 
where all arguments quickly boil down to the question of whether the homeless 
are lazy criminals or saintly victims of society. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of this schism, we will never seriously deal with the homeless problem 
if all we do is argue about the personality and character of the homeless. We 
need to change the way we talk about the issue, because part of the problem of 
homelessness is a "supply-side" one. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, there aren't enough housing options for poor or troubled people in 
Los Angeles, or any other city. Ironically, middle-class housing standards, 
originally designed to improve the lives of economically marginal people, stand 
as a serious impediment to progress. They discourage the construction of 
affordable housing and provide middle-class homeowners with political cover to 
oppose the construction of such housing. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not just political-science theory. It is happening in Los Angeles. 
While the hoopla surrounding the Homeless Bowl was making headlines, 
politicians such as former City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky have been quietly 
feeding an affordable-housing initiative into the grinder of middle-class 
housing values. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever they are and whatever their "lifestyle preferences," homeless people 
are on the streets partly because we have systematically emptied out the 
bedrooms where they used to live. For better or worse, mentally ill people used 
to live in mental institutions. Poor people used to live in slum neighborhoods. 
Alcoholics, drug addicts and difficult personalities used to live in our own 
homes because they were (and still are) our uncles, cousins or parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, all these options are gone, and those who used to depend on them 
scramble for housing. Mental institutions are downsized. Spare bedrooms are 
used for stray stuff, not stray people. Slum housing is snapped up by the 
working poor, who usually pay far too much for their substandard units. Those 
at the bottom of the housing chain end up in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, creating more housing to put into the chain is not easy. In a world of 
growing homelessness and poverty, we still live by housing standards 
established in the 1960s. Then, the most vexing housing problem was not a lack 
of affordable housing but, rather, substandard conditions. As a result, today's 
developers of affordable housing in Los Angeles have to provide lots of parking 
spaces, lots of open space and landscaping -- and pay lots of fees. One recent 
affordable-housing project in the city of Los Angeles paid $8,000 per unit in 
fees, mostly for sewer hookups, schools facilities and processing the building 
permit. The fees increased the cost of the units by more than 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite state laws permitting developers to build extra units if some 
affordable units are included in their projects, city regulations require 
Planning Commission and City Council approval on a case-by-case basis. 
("Affordable" units generally mean units available to the working class and the 
working poor under a percentage-of-income formula.) This opens up the approval 
process to the emotional appeals of neighboring homeowners, which, in turn, 
drives up the cost of projects even further -- and sometimes kills them. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a Soviet-style paradox. Standards for all new housing are 
extremely high because we believe everyone should have middle-class housing. 
Yet, the resulting cost is so expensive -- and the politics so difficult -- 
that housing for poor and working-class people simply doesn't get built. The 
code may call for one or two parking spaces per housing unit (plus guest 
parking); but, in reality, it's people, not cars, who are living in the 
garages. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics of middle-class angst only make this irony worse. While the 
Homeless Bowl was drawing both fire and praise, the City Council was mulling a 
set of recommendations from the city staff and the Planning Commission to relax 
some of the pointlessly high standards for affordable housing in the city. But 
the proposal has run into opposition from homeowner activists. 
</P>
<P>
 As passed by the Planning Commission, the proposal would have permitted higher 
densities "by right" without a case-by-case permitting process. It would also 
have decreased the number of parking spaces required for affordable projects. 
For example, parking requirements would have been dropped from two per unit to 
one in projects located near transit stops; no guest parking would have been 
mandated; parking for single-room occupancy hotels, whose tenants typically 
have no cars, would have been dropped to one space per every four units. 
Balconies and rooftops would have counted toward satisfying the open-space 
requirement, and a height variance would have been permitted. While fees would 
not have been cut, at least payment would have been deferred until the 
construction was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 When this proposal came before the council's Housing and Community Development 
Committee, Yaroslavsky objected, responding to the concerns of San Fernando 
Valley homeowner activists who fear an incursion of the poor into their 
two-car, middle-class neighborhoods. A compromise may be in the works, 
especially since Yaroslavsky is moving to the county Board of Supervisors. But 
the fact remains that while Riordan and homeless activists fiddle over the 
Homeless Bowl, a constructive step toward enlarging the housing chain has been 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing wrong with middle-class housing standards. They're still an 
ideal that should be pursued. But the reality of today's Los Angeles -- indeed, 
of today's America -- is that people who are not middle class need appropriate 
housing that is affordable. Imposing middle-class housing standards on 
affordable-housing projects in Los Angeles will only continue to shrink their 
housing options.*

THEATER; THEATER NOTES; 'SUNSET' ON HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By BD REPLACEMENT  
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1955, not long after Gloria Swanson's famous performance in the movie 
"Sunset Boulevard," she tried to turn "Sunset" into a Broadway musical called 
"Starring Norma Desmond." It never got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Andrew Lloyd Webber's latter-day musical staging of "Sunset 
Boulevard" is a huge hit, eight of the songs from "Starring Norma Desmond" and 
the story of the attempt to stage it are about to emerge from the realm of 
backstage anecdotes onto an actual stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle is called "Swanson on Sunset," a three-actor account of the true 
story behind "Starring Norma Desmond," written by and starring one of the 
story's principals, Dickson Hughes. It will be workshopped in four performances 
at the Cinegrill in Hollywood -- Wednesday, Dec. 21 and 28, and Jan. 4 -- and 
in a possible out-of-town engagement early next year before opening in L.A., 
probably at the Tiffany Theater next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes and his then-partner Richard Stapley became involved in the Swanson 
saga when they wrote to her asking her to star in their revue "About Time." 
Swanson invited them to the L.A. home where she was staying and listened to 
their tunes. But she told them the only project that might induce her back on 
stage would be a musicalization of "Sunset Boulevard." She asked them if they 
would be interested in writing it. 
</P>
<P>
 They were, and they did. But according to Hughes, "Starring Norma Desmond" 
foundered when Swanson developed a romantic interest in Stapley, much like that 
of Norma and Joe in "Sunset Boulevard" itself, but with one major difference -- 
Stapley was already involved in a personal relationship with Hughes. Soon both 
relationships were over, and Paramount failed to renew Swanson's one-year 
option on the project. All that was left of the saga was a demo tape and a 
recording of Swanson's 1957 appearance on Steve Allen's TV show, singing one of 
the songs from the "Starring Norma Desmond" score. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this account will be told primarily from Hughes' perspective in 
"Swanson on Sunset," he created it with Stapley's permission (though not with 
Swanson's -- she died in 1983). In addition to the script, Hughes will provide 
the piano accompaniment and will play himself -- sometimes leaving the piano 
bench to do scenes with the actors playing Swanson and Stapley. Besides eight 
songs written for "Starring Norma Desmond," Hughes and company will perform 
four other songs written for "Swanson on Sunset" itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starring Norma Desmond" would have relied less on the original screenplay 
than did the Lloyd Webber version, Hughes said. But he added that he hasn't 
seen the Lloyd Webber extravaganza: "My curiosity was satisfied by listening to 
the tape." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A CONNECTICUT YANKEE: Luke Yankee, the director of the "Swanson on Sunset" 
workshops, is also the just-appointed producing artistic director of Long Beach 
Civic Light Opera -- perhaps the most prestigious job in the Southern 
California musical theater scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of actress Eileen Heckart and retired insurance broker Jack Yankee, 
the new producer, 34, was raised in New Canaan, Conn., got his Equity card at 
age 15 and attended Juilliard School of Drama. After an acting career turned to 
directing in the '80s, he ran a summer stock theater in Pennsylvania for two 
seasons, producing and directing all of its shows. He also has directed at 
theaters in Florida, Massachusetts and New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving to Los Angeles one day prior to the Jan. 17 earthquake -- in 
order to pursue film and TV work -- his only previous L.A. gig was assisting 
director Ellis Rabb on the Broadway-intended production of "Light Up the Sky," 
with Peter Falk, which played the Ahmanson in 1987. But probably the starriest 
director he ever assisted was Harold Prince, with whom he worked on the 
Broadway production of "Grind." 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee said that Prince helped him get the Long Beach job -- and, after he was 
hired, he immediately faxed Prince an open-ended invitation to workshop a show 
at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The only LBCLO production Yankee has seen was last year's "Company," which he 
labeled "terrific." But he's aware that Long Beach has had financial problems, 
and "I need to play it very safe for the first year or two." He said his show 
budgets should average no more than $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, though, "I'd love to explore new or lesser-known pieces, tours, 
co-production with New York producers" -- and activation of the mid-sized 
Center Theatre next door to the LBCLO's base of operations, the giant-sized 
Terrace Theatre. None of these is a new goal; the Center Theatre, for example, 
was briefly activated during the tenure of Yankee's predecessor, Barry Brown, 
only to fall back into disuse when budgets shrank during the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the Long Beach City Council approved an LBCLO funding package of 
$490,000 a year for the next two years -- in the form of deferred rent 
($130,000 a year) of the city-owned Terrace Theater, $25,000 in annual grants 
from the theater's management company, and a $1 increase in Convention Center 
parking fees, most of which will go to LBCLO for the first two years. However, 
the city required LBCLO to match the first $490,000 by January. Last week, 
LBCLO officials estimated they were within $25,000 of that goal. 
</P>
<P>

 ADVANCE NOTICE: The $8-million advance reported for "Miss Saigon" roughly two 
months before its Jan. 25 opening at the Ahmanson Theatre is heftier than the 
$5.5-million advance for "Sunset Boulevard" roughly two months before that 
musical opened last December. But the "Saigon" advance isn't as big as the 
two-months-out advance of $11.7 million for the Ahmanson's last show, "The 
Phantom of the Opera," back in 1989. "Phantom" combined the talents of "Saigon" 
producer Cameron Mackintosh and "Sunset" producer-composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, 
who have since worked separately.

CALIFORNIA LAW SPURS INCREASE IN SAFE CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE E. ALLEN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 8,000 patterns of china sold worldwide now meet strict standards for 
exposure to lead because of a tough California law, according to one 
environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of lead-safe patterns to choose from has increased dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 About two years ago, the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund and California's 
attorney general published alist of 600 patterns that then met the stringent 
state standard -- more than 10 times tougher than the federal standard for 
plates and five times tougher for cups and bowls. That came after they sued 
manufacturers under Proposition 65, California's toxic chemical control law, 
for failing to disclose lead risks to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal standards allow 3,000 parts per billion of lead when plate glazes 
and decorations are tested for how much lead they release. The federal standard 
is 500 parts per billion for cups and bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 The California standard is 226 parts per billion for plates and 100 parts per 
billion for cups and bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 "One state law forced the facts out into the marketplace and the marketplace 
reacted worldwide," David Roe, a senior attorney in Oakland with EDF, said last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 EDF, in cooperation with the California attorney general, has compiled a 
shoppers' guide, "What You Should Know About Lead in China Dishes." It lists 
the fine and everyday china patterns that meet California's standard, based on 
information supplied by the manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether buying dishes for the holidays, registering for wedding china or 
getting everyday plates and cups for your family, there is no longer any reason 
to have to worry about toxic lead," Roe said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1993 settlement, 10 major manufacturers agreed to halve the amount of 
lead that leaches from patterns that are over the California standard. They 
also were required to attach warning stickers, only for sales in California, to 
every pattern that could not meet the California standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Signing the settlement were: Lenox, Wedgwood, Royal Doulton, Mikasa, Noritake, 
Fitz & Floyd, Pickard, Villeroy & Boch, Pfaltzgraff and Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 30 manufacturers also signed the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet is available by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to 
China Brochure at EDF, P.O. Box 96969, Washington, D.C. 20090.

SPACECRAFT FINDS SUN HAS UNIFORM MAGNETIC FIELD, NOT MAGNETIC POLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ulysses spacecraft has found the sun to have a uniform magnetic field 
rather than magnetic poles, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The spacecraft's finding differs greatly from the way the sun's magnetic field 
appears in Earth-based observations, which indicate the sun has magnetic 
poles.Ulysses did not detect any magnetic poles, JPL said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulysses, the first spacecraft to study the sun's high latitudes, completed its 
pass over the sun's southern pole on Nov. 5. The sun's polar regions are 
considered to begin at about 70 degrees north and south of the sun's equator. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulysses was released from the space shuttle Discovery and launched in 1990 on 
a $750-million mission. The mission is jointly managed by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration and the European Space Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulysses is now heading toward the sun's equator in a huge orbit far above the 
star. On March 12, 1995, Ulysses will be at the closest point of its solar 
exploration, 120 million miles above the sun.

LAWYER HELPS CONVICTS TO GET THE LEAST OUT OF PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAU CHAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Maureen McGinley's lawyer couldn't save her from 10 years in prison for 
dealing cocaine, she turned to Alan Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, based in San Francisco, is one of a handful of "post-conviction" 
attorneys who help the convicted get the most out of the federal prison system. 
</P>
<P>
 With Ellis' help, McGinley's sentence was cut to eight years and a month. 
McGinley, 41, is serving the last four years at the Federal Prison Camp in 
Alderson, a minimum-security prison for nonviolent women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told if you want the best, get Alan Ellis," McGinley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our aim is to get our clients the lowest possible sentence to be served at 
the best place possible," Ellis said. "Our names are written on all the 
bathroom walls of all the federal prisons of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, 50, a defense lawyer for 25 years with offices in San Francisco and 
Philadelphia, started out representing Pennsylvania college students busted for 
possessing small amounts of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "If their friends got in trouble, they would tell them about me," he said. "So 
I wound up expanding my practice." 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits some of Ellis' clients get are "Club Feds," minimum-security 
facilities that appear, at first glance, to be luxury resorts rather than 
institutions for incarceration and punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis commands $350 an hour, but boasts, "I can do in one hour what another 
lawyer who might charge $175 an hour might take three hours to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Wallace, one of Ellis' former clients, says Ellis helped him get released 
early, in April, from a minimum-security facility in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace was sentenced to 15 years in prison for one count of dealing cocaine, 
but Ellis reviewed his case and helped reduce the sentence by 18 months with 
credit for time served. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alan is the second most expensive investment you will ever make after your 
house," Wallace said. "And he may end up with your house. But good lawyers 
aren't cheap and Alan is a very good lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace says he, indeed, had to sell his house to pay Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
 But Richard Stratton, editor of Prison Life magazine and a former convict, has 
a different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused Ellis of "preying on . . . very desperate people who will cling to 
any kind of hope. He's advertising falsely and delivering very little because 
very little can be delivered in these cases." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis says his work is necessary because not all criminal attorneys are well 
versed in sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of criminal defense attorneys might be good at trial, but they lose 
interest when it comes time for sentencing," he said. "It's not their bag. 
That's where I step in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look for holes in the case. We look for any attorney malpractice, judges 
who have made errors or prosecutors who have failed to keep their word in plea 
bargain." 
</P>
<P>
 When ultraconservative and former presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche Jr. 
was convicted in 1988 of defrauding the government and supporters of millions 
of dollars, his attorneys consulted Ellis' firm about how to get the best 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Ellis' other well known clients were former Atlantic City Mayor Michael 
Mathews, who was convicted of taking bribes in office, and Steven Kalish, who 
was convicted of running drugs with Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews' attorneys consulted Ellis to advise them on what kind of sentence to 
ask for, and Ellis helped chip down Kalish's sentence from 14 years to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 It also helps to have six other attorneys and a social worker on staff as well 
as two former Bureau of Prisons officials as consultants, Ellis says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis says his firm has a policy of not taking cases it can't win. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have very fragile egos," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter where or how long Ellis' clients serve, it's still hard time, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going through the deprivation of their liberty, which is the most 
important thing," he said. "They're away from their loved ones. There is no 
such thing as a conjugal visit in the federal system." 
</P>
<P>
 McGinley knows about losing her liberty. For the last four years, she's been 
coping with separation from her two sons, ages 12 and 14, who are living with 
her parents in Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "My children need me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a 23-month reduction, McGinley believes she'd been dealt with too 
harshly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I probably deserve maybe a couple of years of counseling," she said. 
"That would have been more than enough. Particularly now, it just seems like a 
real overkill and a waste of time."

HIGH CELLULAR RATES CALL FOR ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California's large and powerful cellular telephone carriers are at it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently criticized by the California Public Utilities Commission for refusing 
to lower cellular rates to more than 2 million California consumers, the 
cellular carriers now accuse the PUC of thwarting "entrepreneurial zeal" by 
asking the Federal Communications Commission to allow it to impose limited 
regulatory oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 The PUC has prodded the carriers for years to reduce rates, with little 
success. Except for an occasional promotional pricing plan for new customers, 
since 1984 basic monthly access and usage charges in California remain 
virtually unchanged and are among the highest in the nation. In Los Angeles and 
San Francisco, subscribers pay basic rates of $45 monthly for access and 45 
cents per minute in peak usage periods. Prices for the "competing" cellular 
carriers in any city are almost identical. After years of study, the PUC has 
declared that cellular prices remain "unreasonably high." 
</P>
<P>
 THe PUC's conclusion is supported by the U.S. Government Accounting Office, 
which in 1992 studied 30 major cellular markets in the United States, including 
Los Angeles, San Francisco and San Diego. In its report titled "Concerns About 
Competition in the Cellular Telephone Service Industry," the GAO found that the 
duopoly market structure imposed by the FCC was restricting full competition, 
which in turn was likely leading to excessively high rates. (FCC policy permits 
no more than two licensed cellular carriers to offer service in any city.) 
Likewise, the FCC determined in March that cellular is still not fully 
competitive, a sentiment echoed in a recent Wall Street Journal article. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the cure for these high cellular rates? The cellular carriers would 
have you believe that deregulation will lower prices. This notion is silly at 
best. No company lowers prices if it isn't forced to by competitors or 
regulators. In fact, the only thing keeping AirTouch from raising its rates in 
Sacramento is the PUC, which so far hasn't agreed to its request. (Keep in mind 
that cellular carriers are free to lower prices today and that we have seen 
precious little of that freedom exercised.) 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to high cellular telephone rates in the long run is competition. In 
industries where there is effective competition, government oversight is both 
unnecessary and counterproductive. We need to encourage the development of more 
wireless competitors, which the federal government is doing through its auction 
of personal communications service licenses. But this potential competition, 
which is years away, must be monitored carefully because the most likely 
bidders for these PCS licenses are the cellular carriers! 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, the PUC must retain its regulatory authority. Backed by United 
Consumers Action Network and Toward Utility Rate Normalization, the PUC has 
petitioned the FCC to allow it to continue to regulate cellular rates. This 
will protect consumers against any rate increases. It will also allow the PUC 
to continue its efforts to inject more competition into these markets and deal 
with the sticky issue of bundling cellular telephone equipment with service, 
all of which will lead to lower consumer prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from thwarting "entrepreneurial zeal," as alleged by the cellular 
carriers, the PUC's continued regulatory authority will protect consumers from 
excessively high prices by these communications duopolists. The FCC needs to 
approve the PUC's petition.

FAULT LIES IN GATT, NOT FREE TRADE ITSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Flanigan did his usually excellent job in extolling the benefits of free 
trade ("GATT Reality Check Is Drawing on Strong Reserves," Nov. 27) but 
confused opposition to GATT with opposition to free trade. The objections of 
the environmental community and consumer groups lie in the structure of the 
agreement, not free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanigan quotes constitutional scholar Robert Bork that "no international 
agreement can override U.S. laws." This is a perfect example of Bork's verbal 
sleight of hand (sleight of mouth) in stating a true fact in order to tell a 
falsehood. 
</P>
<P>
 It so happens that under GATT, a body decides in closed session which laws 
constitute a restraint of trade. True, the offending country need not rescind 
the offending law or regulation. However, the country must keep paying a hefty 
fine as determined by the body if it wishes to keep the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Any offshore country can challenge the law in behalf of any international 
mega-corporation. Can you imagine President Clinton pulling out after six 
months, when these decisions go against us? Or Dole? Or Gingrich? 
</P>
<P>
 European countries are already waiting to attack our automobile efficiency 
standards, our safety standards, pesticide tolerances and even lead in wine. 
This has already shown up under NAFTA with regard to the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some of our industries wish to attack environmental laws in other 
countries where theirs are stronger than ours. For example, the German 
government has much stricter requirements on recycling of manufactured 
products. Our trade representative would be accusing them of restraining trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus we come down to the lowest common denominator prevailing. Health, safety 
and the environment will all be sacrificed to a grievously faulty agreement.

GAYS, LESBIANS NEED WORKPLACE ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Last Frontier" (Nov. 27) presents the great problem in business today for 
any gay or lesbian professional. One can be professional in behavior, 
professional in appearance and attitude.One can do an excellent day's work and 
still face a stigma and employment discrimination if openly homosexual within 
the ranks of an organization. 
</P>
<P>
 This can leave a decision to the individual: Be honest with co-workers with a 
clear conscience and thinner pocketbook, or live an untruthful life. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why the government would serve us all well by protecting homosexuals 
from discrimination in the workplace. Then business owners and corporate 
officers could point to that law as the reason their companies must by law use 
gay and lesbian employees in a manner warranted by their talents and abilities.

SEASON'S READINGS; BEWARE OF HOLIDAY KITSCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE LAMOTT, Anne Lamott's most recent book is Bird by Bird: Some 
Instructions on Writing and Life (Pantheon). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Old Uncle Jesus, whose birthday is nearly upon us, said, "Where your treasure 
is, there will your heart be also." What this means is so obvious -- that where 
you put your money is where your focus will be. Now, I am sitting here 
surrounded by some extremely expensive coffee table books, books of pure 
kitsch, and I'm deeply concerned about what these books mean. 
</P>
<P>
 It is appropriate that we would be swamped by sentimental art books this time 
of year, here in the Northern Hemisphere, where days are short and leaves have 
fallen, the nights are cold and dark, and everything points to the power of 
death in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Even forgetting the specter of Newt Gingrich and Jesse Helms for a moment, 
this is the time when death is most visibly apparent in our lives, when one 
might be tempted to ask the deeper questions, such as "Where is life?" And I 
tell you, I don't find it in any of the books before me. For instance, I've 
been studying a book of photography about an exact miniaturized replica of the 
White House with "tiny working televisions . . . and miniaturized carpets that 
reproduce the originals stitch by stitch," and an illustrated Gettysburg 
Address, and a guide to Bible Quilts and a book on the art of the heartland. 
These books are designed to give me a specific feeling: kitsch is cozy; it's 
Disney and fairy tales and mom and the mass cozy consciousness. It makes no 
demands upon you, because it tells you how to feel, and in many, many cases, 
that's happy and bland and sedated. For instance, Charles Wysocki, the artist 
and author of "Heartland," revels in his refuge, this refuge he offers the 
reader: "There is a country in my mind, a landscape in my heart, a place that 
does not appear on any map but is so clear and sharply detailed that to paint 
it, I have only to look within." This is the most beautifully concise 
description of kitsch I can imagine, along with this description from the book: 
"where things make sense and love holds . . . the past as it ought to have 
been." 
</P>
<P>
 This just gives me the chill. Maybe I'm overreacting, because we Californians 
came this close to electing living kitsch to be our new senator. Michael 
Huffington was celebrated and almost won for the exact reason that he didn't 
really exist. Michael Huffington is kitsch. So is Ronald Reagan. What they and 
collectible kitsch do is enthrall people, cast a spell. They give us a false 
sense of security and goodness. It is a form of idolatry. We create false gods 
with our own hands and then, like damn fools, fall down before them and 
worship. This worship saves people the pain of being responsible, of being 
aware and alive in these hard, frightening times. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not part of the solution. I would like to run out right now, because 
I'm bored and anxious and angry, and eat my body weight in Mexican food, chased 
down with a Kit-Kat or two. But I have learned that the solution is to stay 
present, tell the truth and feel my feelings and rage my rage and cry. Then 
there is hope, of relief, of feeling cleansed and renewed. I bet Susan Smith's 
house is full of kitschy gewgaws that seem very beautiful to her, that help her 
feel better about her self, that help her avoid her rage and grief. The 
solution is not to medicate. The solution, although it is painful, is to be 
awake and fully human, grounded in what is real and what is now.  
</P>
<P>
 I understand the love of kitsch; I do. It fills the need for fairy tales and 
happy endings as it fills up white space. People who love it fill and cover 
every smooth, shiny space in their homes with this stuff -- everything in the 
house, every place, every table and bit of shelf space and glass cabinet is a 
platform for these talismans. And I think that one compulsively, out of fear, 
decorates the white space because white space is the abyss -- white space is 
the black space. Then, instead of feeling terrified about how quickly it all 
goes, and how vulnerable we all are, and how tiny our children and 
grandchildren seem and how angry people are about all these upsetting 
immigrants trying to take advantage of our tax base, we get to feel sentimental 
and silly and protected. These pieces of art provide you with positive 
associations, because they remind you of happier times: Someone will look at 
your collection of fuzzy Santa Claus pins and be reminded of her third-grade 
teacher who wore a pin just like this, where she could pull the little 
red-satin cord and Santa's nose would light up and the mortgage was not due and 
Newt Gingrich was not about to be Speaker of the House and her son did not have 
a pierced eyebrow because she did not yet have a son, because she was only 8, 
and life had not yet become a living hell. (Or perhaps it was, but for a few 
hours every day during the Christmas season, she got to hang out with this 
sweet benevolent teacher who loved her and let her pull the cord on her fuzzy 
Santa Claus pin.) 
</P>
<P>
 Kitsch reminds us tenderly, romantically, of a time and place that never was 
and never will be -- herds of blown-glass unicorns, serrated grapefruit spoons 
bearing the image of the martyred JFK, Jesus tea towels. These things are about 
not wanting to be disturbed -- I think of the John Callahan cartoon of the 
woman outside the locked psychiatric ward, reading the sign that says, "Do not 
disturb any further." People do not want to be disturbed any further, and so 
they peer at the photos of the tiny hand-painted reproductions of the portraits 
that line the White House Walls, or they polish the glass cinnamon buns the 
size of lentils in their olde America Bake Shoppe dollhouse. These things are 
supposed to protect us by thwarting the darkness; and this is exactly why they 
are so destructive. In the darkness, as pagans recognize when they celebrate 
the winter solstice, lie the seeds of brand-new life and rebirth, which will 
burst forth again in the spring. We need the darkness. The darkness makes the 
light visible. Without it, the light would disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, to take refuge -- in sentimental art, in narcissistic display -- 
means you are checking out of the fray. This is celebrating things precisely 
because they are fantasy, and never existed and so are not tarnished and funky 
and used and real: like life, like us. Kitschiness lures people into giving up 
the fight, and when we give up the fight, we're dead. We give up working for 
what is right, for nonviolence and love and the belief that all people are 
created equal, that everyone be regarded with the same degree of respect. 
Curled up around your kitsch, your proud little angler ashtrays, you place 
yourself outside the struggle to be responsible: able to respond. If enough 
good people do nothing, well -- I don't want to seem like some left-wing 
Christian crackpot, although this is pretty much exactly what I am, but 
whatever you might call the power of good out there -- conscience or kindness 
or God, whatever it is that calls us to fairness and community and empathy, 
calls us to reach out and care about the fate of other people -- needs our 
cooperation. It needs us to notice the impossible beauty and impossible 
brokenness and mysteriousness of who we are and our connection in the mosaic. 
Like the small print says, you must be present to win. To the extent that these 
books on kitsch offer one delight and a sense of buoyancy, I welcome their 
arrival every year. To the extent that they narcotize us to matters of justice 
and freedom, to the work that needs to be done, the soup that needs to be made 
and served, I see them coming and shudder.

DANA PARSONS: TREADING THE MURKY WATERS OF THE INVESTMENT POOL FIASCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't know about you, but nothing makes me more panicky than someone calling 
a press conference and telling me not to panic. So even without understanding 
all the ins and outs surrounding the plunge of Orange County's investment fund, 
my palms are suddenly clammy in the wake of the county's top money managers 
telling us all to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasn't "relax" the last word investors said in 1929 just before they started 
jumping out of 10th-floor windows? 
</P>
<P>
 But while I may not grasp the terminology of the investment-pool fiasco, I 
grasp the psychology. And my guess is that the public financial managers 
throughout Orange County who subscribed to "In Citron We Trust" are in for some 
lathering by their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 All of a sudden, taxpayers and special-district ratepayers who had no idea 
where their money was now will be asking their elected representatives. From 
the sound of things, they won't like the answers. The citizens probably won't 
direct their fire at Robert L. Citron -- if only because they don't know him -- 
but at the finance people at their local City Halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron has left those people in a major political box. They either can't or 
don't want to take their constituents' money out of Citron's pool, hoping to 
recoup the paper loss incurred so far but thus leaving them vulnerable to 
potential further losses. Now that the public is suddenly clued in to the 
high-stakes game Citron has been playing, citizens without his gaming spirit 
may start leaning on their elected reps to cash in. 
</P>
<P>
 If this were Japan, Citron would have resigned by now. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't have to resign, but he should face the music. His performance last 
Thursday -- the day the story broke -- was somewhat less than admirable. 
</P>
<P>
 He said virtually nothing at the press conference, then made himself 
unavailable to the media on Friday. If this is his idea of the way to stem a 
loss of public confidence, he's wrong. He surely knows the markets much better 
than the average citizen, so why not explain to us why a skid of $1.5 billion 
is nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, his attitude reflected the way he ran his campaign against 
Republican challenger John Moorlach in the spring. Moorlach was all over Citron 
for risky investments, and Citron, first elected in 1970, acted like the feudal 
landlord being questioned by a serf. That the serf actually may have known what 
he was talking about is now rather obvious, and you'd think Citron would give 
us Joe Six-Packs of Orange County at least a primer on his investment 
strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sophisticated in money matters, and if I were running the county's 
investments, they'd be in a tin can buried in my back yard. But I can 
understand some basics, and I would have liked to have heard some good reasons 
from Citron as to why this is no time to panic, especially when other financial 
professionals are telling us to run for our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Aren't public officials supposed to soothe us from time to time? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Citron went to his bunker defense. During the campaign, the defense 
made sense, up to a point. He cited his long run of investment success, and 
said Moorlach's naysaying was detrimental to the market. Voters, who may or may 
not have understood the nuances of his investment strategies, overwhelmingly 
reelected him. With his track record, Citron is no doubt indignant that anyone 
deigns to question him. Someone should tell him that attitude is never 
acceptable for a public official. 
</P>
<P>
 However hypocritical it may appear to Citron to be criticized for the recent 
swan-dive of the investment fund -- given that that same strategy yielded high 
returns in years past -- it's perfectly appropriate. Yes, it's 20-20 hindsight 
on his critics' part, but hindsight is all we have, given his refusal to engage 
Moorlach in much debate during the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not Citron's fault that the public didn't know how he was playing the 
county portfolio. It's not his fault if people thought he was playing the 
"Don't Pass" line and he was putting the money on six the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that we've added up the losses, even if it is the equivalent so far of 
house money, Citron needs to let us in on his thinking. Even we dullards know 
that speculation means risk, but explain how you misread the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, restore our confidence. All we know now is that $1.5 billion 
we had in hand a few months ago is now in the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the kind of news that makes us relax. 
</P>

ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hands-on Approach--The public is invited to the Bolsa Chica wetlands on 
Saturday at 8 a.m to support protecting the wetlands from development. 
Participants will stand side-by-side, joining hands and encircling much of the 
wildlife area. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Chica is one of the best bird-watching sites in the county. Birds likely 
to be seen include egrets, herons, American avocets and whimbrels, a bird 
usually found along rocky shorelines. Among endangered species found at the 
wetlands are Belding's savannah sparrow, light-footed clapper rails and 
peregrine falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 The ecological reserve is on Pacific Coast Highway about half a mile south of 
Warner Avenue, across from Bolsa Chica State Beach. A second entrance is off 
Warner Avenue. If parking lots are full, participants will be directed to 
alternative parking sites. Car-pooling is recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call (714) 960-9939. 
</P>
<P>
 Nature (Crafts) Calls--Children of all ages are invited to the Oak Canyon 
Nature Center to create natural wreaths and ornaments from materials gathered 
out-of-doors.  
</P>
<P>
 The Saturday program, from 1 to 3 p.m., may also include a nature hike. Cost 
of the program is $6.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Canyon Nature Center is at 6700 Walnut Canyon Road, Anaheim. Call (714) 
998-8380 to reserve space. To get there, take the Riverside (91) Freeway east 
to the Imperial Highway turnoff. Exit and head south to Nohl Ranch Road. Turn 
left and travel about three miles to Walnut Canyon Road, and turn left again. 
Pass the Anaheim Hills Golf Course; the nature center is at the end of the 
road, parking is on the left.

NEW ANSWERS POSE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS; SURVEY REDIRECTS FOCUS TO CRIME AND 
RELATED ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first 10 years of its existence, every time the Orange County Annual 
Survey asked residents to identify their biggest concern, the same answer came 
back: traffic. It was enough to prompt the directors of the survey to say they 
were working in a "one-issue county." No longer. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, when Bill Clinton's aides reminded campaign workers that "It's the 
economy, stupid," the economy ranked highest on the list of concerns in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, and again this year, the main worry has been crime. More than 30% 
picked crime as the most important public policy problem, followed by 18% who 
chose jobs and the economy. The director of the annual survey, Mark Baldassare 
of UC Irvine, said the shift from traffic to crime parallels Orange County's 
shift from suburban to urban. Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates said the fears 
of crime are not unfounded. Violent crimes are increasing, and the publicity 
given to them adds to the fear. 
</P>
<P>
 But the survey of 1,000 county residents also found signs of hope. For 
instance, the number of respondents who said things were going "badly" in the 
county dropped from 40% last year to 29% this year. One reason was a better 
feeling about the economy, rated good or excellent by more than one-quarter of 
the respondents. And nearly half expected it to improve in the next two years. 
Baldassare said the "quality of life" ratings were the highest since 1990, 
which is encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a troubling aspect of the poll was the renewed evidence of a fault 
line dividing South County from north, west and central. Along with it went a 
marked difference in the threats perceived by poor and rich, and their 
reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Of South County respondents, 35% feared becoming a crime victim. For north, 
west and central, the figure was far higher, just under 50%. Asked if their 
worries about crime were so bad that they kept them from using public parks or 
beaches, 53% in central Orange County answered "yes." In South County, only 28% 
answered "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 As Baldassare correctly noted, if people acted on those worries, an exodus of 
residents from other areas to wealthier South County would hurt in at least two 
ways. It would worsen traffic in one area of the county where many still rank 
traffic as a major problem, and it would harm the economy of the areas the 
migrants are fleeing. Also troubling was that only 24% of residents had 
confidence in the ability of courts to convict and sentence criminals. 
Nationally, the percentage is even lower. With attitudes like that, it was not 
surprising that flawed legislation like the "three strikes" law passed the 
Legislature this year -- and was adopted by the voters via Proposition 184 last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 These findings challenge the county's political and opinion leadership to deal 
creatively and effectively with changing perceptions and new realities. One 
encouraging note was the finding that nearly four out of five residents said 
the county needed programs to increase dialogue among ethnic groups and raise 
public understanding about cultural diversity. Even higher numbers made the 
realistic assessment that efforts to improve race relations are important to 
the county's economy and quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many residents clearly are concerned about the demographic changes of 
recent years, which have whittled away at the overwhelming numerical majority 
of whites and increased the numbers of Latinos and Asians. The changes ought to 
prompt all our citizens to make diversity an asset to the community and to 
involve members of all groups in shaping policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County residents are in for a treat next weekend. The park at the end 
of Oso Parkway will open, with a new name, trails for hikers, bikers and 
horseback riders, and above all a chance to get away from the hustle and bustle 
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 For years the 475 acres was known as Wagon Wheel Canyon Park, a gift to Orange 
County from the Coto de Caza Corp., developers of the community by that name. 
The problem with the park was that it was virtually impossible to reach without 
trespassing. The three-mile extension of Oso Parkway enabling traffic to reach 
the park opened only last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors have renamed the park for one of their own, Thomas F. Riley, a 
retired U.S. Marine Corps general who is leaving the Board of Supervisors next 
month after a 20-year career. It is a fitting tribute to a man with a deep love 
for parks and wilderness areas and who insisted that developers include open 
spaces in the communities they built. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisely, the acreage has been designated a wilderness park, meaning there will 
be only a minimum of facilities. No playgrounds, no hookups for recreational 
vehicles. Those are available in other parks. The Riley Wilderness Park is due 
to open next Saturday with hayrides, tours and refreshments. The park will have 
the trails and some paved roads, a few exhibits and some picnic tables. Oh, 
yes. A few portable toilets too. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy development of Orange County in recent decades has removed natural 
areas and forced people to travel farther to glimpse birds and wildlife. The 
paving of grasslands and leveling of hills was inevitable; without it, there 
would not have been houses for newer Orange County residents. Yet there is no 
denying that we have lost a part of the county and must be vigilant to preserve 
what open space we can. The park will be a fitting addition to the county's 
inventory of areas that allow residents to slip the bonds of civilization, at 
least temporarily.

WRITER CLARIFIES HER OPTIMA COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is to correct an error and to give credit where credit is due. The error 
was in a letter of mine about the county program OPTIMA, which you printed Nov. 
20. What I said in the letter was based upon misinformation gleaned while 
talking with OPTIMA. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit is due to Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. Even though I do not live in 
her district, her office phoned me, asking if I had talked with OPTIMA. When I 
told Wieder's assistant that OPTIMA was where I had gotten my information, she 
told me that existing patient-doctor relationships will be continued and that 
there will be no problem about repeat visits for my ongoing conditions. She 
also said that, although nothing has been decided about prescriptions, she sees 
no reason why I cannot continue using the same, convenient, pharmacy that I am 
using now. Supervisor Wieder deserves credit for contacting people outside of 
her district in order to ensure accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the supervisor for my district merely wrote me that old political 
standby: a good-doggie-down-Fido letter. These letters sound nice at first 
reading but, when examined more closely, are found to be lacking in information 
and/or assistance and/or interest in your viewpoints.

 * In regard to Juanita Matassa's letter, "Health Plan Robs Poor of Dignity" 
(Nov. 20): 
</P>
<P>
 I took offense at the implication that only the poor have lost 
"self-determination" in regard to their health care. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a white, middle-class, college-educated, credentialed teacher, teaching 
in a private school. My employer offers a PPO or HMO through a major insurance 
carrier. Most of my co-workers and I cannot afford the luxury of the PPO. I 
have had four changes of plans in four years. A few weeks ago, my colleagues 
and I were given 24 hours' notice that most of our doctors had been dropped 
from our plan and we were assigned to yet another group of doctors we knew 
nothing about. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor, who benefit from the hard-earned tax dollars of people like myself, 
need to realize that they are not the only group that have no 
self-determination in their health care. Few of us do.

SAVE THE BUNKER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Will the real Amigos de Bolsa Chica please stand up! 
</P>
<P>
 A letter sent to the county by the board of directors of the Amigos de Bolsa 
Chica (Nov. 23) stated that the Amigos support the plan for demolishing World 
War II bunker No. 128, which is on the Bolsa Chica mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The bunker last September was declared by the U.S. Department of the Interior 
to be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historical Places. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amigos must be an environmental group that supports the preservation of 
the Bolsa Chica OR be a Koll ally; they cannot be both. 
</P>
<P>
 In our recent City Council election, four Amigos were elected on the promise 
to protect Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 The Koll Real Estate Group wants to destroy this historical site to erect 
3,300 dwellings on Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 If the board of directors' letter is speaking for the Amigos, we the community 
of Huntington Beach were lied to in the recent election by the elected incoming 
City Council.

CABLE RATES NOT FROZEN IN LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your news stories about cable television ("O.C. Cable Firm to Pay Rebates of 
$1.2 Million" and "City Freezes Paragon Cable Basic Rates Pending Federal 
Ruling," Nov. 30) portray the Los Alamitos City Council's action of Nov. 28 as 
a "freeze" of basic cable rates. That is not an accurate portrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action did not freeze basic cable rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action ordered Paragon Cable to maintain a record of revenues 
from various service tiers pending FCC decisions interpreting its previous 
rulings on rate regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the FCC ruling favor the city consultant's interpretation, a refund 
would be in order (actually, a credit on upcoming subscriber bills is 
customary). 
</P>
<P>
 Two November FCC rulings on similar cases (Time/Warner, Milwaukee, Wis., and 
Paragon, Irving, Tex.) have supported cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Paragon Cable has not taken a rate increase during the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next six months several rate adjustments can be expected, including 
a decrease in equipment rates, an FCC-controlled 3-cent increase in basic rates 
to cover FCC license costs and a permitted cost-of-living increase in basic 
rates.

 So the Villa Park City Council "Denounces Federal Clean Air Plan" (Nov. 28) 
because school buses that emit an unhealthy level of carcinogenic exhaust would 
be rendered "obsolete" to the tune of $600 million. With all the money saved, 
perhaps the City Council might have the largess to pass an additional 
resolution -- one that provides oxygen masks to students riding those obsolete 
and dangerously polluting vehicles.

TAKING ISSUE WITH EVOLUTION'S CRITIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Terrence Tobin's letter of Nov. 27 misleads readers by suggesting 
that the John Peloza lawsuit has any merit. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who missed it, Capistrano Valley High School science instructor John 
Peloza sued the Capistrano Unified School District because he was censured for 
refusing to teach evolution in science class and also for proselytizing 
students between classes. Peloza is now conducting physical education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 This suit (that contended evolution was a religion and therefore violated the 
Constitution) was rejected by the 9th U.S. Court of Appeals, calling it 
patently frivolous. Undaunted, the radical religious right has vowed to take it 
to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though evolution is a scientific fact, I respect the beliefs of 
fundamentalists who adhere to a strict interpretation of the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 My problem is with the Rev. Tobin, who asserts that only atheists believe in 
evolution and that Darwin's "only purpose (in developing evolution) was to move 
away from God." These statements show how far out (and intolerant of others) 
the radical religious right has become. 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM R. LAKIN 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * In his recent letter, the Rev. Terrence Tobin "unchristianly" bent his 
"facts" to make his case. The facts are:  
</P>
<P>
 * Evolution is never taught in any school as a fact, but only as a strongly 
substantiated theory. 
</P>
<P>
 * Atheism is not a religion because atheists do not worship any God. They 
simply do not want any mystical and absurd religious dogma forced on them or 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Peloza's legal suit against the school district caused the waste of 
thousands of dollars of taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Rev. Tobin's letter is just another unrelenting attempt to destroy 
religious freedom in the United States by breaking down the wall of separation 
between church and state. The Rev. Tobin wants to institute his own brand of 
Christianity as the state religion.

TAKING ISSUE WITH FINDINGS OF POLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I strongly disagree with your assertion that a "majority" of Orange County 
residents favor stricter gun control laws (Nov. 29). I don't feel a survey of 
only 1,000 residents constitutes the true feelings of "an overwhelming 
majority" of county residents. Medical students from UCI, the source of the 
poll, have recently been demonstrating against firearms and in favor of gun 
control. I feel the poll's accuracy could have been affected by the biases of 
those who created it. 
</P>
<P>
 I would also question the background knowledge and information the survey 
respondents had about the subject. In talking to non-firearm owners about gun 
control, I have found that they largely base their opinions on what information 
they receive from the media. Since the media are predominantly liberal and 
extremely anti-gun, most non-firearm owners have received only slanted, 
one-sided information. Nothing was said about the background of the survey 
respondents. For all we know they could have been UCI medical students or Times 
staff writers. 
</P>
<P>
 The media have a frightening ability to control what we see and how we see it. 
We should be very careful when they are trying to sway our opinions on such an 
important issue. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL THOMAS 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro 
</P>
<P>
 * Please explain where this poll was taken that found 48% of the respondents 
in favor of gun control. Anyone who is serious about wanting to make an impact 
on crime would advocate less lenient judges, longer sentences and more police 
on the streets, not more restrictions on the people who are innocent of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tougher enforcement of existing laws, including those on immigration, will 
lead to a reduction in crime, not such a topical solution such as banning 
weapons that are used in few crimes compared to the number of violent crimes 
committed by repeat felons. Assault rifles are rarely used in the commission of 
a crime due to size and cost. 
</P>
<P>
 A much greater impact would be had against crime if the problems of gangs and 
drugs on the streets were addressed.

FAREWELL TO KUCHEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a lifelong Democrat, I was saddened to hear of the death of former U.S. 
Sen. Thomas H. Kuchel, as he was the last Republican legislator I ever voted 
for.Unlike today's crop, Tom Kuchel was a human being first, a gentleman next 
and a politician last. In casting my ballot it didn't matter what party Tom 
belonged to, I knew he would govern for all the people. He must have been 
thoroughly sickened by what has been taking place on both sides of the 
legislative aisle over the past decade or so. 
</P>
<P>
 To Tom Kuchel's family, take heart. He may have been the last good politician 
we will see for quite a while.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON COOPERATION; WE MUST STRIVE TO FIND HARMONY 
AFTER CACOPHONY OF PROP. 187; REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ORANGE COUNTY HUMAN 
RELATIONS COMMISSION SAY RESIDENTS NOW FACE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ESTABLISHING 
COMMUNICATION BEFITTING A MULTICULTURAL COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH INOUYE and RUSTY KENNEDY, Kenneth Inouye is chairman of the Orange 
County Human Relations Commission. Rusty Kennedy is the commission's executive 
director. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Nov. 8, we voted in overwhelming numbers to pass Proposition 187 to cut off 
services to, and education of, immigrants without legal status. To some this 
was standing up for law and order; to others, it was racially motivated 
scapegoating at its worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-election rhetoric was so charged with emotion on both sides that it 
dominated our entire community's attention. We were spellbound as outrageous 
charges and countercharges flew back and forth, as conservative and liberal 
monikers were cast aside, and we were grouped according to support or 
opposition, as our children started to act up and demonstrate for the first 
time in years, as the fabric of our community showed its threadbare nature 
under the strain. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the election, we held our collective breath to see what the 
reactions would be. We watched as the dialogue moved from the streets to the 
courts, where the minority and the unpopular have always sought their last 
refuge under the protections of the Constitution. With the ink barely dry on 
the election results, the legal challenges that both sides predicted were filed 
and the long court journey was begun. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the emotions that were whipped into an election eve frenzy 
continue to spill out all over. Letters to the editors in record numbers malign 
the courts and the Constitution as interfering with the mandate of the people, 
and children and families are driven by irrational fears based on wild rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that for the near future rather than solving the problems as 
promised, Proposition 187 has pointed the finger, divided our community and 
raised expectations that are impossible to meet, thereby leaving us with an 
increasingly frustrated and angry populace crying for more and more on the one 
side and on the other side feeling alienated, isolated, angry and under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we hold together as a community while this divisive issue is debated, 
challenged and finally decided, knowing full well that no matter what the 
ultimate outcome, it is unlikely to live up to our expectations? 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Human Relations Commission was created by the Orange County 
Board of Supervisors to build mutual understanding among the diverse residents 
of our community. We don't know what is the best path forward, but we know the 
goal: It is to get there together. 
</P>
<P>
 If we are to hold together as a great society, we must go back to the basics: 
We have to talk to each other. Through this time-honored process of dialogue we 
can as a community begin to better understand different perspectives and 
eventually make better decisions -- decisions that bring us together in our 
diversity and make us strong because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as survival of a species is positively affected by the diversity of its 
diet so shall we be made strong as a community by the diversity of our 
elements. Who knows what skills, abilities, talents or languages will be 
pivotal to our economic survival in the rapidly approaching future? 
</P>
<P>
 We must find the generosity of spirit to come together after elections and try 
to make this experiment in democracy work. For if each election is merely the 
starting gun in yet another campaign of vilification of our elected officials 
and our laws, it is not the policies that will be denigrated -- in the end it 
will be our country and its system of Democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Human Relations Commission invites all interested parties to 
an open forum Thursday at 7 p.m. at 1300 S. Grand, Building B, in Santa Ana to 
begin this dialogue. We will hear from officials about the facts involved in 
implementing Proposition 187 and from all sides about their ideas as to how we 
can pull together as a community as these contentious issues are being decided. 
Orange County Together -- a special collaboration of the United Way of Orange 
County, the Orange County Human Relations Council, businesses and community 
members -- will be joining us as we initiate this dialogue and pose such 
questions on the passage of Prop. 187 as:  
</P>
<P>
 * What does it mean and how will we as a community deal with its 
implementation and challenges? 
</P>
<P>
 * Will we be torn apart by our emotions, expectations and fears? 
</P>
<P>
 * Is there a path forward which brings our community together during this 
difficult time? 
</P>
<P>
 * Are there things we can do to prevent the escalating hostility? 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what side of this issue we come down on, we must work together to 
address these questions and chart a course that will bring us to a future where 
diverse people can disagree about important issues and still coexist in peace.

PRINCIPAL IN GRADE SCANDAL SHOULD QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My rudimentary recollection of journalistic principles tells me that stories 
in the right-hand column above the fold are major stories. So I read with 
interest and then increasing shock, the Nov. 29 story "Principal in O.C. Grade 
Scandal Faces Transfer." What I was led to surmise from the headline was true: 
The principal in the Brea-Olinda High School grade-altering scheme was not 
being fired: He was being transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I live in the Orange Unified School District, and neither pay taxes to 
nor elect the trustees of the Brea-Olinda Unified School District, all I can do 
is write to The Times and hope those trustees get this message: Shame on you 
for lacking the courage to fire the man outright. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article reported that all others involved in the scandal, including those 
who actually altered the transcripts, are not now employed in the district. 
Therefore, the school board has no power to discipline those errant former 
employees. But former principal John Johnson is still employed by the district 
and what happens: He not only is sent to work in the district's office, but 
also he will "oversee some personnel" and "be in charge of student expulsions 
and suspensions." 
</P>
<P>
 As a parent of school-age children and as a pastor in Orange, I ask: What 
message are we sending to our children? Mr. Johnson discovered the scheme and 
did indeed order it stopped. However, he did not order the affected students' 
grades to be changed back to their original state; nor did he inform the school 
board until many months later that this monstrous thing had even happened. Mr. 
Johnson, although he altered no grades himself, aided and abetted cheating by 
not telling the appropriate authorities of the scheme the moment he discovered 
it. He was the supervisor of those guidance counselors. He made the decision to 
"cover up" what the guidance counselors had done. But he is not paying the full 
price for what he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the tentacles of tenure, if covering up scandal is not grounds for 
dismissal, then apparently nothing is. 
</P>
<P>
 How ironic that Yorba Linda, home of the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace, 
is in the Brea-Olinda district. The late President Nixon, accused of the 
massive Watergate "cover-up," resigned the presidency. Would that Mr. Johnson 
do the same honorable thing in the absence of any apparent spines on the part 
of the school board to fire him.

'CATHOLIC DIFFERENCES' ARE MISSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The table labeled "Catholic Differences" ("Tiny St. Matthew Rattles the Roman 
Catholic Diocese," Nov. 28) contained inaccurate statements about the official 
teachings of the Roman Catholic Church. The source of the table was cited as 
"St. Matthew Old Catholic Church," with no mention of input from the Roman 
Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is true that the Roman Church does not approve the ordination of 
women, it is not clear from the article that the "Old Catholic Church" ordains 
female priests either. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement that "women's involvement in ministry encouraged" applies to the 
Old Catholic Church and not to the Roman Church is untrue. Short of the 
ordained priesthood, women have always been encouraged to play an active role 
in service within the Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially since Vatican Council II, the Church has actively encouraged women 
to aspire to positions of leadership within the Church and has opened new 
opportunities of ministry to women. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the statement that in the Roman Church "Bishop, priests, deacons have 
elevated status" in contrast to the Old Catholic movement where "laity plays 
prominent role in Church" is ludicrous. Virtually all religions apply some sort 
of "elevated status" or respect to their clergy, and I am sure that the Old 
Catholic Church is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roman Catholic Church teaches that the role of the laity is essential to 
the life of the Church. This has been particularly emphasized by our current 
Pope, John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 The major difference between the two churches is the disagreement over papal 
authority.

UNCHARITABLE ACT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article "Residents Want Costa Mesa to Oust 3 Charities" (Nov. 22) reports 
". . . that some residents want the charities out because they are magnets for 
street people." Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter was named as one of the three 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 For 13 years, Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter has helped the homeless become 
housed. We have an 84% success rate in moving graduates into permanent homes. 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of our clients are young children. They do not fit a stereotype of 
street people. They need our help to stay in school and break the cycle of 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, when you hear people talking about helping people privately 
instead of with government and taxpayer money, does it behoove residents to 
talk of ousting effective charities? What happened to the "points of light" 
idea? I think we as a community can do better.

BARBARIC HUNTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times editorial "Coal Canyon Better Off Without Hunting" (Nov. 20) 
certainly took a milquetoast position with the comment "limiting weapons to 
bows and arrows . . . decreases the chance of harm to others." 
</P>
<P>
 It may be the "function of Fish and Game to preserve the interest of hunters," 
but to preserve the pusillanimous pleasure of a mindless minority of erstwhile 
Robin Hoods who enjoy riddling animals with arrows is an unconscionable abuse 
of the wildlife it harbors. Arrows inflict slow, torturous deaths, and no 
animal should be subjected to such a barbaric method of hunting.

MOVING FORWARD ON AIRPORT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A majority of the voters of Orange County recently decided a commercial 
airport at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station is necessary to meet our long-range 
air transportation needs. On Nov. 15, the Board of Supervisors made the correct 
choice to follow the decision of the voters by giving 30-day notice to withdraw 
from the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority as the first step in implementing the 
provisions in Measure A. Its staff was directed to develop plans to change the 
existing structure to conform with the requirements of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors has now regained planning and land use authority for 
the base to be aided by the newly mandated 13-member El Toro Airport Citizens 
Advisory Committee. Five members of the committee will be selected by the 
Orange County League of Cities; another five will be chosen, one from each 
supervisor's district. Since Irvine is in the 4th District and Lake Forest in 
the 3rd District, we suggest their selection by the league as most directly 
impacted cities. The last three members will be drawn from aviation, business, 
labor and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 We assume that the county staff will pass on the knowledge gained so far in 
studies by consultants, and sub-committees to reduce any loss of time in a 
revised plan.

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS; SERVITE VICTORY REVIVES MEMORIES; DIVISION 
V FOOTBALL: FRIARS BEAT EL TORO, 34-19, TO GET BACK INTO THE FINAL, WHICH THEY 
LAST MADE IN 1983. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Servite returned to familiar territory Saturday night. Ancient turf, to be 
sure, but many Friars knew the tale. 
</P>
<P>
 When running back David Bedard shook free of defensive back Keith Yarmchuk and 
sprinted into the end zone, the Friars were back in a Southern Section 
championship game. Bedard's 23-yard run, good for his third touchdown of the 
game, locked up a 34-19 victory over El Toro at Mission Viejo High School and 
put the Friars in next Saturday's Division V title game against top-seeded 
Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars' last appearance in a title game was in 1983, when they defeated La 
Puente Bishop Amat for their second consecutive Division I title. Many of this 
group still remember it, including their coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the stands that night, watching that group," said Coach Larry Toner, 
who was Servite's freshman coach in 1983. "This is great to be back." 
</P>
<P>
 The closest the Friars have been to a title game since then was a semifinal 
appearance in 1988, when they lost to Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just a kid in 1983, but I went to every Servite game," linebacker Tony 
Magliocco said. "My dad played here. I loved the Friars." 
</P>
<P>
 Magliocco was a big reason for the trip down memory lane. 
</P>
<P>
 He blocked Chad Johnson's 24-yard field-goal try early in the second half. The 
ball bounced into the arms of Don Hong, who returned it 67 yards to the El Toro 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Bedard scored the first of his touchdowns, on a two-yard 
run. It gave the Friars a 13-3 lead and the Chargers had to play catch-up the 
rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't easy against a Friar defense that had three consecutive shutouts. 
Servite has lived by its defense in the playoffs; the offense has supplied 
crumbs, scoring only 19 points in two playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense continued to self-destruct in the first half. The Friars ran the 
ball well but stopped themselves with three turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 They were left clinging to a 7-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the second half, the Servite offense showed just how good it could be. 
Running backs chewed up turf behind guards Matt Hawkins (6 feet, 235 pounds) 
and Zack LaMonda (6-2, 240). 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard was the biggest beneficiary and gained 168 yards in 17 carries. Frank 
Patti gained 105. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars finished with 340 yards rushing. Quarterback David Martin threw 
only one pass in the second half. But he scored twice on quarterback sneaks, 
covering 30 and 22 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offense has struggled, but we knew it would get it together," Magliocco 
said. "We have too many good backs. The defense was going to stop them until 
the the offense got going." 
</P>
<P>
 And stop them they did. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro quarterback Brian Wilson was nine of 25 for 117 yards. He had 
completed 55% of his passes this season and 65% in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was harassed by the Friars defensive front, which had four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars needed that defense in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Their streak of 13 quarters without allowing a point came to an end when 
Johnson kicked a 41-yard field goal late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnovers plagued the Friars. Two Martin passes were intercepted and running 
back Marvin Smith fumbled. But the Friar defense would not budge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers had only 62 yards in the first half. Wilson was three of 12 for 
13 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 They did get as far as the Servite 13 late in the second quarter, but the 
Friars stiffened and Johnson's 32-yard field-goal attempt sailed wide right 
with eight seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friar defense bent a little in the fourth quarter, mostly out of fatigue. 
But they were there at the finish as David Watters cradled the ball after 
intercepting a pass on the final play. 
</P>
<P>
 It ended a decade of waiting and brought back a few memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were there in 1983, I think," LaMonda said. "Right? Oh, what do I know, 
I'm only a sophomore."

CLIPPERS FALL IN SHOWDOWN AT THE BOTTOM; PRO BASKETBALL: TIMBERWOLVES, THE 
NEXT-WORST TEAM IN THE NBA, ARE TOO TOUGH FOR 0-15 L.A., 103-95.

<P>
 The NBA season is only a month old, but the Clippers can already start sending 
out invitations to their annual lottery party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers extended their season-opening losing streak to 15 games, falling 
behind by 20 points in the fourth quarter and losing to the Minnesota 
Timberwolves, 103-95, Saturday night before an announced crowd of 6,196 at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me this is not the end of the world, but we can see it from here," Clipper 
rookie center Matt Fish told a radio reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Can it get any worse for the NBA's worst team? 
</P>
<P>
 "To me it was very disappointing because a lot of things we did out on the 
floor go directly back to some of the things that we've spent a lot of time 
on," Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said. "Whether it's lack of poise or lack of 
smarts, we're starting to see a consistent factor of no-brainers by some of the 
same people." 
</P>
<P>
 The game, which matched the NBA's two worst teams, had all the atmosphere of a 
CBA game. The crowd, the Clippers' smallest of the season, booed and mocked the 
home team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports Illustrated and ESPN and all the people who thought this game was like 
Game 7 would not have given it the same coverage if it had been the Knicks or 
Houston in here, and I'm sure Minnesota was well aware of that," Fitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who matched a club record by losing 19 games in a row dating to 
last season, are three losses away from breaking the NBA record for the worst 
start, set when the expansion Miami Heat lost its first 17 games in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got guys on our ballclub that have never won an NBA game," Fitch said. 
"We're seriously trying to get all of them over in the win column." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who trailed by 12 points at the end of the first quarter, 13 at 
halftime and 13 at the end of the third quarter, were outscored, 16-9, in the 
first 4:40 of the final quarter as Minnesota took a 90-70 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But rookie forward Lamond Murray scored 15 of his game-high 23 points in the 
final quarter as the Clippers outscored the Timberwolves, 25-13, in the final 
7:20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a tough loss to take," Murray said. "I don't think it's 
embarrassing. It gets tougher each game that we lose. Each game that we lose it 
gets harder and harder to keep going out there and playing your heart out every 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Christian Laettner had 19 points, 10 rebounds, a season-high six 
steals and five assists as Minnesota won for the third time in 16 games, all on 
the road. Doug West and Isaiah Rider each had 19 points as the Timberwolves won 
their second game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Loy Vaught, who promised to treat the team to a bottle of expensive 
champagne if the Clippers won their first game, scored 20 points, including 10 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers were optimistic before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Harold Ellis, who predicted on the first day of training camp that the 
Clippers wouldn't break the NBA record for most losses in a season, set when 
the Philadelphia 76ers went 9-73 in 1972-73, predicted before the game that the 
Clippers wouldn't break the record for the worst start in league history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to end tonight," Ellis said. "We need this win. This game is like 
the most important game this year for us. Win this game, stuff turns around. 
Lose this game, and it's chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is going to be the night. I can't be like Joe Namath and 
guarantee it." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's a good thing Ellis didn't make any guarantees because the Clippers 
were awful in the first half, falling behind by 18 points in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitch didn't play enigmatic center Elmore Spencer, who lost his starting job 
to Fish nine games into the season. Fitch said he rested Spencer because he had 
back spasms Friday. Fish had a season-high nine rebounds.

FLORIDA TURNS TIDE BY NOT PLAYING SAFE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: STALLINGS' DECISIONS 
SECOND-GUESSED AFTER SPURRIER'S DECEPTION WINS OUT, 24-23, ENDING ALABAMA'S 
TITLE HOPES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, who tinkered with the script? It specifically says that Alabama must win 
all close games, that Florida must gag as if it got a whiff of ammonia, that 
Gene Stallings' conservative coaching style never fails and Steve Spurrier's 
play-calling backfires like your grandmother's Vista Cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Saturday's Southeastern Conference championship game at the Georgia 
Dome ended with a 24-23 Florida victory and for a change of pace, some serious 
postgame second-guessing of Stallings and his fourth-quarter strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, why did Stallings have the Crimson Tide kick an extra point 
rather than try a two-point conversion midway through the final quarter? The 
extra point made it a 23-17 lead. A two-pointer would have forced Florida not 
only to score a touchdown, but also make Spurrier decide between a tie or a 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 And did Stallings put too much faith in senior quarterback Jay Barker, who 
played the entire second half despite a bruised non-throwing shoulder? Barker 
later said the injury bothered him, but not enough to sit out. You decide: 
Barker was six of 10 for 122 yards, one touchdown and one interception in the 
first half and four of nine for 59 yards, no touchdowns and one interception in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
 And anyway, isn't that Stallings' decision, not Barker's? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reasons, No. 3-ranked Alabama (11-1) can forget about a Sugar 
Bowl bid and the national championship chance that came with it. The Crimson 
Tide goes to the Citrus Bowl, while No. 6-ranked Florida (10-1-1) faces Florida 
State in a rematch of their regular-season tie game in New Orleans on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must have just been meant to be," Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Alabama played it safe, Spurrier was pulling out obscure formations used 
by little Emory & Henry College in the 1950s. He ordered lateral passes and 
fake injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Spurrier did, it worked. More important, it worked during the fourth 
quarter, the same quarter in which Florida blew a 28-point lead against Florida 
State last week at Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
 This time there would be no choke. The only gasping heard came from Alabama's 
players, who couldn't believe their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Florida's deciding scoring drive, the Crimson Tide defense saw starting 
quarterback Danny Wuerffel limp gingerly off the field, replaced by Eric 
Kresser. Surely the Gators would play it safe and run some sort of halfback 
plunge while Wuerffel recovered. At least that's what Alabama thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supposed to hop off the field," Wuerffel said. "Did it look good?" 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama was fooled. Kresser, who has the strongest arm on the team, promptly 
dropped back and hit Ike Hilliard for a 25-yard gain to the Alabama 42. In came 
a healthy Wuerffel, the deception complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when you put someone else in, they're a little timid," Wuerffel 
said, explaining the psychology of the play. "You don't expect them to fire it 
downfield." 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, on fourth and one from the Alabama 33, running back Fred 
Taylor squirted forward for two yards. Then the Gators lined up in a split 
formation that saw part of the offensive line go to the right and the other 
part to the left.  
</P>
<P>
 Alabama's players said they were ready for this one, but couldn't stop 
Wuerffel from hitting Reidel Anthony for a nine-yard gain. Second and one at 
the Alabama 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came the lateral pass -- the first time the play had been called all 
season by Spurrier -- from Wuerffel to wide receiver Chris Doering. Doering, a 
former third-string high school quarterback, found Aubrey Hill wide open for a 
20-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Wuerffel hit Doering for a two-yard touchdown on the next play and Judd Davis 
kicked the extra point, leaving Alabama with 5:29 for a game-winning drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crimson Tide never crossed midfield. Barker's pass on fourth and 13 was 
intercepted by safety Eddie Lake. End of threat. End of game. Beginning of 
second-guessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallings wasn't in the defending mood. He said he kicked the extra point 
because he didn't want to risk being beaten by two field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understood that entirely," he said. "I made the decision, how's that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Later, as he left the postgame news conference, he turned to reporters and 
said, "Does anybody want to ask why we went for the extra point? It was the 
right decision at the time. I'd do the same thing again." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Barker, Stallings said he wasn't about to pull the guy who had led the 
Crimson Tide to a 34-1-1 record. And it's probably best not to mention 
Alabama's final drive, if you can call it that. 
</P>
<P>
 All they had to do, kicker Michael Proctor said, was get to the Florida 
40-yard line. Proctor would have done the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kicked a 56-, 57-yarder in practice (the day before)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will ever know now. Nor will the Crimson Tide have a chance for the 
national championship it craved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stinks," guard Jon Stevenson said. "It really stinks."

WHO SHOT KENTUCKY? UCLA'S J.R., OF COURSE; WOODEN CLASSIC: FRESHMAN MAKES TWO 
FREE THROWS IN FINAL SECOND TO BEAT WILDCATS, 82-81.

<P>
 Barely 18 and blase enough about the whole, rowdy scene to sneak a shy smile 
over at his teammates, J.R. Henderson had the game in his hands and a national 
audience waiting to witness. 
</P>
<P>
 In an erratic, frantic game of runs and counterattacks Saturday afternoon, 
UCLA's final push had brought them one point behind Kentucky, 81-80, with 
six-tenths of a second remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Two free throws. One freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought if he does miss, we'll have to kick him off the team or 
something," senior forward Ed O'Bannon said later. "Well, to be honest, I just 
wanted him to be relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 No problem for Henderson, who admits to a personality that does not quite 
crackle with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson flipped the first free throw gently over the front rim, sat through 
Kentucky's ensuing timeout, then swished the second one, giving UCLA an 82-81 
victory before 18,307 at The Pond of Anaheim in the second game of the 
inaugural John R. Wooden Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was as cool as ice," O'Bannon said. "Of course, he really doesn't say much 
anyway. To be honest, I'd have been all shaken up if it was me." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bruins had finally won it, O'Bannon screamed and jumped into center 
George Zidek's arms, and the other Bruins celebrated as if they had won an NCAA 
tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was huge ," O'Bannon said. "We'd been hearing things all week that we 
weren't good enough, that we didn't have enough heart to beat Kentucky. That 
kind of takes a toll. When it was over, it was like a huge sigh of relief." 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson's heroics capped a sloppy but tension-filled game between two 
top-five teams. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 UCLA (2-0) and No. 3 Kentucky (2-1) had not played each other since 
Wooden coached his final game 20 years ago, and in the first half both squads 
played as if they were running on excess adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
 But with O'Bannon, who led all scorers with 26 points (17 in the second half) 
and Wildcat forward Rodrick Rhodes, who scored 12 of his team-leading 16 points 
in the second, upping their level of play, the second half was a showcase for 
two teams that hope to be playing deep into March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the execution wasn't tournament-caliber," Kentucky Coach Rick 
Pitino said, "but the intensity certainly was." 
</P>
<P>
 When Rhodes and backup guard Jeff Sheppard (14 points) led Kentucky on a 17-3 
run midway through the second half, giving the Wildcats a 10-point lead with 
10:12 to play, UCLA appeared ready to give way. 
</P>
<P>
 During the run, sophomore forward Charles O'Bannon, guarding Rhodes, picked up 
his fourth foul, then quickly, his fifth, with 11:33 to play, before UCLA Coach 
Jim Harrick could get his older brother, Ed, into the game to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson, who ended up with 10 points, four rebounds and two assists, played 
the rest of the game at Charles O'Bannon's small forward spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came in, what I was really thinking about was Rhodes -- what am I 
going to do?" Henderson said. "My teammates created a couple of turnovers that 
saved me from playing him some, and I felt I did a pretty good job on him." 
</P>
<P>
 With Kentucky ahead by eight and less than five minutes left, Harrick said he 
told his team it could win the game only by stopping Kentucky's offense. The 
Bruins responded by forcing turnovers on three of the Wildcats' final six 
possessions and holding Kentucky to four points in the final 4:18. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's offense also revved up late, scoring on its last six possessions, 
mostly off dribble penetration by guards Tyus Edney and Cameron Dollar. In that 
span, Zidek had one of the best stretches of his college career, scoring seven 
of UCLA's final 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Zidek had 16 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a big lead with 10 minutes, we needed to stay with the defensive 
intensity that got us that lead," Pitino said. "And we did not." 
</P>
<P>
 The final moments were set up by UCLA's trap defense, when Marquis Burns and 
Henderson forced Rhodes, deep in his backcourt, to fire a pass that caromed off 
of the knee of Mark Pope and out of bounds, giving UCLA the ball with 16.5 
seconds remaining and Kentucky up by one. 
</P>
<P>
 With time running down, Edney said he knew he had to beat his man off the 
dribble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw an opening," Edney said, "and I saw J.R. behind his defender, and I 
knew either I was going to get an open shot or I had a dish." 
</P>
<P>
 Edney drew Rhodes, then passed to Henderson, who was fouled by Walter McCarty 
going for a slam. 
</P>
<P>
 Two free throws. One freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 On the sideline, assistant coach Mark Gottfried told Harrick that it reminded 
him of the time freshman Tracy Murray made two free throws to beat Kansas to 
put UCLA into the Sweet 16 in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Harrick admitted: "I didn't think J.R.'s as good a shooter as Murray 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 For all that mattered Saturday, he was. 
</P>

GOING 55, HART CAN'T BE CAUGHT; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: QUARTZ HILL MAKES AN 
EARLY RUN BUT IS UNABLE TO KEEP UP IN DIVISION II SEMIFINALS. 
</P>

<P>
 Are you listening, Antelope Valley? 
</P>
<P>
 Hart High sent a message to its opponent in this week's Southern Section 
Division II championship game by blasting Quartz Hill, 55-23, in a semifinal 
game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians (13-0) scored a touchdown on eight of their first nine 
possessions, including five in a row in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're just clicking big-time," said Hart running back Ted Iacenda, 
who scored four touchdowns, giving him 40 for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Indians Coach Mike Herrington: "We just hope we don't slow down." 
</P>
<P>
 Can anyone slow down the Indians' complex one-back offense? 
</P>
<P>
 Hart has scored 106 points in its last two games. The Indians rolled up 348 
yards and six touchdowns in the first half against the Rebels (7-4-2). 
</P>
<P>
 After Hart's final touchdown, early in the fourth quarter, the contingent of 
Antelope Valley players watching the game from the stands (the Antelopes won 
their semifinal Friday night) left en masse. 
</P>
<P>
 Were they impressed? 
</P>
<P>
 "They look pretty big up front," Antelope Valley's Justin Reinier said while 
walking out of the stadium. "But I think we have them outspeeded. Hart will go 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 A more-objective source was Quartz Hill quarterback Damein Kendrid, because he 
has faced both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're pretty evenly matched," he said. "It should be a good game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just a great team. It's hard. They've got a lot of good athletes. I'm 
glad we didn't give up. We played our hearts out." 
</P>
<P>
 The final will be held Friday night at College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a tough opponent (next week)," Herrington said. "I said at the 
beginning of the playoffs, 'Hey, AV could be the toughest team in the 
tournament.' They were awesome (Friday night in their 28-0 victory over 
Peninsula) against a very good team." 
</P>
<P>
 This will be Herrington's first trip to a Southern Section final as a head 
coach. Hart won Southern Section titles in 1983 and 1986 when Herrington was an 
assistant coach for the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill's hopes of upsetting its third consecutive playoff opponent were 
quashed in the nightmarish first half. 
</P>
<P>
 In what turned out to be a harbinger, Iacenda scored on a 49-yard pass play 
from quarterback Steve McKeon on the game's first play from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a brief interlude. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill scored the next 10 points and actually led, 10-7, at the end of 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels evened the score, 7-7, on an 80-yard touchdown pass play from 
Kendrid to James Welch, and McKeon threw a wobbly interception to Monte Reed 
three plays later. A 29-yard field goal by Jeff Diamond gave the Rebels their 
high-water mark. 
</P>
<P>
 That vanished during Hart's second-quarter onslaught -- three touchdown runs 
by Iacenda and one by J.B. Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill did manage another 80-yard touchdown pass play, from Kendrid to 
Charlie Abbott on a flea flicker. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hart scored on its lone possession of the third quarter and on came the 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendrid also scored on a 90-yard pass play from backup quarterback Brian 
Woodworth in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kendrid completed six of 16 passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns in 
addition to throwing an interception. He also caught three passes for 142 yards 
after switching to wide receiver in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda finished with 107 yards in 15 carries, with 105 of the yards coming in 
the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were going to come in all fired up," Iacenda said. "We knew not 
to look past them. We were not going to go out like that." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon completed 10 of 14 passes for 231 yards and three touchdowns.

TENNIS / DAVIS CUP FINAL; SWEDES DOUBLE UP TO WIN TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These are heady days for Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman. 
</P>
<P>
 And, thanks to them, these are days of newfound glory for Swedish tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two weeks after winning the ATP World Doubles Championship in 
Jakarta, Indonesia, Apell and Bjorkman teamed Saturday to defeat their Russian 
rivals in a five-set thriller and clinch the Davis Cup for Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 6-7 (7-4), 6-2, 6-3, 1-6, 8-6 victory here over Yevgeny Kafelnikov and 
Andrei Olhovskiy gave Sweden an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the best-of-five final. 
This is Sweden's fifth Davis Cup title, its first in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot of fun to win in Jakarta last week, but this is really 
something," said Apell, beaming beside his partner. "This is bigger, with the 
team and everything. After all, we play for Sweden." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden had a golden era of tennis in the 1970s and '80s. Bjorn Borg led a 
Davis Cup winner in 1975. Mats Wilander and Stefan Edberg starred on the 
championship teams of 1984, 1985 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Apell, 25, and Bjorkman, 22, were boys when Sweden upset the United States in 
the 1984 final -- the event that fed their fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 They became doubles partners two years ago and were invited only this year, 
along with 24-year-old Magnus Larsson, to join Edberg, who is now 28 and 
addressed as "father" on the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 All four players shared in the victories over Russia, none of them easy. 
Edberg and Larsson won five-set contests Friday from Alexander Volkov and 
Kafelnikov before a raucous Russian crowd in the Olympic Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a great memory for me," Edberg said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was even sweeter for John Anders Sjogren, the retiring Swedish captain 
whose first Davis Cup squad lost the 1989 final to Boris Becker and West 
Germany. Until this year, Sjogren's teams had come no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a classic Swedish team, with team spirit," he said after his players 
tossed him in the air Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-handed Apell and right-handed Bjorkman had won the doubles in the 
team's earlier Davis Cup rounds against Denmark, France and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored to win here, they outserved the Russians (11 aces and service winners 
to seven) and won more points (32-15) at the net. But the match could have gone 
either way. 
</P>
<P>
 Kafelnikov, Russia's top player, played brilliantly, even after exhausting 
himself Friday and hurting his left wrist in a fall. The Swedes tried to keep 
the ball from him, but he scored often with sharp service returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden held every service until the fourth set. Then the Russians broke 
Bjorkman twice and evened the match. 
</P>
<P>
 With the decisive set tied at two games apiece and 10,000 spectators roaring, 
Russia blew the advantage three times; Apell held service when Olhovskiy 
volleyed into the net and, on the next point, Bjorkman landed a smash at 
Kafelnikov's feet. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the point, Apell said, when Russia's momentum stopped. Each side held 
service until the end, when Olhovskiy double faulted to set up match point, and 
Kafelnikov's easy forehand from the net went wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to play in a crowded stadium where everyone wants you to win," 
Kafelnikov, 20, said afterward. "That was huge psychological pressure for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sjogren had another explanation for his team's victory. "Apell and Bjorkman 
did a great job," he said. "They were very hungry."

NBA ROUNDUP; HAWKS END MAGIC STREAK AT NINE GAMES, 107-105 
</P>

<P>
 Jon Koncak made a tiebreaking free throw with 32 seconds to play and forced a 
key turnover 25 seconds later and the Atlanta Hawks defeated Orlando, 107-105, 
Saturday night at Atlanta, ending the Magic's nine-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal had 27 points and 15 rebounds, but his foul sent Koncak to 
the line after Stacey Augmon made a 12-foot jumper to pull the Hawks even at 
105-105. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember, this Jon Koncak is the greatest defensive player in the world. He 
never fouled me once," O'Neal said after the game, expressing a little 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Koncak pressured Brian Shaw into losing the ball out of bounds with seven 
seconds to play, and the Magic fouled Mookie Blaylock with five seconds left. 
He made one of two free throws before Nick Anderson missed a three-point shot 
at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Augmon led the Hawks with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 111, Washington 95 -- Routed by the Magic the night before, the 
Knicks got 23 points from Charles Smith and romped at New York against another 
young team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets have lost six of seven games and are 1-4 with Chris Webber, who 
was acquired Nov. 17 from the Golden State Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 125, Boston 109 -- Scottie Pippen scored 26 points to lead the Bulls 
at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen, who scored nine points on four-of-14 shooting in Friday's loss to the 
Hawks -- his first single-digit game since the 1992-93 finale -- made 11 of 15 
shots against the Celtics and held Dominique Wilkins to 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 112, Dallas 87 -- Antoine Carr came off the bench to score a season-high 
22 points and Karl Malone added 21 at Dallas as the Jazz increased its winning 
streak over the Mavericks to 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks haven't beaten the Jazz since Nov. 23, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 83, Cleveland 78 -- Clarence Weatherspoon scored 23 points at 
Cleveland to help the 76ers end the Cavaliers' four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The 76ers, who had lost 13 in a row to the Cavaliers, made only 43% of their 
shots and were outrebounded, 59-31, but the Cavaliers made a season-low 32% of 
their shots and only 61% of their free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 94, New Jersey 89 -- Mitch Richmond scored 31 points and Walt 
Williams had 29 at East Rutherford, N.J., as the Kings handed the Nets their 
fourth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings are 7-7, their best start since 1982-83, when they played in Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 107, Phoenix 97 -- Joe Dumars scored 17 points and Grant Hill and Mark 
Macon led an 11-0 third-quarter run that lifted the Pistons at Auburn Hills, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons had maintained a 10-point halftime lead through most of the third 
quarter before Hill began the burst with a dunk and a layup and Macon made a 
pair of three-point shots to make the score 87-66. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 118, Golden State 107 -- Reggie Miller scored 33 points and Mark 
Jackson had 22 to lead the Pacers at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors made a season-high 27 turnovers in losing for the sixth time in 
seven games. Rony Seikaly led the Warriors with 24 points and Chris Gatling had 
21. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 111, Milwaukee 108 -- Shawn Kemp had 26 points and 15 rebounds and 
Kendall Gill had a season-high 24 points to lead the SuperSonics at Tacoma, 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill and Sam Perkins made one free throw each with 15 and 12 seconds to play 
for a three-point lead, and the Bucks were unable to get off a shot before the 
end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 99, Charlotte 88 -- Rodney Rogers and Bryant Stith each scored 17 
points, including key baskets during a 24-9 run in the third quarter, to lead 
the Nuggets at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Dikembe Mutombo had 22 rebounds for the Nuggets.

NCAA SOCCER; TOP-RANKED INDIANA CHALLENGES TITANS FOR FINAL FOUR BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Only two teams have a chance to return to the final four of NCAA men's soccer 
next week at Davidson, N.C., for the second consecutive time.  
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton (14-6-2) is one and defending three-time national champion 
Virginia is the other. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, however, will face a big hurdle today when they play top-ranked 
Indiana (21-2) on the Hoosiers' home field in an 11 a.m. (PST) quarterfinal 
match. One of Indiana's two losses was to Fullerton, 3-2 in overtime, in the 
UCLA MetLife tournament in late October. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton has made arrangements for the game to be broadcast live on 
KMNY radio (AM 1600). Rick Davis, coach and general manager of the Salsa, will 
be one of the announcers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton has won two consecutive playoff games in overtime, stopping San 
Diego and San Francisco on the Titans' home field. The Titans haven't been 
beaten in seven games. Fullerton's 4-3 overtime victory over UC Irvine started 
the Titans on a roll that includes only one tie, 2-2, against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 The game shapes up as a battle between Fullerton's strong offense against 
Indiana's formidable defense. Fullerton has scored 13 goals in its last four 
games; the Hoosiers have given up only 10 in 23 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Soto and Matt Bradbury lead the Titans. Soto has scored 11 goals in the 
last eight games, and Bradbury has six in the last four. Soto now holds the 
school records for goals and points in a career as well as a single season. LON

COMMENTARY; NOTRE DAME GETS ITS WAY AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the end of one of its most glorious seasons, college football again is the 
burlesque of major sports. There is something known as the Bowl Coalition and 
it was supposed to clean up the way bowl bids were handed out and back-room 
deals between bowls and schools were made. It also was supposed to reward the 
most deserving teams, maybe even settle a national championship on the field 
once in a while. It does none of that in its last year, before it gives way to 
next year's miracle cure for college football, known as the Bowl Alliance. The 
coalition is a failure, run by greedy bums. Sometimes they look like the 
overflow from boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 As we approach another college football postseason that could be a waste of 
time, with sportswriters and coaches settling the national championship instead 
of Nebraska settling it against Penn State, it is reassuring that the tradition 
of greed holds. It is why a mediocre team such as Notre Dame gets a spot in the 
Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 2 when it does not deserve to be anywhere near a major bowl 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The best Notre Dame can do in any poll with its 6-4-1 record is No.26. Notre 
Dame really is lucky to be ranked that high. It does not stop it from going to 
the Fiesta Bowl and making $3.2 million to play Colorado. A few weeks ago, 
Notre Dame coach Lou Holtz said he would be embarrassed to go to a bowl game 
with his team's record. Then the Fiesta Bowl waved all that money at him. You 
wave money at Notre Dame, it will offer to turn the fight song into rap. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame is college football's version of the 51st state. The Fighting Irish 
even have state-run television, NBC Sports in this case. NBC Sports televises 
Notre Dame home games. It also gets ready to televise the Fiesta Bowl for the 
last time. Next year, the game moves to CBS, so there is absolutely no love 
lost between NBC and the Fiesta Bowl, even if selecting Notre Dame looks like a 
cheap ratings grab. The bums from the Fiesta Bowl made the call here, but NBC 
never complains when it ends up in another sweaty embrace with the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame makes a big score on its name, not on merit. This is a season when 
Holtz disgraced himself by running up the score against Navy, when his team's 
most impressive victory might have come against that powerhouse from Air Force. 
Even at the end, the best Notre Dame could do against a USC team it had beaten 
11 straight times was a tie. Now Holtz says his team was a few good kicks away 
from being 10-1. He sounds like the beery fan at the end of the bar with the 
leprechaun on his T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deserve to go (to the Fiesta) off our play for the last four games," Holtz 
says in the newspapers and on television. 
</P>
<P>
 All the other teams have to prove themselves over the season. The rules are 
different for Notre Dame teams, even those punched out by half its opponents. 
All the Irish have to do now is show signs of life at the finish. And here is 
what passes for a real big finish now in South Bend: wins over Navy and Air 
Force, a loss to Florida State, a tie against USC. Earlier in the season, 
Boston College pushed Notre Dame around the way it would push around a 
high-school team. "Manhandled" is the word Holtz himself used. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College goes to the Aloha Bowl Christmas Day. Its opponent is Kansas 
State, which is one of the great stories of college football this season, a 
nowhere program that can now play with anybody. Kansas State's only losses were 
to Nebraska (17-6) and Colorado (35-21), two of the best teams in the country. 
KSU was down one point to Nebraska with 11 minutes to go and was 21-21 in the 
fourth quarter with Colorado before blowing a terrific chance at the goal line 
to take the lead. Coach Bill Snyder's players ended up with a record of 9-2 
anyway, and are currently ranked No.8 in the coaches' poll. They are so much 
more deserving of a major bowl than Notre Dame it is a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Notre Dame decided to go to the Fiesta Bowl, it set off a chain reaction 
that knocked Kansas State out of either the Cotton Bowl or the Sun Bowl. So 
Kansas State gets $750,000 to play in the Aloha Bowl. But the Aloha doesn't pay 
expenses, which means the school might lose money by the time it flies 
everybody to Hawaii. It sure doesn't get $3 million from the Cotton Bowl, and 
that is a shame because this is a wonderful program all of a sudden under 
Snyder. But it is not a television program, the way Notre Dame is. It is not 
close to being the kind of draw Notre Dame is, because no one really is. Kansas 
State goes to the Aloha Bowl and, by the time the showcase games are played on 
Jan. 2, Snyder's players will have gone home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a product of a system that doesn't seem to work very well," Snyder said 
from his office in Manhattan, Kan. "I'm angry about the treatment we've gotten, 
my players are angry, our fans are angry. But our problem is a problem you run 
into a lot at this time of year: You don't know where to vent your anger. There 
isn't an individual or an institution who really seems to be in charge. You 
just hold it in."

HE CAN'T HEAR, BARELY SEES BUT KICKS ARMY OVER NAVY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The goal posts looked like fuzzy toothpicks to Kurt Heiss, and he couldn't 
hear the 65,000 fans cheering and jeering at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Deprived of sight and sound, Heiss was calm as he kicked the longest field 
goal of his career, a 52-yarder that gave Army a 22-20 victory over Navy on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Heiss, a senior whose previous best was a 37-yard field goal, said astigmatism 
left him with 20-5,000 vision in his right eye and 20-800 in his left eye. 
</P>
<P>
 From about 40 yards out, Heiss said the goal posts "are really blurry. Where 
the ball comes down, whether it crosses the crossbar or not, I can't really 
tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the winning kick, he said: "I didn't realize it was good until my team 
mobbed me." 
</P>
<P>
 This was the third consecutive Army-Navy game decided by a field goal. Last 
season, Navy's Ryan Bucchianeri missed an 18-yarder with six seconds left, 
giving Army a 16-14 victory. Bucchianeri missed a 37-yard field-goal try 
Saturday on Navy's first possession. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Army's Patmon Malcom kicked a 49-yard field goal with 12 seconds to 
play to give the Cadets a 25-24 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's loss was the Midshipmen's third in a row in the series, and fourth 
in five years. Jim Kubiak leaves Navy as the school's career passing leader, 
but is 1-3 against Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Kubiak was 24 of 34 for 361 yards and two touchdowns, but threw three 
interceptions. In the third quarter, Navy led, 20-19, and was driving for 
another score when Army's Darren Klein intercepted a Kubiak pass at the Army 
two. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Ronnie McAda rushed for 126 yards as Army (4-7) won by running up 
the middle against the Navy (3-8) defense. The Cadets ran for 373 yards in 68 
carries.

 The UCLA and USC women's volleyball teams each won home matches Saturday in 
the second round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>

10 kills against Georgia Tech (26-9). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 USC defeated No. 19 New Mexico, 15-13, 15-4, 15-6, behind a powerful 
performance by Meika Wagner at the Lyon Center. Wagner had 17 kills and hit

GOLFING TIGER AT REST; STANFORD'S WOODS SLOWS THE PACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE M. PETERSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Tiger Woods takes his much-needed break from golf, he won't be watching 
any television. The 18-year-old Stanford freshman says he doesn't own a TV for 
the same reason he's temporarily retreating from his sport. 
</P>
<P>
 School comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't bring a TV because I would watch all the time and I wouldn't study," 
said Woods, revealing his "just a teen-ager" side. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, the youngest player and the only black to win the U.S. Amateur, says he 
needs a rest from golf -- and all the attention he generates -- until Stanford 
resumes tournament play in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods knows his accomplishments on the golf course put him in the spotlight, 
and it means he must grant countless interviews and make numerous public 
appearances. It's a necessary evil to a point, he notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually I take a break after the summer, but I couldn't do that because of 
college golf," he said. "So I'm taking my break now." 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanford, Woods says he's just another freshman. He lives in a dormitory, 
the only one on campus that hasn't been renovated. He says the dorms aren't 
fitted for cable, another reason his room doesn't include a TV. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes classes in civics, computers and "Portuguese Cultural Perspectives." 
And, of course, he hangs out with his dormmates and the other friends he's 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll let loose at parties," he said with a smile. But when asked how, he 
replied: "I can't tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods spent the summer before his first year of college gaining tournament 
wins at the Western Amateur, the Southern California Amateur and the Pacific 
Northwest Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was his stunning U.S. Amateur win in August at the TPC Sawgrass Stadium 
Course at Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., that gained Woods the most recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 The lanky 6-foot-1, 150-pound teen-ager was down by six holes after 13 holes 
of the 36-hole final, but came back to win over Trip Kuehne of Oklahoma State. 
</P>
<P>
 He won his first collegiate tournament, the Tucker Invitational at the 
University of New Mexico, by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Woods played on the U.S. Team that won the World Amateur 
Championships in Versailles, France. He also won the Jerry Pate National 
Intercollegiate tournament at Shoal Creek in Birmingham, Ala. His victory made 
him 2-3 in college play. Stanford won the team title at the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent interview at Stanford, Woods said he did not want to discuss 
his experience at Shoal Creek, which once vowed never to accept black members. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods is unfailingly honest. If there's a question he doesn't want to answer, 
or a topic he wants to avoid, he says so. There's no dancing around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I got to know his mom and dad I felt there's got to be an exceptional 
kid here, and there is," said Stanford coach Wally Goodwin. "If you were up 
here and saw him on a day-to-day basis, you would see he's remarkable with 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, along with the rest of his teammates, won't resurface until February 
when the Stanford team travels to the Big Island Invitational in Hilo, Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has four of five starters returning this year from the team that 
captured the 1994 NCAA men's title. Goodwin said the Cardinal has a good shot 
at repeating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our strength is I've got five relentless guys ... They're proficient, 
focused, yet loveable guys. It's a very interesting combination," Goodwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, meanwhile, seems out to prove he's not only an exceptional golfer, but 
also a regular, well-adjusted guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very mellow. I'm not a guy who has a lot of mood swings -- peaks and 
valleys -- I'm pretty stable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And his goals? Once again, that subject is taboo. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goals are my goals," he said.

 Newhall Hart scored a touchdown on eight of its first nine possessions, 
including five in a row in the second quarter, to defeat Quartz Hill, 55-23, 
Saturday in a Southern Section Division II semifinal game at Quartz Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart running back Ted Iacenda scored four touchdowns, giving him 40 this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians (13-0) rolled up 348 yards and six touchdowns in the first half, 
ending Quartz Hill's hopes of upsetting its third straight playoff opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels finished 7-4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Chino Hills Ayala 29, Diamond Bar 21 -- With Ayala trailing, 21-20, junior 
running back Jimmy Lejay scored on a 37-yard pass play from quarterback Steve 
Brinbaum to cap a nine play, 74-yard drive to give the Bulldogs (12-1) the lead 
for good. They play Sherman Oaks Notre Dame in the Division III final. 
</P>
<P>
 Brinbaum completed 10 of 19 passes for 215 yards and three touchdowns, and 
receiver Julius Taino caught six passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns for 
Ayala. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar (8-4) trailed early, 14-0, but got back into the game on the 
passing of senior quarterback Eric Stidham, who had two second-quarter 
touchdown passes, including a 59-yard play to receiver Lathiam Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
 Norco 20, Corona 0 -- Norco held Corona to nine yards of offense in the first 
half as it built a 20-0 lead in a Division IV semifinal at Corona High. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Whieldon threw two touchdown passes in the first half to lead Norco 
(11-2) to its second consecutive championship. Sean Hansen and Mike McCaskell 
led the Cougars' defense with two sacks each. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona, outgained on offense, 327 to 141, finished 9-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Servite 34, Lake Forest El Toro 19 -- David Bedard rushed for 168 
yards and three touchdowns and Frank Patti gained 105 yards in a Division V 
semifinal at Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite, which won back-to-back Division I titles in 1982-83, will play 
Newport Harbor on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Friars' offense that got them to the final. They had scored only 19 
points in two playoff games but finally broke loose in the second half. They 
finished with 340 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard scored on runs of two, 39 and 23 yards. His last touchdown, with 48 
seconds left, clinched the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite's defense, which had three consecutive shutouts, was strong again in 
the first half. The Friars allowed only 62 yards in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ontario Chaffey 21, Rancho Cucamonga 3 -- Joe Williams' 54-yard touchdown 
reception on a deflected pass in the first quarter was all the scoring Chaffey 
(12-1) needed in a Division VI semifinal at Chaffey College. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffey, third-place finisher in the Mt. Baldy League, will play Atla Loma, 
Mt. Baldy League champion, for the divisional title Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga finished 11-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai Nordhoff 30, Santa Ynez 19 -- On first and 10 at the Ranger 12-yard line, 
running back Josh Hawkins broke through the left side of the line and took off 
on an 88-yard touchdown run in a Division IX semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 The play was wiped out because of a holding call on Nordhoff, but Hawkins did 
the same thing two plays later to give the Rangers (10-3) a 16-0 lead before 
4,000 at Nordhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ynez finishes 11-2. KENNEDY COSGROVE and WILL ETHERIDGE and RICHARD

STATE GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; OILERS LOSE MOMENTUM IN FINAL; DIVISION 
II: HUNTINGTON BEACH STRUGGLES AFTER TAKING FIRST GAME, AND ST. FRANCIS WINS 
ITS SECOND CHAMPIONSHIP IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli knew his team had to play aggressively 
Saturday if it was to be successful in the State Division II girls' volleyball 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers started out that way. But unfortunately for Ciarelli, they couldn't 
maintain it, and defending champion Mountain View St. Francis went on to a 
10-15, 15-9, 15-11, 15-11 victory at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the first game, the Oilers struggled the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got outplayed," Ciarelli said. "They were much more aggressive. I didn't 
have (my team) ready to play aggressively." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach took a 6-1 lead on three aces by senior Jennifer Oslin before 
St. Francis (38-3) pulled even behind a kill and two blocks by Elizabeth Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior middle blocker Melissa Wendt carried the Oilers the rest of the game, 
with seven kills, as Huntington Beach fell behind, 9-7, before a 6-0 run put 
the game out of reach. Back-to-back kills by sophomore Dana Atkinson and Wendt 
finished it for the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior outside hitter Jamey Scritchfield led the Lancers in Game 2, with six 
kills and an ace as the Lancers tied the match. Trailing, 4-3, St. Francis ran 
off 12 of the final 17 points, including the last six. Megan O'Brien had four 
kills in the game for the Lancers. Junior Jill Meyers had three kills and two 
blocks for Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis took a 13-6 lead in the third game before Huntington Beach 
rallied. The Oilers pulled to within 14-11 before Shelly Glennon's third kill 
of the game ended it. Wendt had eight kills for the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just picked it up a little, and we didn't," Wendt said. "We never really 
got in our rhythm. I don't think we were playing our best." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach fell behind, 5-0, and trailed, 7-3, in the fourth game before 
making its final run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers took advantage of eight St. Francis errors to tie it, 10-10. But 
the Lancers scored the last three points, including an O'Brien kill that 
clinched a second consecutive State title. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one was a lot easier in terms of pressure," St. Francis Coach Dave 
Gambelin said. "Our experience helped us a lot. It made a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendt had a game-high 23 kills, and 13 digs. Meyers had 10 kills and Mindy 
Adam added 27 assists and 15 digs for Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien had 21 kills and 17 digs, Scritchfield 13 kills and 14 digs and Jones 
11 kills and 10 digs for St. Francis.

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS; LAGUNA HILLS STAYS CLOSE BUT WINDS UP 
LOSING TO BLOOMINGTON; DIVISION VIII: THE HAWKS EXTEND BRUINS INTO THE FOURTH 
QUARTER BEFORE FALLING, 34-21. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Laguna Hills Hawks met up with the irresistible force known as Bloomington 
High and held the Bruins better than any of their previous 12 opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't enough to win the game. Despite holding the Bruins 32 points 
below their average, the Hawks fell, 34-21, in the Division VIII semifinals 
before an estimated crowd of 7,000 at Colton High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington will face La Mirada in the title game next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills (10-3) will take little solace in the fact that they made the 
13-0 Bruins sweat out a victory for the first time this season. Most 
Bloomington games have been over by the first quarter; Saturday night they 
would need all four to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the best and most physical defense we've seen," said Bloomington 
running back Greg Oliver, who led all rushers with 197 yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 28-21 when the Bruins, on fourth and inches from their own 20, clinched 
the victory on Oliver's 80-yard gallop with 7:14 left to play. Clearing the 
lane for Oliver was fullback Cheyane Caldwell, who added 161 yards in 16 
carries and scored once. 
</P>
<P>
 "They ran some things we hadn't seen before," said Laguna Hills Coach Steve 
Bresnahan. "I thought we adjusted pretty good by the second quarter. But they 
made big plays when they had to, including that last touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins needed 27 points to better the national single-season scoring 
record of 824 set by Big Sandy (Tex.) High in 1975. They got it with 43 seconds 
left in the third quarter, on David Smith's 19-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't start out as a fun week for the Hawks' staff as they tried to find 
ways to stop Bloomington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever we asked other schools for film and told them we were playing 
Bloomington," assistant coach Marty Spaulding said, "they looked at us as if we 
had just run over their dog." 
</P>
<P>
 The inference was clear to Spaulding; whoever stood in front the point-hungry 
Bruins was sure to be thrashed, and possibly embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 But that did not happen to Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington broke out to a 14-0 first-quarter lead on touchdown runs of 25 and 
28 yards by Oliver and Caldwell, and a rout seemed imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks shook off the mesmerizing effect of the Bruins' double wing-T 
offense, however, to make a game of it. McGraw, who had only three net yards in 
his first six carries, broke loose for a 63-yard touchdown run around the left 
side. And Corey Pardoe, who threw for 120 yards but completed only five passes, 
found Jeff Gahagan for a 15-yard scoring pass with 42 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even when Bloomington made mistakes they worked in the Bruins' favor. 
After McGraw's touchdown romp, Caldwell broke free for 73 yards from the 
Bloomington 20 to the Laguna Hills seven. A penalty took them out to the 19, 
and on a third-and-15 play, Adam Rodriguez sprinted for 12 yards but fumbled at 
the three. Buell picked up the ball and ran into the end zone.

STATE GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; DIVISION IV; CALVARY CHAPEL SETTLES DEBT 
WITH A TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After waiting a year for a second chance, Calvary Chapel didn't waste any time 
putting away its opponent in the Division IV State championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 It took about an hour for Calvary Chapel to defeat Orinda Miramonte, 15-6, 
15-5, 15-2, at Cal State Fullerton Saturday and win the school's first State 
championship in girls' volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' victory equaled the most lopsided margin of victory in a State 
Division IV title match. In 1992, Ojai Nordhoff defeated Forestville Molino, 
15-2, 15-7, 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel's Courtney Owens, the Division IV tournament MVP, led a 
balanced attack with 15 kills, Jenny Roberts added 11 and Lynn Lovingier had 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Calvary Chapel (20-4) lost to San Jose Archbishop Mitty in four 
games in the State Division IV title match. 
</P>
<P>
 "This feels a lot better than last year," said Owens, a 5-foot-9 senior who 
has orally committed to Colorado. "We knew this was our year. It was now or 
never." 
</P>
<P>
 Miramonte (22-5) had never seen a team of Calvary Chapel's caliber. Although 
the Matadors had four starters 6 feet or taller, they couldn't take advantage 
at the net because of poor ball control. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the toughest team we've played by a longshot," Miramonte Coach Leslie 
McKinley said. "Our passing wasn't there, but that's partly because their 
serving was so strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel's toughest server was Lovingier, a 5-10 senior who has orally 
committed to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 She served four consecutive points, including two aces, to help the Eagles 
take a 12-4 lead in Game 1. In Game 2, Lovingier and Jenny Roberts, a 6-foot 
junior, took over after Miramonte took a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sara Roberts (nine kills, nine digs) spiked from the left side for side 
out, Lovingier served six consecutive points. Jenny Roberts had two blocks and 
a kill during the run and Lovingier had two aces. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens, who also had 10 digs, opened the floodgates with three consecutive 
kills, then another kill by Lovingier gave the Eagles an 11-3 lead in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played in spurts early," Calvary Chapel Coach Jim Downey said. "But in the 
third game, the kids just played hard and took off." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles scored 14 of the first 15 points in Game 3. After Jenny Roberts 
spiked from the middle for a side out, her older sister, Sara, spiked off the 
block for match point.

STATE GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; NEWPORT HARBOR DOESN'T LET IT SLIP AWAY 
THIS TIME; DIVISION I: SAILORS TAKE A FIRM HOLD ON STATE TITLE FROM THE START, 
DEFEATING STOCKTON ST. MARY'S, 15-4, 16-14, 15-10.

 It was the perfect ending to an almost perfect season. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long rally in which Newport Harbor's Misty May had three digs, 
teammate Melissa Schutz spiked a free ball at the net to give the Sailors a 
15-4, 16-14, 15-10 victory over Stockton St. Mary's in the State Division I 
girls' volleyball championship Saturday at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Four-year starters May, who had 21 kills, and Schutz, who had 11, led Newport 
Harbor (33-1) to its first State Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't sunk in yet," Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn said. "The kids have 
done a great job of staying focused all season and they picked it up in the 
playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Sailors lost a heartbreaker to Corona del Mar in the Division 
I final, 16-14, 15-8, 16-18, 9-15, 15-10. The victory helped Corona del Mar 
earn a mythical national championship, finishing the season ranked No. 1 in the 
nation in a USA Today poll. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defeat taught the Sailors a valuable lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think you need to experience tough losses to make you a better 
player," Glenn said. "This team has had some tough defeats, but that experience 
showed this whole season." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor entered Saturday's match ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA 
Today and Volleyball Monthly. And the Sailors made sure there would be no 
repeat of last year's final performance. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start, Newport Harbor closed out Game 1 with junior setter Jenny 
Hecker, who had 33 assists and 11 digs, serving for 10 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 2, St. Mary's (35-5) rallied from a six-point deficit to take a 13-11 
lead, then Newport Harbor's seniors took charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Osborne's service winner and kills by Schutz and May put the Sailors 
ahead, 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Although St. Mary's drew even at 14-14, the Sailors pulled it out after a kill 
by May, a St. Mary's error and another kill by senior Sara Fairborn, who had 
five kills and nine digs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 5, Newport Harbor took a 13-3 lead. Senior Tina Bowman, who had two 
kills and two blocks, spiked from the middle to give the Sailors a side out at 
13-10 to set up the final point-scoring kills by Schutz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to let it slip through our fingers again," May said. "We knew 
we had to get them right from the start." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mary's Coach Kathy Hardigan thought May made the difference in the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "They set Misty 50 times tonight," Hardigan said. "And if you get her up and 
going and she's on . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 May has terrorized Orange County coaches for the last four seasons, but she 
will move on to Long Beach State next season. Schutz has orally committed to 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The only blemish on Newport Harbor's record was a loss to San Jose Archbishop 
Mitty, the State Division III champion, in the Santa Barbara tournament Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors played the match without Jenny Hecker. But with Hecker, they 
marched through the section Division I playoffs, sweeping Manhattan Beach Mira 
Costa in the final Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors continued their hot play in the State tournament, losing only one 
of 13 games.

USC RALLY COMES UP SHORT AT BUZZER; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: PARKER'S HALFTIME 
'TALK' INSPIRES TROJANS, BUT LAST-GASP SHOT TO TIE MISSES AND UTAH WINS, 72-70. 
</P>

<P>
 The growing pains continued for USC basketball Saturday in a dramatic 72-70 
loss to Utah at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 After spotting the Utes an 11-point halftime lead, USC rallied in the second 
half, only to have Brandon Martin miss a potential game-tying jumper from just 
inside the three-point line at the buzzer as the Trojans lost for the third 
time in four games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 With four seconds remaining in the game, USC had shooting guards Burt Harris, 
Cameron Murray, Ty Reuter and Martin in the lineup for the last shot. Murray 
in-bounded the ball to Harris, who drove to the top of the key before passing 
to an open Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran a play where everybody had a chance to (shoot)," USC Coach Charlie 
Parker said. "Burt (Harris) was our first option, but he was doubled. . . . We 
had a good shot, it just didn't go in." 
</P>
<P>
 In their three losses, the Trojans have found a different way to lose each 
time. Against fastbreak-minded New Mexico State, the Trojans blew a 15-point 
lead when they tired in the second half. In their loss to Temple, the Trojans 
were overmatched inside against the Owls' halfcourt attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Utah, the Trojans wanted to stop the Utes' inside game with Keith Van 
Horne and force the Utes to their perimeter game. The tactic worked for a while 
as they held a foul-plagued Van Horne scoreless in the first half, but 
backfired when Jimmy Carroll and Brandon Jessie combined to make seven 
three-pointers, including four in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting 32% from the field, USC trailed at halftime, 36-25, as Utah 
outrebounded the Trojans, 25-12. The Utes appeared ready to blow the game open 
as the Trojans missed one open shot after another. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first half, we struggled," Parker said. "We played too tight. I wanted 
us to start attacking the basket and play loose." 
</P>
<P>
 During halftime, Parker surprised the Trojans by yelling at them for the first 
time since taking over as interim coach two days before the start of the season 
in place of retired George Raveling. 
</P>
<P>
 "That got us really motivated because we had never seen him like that before," 
said senior Lorenzo Orr, who sat for most of the first half with three fouls. 
"We were really fired up and we were embarrassed by how we played in the first 
half." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Parker said worked. The Trojans scored the first eight points of the 
second half to cut Utah's lead to 36-33. From there, the Utes turned to Jessie 
and Carroll, who combined to score seven of their next nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, we want Van Horne and Jessie to shoot the ball," Utah Coach Rick 
Majerus said. "But going into the game, (Carroll) was one for 16 from behind 
the three-point line. I told him to keep taking his shots, and that's what he 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-point shot by Carroll, who finished with 14 points, Utah had a 
45-39 lead, but the Trojans rallied again to take a 51-49 lead midway through 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 That lead disappeared, however, as Van Horne, a former Diamond Bar High 
standout, scored all 16 of his points in the second half to help the Utes take 
a 66-59 lead with 3:59 remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans rallied again behind Jaha Wilson, who had a team-high 18 points 
and nine rebounds, and Orr, who finished with 15 points, to close to within 
three at 70-67 on a three-point basket by Murray with 1:03 left. 
</P>
<P>
 After two free throws by Utah sandwiched around a three-pointer by Harris, USC 
had its chance on Martin's final shot.

 Another No. 1 fell with a thud Saturday, a victim of poor shooting and a 
relentless opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Roe tried desperately to hoist top-ranked Massachusetts on his back, but 
it proved to be a heavy burden down the stretch and seventh-ranked Kansas 
pulled away for an 81-75 victory in the first game of the John R. Wooden 
Classic at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Roe did his part to keep UMass on top, but he couldn't guard all five 
Jayhawks. Or score over them. 
</P>
<P>
 He had 33 points and 10 rebounds, often dominating the taller Jayhawk front 
line, but Roe's teammates abandoned him late in the game. Against previously 
top-ranked Arkansas on Nov. 25, Roe scored 34 points and had 13 rebounds in 
overwhelming the Razorbacks' Corliss Williamson. He also had help in the 
24-point victory. Saturday, he did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Kansas, the 6-foot-7 forward made 13 of 25 shots from the field. But 
his teammates made only 17 of 52 shots. Overall, UMass (1-1) shot 39%. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, highly touted sophomore center Marcus Camby seemed invisible. 
Jayhawk big men Raef LaFrentz, who had a team-high 18 points, Greg Ostertag and 
Scot Pollard dominated the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Camby, who had 13 points and 12 rebounds against defending NCAA champion 
Arkansas, had two points and five rebounds against Kansas (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Two free throws by Jacque Vaughn and a three-point basket by Jerod Haase in 
the game's final 1:14 helped Kansas seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was apparent today that we can't beat the top teams with only one guy," 
UMass guard Derek Kellogg said. "The other guys have to step it up a little 
bit. We can't count on (Roe) to get 35 points a night." 
</P>
<P>
 UMass Coach John Calipari pointed to his team's woeful shooting and the 
Jayhawks' intensity as the deciding factors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we got outplayed, outhustled and outcoached," Calipari said. "We 
have shot better. It takes great balance to beat a Kansas or an Arkansas, and 
you can't beat them with one player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Roy (Williams, Kansas coach) 'You took us out of everything we wanted 
to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Calipari made little of losing the top spot. There was a simple 
lesson to be learned from Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned that on Dec. 3 Kansas is better than UMass," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams refused to get too excited about the victory, although he was pleased 
with the Jayhawks' performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do realize it's just one game," he said. "In about 48 hours from now, we 
have to play another one." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, a sophomore point guard from Pasadena Muir High, and Haase, a transfer 
from California, were superb in shredding any pressure UMass threw at them. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn had 14 points and 11 assists, his second consecutive game with 10 or 
more assists. Haase had 16 points, including the back-breaking three-point 
basket with 30 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn slipped the ball to a wide-open Haase, who swished his three-point 
shot, giving Kansas a more comfortable 78-72 lead.

</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara (2-1) was led by Kellie Cook with 18 points, 12 on

NORTHRIDGE LOSS IMPROVES BARTOW'S RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reeling from a 1-3 start, Coach Gene Bartow's Alabama Birmingham team got well 
in a hurry against overmatched Cal State Northridge on Saturday, defeating the 
Matadors, 84-62, before 745 in the Northridge Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Williams scored 30 points, Travis Harper 21 and Rod Willie 19 as the 
Blazers dealt Northridge (0-3) its most lopsided defeat at home in the five 
seasons the Matadors have played at the NCAA Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third consecutive game, Northridge shot only 35%, and for the second 
consecutive game the Matadors were led in scoring by Ryan Martin, a reserve 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not getting second shots or shots inside, that's fairly typical for 
a team that lives on the perimeter," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said of the 
Matadors' shooting woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin scored 11 points. Eric Gray, another substitute, scored 10 points. 
Peter Micelli, Northridge's 6-foot-8 center, also scored 10 points, although he 
made only three of 13 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Birmingham shot 49.2%, a more than acceptable mark since the Blazers 
also pulled in 18 offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight we were more in sync," said Bartow, whose club had lost to the 
College of Charleston, American University of Puerto Rico and Auburn. "We did 
what we needed to do defensively and overall looked more like a basketball 
team."

IRVINE GETS SOME CONSOLATION FROM PEPPERDINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a couple of hard-fought defeats against Oklahoma and 14th-ranked Ohio 
University, UC Irvine appeared to be headed toward an easy victory over a young 
Pepperdine team early in the first half Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters may be improved, but they clearly are a long way from 
steamroller status. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine let a 26-16 lead evaporate and trailed by as many as eight in the 
second half before a late rally carried the Anteaters to a 75-68 Hawkeye 
Invitational consolation game victory over the Waves in the Carver-Hawkeye 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters (1-2) continued to exhibit solid defense, strong rebounding and 
poor shooting. They overcame a 38% effort from the field and a 63% performance 
at the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Coach Rod Baker is relying heavily on his bench. Ten Anteaters played 
11 or more minutes and no one played more than 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a lot of good minutes from a lot of guys," Baker said. "I'm beginning 
to believe our depth is the strength of this team and tonight everybody got a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Chris Brown, the nation's top three-point shooter last season, 
did almost as much sitting as shooting. Brown made two three-pointers in the 
first 3 1/2 minutes, but then he appeared to be frustrated by the absence of a 
call when he felt he was fouled on a layup attempt. So Baker put him on the 
bench to "unwind." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris' level of excitability is directly related to his inability to make his 
shots," Baker said. "He needed to watch the game a little bit. He was too wound 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 The tactic apparently worked. Brown made a three-pointer with four minutes to 
play to put Irvine up for good and then another a minute later that gave the 
Anteaters a 71-66 advantage. He finished with a team-high 17 points, making 
five of 14 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Monte Marcaccini led the Waves (1-3) with 18 points. Kirk Goehring had 
17 points and eight rebounds.

49ERS ENJOY A BREATHER AGAINST DIVISION II FOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all the nervous energy surrounding opening night at the Pyramid, most at 
Long Beach State looked forward to a relaxing Saturday afternoon at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The basketball team shared this feeling and was rewarded with a visit from 
College of Notre Dame. The 49ers coasted to a 96-68 nonconference victory in 
front of 3,247 at the Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach overwhelmed the Argonauts, a Division II team from Belmont in the 
Bay Area, with tenacious pressure defense led by junior point guard Rasul 
Salahuddin. Salahuddin had 12 points, nine assists, a game-high six steals and 
only two turnovers in 24 minutes. His steal and reverse dunk gave Long Beach 
its biggest lead at 84-44 with 5:35 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our first game in the Pyramid was a big game, so we needed a game like this 
to get focused on the season again," said Salahuddin, who recorded the most 
assists for Long Beach since Bobby Sears had 10 in 1992. "This was a hard game 
to get up for, so we wanted to go out and pressure them and not get behind. We 
didn't want to lose to a team like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (2-0) appeared much more alert than in their lackluster 71-64 
victory over Detroit Mercy in Wednesday night's opening of the Pyramid. They 
eliminated any suspense quickly Saturday, taking a 12-2 lead on a three-point 
play by Salahuddin. 
</P>
<P>
 Another three-pointer by Salahuddin gave Long Beach a 19-5 lead. After that, 
College of Notre Dame (1-4) couldn't get any closer than 10 points. Guards 
Rodney Wheeler and Raymar Lawson were the only Argonauts in double figures with 
15 points each. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman forward Akeli Jackson scored a game-high 17 points as a reserve for 
Long Beach. He made seven of eight shots and had seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't about embarrassing anyone," 49er Coach Seth Greenberg said. "I 
went into the game hoping that I wouldn't have to play anyone more than 15 
minutes, and I think I pretty much accomplished that."

<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff McInnis scored a career-high 23 points and second-ranked North Carolina 
survived second-half foul trouble Saturday night to defeat 10th-ranked 
Cincinnati, 86-76, and win the Tournament of Champions at Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 McInnis, a sophomore guard who had 11 assists in a victory over South Carolina 
on Friday night, scored 16 points in the second half. His previous high was 18 
in the opener against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, coupled with losses earlier Saturday by top-ranked Massachusetts 
and No. 3 Kentucky, should push the Tar Heels (4-0) to No. 1 this week. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina would be the third No. 1 team in the first three weeks of the 
season. Defending champion Arkansas was the preseason No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati (3-1) got 22 points from LaZelle Durden. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 Arkansas 94, Missouri 71 -- Scotty Thurman scored 27 points and made two 
of his five three-point baskets in a 32-second span in the second half to lift 
the Razorbacks (3-1) over the Tigers (2-1) at Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman has 79 points in three games against Missouri, all victories, and 
played a large role in ending the Tigers' 17-game home winning streak. Clint 
McDaniel added 20 points for Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Duke 70, Illinois 65 -- Freshman guard Trajan Langdon scored all 12 of 
his points in the second half at Chicago to help the Blue Devils (3-1) continue 
their mastery of Big Ten competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke has won 13 consecutive games against the Big Ten dating to December of 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiwane Garris' three-point basket with 1:23 to play gave Illinois (3-1) its 
only lead of the second half at 65-64. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 Florida 81, No. 21 Wake Forest 70 -- Dan Cross scored 27 points to help 
the Gators (3-0) hold off the Demon Deacons (2-1) at Greensboro, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 11 Maryland 102, Bucknell 64 -- Johnny Rhodes scored a career-high 27 
points and Exree Hipp got seven of his 16 during an 18-0 first-half run that 
carried the Terrapins (4-1) over the Bison (0-4) at College Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Booth had 14 points and 10 rebounds for the Terrapins, who have won 31 
consecutive nonconference home games. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 13 Wisconsin 70, Texas Tech 65 -- Michael Finley found his shooting touch, 
teaming with Rashard Griffith to help the Badgers (3-0) stifle a comeback by 
the Red Raiders (1-1) at Madison, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
 Finley missed his first eight shots but finished with 23 points. Griffith had 
25. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa 91, No. 14 Ohio 75 -- Jess Settles scored 26 points to help the Hawkeyes 
(4-0) roll over the Bobcats (5-2) in the championship game of the Hawkeye 
Invitational at Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa has failed to win the tournament only once in 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio, which has lost two of three games since winning the Preseason NIT, was 
led by Gary Trent, who had 31 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Michigan 83, Tennessee Chattanooga 71 -- Jimmy King scored 23 points to 
lead the Wolverines (3-2) over the Moccasins (1-2) at Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan led by as many as 14 points twice before Tennessee Chattanooga pulled 
to within 72-69 with a little more than two minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Moccasins lost their opportunity to pull even with a series of 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 18 Michigan State 85, Louisville 71 -- Eric Snow had 19 points and 10 
assists, and Shawn Respert scored 24 points to lead the Spartans (2-0) over the 
Cardinals (1-3) at East Lansing, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was No. 400 for Coach Judd Heathcote. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 19 Georgetown 74, DePaul 68 -- Freshman guard Allen Iverson scored 16 of 
his 31 points in the last seven minutes to help the Hoyas (2-1) overpower the 
Blue Demons (1-1) at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kleinschmidt led DePaul with 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 20 Georgia Tech 100, East Carolina 74 -- Travis Best scored 32 points and 
James Forrest 28 as the Yellow Jackets (4-0) romped past the Pirates (2-1) at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Best and Forrest each made 12 of 18 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 22 Syracuse 89, Davidson 66 -- Tournament most valuable player John 
Wallace scored 17 points to lead the Orangemen (3-1) over the Wildcats (2-2) in 
the championship game of the Carrier Classic at Syracuse.

rebounds to help the Cavaliers (3-1) rout the Tigers (1-2) at Charlottesville, 
Va. OTHER GAMES

<P>
 Kurt Thomas scored a career-high 45 points and Texas Christian (2-0), taking 
well to the new style of run-and-gun Coach Billy Tubbs, set a school record for 
points for the second consecutive game in a 120-105 victory over Illinois 
Chicago (0-2) at Ft. Worth. . . . Doug Harris scored 23 points to lead San

RELAXED LONG BEACH WINS EASILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all the last-minute work and nervous energy surrounding opening night at 
The Pyramid, most at Long Beach State looked forward to a relaxing Saturday 
afternoon at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's basketball team shared this thought and was rewarded with a visit 
from the College of Notre Dame. The 49ers treated the Argonauts like a worn 
easy chair, coasting to a 96-68 victory before 3,247. 
</P>
<P>
 "After opening night, we needed something to get our feet back on the ground," 
Long Beach basketball Coach Seth Greenberg said. "We needed to get all the 
festivities out of our system and get back to playing, and I think this served 
its purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State overwhelmed the Argonauts, a Division II team from Belmont, 
with a tenacious defense led by junior point guard Rasul Salahuddin. 
</P>
<P>
 Salahuddin had 12 points, nine assists and six steals, and committed two 
turnovers in 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 His nine assists were the most by a 49er since Bobby Sears had 10 against 
Fresno State on Jan. 16, 1992. Salahuddin's steal and reverse dunk gave Long 
Beach its biggest lead, 84-44, with 5 minutes 35 seconds left to play.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was a hard game to get up for, so we wanted to go out and pressure them 
and not get behind," Salahuddin said. "We didn't want to lose to a team like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (2-0) appeared more alert than in their lackluster 71-64 victory 
over Detroit Mercy on Wednesday. Long Beach eliminated any suspense quickly 
Saturday, taking a 12-2 lead on Salahuddin's three-point play with 16:16 to go 
before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argonauts (1-4) shot 28.1% in the first half, nine of 32, and 38% for the 
game, 24 of 63. Sophomore guard Rodney Wheeler and junior guard Raymar Lawson 
scored 15 points each and were the only Argonauts in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Outrebounded, 48-37, in its opener, Long Beach dominated the Argonauts, 49-33. 
Long Beach led by 24 at halftime, 50-26, when reserve power forward Brian 
Yankelevitz rebounded a missed shot by Salahuddin and scored with less than a 
second remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman forward Akeli Jackson was exceptional as a reserve, scoring 17 
points. He made seven of eight shots and had seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Akeli is so quick to the ball," Greenberg said. "He's just a baby and he's 
still learning how to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The reserves also were a key, as Long Beach's outscored the Argonauts' 54-22. 
Junior swingman Jamie Davis scored 13 points, senior center Joe McNaull had 10 
points and seven rebounds and Yankelevitz, a junior, had nine points and a 
game-high nine rebounds.

FIFTH FOUL TESTS UCLA'S PATIENCE, COURAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The whistle blew, and Charles O'Bannon knew. 
</P>
<P>
 He headed straight down the court, a look of consternation on his face, turned 
toward the bench, hesitated and then just walked off the floor, headed for the 
doors on his way out of the arena for all anyone knew. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon's fifth foul came with 11:11 still to play in fifth-ranked UCLA's 
struggle against No. 3 Kentucky. And for all anyone knew, he was taking a good 
part of the Bruins' chances with him when he left. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had done such a great job on Rodrick Rhodes," said Ed O'Bannon, who 
watched his brother hold Rhodes to four points in the first half, even though 
his shot was off. But Charles O'Bannon picked up his third foul before 2 1/2 
minutes had passed in the second half, and his fourth was an offensive foul 
with 11:24 left. Thirteen seconds later, with Ed O'Bannon waiting to go in for 
his brother, Charles O'Bannon -- who should have been on the bench already -- 
was whistled for a reach on Rhodes, and he was done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably would have blown up if I hadn't gone back there to release some 
tension," said Charles O'Bannon, who returned to the bench a few minutes later. 
"I did a little bit of yelling. I didn't throw anything. I was by myself back 
there but a couple of people came around the corner to see who was yelling." 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing thing was, O'Bannon's departure didn't kill the Bruins. In fact, it 
was freshman J.R. Henderson -- playing only because O'Bannon wasn't -- who won 
it for UCLA on two free throws with a sliver of a second left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if he has nerves," Charles O'Bannon said, laughing, after UCLA's 
82-81 victory. "I mean, I'm sure he has nerves, but he doesn't play like he 
does. He came through in the clutch. He didn't play like a freshman today." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the twist was, had O'Bannon stayed in the game, Henderson wouldn't 
have been playing at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 It gave Henderson the kind of baptism by fire a young player needs -- even if 
he endured it with a beatific smile as he waited to step to the line.  
</P>
<P>
 "In November and December, I want situations like that," UCLA Coach Jim 
Harrick said -- but only after it worked out so well. "I want a situation where 
I've got to play Toby Bailey for long periods of time. Henderson, omm'A Givens, 
Kris Johnson. But you can't just (force) something like that in a game like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Circumstances forced it, and O'Bannon watched as Henderson stepped to the 
line. Just make one, he thought. OK, one more. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means we are capable of playing top-five basketball and capable of 
beating top-five basketball teams," Charles O'Bannon said after the celebration 
subsided. "That's why I came to UCLA , not just to play in big games but to win 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, however, he intends to play more than he did on Saturday.

NORDHOFF CONTINUES RUN AT CHAMPIONSHIP; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: HAWKINS GAINS 264 
YARDS AS RANGERS ADVANCE TO TITLE GAME WITH 30-19 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If Nordhoff had any inkling it was a team of destiny before its Southern 
Section Division IX semifinal playoff game Saturday night, it got a strong sign 
in the second quarter of a 30-19 victory over Santa Ynez. 
</P>
<P>
 On first down at the Ranger 12-yard line, running back Josh Hawkins blasted 
through the left side of the line and took off on a spectacular 88-yard run up 
the left sideline to the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The play was wiped out. Holding, Nordhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 But two plays later Hawkins, still catching his breath, did it again -- the 
same play, the same 88 yards. This time over right tackle, and this time no 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins' big run gave the host Rangers (10-3) a 16-0 lead in front of a 
standing-room-only crowd of about 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the flag out of the corner of my eye, but I went anyway," said Hawkins, 
who rushed for 264 yards and three touchdowns in 35 carries. "But any time I 
get the ball, I'm going full speed. (Two plays later) I got good blocks from 
(running back) Dallan Rigby and (wide receiver) Tony Henney, and it was wide 
open." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, a senior who entered the game with an area-best 2,055 yards rushing, 
led Nordhoff to its first berth in a section championship game. The Rangers 
will play Atascadero this week at a site to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers would need more of Hawkins after Santa Ynez (11-2) got touchdown 
plunges of one and two yards by fullback Russell Cole to narrow the margin to 
16-14 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins carried six times during an eight-play, 80-yard drive and scored on a 
nine-yard run to make it 23-13 with 8:09 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins dropped what looked like a sure interception for a touchdown when 
Santa Ynez took over. But after Nordhoff linebacker Russell Farrar sacked 
quarterback Josh Fiske on fourth down, Hawkins took off on a 15-yard scoring 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff outgained Santa Ynez, 353-268, and contained Fiske, a Division I 
recruit, until he fired a 47-yard scoring pass to Scott Chapman with 3:53 left.

ANDERSON CARRYING ON FOR MONTCLAIR PREP, 14-6; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: HE GAINS 
272 YARDS AS MOUNTIES BEAT KILPATRICK AND ADVANCE TO TITLE GAME. 
</P>

 Montclair Prep's Akil Anderson rushed for 216 of the Mounties' 272 yards to 
pace a 14-6 victory over Kilpatrick in a Southern Section Division X semifinal 
playoff game Saturday night at Kennedy High. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's third consecutive 200-yards-plus playoff game vaulted the Mounties 
into a championship game for the third time in five years. Montclair Prep, 
which won the Division IX title in 1992 and the Division X championship in 
1990, will face Orange Lutheran on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who has rushed for 871 yards and eight touchdowns in three playoff 
games, did not score against Kilpatrick, but he had nifty runs of 35 and 42 
yards and left no question as to who was moving the Mounties down the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think any back would like to get the ball 30 times a game and help his team 
get a victory," said Anderson, whose carries accounted for 31 of the Mounties' 
47 plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Montclair Prep limited Kilpatrick to only 148 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the key to this team," Anderson said. "Everything is focused around 
the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep (10-1), which limited Kilpatrick to 23 yards in the first half, 
broke down only on a 64-yard touchdown run by Mario Qualls, who finished with 
101 yards in 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two minutes after Montclair Prep linebacker Rashawn Jones returned 
an interception 15 yards for a touchdown and a 14-0 lead, Qualls took a pitch, 
ran off tackle and scored to pull Kilpatrick to within 14-6 late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilpatrick (10-3), which beat Montclair Prep, 26-14, earlier in the season, 
had three possessions in the fourth quarter, but could not put a drive 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilpatrick quarterback Cesar Cuevas threw a desperation pass from midfield to 
the Montclair Prep five-yard line on the game's final play, but the pass was 
broken up by Henry Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Dent gave Montclair Prep its first points when he scored on a 
nine-yard scramble less than four minutes into the game.

CAL STATE FULLERTON WELL AWARE IT'S COLD OUTSIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton followed a pattern Saturday night that Titan Coach Bob 
Hawking is finding all too familiar.  
</P>
<P>
 Texas Arlington further exposed the Titans' outside shooting problems with a 
1-3-1 zone defense, and the Mavericks went on to win, 74-68, in the consolation 
game of the Fresno State basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just started doing some work with that 1-3-1 a few days ago, and I'm real 
glad we did," Texas Arlington Coach Eddie McCarter said. "It really saved us. 
We noticed the other night against Santa Clara that they did a good job of 
penetrating, and we felt we had to do what we could to take that away from 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks went to the zone about eight minutes into the game, and stayed 
with it the rest of the way. Fullerton (1-2) made only 19 of 65 shots from the 
field (29%). Texas Arlington was 29 of 61 (48%). 
</P>
<P>
 What success the Titans had on offense was mostly from its inside game. Senior 
center Winston Peterson had 23 points and 16 rebounds. Reserve guard Chris St. 
Clair scored 16 points, hitting five of eight three-pointers. Guard James 
French, however, was scoreless from the field in 11 shots and missed seven 
three-point tries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't attack that 1-3-1 very well, and when you combine that with the 
poor shooting, it was a struggle," Hawking said. "And, for James, it wasn't 
just being 0 for 11, it was some of the shots he missed. I'm sure no one feels 
worse about it than he does, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Arlington (2-2) had balanced scoring in posting their second victory of 
the season. Keith Cornett had 18 points, and Damon Johnson made seven of 10 
shots from the floor and finished with 15. Tony Williams had 12 points and Paul 
Banks had 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans had a similar sluggish shooting performance Friday against Santa 
Clara, and making only 24 of 34 free throws kept them in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton fell behind, 40-33, at halftime Saturday and the Mavericks were in 
control throughout the second half. Texas Arlington led by 21 points with about 
seven minutes remaining, but the Titans managed to cut into the lead behind the 
scoring of Peterson, who had 11 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas Arlington led by 10 points with about a minute left before a three-point 
play by Peterson pulled Fullerton to within five points.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard to get over the hump when you can't score," Hawking said. 
"No matter how well you play defensively, you still have to shoot. We played 
well enough defensively to win it. Peterson played well again. He was a force 
inside, but just about everyone else was struggling offensively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our shots weren't that bad. For the most part, they were taking the shots we 
hit in practice every day." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Senior center Winston Peterson was named to the all-tournament team. . . . 
Santa Clara defeated Fresno State, 81-57, in the championship game.

UC IRVINE FIGHTS BACK TO BEAT PEPPERDINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a couple of hard-fought losses to Oklahoma and 14th-ranked Ohio, UC 
Irvine appeared to be headed toward an easy victory over a young Pepperdine 
team early in the first half Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Anteaters may be improved, they clearly are a long way from 
being a steamroller. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine let a 26-16 lead evaporate and trailed by as many as eight in the 
second half before a late rally carried the Anteaters to a 75-68 victory in the 
consolation game of the Hawkeye Invitational in Carver-Hawkeye Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure that when we got to 26-16 we didn't start thinking the game was 
over," Irvine Coach Rod Baker said. "But we have to understand that people want 
to win just as badly as we do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters (1-2) continued to exhibit solid defense, strong rebounding and 
poor shooting. They overcame a 38% effort from the field and a 63% performance 
at the free-throw line with a balanced attack; five players had nine or more 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker is becoming less reluctant to go to his bench with each game, and 
Saturday night he was substituting freely. Ten Anteaters played 11 or more 
minutes, and no one played more than 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a lot of good minutes from a lot of guys," Baker said. "I'm beginning 
to believe our depth is the strength of this team, and tonight everybody got a 
chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Chris Brown, the nation's top three-point shooter last season, 
did almost as much sitting as shooting, a most uncommon position for him. Brown 
made two three-pointers in the first 3 1/2 minutes, but then appeared to lose 
his focus after complaining about the absence of a call when he thought he was 
fouled on a layup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker put him on the bench to "unwind." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris' level of excitability is directly related to his inability to make his 
shots," Baker said. "He needed to watch the game a little bit. He was too wound 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 The tactic apparently worked. Brown made a three with four minutes to play to 
put Irvine ahead for good, then buried another a minute later that gave the 
Anteaters a 71-66 advantage. He finished with a team-high 17 points after 
making only five of 14 shots from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we got cheated on a couple of calls (during the overtime loss to 
Ohio), and I was afraid it was going to happen again," Brown said. "I guess I 
lost my concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach took me out because I was rushing my game, pressing instead of letting 
my shots come to me. I'm just not very consistent with my shot right now and I 
just want to get the feel back. But once I realized he was going to keep me 
out, I told myself I had to slow down and relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine Coach Tony Fuller thought some of his players were a little too 
relaxed. He was also upset with the Waves' (1-3) interior play and rebounding. 
Irvine won the battle of the boards, 50-36, and Anteater forward Michael Tate 
had 10 rebounds in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the kind of team that needs a total team effort, and if we have a 
couple of guys who don't come to play, it's very hard for us to win," said 
Fuller, who declined to name names. "(Forward) Kirk Goehring came off the bench 
to give us a spark, but we had no inside game, they hit the big shots and we 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine may have hit the big shots, but they missed a lot of the other ones. 
The Anteaters' perimeter shooters -- Brown, Mark Odsather and Brian Keefe -- 
continued to struggle. They were a combined 10 of 32 from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a pretty good sign that we haven't had a good outside game, but 
we still found other ways to get it done," Odsather said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine point guard Raimonds Miglinieks, who was in tears after Friday night's 
loss, was smiling after this one. He was the only Anteater starter who shot 50% 
or better from the field, hitting five of seven field goals, including two of 
three three pointers. He was named to the all-tournament team.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; THIRST FOR PEACE MAKES SHULMAN CLAIM A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sandy Shulman has made countless claims since he began training, but there's 
no doubt that Thirst For Peace is the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken for Clear Valley Stables for $32,000 on Aug. 13, 1993 at Del Mar, after 
the trainer won a 15-way shake, Thirst For Peace gave Shulman his first graded 
stakes victory Saturday when she won the Grade 2 $108,500 Bayakoa Handicap at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 A winner of three of seven starts this year against lesser opposition, the 
5-year-old Time For A Change mare and 18-1 shot beat Glass Ceiling by a head 
under Alex Solis in 1:42 1/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Dominique, the 7-5 favorite, finished fourth in her first start since 
finishing third in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Her rider, Corey Nakatani, 
claimed foul against the winner, but it was quickly dismissed by the stewards. 
Magical Maiden finished last, duplicating her effort in the Yellow Ribbon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is obviously one of our biggest victories," said Shulman. "She's really 
come around for us. She's done real well these last three or four months. She's 
come around like she (did) at the beginning of the year at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have to tell Alex anything. He knows what to do with her. He rode 
her terrifically at Santa Anita." 
</P>
<P>
 Losing for the first time in three starts at Hollywood Park, Glass Ceiling 
finished 2 1/2 lengths ahead of 17-1 outsider Dancing Mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal, who didn't have much success in two trips to Kentucky in his most 
recent races, is the 8-5 favorite in the $100,000 Native Diver Handicap today. 
</P>
<P>
 The return to Hollywood Park could be just what the 6-year-old gelding needs 
because this has been his favorite track. In six starts on the main track at 
Inglewood, Best Pal has five firsts and a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Best Pal was going to run in next Sunday's Hollywood Turf Cup, but 
after Dramatic Gold, who also is owned by John and Betty Mabee's Golden Eagle 
Farm, decided to pass the Native Diver, it was decided to run Best Pal here. A 
winner of 15 of 37 lifetime starts and with earnings of $5,065,645, the 
California-bred will be ridden by McCarron. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-2 second choice in the 1 1/8-mile race is Sea Cadet, who bounced back to 
his best form after a pair of disappointing comeback efforts. He was beaten by 
a nose by Stuka in the Skywalker Handicap at Santa Anita in 1:40 4/5 for the 1 
1/16 miles. Solis will ride for trainer Ron McAnally. Sea Cadet has also shown 
a fondness for Hollywood Park, where he has two firsts, a second and two thirds 
in six races.

 According to a story in today's Daily Racing Form, the schedule for Holy Bull 
is to run twice in Florida in early 1995, then return to California for the 
$1-million Santa Anita Handicap on March 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Holy Bull, who won eight of 10 this year, including an impressive victory in 
the Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park on Sept. 17 to conclude his campaign, is 
scheduled to return in the seven-furlong Hallandale Handicap at Gulfstream Park 
on Jan. 22. He'll then go in the Donn Handicap on Feb. 11 at 1 1/8 miles before 
the Big 'Cap.

 The Pick Six payoff of $761,627.40 Friday night at Hollywood Park was a track 
record.

 The ticket, which was purchased at Hollywood Park, eclipsed the previous high 
of $619,799 paid on June 4, 1992. Horse Racing Notes

 Borodislew, the 3-1 second choice on the morning line, was scratched from the 
Bayakoa Saturday morning because of a slight fever. . . . Thirst For Peace paid 
$39.40, and the victory was worth $63,500 to her owners. . . . Alywow, a 
disappointing seventh as the favorite in last Sunday's Matriarch, suffered a 
fracture in her left hind leg while training Friday morning and is out of next 
weekend's Hollywood Turf Cup. Alywow is scheduled to undergo surgery today or 
Monday. . . . Wagering throughout California increased significantly on the 
Hong Kong races Friday night over the first two weeks. On the first Friday, 
$311,472 was handled, the total dropped to $331,167 last Saturday and it was 
$498,746 on Friday night.

<P>
 Kent Desormeaux, who has been bothered by flu all week, took off his final 
five mounts Saturday after riding in the first two races. Desormeaux didn't 
ride Wednesday or Thursday, then didn't ride his last two mounts on Friday 
night. If he feels better today, Desormeaux will meet with stewards Pete 
Pedersen, Dave Samuel and Tom Ward regarding Saturday's second race. Riding 
About To Shout, he stood up approaching the wire, something he has done several 
times in the past, and the 3-year-old colt was nailed for third by Air Corn.

 Heritage Christian lost a gem in Steve Acheson, but have two new ones in David 
Acheson and Williams. Williams averaged 15 points last season and David Acheson 
14, but they will have to increase their output to get the Patriots some extra 
victories. Heritage Christian got second-place last year, but Williams hopes 
his team will do one better in his first year coaching the Patriots. In 
addition to the two scorers, Heritage Christian's strength lies in its speed 
and quickness, along with its outside shooting. The Patriots play a running 
style and scoring 100 points a game is a realistic goal. Williams is concerned 
about height, but with Findlater and Coke, the Patriots should be bigger than 
most teams in the small Express League.

</P>
<P>
 Orangewood Academy becomes the newest competitor in the Southern Section and 
the Spartans have a young, quick team to put on the floor. In the middle, 
Thorson is hoping big things will come from Lloyd, who won't have too many 
players his size to stop him. The Spartans are going to be a running team, but 
will be able to score in the halfcourt game if Lloyd can develop. Bennie and 
Vasquez are the main scoring threats. Both averaged 20 points last season with 
Anderson averaging 15. Orangewood Academy's only glaring weakness is its lack 
of outside shooting, but if the fast break works as Thorson has planned and 
Lloyd does some scoring in the post, the Spartan's might not need to shoot from 
too far away.

</P>
<P>
 Morales has 10 players on his team, which is a good considering there are only 
45 students enrolled in the high school. In most seasons, Morales has only had 
seven or eight players. Davidson is the scoring threat for Bethel Baptist after 
averaging 16 points and 10 rebounds during his sophomore season. Yamashiro, who 
averaged 10 points from the point guard position last season, moves to 
off-guard; plus, he's a good defender. White also averaged 10 points a season 
ago and is a scrappy player who gets to about every loose ball on the court. 
Tran is a good ballhandler who will be the Warriors' point guard, and Dyrud is 
another tough player who, like White, goes after rebounds with a vengeance. 
Arreona and Montoya are both aggressive defenders.

</P>
<P>
 Watson has three starters back from last season's team. Chen and Simpson will 
be at the guard positions and Kimble at forward, but positioning will not 
really matter if the Cougars play the up-tempo style they would like. The 
biggest hurdle for Watson is assembling a full team for practices so the 
starters can scrimmage against some bodies. Watson and his aides have been 
forced to run against the players in practice, which is good for keeping the 
former New Jersey Net player in shape, but it does not help in evaluating 
newcomers. Kimble needs no evaluation, he's the go-to, rebound and go-to again 
guy for Claremont. Last season, he averaged 22.8 points and 9.7 rebounds while 
playing alongside Gavin Watson, the other Cougar all-league player. Together, 
they kept Claremont in just about every game. This season, Kimble will have to 
do it alone or hope Chen and Simpson can pick up some of the scoring load. If 
the latter happens, Claremont could improve on last season's record.

<P>
 Pacific Shores is the smallest private high school in Orange County so its 
weaknesses begin there. However, there seems to be more interest in the team 
after last season, when the Seahawks won their first-ever playoff game. Chapple 
is the team's leading scorer and if he's hot, there's no limit to his range. 
Ring and Werner will take over the ball-handling duties and both are good 
shooters. Sipling will start at forward and is a wide-body who sets picks for 
Chapple. Nima Sabharwal is the center and is a big, strong player who is the 
Seahawks' best rebounder. Kassinove took over the program and may take some 
time to familiarize himself with his players, but Pacific Shores' season starts 
slowly with only two games in December. However, the Seahawks will be in for 11 
league games in the last 28 days of January, which will determine whether they 
return to the playoffs.

 Cameron has the enviable problem of not having enough time to use all his 
players in a game, a situation that is usually reversed at Southern California 
Christian. With Josh Cameron, the Arrowhead League's most valuable player, and 
eight or nine other players who can contribute on the team, the Flames are deep 
and hope to keep opponents in check with pressure defense. On offense, they 
will try to fast-break their way to a league title. Cameron also said this is 
his biggest team in the last two seasons, with newcomers Dowdell and Freeman to 
back up Lautt at forward.

<P>
 Swanson is still looking for that 200th career victory after getting only two 
last season. He likes the makeup of this year's squad even though the Lancers 
graduated Tom Howard and Tony Risberg, who were their top two scorers. "We're 
going after everybody this season and we have a good preseason to warm us up," 
he said. Orange Lutheran played host to its own tournament to start the season 
and also participates in the tough Orange Holiday Classic in mid-December. 
Swanson is impressed with his team's work ethic, and several players who never 
played last year will get ample playing time this season. Meaux was the 15th 
man on the team a year ago, but he has locked up the point guard position this 
season. The rest of the players are battling for the four remaining starting 
spots. Taube averaged 4.3 points last year and is the only returning starter, 
but he has some competition for the job from Bagatourian and Madsen. Watson is 
concerned about his team's size and rebounding ability.

of sophomores. However, the Eagles are coming off a successful summer league 
which gives him a reason to believe his team may improve on its poor record of 
last season. The Eagles will have to depend on a much more balanced scoring 
attack after losing all of their main scoring threats to graduation. Newcomers 
Ghosheh and C' de Baca are the big men for Markum and will have to hold their 
own against taller teams such as St. Margaret's. Jennings was a big contributor 
on offense for the Eagles as a freshman. Depth and experience are the team's 
most glaring weaknesses. Markum admits he does not know a lot about the Eagles' 
new league, but is optimistic about their chances.

<P>
 The Minutemen are loaded with juniors and seniors, and should be in the hunt 
for the league championship from the start. McClung and Avery each have a 
chance to lead the county in scoring after averaging close to 25 points during 
summer league. McClung also averaged six three-pointers. Bahnsen has a tough 
nonleague schedule, and the first-year coach hopes his team can survive and 
improve during that time. He also hopes Liberty Christian can get past the 
playoff quarterfinals, where it has been stopped the last four seasons. McClung 
and Avery both were first-team all-league selections last season, while Rule 
made the second team. The Minutemen's main weakness is their lack of experience 
at center. Engleman has the size to fit the role, but whatever else is yet to 
be seen. Developing Engleman into more than just a big body will be a key to 
the Minutemen's season.

</P>
<P>
 The Tartans should be a lock to repeat as champions in the Academy League 
after going unbeaten last season. The main reasons are St. Margaret's returning 
starters. Raibon was a first-team All-Southern Section selection and the 
league's most valuable player after averaging 22 points. He has already 
committed to the University of San Francisco. Masters and Baker are another 
pair of all-league seniors who averaged just over 10 points. Masters was the 
Tartans starting quarterback and is an excellent all-around athlete. Larson 
bypassed the junior varsity team and has proved to be a legitimate young 
talent. Ohara, in his first year after taking over for Rick Bauer who switched 
to Dana Hills, said he wants the Tartans to again challenge for the Division 
V-AA title and improve on their record from last season. The Tartan's best 
assets are their experience, quickness and athletic ability. Their weaknesses 
lie in rebounding and defensive transition, Ohara said.

<P>
 The Pioneers are hoping a trio of sophomores will be enough to lead them into 
the playoffs in the four-team Academy League. Yang is a dramatically improved 
power forward who will be the only Pioneer with varsity playing time. Bui 
weighs just 90 pounds, but uses the size to his advantage to slip inside 
opposing defenses. Dignan said Bui has extraordinary court vision. Payne is St. 
Michael's biggest player and has good quickness to the basket. Dignan is 
working on some other offensive moves for Payne, such as back-to-the-basket 
shots, to take advantage of his size. St. Michael's had two other talented 
players who would have helped the team, but the school's principal instructed 
them to concentrate on their duties as elected student government officers. One 
particular player who will be sorely missed is Gabrial Trebels, the team's 
leading scorer last season, who has been elected student-body president and 
will not have the school's permission to participate in basketball.

 The Tartans strolled through league play unbeaten behind the play of Damian 
Raibon, who earned Academy League most valuable player honors after averaging 
22 points. Teammates Bobby Masters (10-point average) and Bobby Baker (11) 
earned first-team honors for St. Margaret's. Liberty Christian's only two 
league losses were against the Tartans as the Minutemen placed all five 
starters on either the first or second team. Dave Vaccaro was among the top 10 
in scoring and rebounding; Robert McClung averaged 17 points, and Bryan Avery 
averaged 10.2, which landed the trio on the first team. Greg Rule and Carl 
Warmack were second-team selections. St. Michael's Prep was led by leading 
scorer Gabriel Trebels and showed gradual signs of improvement. Arrowhead

 Heritage Christian used its run-and-gun style to place second in league play. 
However, the Patriots were stopped cold in the first round of the playoffs by 
Pacific Shores. First-team all-league selection Steve Acheson averaged 16.3 
points for Heritage Christian. David Acheson and Jay Williams added to the 
high-scoring Patriot offense by averaging just more than 15 points. Huntington 
Beach Claremont continued to improve behind the scoring of all-league players 
Gavin Watson and Steve Kimble, who averaged more than 20 points. Kimble

 Whittier Christian was a mild surprise when it won the league title over 
Brethren Christian, which had five returning starters. The Heralds' Tyler Ream 
was the league's most valuable player, and Kevin Berry and Kwadwo Boachie were 
first-team selections. Brethren Christian also placed Reggie Davis (11.1 
points) and Andy Brown (9.1 rebounds) on the first team. Whittier Christian and 
the Warriors lost their first-round playoff games. The Heralds were upset by 
Downey Pius X and the Warriors lost to Santa Monica St. Monica. Rounding out 
the first-team selections from Orange County schools were Jeff Jennings of 
Capistrano Valley Christian and Isaac Leasau for Calvary Chapel. Second team 
players were Richard Mendoza (Brethren Christian), Tony Risberg (Orange 
Lutheran), Tom Howard (Orange Lutheran) and Trevor Ream (Whittier Christian). 
Ed Zieman (Whittier Christian) and Matt Herr (Calvary Chapel) were honorable 
mention.

<P>
 Brethren Christian is going to have to start from scratch after losing all 
five starters two years after playing in the state finals. Thomas is going to 
go with the popular running game to start the season since his team's best 
assests are its speed, ballhandling ability and outside shooting. If that 
doesn't work, he will have to rethink his strategy. Thomas would like to get 80 
to 90 points a game from his team, but defense will be the key to winning, he 
said. Babcock and Milne are the backbone of the Warriors, but Cooper is going 
to be a player to watch because of his good size and presence under the basket. 
Brethren Christian is by no means a young team, as it has four seniors and four 
juniors, but on-the-court experience will still be a factor in how well it does 
against league favorites Calvary Chapel and Whittier Christian.

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; LOS ALAMITOS TOUGH INSIDE, WINS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cory Johnson scored 22 points to lead Los Alamitos to a 72-53 victory over 
Corona del Mar in the championship game of the Daily Pilot Tip-Off Classic at 
Corona del Mar High. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson made two three-pointers and eight of 10 free throws for the Griffins 
(4-0). He also had five rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the key for Los Alamitos was its dominance inside. A.D. Lamoreux and 
Jeremy Vandervoet controlled the lane, scoring 15 points each. They combined 
for 14 rebounds, and Vandervoet blocked six shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Lamoreux and Vandervoet) were able to do the job inside," Griffins 
Coach Steve Brooks said. "We've got some things to work on, but I'm pleased 
with where we are at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings (3-1) were led by Brian Fracalosy's 12 points but never made a 
serious run. The Griffins took an early 14-2 lead in the first quarter, and 
Corona del Mar didn't get closer than nine points after that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings trailed, 47-37, at the end of three quarters and Los Alamitos 
went on a 14-8 run in the first four minutes of the fourth quarter to put the 
game out of reach.

SANTA ANA WRESTLERS TOP IRVINE, WIN EL TORO 10-WAY TOURNAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIK HAMILTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana, ranked second in the county, defeated No. 5 Irvine to win the El 
Toro 10-way wrestling tournament Saturday at El Toro High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints defeated Irvine, 40-17, after both teams posted the best records 
(7-0) of the two-day, 10-school competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine kept the score in range until the 160-pound class, where the Vaqueros 
had to forfeit. Santa Ana senior Brian Schwalm then pinned Matt Johnson in the 
first period at 171 to begin to put the match out of reach. And after Irvine 
senior Steve Ruiz won by technical fall at 189, Santa Ana came back on a 
53-second pin by heavyweight Juan Gonzalez, MVP of the upper weights. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Coach Scott Glabb was confident his team could beat Irvine but was 
surprised by some of the results. 
</P>

 One was the competition between his wrestler, junior Ignacio Bahena, and 
Irvine sophomore Andrew Pena; both were undefeated at 119 pounds and wrestling 
for the individual title. At times, the match resembled a street brawl, but 
Bahena made some last-second reverses to win, 15-13. "That really surprised 
me," Glabb said. "That kid (Pena) was tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Bahena (119), Sadie Morales (125), Jim Rodriguez (160), Schwalm (171) and 
Gonzalez (heavyweight) won their classes for Santa Ana. Peter Hamilton (112), 
Justin Meier (130), Alan Rush (145) and Ruiz (189) won for Irvine.

 Thomas Juarez (103) of San Diego Montgomery, which placed third, was named MVP 
of the lower weights. ERIK HAMILTON

 REWARD OFFERED: Approved a $25,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest and conviction of the hit-and-run driver responsible for the death of 
27-year-old Marcey Lewis. Lewis was driving along Beverly Boulevard in Hancock 
Park on March 2 when her vehicle was broadsided by another automobile. The 
driver of the other vehicle, who has not been identified, fled on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * LIBRARY CONTRIBUTIONS: Approved an agreement between the city and the 
Library Foundation, a nonprofit group, for the disposition of funds raised from 
the Voluntary Library Card Solicitation Program. For every contribution $35 and 
under, 90% will go to the library and 10% to the foundation. For contributions 
exceeding $35, the libraries and the foundation will each get half. Brochures 
encouraging donations have been printed and will be handed out to adults when 
they receive their new computerized library card. A spokesman for the Library 
Foundation said the group will use its share of the funds to finance more 
fund-raising events for the libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 * HARLEY TOY RIDE: Approved the closure of Towne Avenue between 4th and 6th 
streets on Dec. 11 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. for the annual Kid Row Toy Ride by 
the Harley Davidson Owners of Glendale. The event provides toys to homeless 
children on Skid Row. BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS 
</P>
<P>
 * LIQUOR DISPUTE: Granted an appeal by the owner of the Save Penny Market at 
449 N. Bixel Street, whose request to be allowed to sell beer and wine had been 
rejected by a zoning administrator. The ruling was made despite extensive 
community opposition; at a hearing on the issue, dozens of area residents 
complained there is already too much public drunkenness in the neighborhood. A 
decision by the City Council on whether to uphold the appeal is expected soon. 
HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * SKID ROW HOTELS: Approved a Community Redevelopment Agency plan to grant 
$375,000 to the Church and Temple Housing Partnership for the purpose of 
stabilizing the finances of the Genesis Hotel at 452 S. Main Street and the 
Pershing/Roma Hotel at 500-508 S. Main Street. The hotels are operating at a 
deficit and CRA officials say the grant is needed to avoid the possibility of 
foreclosure of the properties by banks. In 1988, the CRA provided $2.5 million 
in funding for the rehabilitation of the two hotels, which offer 97 rooms to 
people with very low income. Passed 10-0. Voting yes: Jackie Goldberg, Mike 
Hernandez, Nate Holden, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rudy Svorinich Jr. Absent: Richard 
Alatorre, Rita Walters. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

GET THE ROCKZORDS A BACKSTAGE PASS; THEY WON'T SING. THEY WON'T DANCE EITHER. 
BUT IF YOU THINK THEIR $3-MILLION PRODUCTION LOOKS AND SOUNDS LIKE A ROLLING 
STONES CONCERT, YOU'D BE RIGHT.

 The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Rod Stewart may be lively rock 'n' roll 
dinosaurs, but can any of them actually summon the powers of a charging 
triceratops, a swooping pterodactyl or a thundering Tyrannosaurus rex ? 
</P>
<P>
 Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 But those are the powers drawn upon each weekday afternoon by an even livelier 
group of pop heroes -- the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The multihued teen titans have regularly called upon Dinozords, Thunderzords 
and even Megazords to vanquish their malevolent nemeses, Rita Repulsa and Lord 
Zedd. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a move of Ultrazordian proportions, they are following in the 
footsteps of the Stones, Floyd and Rod. They're taking their show on the road 
-- rock 'n' roll style. 
</P>
<P>
 The $3-million production will feature rock-worthy, state-of-the-art lights, 
lasers, scenery and pyrotechnics and a monster sound system. Giant video 
screens will make the stage action clear to everyone in the arena. The 
90-minute show will also incorporate top-flight stage illusions, creature 
effects, giant inflatables and robotics. 
</P>
<P>
 The live tour may be a family entertainment event, but the team that has come 
together to put the Rangers on stage carries heavy rock credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Marcel Avram has overseen Stones, Floyd and Stewart tours, as well as 
Michael Jackson's "Dangerous" tour. Producers Arnold Stiefel and Randy Phillips 
manage the careers of Stewart, Morrissey and Toni Braxton. The show is being 
staged by the design team of Rikki Farr and Ian Knight, who boast collective 
rock credits running from Jimi Hendrix to Lollapalooza. 
</P>
<P>
 Composer Ron Wasserman, of the "Go Go Power Rangers" theme song fame, has 
co-produced the last two solo albums from Jon Anderson of Yes. And even 
director Anita Mann, whose family entertainment credits stretch from "The New 
Zoo Revue" to "Snoopy's World of Magic," got her start as a dancer on the 
"Shindig" and "Hullabaloo" TV shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Danny O'Donovan, who learned his business working early Motown tours, 
recently joined with Avram to form Global Events Inc. The Power Rangers have 
offered their company its first chance to step into the realm of family 
entertainment, and O'Donovan says it has been a surprisingly easy transition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 'The line between rock 'n' roll and family entertainment starts to get erased 
on a show like this," O'Donovan says. "The Rolling Stones just spent a lot of 
money on their last tour to put on a rock 'n' roll show that appealed to fans 
of all ages, and I think we're doing a little bit of that in reverse. We're 
putting on a family show that attempts to entertain the parents. We don't want 
any moms and dads squirming and yawning and bored to tears." 
</P>
<P>
 That's an experience that producer Stiefel can relate to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took my nephew to see Barney, and I thought I was going to go crazy. My 
brain was going soft," he recalls. "With the Power Rangers, I think we're 
shooting for a cross between the 'Back to the Future' ride at Universal Studios 
and a great rock 'n' roll concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would Rod be satisfied with this show if he were a Power Ranger? That was our 
main criterion for giving the production its rock 'n' roll energy. We're used 
to sending out Rod Stewart and Morrissey on tour, and we wanted to give the 
Power Rangers the same kind of production quality that those stars would be 
happy with." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he adds, "We had to deliver something sensational. Why else would people 
pay for something that's free on TV every day at 4:30?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Live" tour is close to selling out its 
preview performances at the San Diego Sports Arena from Tuesday through next 
Sunday, and it opens its West Coast world premiere engagement Dec. 13 at the 
Universal Amphitheatre. Ticket demand has extended that run to 20 shows over 10 
days, and the buzz among pint-sized Morphin fans looks to make the show a 
sellout across the country as the West Coast and East Coast touring units cover 
65 cities in the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is big-time entertainment," says Gary Bongiovanni, editor in chief of 
Pollstar magazine, which tracks the national concert business. "I think 
promoters across the country want to get dates for the Power Rangers just as 
much as they want Rod Stewart dates. Anybody that has kids realizes just how 
big an attraction this is." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now in their second season on the Fox Children's Network, the wholesome, 
high-kicking Rangers continue to put their estimable Morphin talents to good 
use, saving their home burg of Angel Grove from the forces of darkness in tidy, 
half-hour installments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Power Rangers have long been popular figures in Japan, but their 
phenomenal American TV success began when Saban Entertainment developed the 
current series, launching it on Fox in the summer of 1993. The low-tech show 
presented an unlikely mix of "Star Wars" space mythology, "Godzilla"-flick 
monsters and upbeat teen camaraderie right out of "Archie" comics. But the 
upstanding Rangers were a smash with kids, spawning a 100,000-member fan club 
in its first two months. Morphin-crazed youngsters have also made 
Ranger-related items one of the toy industry's hottest sellers.  
</P>
<P>
 The Ranger tour is no last hurrah -- a third season of TV shows is about to be 
filmed and a feature film is due out next summer.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first few times I watched the show, I thought it was terrible," says tour 
co-designer Farr. "The worst sort of second-rate children's entertainment. But, 
as I kept watching, I saw that there really were some positive messages in 
there, and there was also a lot of really kitschy humor. Suddenly, working on a 
Power Rangers tour looked like a lot of fun to me." 
</P>
<P>
 That would seemingly be a sizable stretch from the fun that Farr was used to. 
As a promoter he has worked with Hendrix, the Doors, Led Zeppelin, the Who and 
the Beatles, among many others. He was a creative force behind the Isle of 
Wight rock festivals, and in the last few years has worked with Guns N' Roses, 
Tom Petty, Nine Inch Nails and the Lollapalooza shows.  
</P>
<P>
 Farr managed to bring his rambunctious, rock 'n' roll edge to the Rangers tour 
even before he officially signed on, when he was asked to present a production 
plan to Saban executives.  
</P>
<P>
 "They'd been seeing all these polished, high-tech presentations," he explains. 
"I went into the boardroom in my shorts and sweat shirt, plopped down Ian 
Knight's model of the stage, and started prancing around and acting out all the 
monsters and the fight scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was growling and roaring, and these guys in suits didn't know whether to 
laugh. But Hiam Saban said, 'It is perfect. You've got the job.' I told him it 
was going to cost some money, and he said, 'You've got $3 million to mount the 
show and a $10-million budget to take it on the road.' I said, 'Well guys, 
that'll do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Dang, president of Children's Entertainment at Saban, says the decision 
to turn the Power Rangers into a no-expenses-spared rock 'n' roll extravaganza 
was made in February, when a live Power Rangers appearance at Universal Studios 
on behalf of the anti-drug organization DARE attracted an estimated crowd of 
35,000 and tied up traffic on the Hollywood Freeway for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a rule we had tried to refrain from the characters making live 
appearances, just because we're keepers of the image and it's harder than you'd 
think to find people who look really good in spandex suits," he says with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the DARE appearance told us we should take a look at the possibilities. 
We decided if we were going to give the kids a show, we were really going to 
give them something to remember. There haven't been too many family shows where 
it cost $3 million to mount the sucker." 
</P>
<P>
 The money may have bought a rock 'n' roll concert-quality production, but Dang 
is quick to point out that all that rock power hasn't altered the basic charms 
of the vigilant Rangers: "This isn't a rock 'n' roll musical. The Power Rangers 
will not sing. The Power Rangers will not dance. We're presenting a complete 
Power Rangers story where rock 'n' roll music and energy set the pace for the 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 While the tour has the Power Rangers leaping into the world of rock 'n' roll 
production values, the group's evil-bashing on TV has always been accompanied 
by a rock 'n' roll score. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted to create little kid's music for the show," says composer 
Wasserman. "There's too much of that out there, and the little kids I know 
listen to adult stuff. I figured why not give kids that sound in a show of 
their own -- rock 'n' roll for preteens. I'm used to hearing my music through 
TV speakers. It's going to be nice to hear it loud." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Dang, Frank Roach of MCA Concerts is a member of the Rangers' team with a 
non-rock background -- he spent the last 15 years working with Ringling Bros. 
and Barnum & Bailey. But he believes that all-ages entertainment and rock 'n' 
roll are going to increasingly resemble each other: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the boundaries are changing. Fifteen years ago, the circus was for 
families with children and rock 'n' roll shows were for 15- to 30-year-olds. 
But, within the last few years, the people buying tickets to the Stones or Pink 
Floyd or the Eagles are the same people taking their kids to see the Ninja 
Turtles or even taking the whole family to the Stones show." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One element of the rock world that hasn't been translated into the Power 
Rangers show is attitude. While rock 'n' roll talents and technology have 
pumped up the energy level for the Rangers, the innocence and excitement of a 
children-oriented tour seem to have pumped up the Rangers' support crew. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in rock 'n' roll think they're inventing a cure for cancer," Farr 
says. "I don't ever take it that seriously. I just want fun, and the Power 
Rangers show is a tremendous amount of fun.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you put on a rock concert and you're putting all that production 
together, the thing is very ego-driven and self-motivated. Now we're just 
thinking about how we can keep the kids excited." 
</P>
<P>
 If the excitement spreads, and the Power Rangers make a spectacular splash in 
the nation's arenas by borrowing from rock 'n' roll, is it possible that 
someday soon bona fide rock 'n' roll artists may look to nick a trick or two 
from the Rangers?  
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you who," Farr says, "but I've already been asked by a major 
artist -- a household name -- if I can incorporate into his next show some of 
the kind of magic and illusions that we're presenting with the Power Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, the horizons are bigger now in every field of entertainment. Rock 'n' 
rollers can't just get away with tight pants and fancy hairdos. And when they 
come to me in the future and ask what kind of a show I can do for them, I'm 
going to start saying, 'I've got some experience with the Power Rangers -- 
shall we have a look at their act?' " 
</P>
<P>
 What about the further possibilities of Morphin-rock cross-pollination? Might 
we someday see an arena spectacular in which Lord Zedd, weary of battling the 
unflagging Power Rangers, turns his nefarious attentions instead to somebody 
like, say, Trent Reznor? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Farr says with a chuckle, "Nine Inch Nails is a client of mine, and 
I'm afraid poor Lord Zedd wouldn't stand a chance against Trent. But I do 
happen to think he'd stand a pretty fair chance against Pink Floyd's pig."

'OLIVER!' WITH A TWIST; IF A 28-YEAR-OLD LONDON DIRECTOR DECONSTRUCTS THE 
CLASSIC LIONEL BART MUSICAL, CAN HE PUT IT BACK TOGETHER? APPARENTLY SO: IT'S 
SOLD $11 MILLION WORTH OF TICKETS BEFORE OPENING.

 "Half the people in Britain have seen this musical," Cameron Mackintosh says 
with an audible sigh. "And it seems the other half have actually been in it." 
</P>
<P>
 He is talking about "Oliver!," Lionel Bart's stage adaptation of Charles 
Dickens' novel, "Oliver Twist," which dealt with the poverty, crime and 
homeless children in early Victorian London. The musical made its debut in the 
West End in 1960, and was an instant hit, powered by memorable songs like 
"Consider Yourself," "As Long as He Needs Me," "Food, Glorious Food" and 
"You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two." Overnight, Bart became one of the biggest 
celebrities in Britain. It made a star of the hitherto obscure Ron Moody, who 
played the villainous Fagin. 
</P>
<P>
 A film version of "Oliver!" in 1968, also starring Moody, was a worldwide hit 
and won six Oscars. In Britain, especially, "Oliver!" is hugely familiar -- a 
reliable, crowd-pleasing choice for amateur dramatic groups and (perhaps 
because it calls for a large number of young boys in the chorus) high school 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 One might think that Mackintosh, the impresario who has staged "Cats," "Les 
Miserables" and "Miss Saigon" in recent years, is taking a big chance in 
launching a revival of such a familiar work -- especially in a lavish, 3.6 
million pounds ($5.6 million) West End production. Jonathan Pryce, the actor 
who became a musical theater star with the role of the Engineer in "Miss 
Saigon" and is now the new Fagin, admits that expectations are high. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone I meet these days seems to have been involved in 'Oliver!' in some 
way," he notes. "Only yesterday I was in a shop and a man introduced himself to 
me. He'd been a boy soprano and was on the soundtrack of the film. He was very 
proprietorial about it all, I must say." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Mackintosh's gamble has already paid off in strictly financial terms. 
Prior to its opening this Thursday at the London Palladium, a staggering 7 
million pounds ($11 million) of tickets have been sold and bookings are 
currently being taken for next summer. This puts it beyond doubt that the new 
"Oliver!" will be the biggest musical to hit London's West End since "Miss 
Saigon" (certainly bigger than Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard"). It 
appears that the British public, to echo Oliver Twist's famous phrase, really 
do "want some more." A transfer to American shores, while not being discussed 
yet, seems highly likely. 
</P>
<P>
 But will it be any good? Will it merely coast along for a year on the strength 
of the advance buzz, or will it be a long-running West End hit, like 
Mackintosh's other hits? The critics have yet to deliver their verdicts, but 
the scale of the show's success is ultimately up to one man: director Sam 
Mendes, 28. 
</P>
<P>
 And herein lies another possible pitfall for Mackintosh. Mendes is widely 
regarded as British theater's leading Wunderkind, but his reputation rests on 
brilliant work far removed from the commercial, high-visibility pressures of 
the West End musical. He directed highly praised Royal Shakespeare Company 
productions of "Troilus and Cressida" (with Ralph Fiennes), "The Tempest" and 
"Richard III," as well as Pinter's "The Birthday Party" at the National 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992 Mendes has been artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse, a 
250-seat theater in Covent Garden. There he has directed a successful reworking 
of the musical "Cabaret," with his girlfriend-actress Jane Horrocks (best known 
in America for the film "Life Is Sweet") in the Sally Bowles role. Even more 
notably, he received raves for the London production of the difficult Stephen 
Sondheim musical "Assassins," which stalled Off Broadway but which Mendes 
triumphantly restaged as a black farce. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so much bigger," he says of "Oliver!" "In rehearsals, I like to close 
the door behind me with two or three actors and get on with it. On this show, 
there are 25 people behind me -- and the cast and 48 kids on stage. You feel 
like you're in a fish tank sometimes. It's as if this is a different job 
altogether -- like you've sculpted in marble for 10 years and now you have to 
build a house." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the intrigue surrounding Mendes being hired to direct such a 
well-loved, familiar musical as "Oliver!" is his modus operandi in rehearsals; 
he likes to deconstruct theatrical works, strip them to their essentials and 
rethink them as he rebuilds them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to take the show apart and question everything," Mendes says. "That 
includes the tempo of the songs, the structure of the entire piece. You have to 
go back to a point where a song didn't exist. We know this is a hit show, a 
show which delivers. So why is it good? How do you make it better? I love 
challenging these icons of theater, like 'Cabaret' and 'Oliver!' Part of the 
thrill of theater is reinvention." 
</P>
<P>
 He has been as good as his word. This will be the first major production of 
"Oliver!" that has not employed the original revolving set designed by Sean 
Kenny, regarded in its time as startlingly ground-breaking. In 1960 Kenny hit 
on the notion (which now seems quite post-modern) of showing the audience the 
mechanics of scene-shifting and lighting changes; stagehands did their work in 
plain sight and doubled as members of the chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Mendes and Mackintosh approached designer Anthony Ward (with whom 
Mendes had worked at the RSC) to rethink the set; Ward, who describes himself 
as a minimalist, has come up with a variety of London scenes, creating an 
illusion of space through shifting perspectives. This alone will make the new 
"Oliver!" a very different show from audiences' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Mackintosh's decision to kill off the old "Oliver!" and allow a new one 
to be reborn. His association with the show goes back to 1965, when he worked 
as an assistant stage manager with a touring company; he was one of the singing 
stagehands. A decade later, when he had become a producer, he bought most of 
the performing rights to "Oliver!" and revived it in 1977 and 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 He then "retired" "Oliver!" for a decade and allowed no major productions 
during that time: "After (1983) I decided that wonderful though the show was, I 
was never going to be able to put new life into it without getting rid of 
Sean's set. That was a big decision, because it's one of the most brilliant 
ever designed. But the problem is that the set directs the show, and there 
would never be a chance of getting a top director to do another production if 
he had to be shunted around by that set." 
</P>
<P>
 Another crucial change has been wrought. The original "Oliver!" had no 
choreography, though the film featured dance sequences. Mendes brought in 
Matthew Bourne, who runs the British avant-garde dance troupe Adventures in 
Motion Pictures, to devise some "musical staging." "It's not choreography as 
such," he says. "But because everyone knows the film, we're having some dance, 
as long as it stems from realistic situations. Cameron said to integrate dance 
if it's necessary, rather than have gratuitous dance numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Bourne is 34, and was a babe in arms when "Oliver!" made its debut in 1960. 
Ward was only 3; Mendes would not be born for another five years. "It'll feel 
like a new show," Bourne predicts. "That's why Cameron picked a new set of 
younger people to rethink it. We don't come with the baggage of the original 
show in our memories." 
</P>
<P>
 The same would seem to apply to the cast; Pryce cheerfully admits he has never 
seen "Oliver!" on stage. Despite his success as the Engineer in "Miss Saigon," 
he is hardly a safe choice as Fagin; he remains best-known as a dramatic actor, 
who has played "Hamlet" and was the lead in Terry Gilliam's film "Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 "But the same is true of all of us," Pryce says. "Of all the principals in the 
cast, none is from the musical theater. Apart from me there's Sally Dexter and 
Miles Anderson (who play Nancy and Bill Sikes respectively) from the RSC. We're 
all actors, primarily." 
</P>
<P>
 Actors or children, anyhow. When "Oliver!" first opened in 1960, there were 
only 14 boys (from the workhouse or Fagin's gang) on stage. This new production 
calls for 24 boys, and British child employment laws now dictate that two 
Olivers and two parallel gangs of 24 must be used on different nights. "When I 
last did the show in 1977, 70% of the kids were 13 to 15, and the other 30% 
were under 13," says Mackintosh. "Now it's the opposite -- children have become 
much more precocious and aware. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's made life harder. Sam's been rehearsing with the children in the daytime 
and not calling the adults in the cast until the evening, when the kids go off 
to bed. It's made for some complicated logistics and very long working days." 
Not only that, the first two preview performances of "Oliver!" in mid-November 
had to be canceled because Fagin's gangs of child pickpockets needed more 
rehearsal time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Given these problems, some trepidation on the part of the "Oliver!" team is 
understandable and evident; Mendes has declared the Palladium auditorium a 
no-go area to outsiders during rehearsals. Visitors meet the principals in 
dressing rooms to which they are escorted via a route ensuring the sets are 
never seen. 
</P>
<P>
 For all this caution, one figure connected with the production remains 
cheerfully optimistic -- its creator, Lionel Bart. He has been retained on a 
consultancy basis by Mackintosh, has worked with Mendes on the script and has 
extended a couple of songs and lyrics. "It's going to be all right," says Bart 
perkily, his Cockney accent undimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 64 now and has been in the wilderness for two decades. After "Oliver!" 
his muse largely deserted him; his show "Blitz!" failed to repeat his success, 
and his musical "Twang!" was an unmitigated disaster. Bart declared bankruptcy, 
lost his rights to "Oliver!" and is now a recovering alcoholic who has suffered 
diabetes and an internal hemorrhage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam's vision is a bit darker and more real than my staging," he says. "It's 
hard for me to go in (to rehearsals) and not think of the original. But the one 
thing I don't say is: 'This is how we did it.' I've tried to be supportive, not 
a judge. I'm involved, yet I have to stand back." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard for Lionel," says Mendes. "Remember, he hasn't been in a 
rehearsal room for 20 years, and to a degree I think it's freaked him out. The 
scale of this show is something he's just not used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, talking to Bart indicates the degree to which the culture of big 
international musicals has changed since his heyday. Mackintosh's shows are run 
like a large-scale military operation, with each detail considered and even 
marginal aspects like publicity and merchandising thought out well ahead. Bart 
likes to say that the original "Oliver!" grew organically; in fact, it was born 
of chaos. He wrote four songs during rehearsals, and two more -- "It's a Fine 
Life" and "That's Your Funeral" -- in a 10-day pre-West End run at Wimbledon. 
Says Mendes: "He'll say, 'Oh, it was so organic,' and I'll think, 'Well, that's 
fine, Lionel. But this show can't be just organic anymore.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the overall mood of the company at this juncture is upbeat. As Pryce 
says, " 'Oliver!' is extraordinarily good material. That's why it's survived 
all this time and why it's so often performed." Mendes gushes: "Song after song 
delivers, and the show has real old-fashioned virtues -- conciseness, warmth, 
melodic simplicity, unpretentiousness. The music's uplifting, the whole thing's 
very life-affirming." 
</P>
<P>
 One might also add that the underlying themes of "Oliver!" -- poverty, 
homelessness, children on the streets -- are far more relevant to the London of 
today than in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that what the new team needs to do, above all, is not to 
interfere with the essence of "Oliver!" "Correct," says Mackintosh. "If people 
come out of this show saying it's as good as the original, I'll be happy and 
proud."

COVER STORY; WHO SAID ROMANCE WAS DEAD?; WITH 'DISCLOSURE,' MICHAEL DOUGLAS 
COMPLETES A TRILOGY OF MODERN MALE ANXIETY THAT INCLUDES 'FATAL ATTRACTION' AND 
'BASIC INSTINCT.' HOW DID HE FIND HIMSELF ON THE MOVIES' SEXUAL FOREFRONT?

 The couple is fully clothed, the man hovering directly above the woman. They 
are smiling, but they are not touching -- simultaneously attracted and 
eternally repelled, perfect polar opposites. "I love them because you don't 
know whether they're floating or falling," Michael Douglas says. He smiles his 
predatory smile, and the couple in the painting smiles back. On another of the 
canvases by painter Robert Yarber that hang in Douglas' office on the Paramount 
lot, a man and woman hold hands as they step off the edge of a cliff. Perhaps 
they are flying. 
</P>
<P>
 From where Douglas sits, up and down, in and out, even good and evil are all 
simply limits to be pushed. As Sharon Stone, his co-star in "Basic Instinct," 
said at the time of Douglas' ability to keep his tongue on the pulse of 
America, "I think we licked the outer edge of the envelope." 
</P>
<P>
 With the release of "Disclosure" this Friday, Douglas firmly affixes his stamp 
to the U.S. male as he has been delivered up to movie audiences over the past 
decade, completing the rough-trade triptych he began in 1987 with "Fatal 
Attraction," continued with "Basic Instinct" in 1992, and concludes -- 
violently, but without taking his pants off for a change -- with Demi Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love being politically incorrect," he says, "so I thought the reverse twist 
of changing the roles of sexual harassment would give people a way to look at 
the issue from a different point of view. Reversing the roles stops us from 
lining up simply on gender, and allows people to see the other side. I don't 
mean we should start feeling sorry for guys, but I think it helps everybody to 
look at the other side." 
</P>
<P>
 The film also goes so far over to the other side that only an actor of 
Douglas' seductive power could redeem it, suggesting that given enough sex and 
power, a woman can ruin a man's chance for career advancement. Douglas stars in 
the adaptation of the Michael Crichton novel as a mid-level computer-company 
executive whose ex-girlfriend Moore is brought in as his boss to help the 
company finesse a profitable merger; she also has plans for Douglas that have 
nothing to do with the furthering of his corporate career. As he did in "Fatal 
Attraction," Douglas plays a character who deceives his wife and imperils his 
family, and still leaves you rooting for him at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "His role is difficult because he's carrying the movie on his back," says 
"Disclosure's" director, Barry Levinson, "but he has the ability to make it 
look effortless. Having some big bravura emotional scene is easy, but it's very 
hard to take the audience through this movie, to tell this story, without the 
audience getting tired of looking at him. But Michael always seems to be 
saying, 'Watch me, look at me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It is a trick he learned from watching his father work, and then resisted 
using for nearly 20 years, from the time he became an actor in the late '60s 
until he made "Wall Street" in 1987, because he didn't want Hollywood to think 
of him first as the son of Kirk Douglas, known for playing some of Hollywood's 
most legendary heels and heavies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was a very conscious effort on my part to play these 
sensitive-young-men roles," Michael says of his early parts in features such as 
"Summertree," "Hail, Hero!" and "Adam at 6 a.m.," as well as his career-making 
sidekick role in ABC's '70s police series "The Streets of San Francisco." "I 
was trying very hard not to be what I most wanted to be, which is a pretty 
limiting way to live." 
</P>
<P>
 His father had cast a giant shadow, but when Michael finally emerged from it, 
it was by finding his own dark side. In "Wall Street," for which he won the 
best actor Oscar, he played greenmailer Gordon Gekko as a shark with all shiny 
surfaces, a brilliantine killer in a gray-green suit.  
</P>
<P>
 "It ain't the devil if it doesn't look good, because the devil's seductive, 
it's gorgeous," Douglas says. "That's what's interesting about the devil -- the 
evil. I'm fascinated by morality tales, that struggle. It's a theme that keeps 
popping up in my movies." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not all that keeps popping up in Douglas' films, of course; he has 
become the John Wayne of the gender war movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a gender war going on for a long time, and a lot of my pictures 
have been about that," he says. "Both sexes are having a tough time identifying 
their roles to themselves, much less to each other. I think a lot of guys are 
lost as to what their role is, and they're confused in terms of the signals 
they're getting from women. I also think they're concerned about losing their 
role as provider." 
</P>
<P>
 He is not speaking strictly about being the breadwinner here. "A woman can be 
artificially inseminated, she has milk and can feed, has cycles like the moon," 
he says. "She's much closer to the earth than men are. I do feel guys are lost 
because their role, in a lot of cases, is to be the worker bees, the drones." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether sexual or violent, Douglas has been living out the fantasies of the 
white, urban worker bee far more convincingly -- and therefore troublingly -- 
than many of the action-adventure figures who pass for leading men. In "Falling 
Down" he tapped into the volatile mixture ofcivility and rage that inform much 
of the urban discourse, and now in "Disclosure"he has entered the modern 
corporate hive and attempted to slay the queen bee. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When "Basic Instinct" was released, there were rumors that the movie's graphic 
sex scenes had so offended Diandra Douglas that it had created a rift in the 
couple's then-15-year marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 "None of that was true at all," Michael says. "I have a very understanding 
wife. Diandra may shake her head sometimes, but she's been extraordinarily 
supportive. You never want to embarrass people who are close to you, but sure, 
they get affected by all the dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 Diandra Douglas had not wanted her husband to take the part in the first 
place, and was even less thrilled when she saw the finished film. "It wasn't 
really my decision, if you know what I mean," she says by telephone from the 
office of her New York-based Wild Wolf Productions, for which she is writing 
and producing a film on the history of country music for Ted Turner. "I've 
never told my husband what roles he should take. He has his agenda, I have 
mine, and he doesn't often agree with my opinion. Certainly there's the issue 
of nudity, the sexual scenes. But there were things about the script that I 
found offensive as a woman. Sex was presented as a form of manipulation, and 
violent sex was portrayed in an accepted way." 
</P>
<P>
 When the couple, who have a 16-year-old son, Cameron, met in Washington the 
night before Jimmy Carter's inauguration almost 18 years ago, he was wearing 
his hair long and had a beard. Diandra had grown up in Spain with her mother, 
Patricia de Morell, who sailed sloops around the world, and was unfamiliar with 
the handsome young sidekick on "The Streets of San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was an artist, perhaps some kind of painter," she says. "It 
wasn't until the third day, when we got into this discussion about his work, 
that I found out he was an actor, which to me was not such a great thing, to 
tell you the truth. But I liked him by then, so it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
 She resisted Hollywood from the very beginning, and grew to love it less and 
less with time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighteen years ago there was a group of wild and crazy guys, partying a lot, 
they had the world spread out before them," she says. "There was Jack and 
Warren -- the group, the boys -- and he was part of that group. I should 
probably be telling you I love the Hollywood system, that I love the way they 
rank people, but I think there are certain stereotypes that aren't conducive to 
having relationships or a family." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those stereotypes is that the boys will be boys, only more so, and 
whenever possible. In September of 1992, less than six months after he appeared 
on the cover of Entertainment Weekly being shaved by a leggy blond model, 
Douglas checked himself into the Sierra Tucson Center in Arizona, where he was 
treated for what was described in several British newspapers and U.S. tabloids 
as an addiction to sex. Douglas reportedly agreed to seek therapy after his 
wife caught him in bed with a woman he had picked up in a bar at a Beverly 
Hills hotel. He checked in the next day under the name Mike Morell, which is 
his mother-in-law's last name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tabloids tied in a lot of innuendo," Douglas says. "It made for a cute 
story after 'Basic Instinct,' but none of that was true. I entered Sierra 
Tucson to treat the cumulative effects of 20 years of overwork and alcohol 
abuse. Until then, I had never had any counseling or therapy in my life. The 
program covers a wide range of issues, which is all I have to say about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's supposed to be some confidentiality and privacy that goes along with 
these programs, but unfortunately that doesn't seem to apply in my case." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Douglas' denial, his wife spoke openly of the effects of the rumors to 
the contrary on their marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult," she says. "If I said I enjoyed it, they should send me 
to the Sierra Tucson Center right away. If you have a marriage to a movie star, 
you have to accept that your life is under the microscope. I don't have the 
power to change it. I'm sure I could dwell on certain things that have been 
painful and humiliating, but I try not to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the exotica of the film community's colorful addictions, sexual 
compulsiveness is just the sort of thing that often is allowed to go untreated. 
It didn't really begin to seem, well, a little odd and very brave until he took 
the lead in "Disclosure," a role that required him to simulate submission to a 
sex act over which he had no control. It seemed a little like checking out of 
the Betty Ford Clinic to play the lead in a remake of "The Days of Wine and 
Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas says: "After 'Falling Down' I had taken a sabbatical and had not 
worked in two years. When I came back and looked at what was there, this was 
it. Quite honestly, I remember telling my agent, 'I think I've been down this 
road before, in one form or another.' But I have to remember that 'Fatal 
Attraction' was almost 10 years ago. In the ads they're calling 'Disclosure' 
the 'Fatal Attraction' of the '90s. That movie was like a signature of the 
whole decade, right? So it's not like I've been walking around with a raincoat 
on for the last 20 years, it's simply that a couple of pictures I did during 
that time were effectively done and left an impression." 
</P>
<P>
 What they left was more like a fault line running squarely down the center of 
the battlefield in the war between the sexes. But his films have frequently 
crossed borders into the heart of darkness, beginning with "One Flew Over the 
Cuckoo's Nest," the first of seven features he has produced. 
</P>
<P>
 His father had optioned the book years earlier, and turned it over to Michael, 
who spent four years nurturing the project while he appeared on "The Streets of 
San Francisco." When "Cuckoo's Nest" won the Academy Award for best picture in 
1975, Douglas suddenly found himself an Oscar-winning producer at 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas appeared in a number of forgettable films like "Coma," "The Star 
Chamber," "A Chorus Line," and "It's My Turn" after that, but was more 
successful as the producer of "The China Syndrome" and "Romancing the Stone," 
both of which he also appeared in. He hit his stride as a performer in 1987, 
when "Fatal Attraction" and "Wall Street" came out within three months of each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael dares to play what could be considered non-user-friendly roles," says 
Joel Schumacher, who directed Douglas as a mentally unbalanced protagonist in 
"Falling Down" last year. "At no point did he come to me and ask if the 
character could be made more sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of actors can do rage, but they telegraph it so it's no surprise to the 
audience when they step out of a car and start destroying L.A. I think a lot of 
the controversy surrounding 'Falling Down' was caused by people's confusion 
about whether Michael was playing the good guy or the bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even his trio of baddest guys -- in "Fatal Attraction," "Basic Instinct" and 
now "Disclosure" -- usually have audiences rooting for them in the final reel, 
just as those closest to Douglas quietly pull for him as he works through his 
own moral ambiguities, often in front of millions of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often ask myself why he's picked those roles," says Diandra Douglas. "And I 
still don't know the answer. I think they've made it more difficult for me to 
live my life. I would be lying to you if I said this is every woman's dream." 
</P>
<P>
 As an actor, Douglas is every woman's dream because he isn't afraid to share 
the screen with them as equals. "He's one of the few actors that works very 
well with women," says Levinson. "A lot of actors don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if it would be fair to say he has enhanced the careers of many of his 
leading ladies, Douglas quickly replies, "I think you can. With all the 
complaints women have about roles in films, please don't talk to me about that, 
not with my record. I love, and have always felt very comfortable, working with 
ladies. And not a lot of guys do." 
</P>
<P>
 He does not have his own shelf at video stores like many of the other leading 
men, and his recent withdrawal from the pirate movie "Cutthroat Island" in 
favor of "The American President" will further narrow the niche he occupies. 
"He's not so exotic that, as a hero, you can't accept him at face value," 
Levinson says. "He has a certain degree of vulnerability, not just a macho 
sensibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas speaks slowly in a whiskey voice, as if someone had told him once that 
rushing betrayed a lack of confidence. He cannot seem to help squirming in his 
chair, however, and his fingers are constantly running through that improbable 
upsweep of caramel-colored hair. Occasionally, he has to get up and walk around 
the office, saying the coffee he's been sipping is too strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have anger in me, definitely," he says. "I try to channel it in productive 
ways. It's a stimulant, it's a way that you keep going longer and harder and 
further than you normally would. But time will show it can be exhausting, and 
take its toll. Sometimes there are easier ways to do it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 He was 5 when Kirk and Diana Douglas divorced. "I think the divorce caused a 
lot of anger with him," says his mother, now Diana Darrid. "He had been a very 
tractable child before that, but he began to have some problems. I finally took 
him to a child psychologist, who told me he wasn't seriously disturbed but that 
I needed to ease back on the discipline. He still has some residual anger. It's 
not completely resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas spent most of his childhood in Connecticut with his mother and 
stepfather, visiting his father on holidays from school. "I think he made every 
effort he could to be responsible, and given that he was an absentee father, to 
be there," Michael says. "But my father's up to 78 pictures now, and I don't 
think I have 25, so the workload was intense. It was show-biz, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 As a prince of Hollywood, there was also a certain amount of show-biz at home. 
Hayley Mills was Douglas' 16th-birthday date, and Candice Bergen lived across 
the street in Beverly Hills. "They were used to a much more luxurious life in 
California," says Douglas' mother. "One time Michael came home from a stay in 
Beverly Hills and left his dirty clothes lying around on the floor. I told him 
to pick them up, and he said, 'Gee, Dad has a butler to pick up his socks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He spent a long time loudly proclaiming his independence from what he now 
refers to as "the biz" with the practiced ease of the insider. "When he was in 
prep school, he didn't join the drama club," his mother says. "He would always 
say, 'I'm going to be something sensible, like a lawyer.' "  
</P>
<P>
 It was that sensibility that illuminated his performance in "Fatal Attraction" 
years later. "That was a picture that's close to who you are, as opposed to 
some picture where you're a jet fighter pilot or a homicide detective," he 
says. "I was just a schmucky lawyer in New York. For me, it was like, 'Oh, I 
know that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He came to acting reluctantly when the dean of UC Santa Barbara called him in 
during "the third year of my junior year" and suggested it would be a good time 
for him to declare a major. He selected theater because it sounded easy. "I 
don't know whether I was lying to myself for all the years I totally denied 
ever having any interest in it," Douglas says, "but I began working at it, 
painfully at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to do plays and keep a wastebasket offstage, so I could puke and then 
go out and do it," he says. "Once I jumped aboard it was not a lot of laughs. 
The risk element takes away a lot of the fun. When you're flying without a net 
you can't be laughing the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 At 50, he has begun to allow himself the occasional reflective smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty good, looking around," he says. "Who else is still standing at 
50? I look at the opportunities in acting, I see how far you can go, and I feel 
excited, like I'm just getting my second wind." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas and his producing partner, Steve Reuther, started their own production 
company six months ago, and have signed a deal with Paramount to deliver 12 to 
14 pictures over the next four years. It is, according to one source, "the best 
actor deal in town," because Douglas can make any movie he wants without 
getting a studio green light, and can choose to star in them or not, while 
retaining the right to continue working at other studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've found a way to marry my two careers," Douglas says, "which have 
always been on separate tracks to a certain degree. When I had my success as a 
producer, people always wanted to know why I wanted to be an actor. And when I 
got some success as an actor, people asked me why I still wanted to produce. 
It's always made some people uncomfortable that I won't just be one thing or 
the other." 
</P>
<P>
 He is also finally developing a picture that he and his father will star in 
together, perhaps as soon as next year, although he doesn't have a script yet. 
"It's something we both wanted to do, we just never found anything," he says. 
"We've been looking for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 It may have taken until Kirk Douglas was 77 for Michael to feel comfortable 
standing shoulder to shoulder with his father under the bright lights. "My 
father had a very strong, dynamic persona. I've done some therapy now, and I'm 
sure that part of one's ambition when one has a father as successful as mine is 
to achieve one's own sense of identity. But I've never felt competition from 
him, only support and love." 
</P>
<P>
 His office is almost completely dark now, but Douglas does not turn on the 
light. With "Disclosure," he has finished what he calls "my long, dark run," 
but he is never far from the shadow in which he has lived his entire life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always led with my instincts," he says, "and they haven't let me down. 
On some of these pictures, I felt like, 'Is the audience really going to buy 
this?' But there's an edge there that is stimulating and exciting -- you feel 
alive. Sometimes I feel like it's not worth making unless it's dangerous. But I 
mean it's not like you're a thrill-seeker."  
</P>
<P>
 He brings both his hands up and slowly pushes his fingers through his hair, 
creating a small nimbus of light. "Or maybe you are."

OPERA AT WARP SPEED; IT'S NOT THE NUDITY, ROUGH SEX OR A RESISTANCE TO NEW 
IDEAS THAT MAKE 'ROSA' AND SIMILAR WORKS CONTROVERSIAL -- IT'S THE WAY MUSIC 
MEETS THE STAGE, CREATING A NEW KIND OF OPERATIC EXPERIENCE. 
</P>

<P>
 Last month Netherlands Opera offered the world premiere in Amsterdam of a new 
opera, "Rosa," a collaboration between Holland's best-known composer -- 
aggressive minimalist Louis Andriessen -- and iconoclastic British filmmaker 
Peter Greenaway. On the surface there seems nothing particularly remarkable 
about that fact. New operas are presented all the time these days. Also any 
number of major film directors, including Francis Ford Coppola and Robert 
Altman, have been drawn to the lyric stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The opera, however, proved a sensation, generating a considerable wave of 
international attention, and even managed to somewhat scandalize the generally 
sophisticated Dutch audiences. Artistic directors from both the Brooklyn 
Academy of Music and Lincoln Center went to Amsterdam to hear it, and a 
question much asked in operatic circles around New York these days is whether 
"Rosa" could possibly be performed in America, given the current political 
attitude toward what is and is not appropriate in art. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just that "Rosa" contains a fair amount of nudity and rough sex. That 
kind of thing, while perhaps not commonplace, does find its way, now and then, 
into mainstream opera companies. Angelenos may remember Maria Ewing's strip in 
"Salome" at the Music Center, and the same soprano is currently at the 
Metropolitan Opera titillating audiences with her provocative lustiness in some 
soft-core Shostakovich, a new production of "Lady Macbeth of Mtsenk." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it potential audience resistance to new work. That seems to be 
something nearly forgotten. Even the major American opera companies, which 
traditionally had been far less inclined to produce new work than many of their 
European counterparts, have been enjoying remarkable success with new operas in 
recent years, albeit conservative in tone and style. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, three seasons ago, when the Met staged John Corigliano's "The Ghosts 
of Versailles," its first premiere in a quarter-century, the company found 
itself with an instant hit, so much so that the company made a sudden decision 
to televise it, and now the opera is returning this season. Nearly as popular 
have been William Bolcom's "McTeague" in Chicago two years ago and, earlier 
this season, Conrad Susa's "Dangerous Liaisons" in San Francisco (which already 
has been televised). Houston Grand Opera thrives on regular doses of opera that 
is of our time. 
</P>
<P>
 No, what makes "Rosa" shocking is that it really offers something new in 
opera. Although perfectly accessible, it is altogether different in the way it 
uses music and the stage, in its very conception of opera, from these other new 
audience-pleasing operas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is "Rosa" alone. This season there have been other new operas -- Robert 
Ashley's four-part "Now Eleanor's Idea," the conclusion to a 20-hour mega-opera 
ultimately intended for television in its final form; Philip Glass' "La Belle 
et la Bete," a curious opera literally performed to the classic Cocteau film; 
John Moran's authentically weird TV-age "Mathew in the School of Life," and Tod 
Machover's high-tech extravaganza of opera as magic act for Penn & Teller -- 
each in some way radically reinventing opera for our age and perhaps the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases -- actually in most cases -- they hardly look or sound like 
opera at all. With the exception of "Rosa," they are not intended for the 
traditional opera house, the traditional opera conductor, the traditional opera 
singer or the traditional opera-goer. (And "Rosa" pretty much wreaks havoc with 
most of those traditions.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, these new operas are more likely to play to other sensibilities and at 
other venues, to be suited more for adventurous audiences and alternative 
spaces. (Machover's opera had its premiere at the Media Laboratory of the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.) 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas an opera like "The Ghosts of Versailles" is opera about opera and its 
conventions, these new operas are about life and culture as they exist today. 
They acknowledge the fact that everyone goes to movies and watches television 
and that, in the age of multimedia, we are beginning to process information, 
audio and visual, very differently than we did in the past. They are works that 
contend that opera itself must change, and because of them it surely will. 
</P>
<P>
 Media and technology are the key elements that tie all these operas together. 
But that is nothing new for operatic progress. Opera has always responded to 
the changes in the other arts and culture in general, as well as to the 
advancements of technology. One could, for instance, study the evolution of the 
art form as related to the development of stage lighting -- from the way 
flickering candlelight reflects elaborate Baroque ornamentation to the 
influence greater lighting possibilities had for Wagner's concept of opera as 
total artwork to the effect Robert Wilson's intense luminosity had on Philip 
Glass' early operatic work. 
</P>
<P>
 Since film and television are the common denominators of our culture, they are 
also inescapable in the latest opera aesthetic. In "Rosa," for instance, 
Greenaway, who wrote its libretto and directed and designed it, has taken the 
interaction between film and music theater to a new level, and then from there 
all the way over the top. Not only does the opera use actual film as an 
integral part of its narrative, but the opera is also structured like a film, 
lasting the typical unbroken two-hour length of a film. There is even a staged 
bit resembling the credits at the end of a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 More remarkable, still, Greenaway, who is also a visual artist, employs here 
the whole range of his obsessions, obsessions that would seem realizable only 
on the screen. The work is based upon the murder of an obscure Brazilian 
composer, Juan Manuel de Rosa, who had studied seriously in Paris but wound up 
in Uruguay writing music for Hollywood Westerns and was found shot in an 
abandoned abattoir in Fray Bentos. As Greenaway envisions the crime, Rosa, 
captivated by the Western films he scores, is shot by two cowboys in the film 
as he projects it. 
</P>
<P>
 As anyone familiar with such Greenaway films as "The Cook, the Thief, His Wife 
& Her Lover" will by now have already suspected, "Rosa" is quite a nasty piece 
of work. Rosa is infatuated with his horse, which he keeps housed in a 
treadmill contraption. Rosa's fiancee, Esmeralda, spends most of the opera 
nude, paints herself black to look like a horse and does a lot of neighing. In 
the end, she is stuffed into Rosa's horse, the composer's dead body draped over 
it, and set on fire in what just might be the most malevolent immolation scene 
in all of opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Greenaway's vision gets most of the attention in the theater. But 
what really makes "Rosa" so shocking (movies, after all, commonly display 
worse) is that "Rosa" is opera. While the artifice of the stage is always 
apparent, there is something absolutely devastating about the fact that those 
are opera singers, singing, while doing -- or being the victims of -- the 
unspeakable acts onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rosa" is a genuine opera. Andriessen's score is forceful, intricate and 
angry, and it doesn't loosen its grip upon the listener for a second. But the 
relationship of music to the staging is a radical one. While the strong score 
drives the drama and has its own integrity, it also inevitably functions, under 
such extreme circumstances, as a heightened soundtrack, and its ambiguous 
nature produces an altogether new kind of operatic experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Glass' "La Belle et la Bete" -- which recently completed a European tour and 
will have its American premiere on Wednesday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music 
(with an eventual American tour, although no dates or cities have yet been set) 
-- also takes its originality from reinterpreting the relationships between 
music and film. Here, Glass has simply set an opera to Cocteau's screenplay, 
using singers and his ensemble players performing live to a screening of the 
film, turning the movie into an opera it had never intended to be. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This too alters our perception of opera in several different ways at the same 
time. It obviously changes the film dramatically, removing not just Georges 
Auric's original score but also the actors' voices. It adds that special 
heightened effect that live music, synchronized to film, can have. 
</P>
<P>
 But the very nature of the project also profoundly influenced the kind of 
music Glass wrote, since his vocal lines had to be designed so that they could 
fit the delivery of the actors on the screen. The final result is supposed to 
make the original actors now seem like singers. And so the music itself becomes 
not exactly recitative but not song either. It is a paradoxical kind of singing 
that is entirely artificial in its relationship to the film (where one expects 
speaking), yet far less artificial than typical operatic singing since the 
rhythm and pacing of the vocal lines are so closely tied to the pacing of 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 That fascinating area between speech and song is the most spectacularly and 
thoroughly investigated in Robert Ashley's operas. These operas are, in fact, 
one great opera, "Ring"-sized in length and as elaborate a narrative. Their 
subject matter, however, is the utterly mundane. Their characters are bank 
tellers and lowriders and various other unlikely operatic subjects. But their 
highly stylized texts, in which the mundane becomes poetry, are presented in an 
incandescent, trance-inducing manner that transforms all it touches into a sort 
of futuristic chant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley's vocal style is a unique sung speech. Singers are given certain 
harmonic areas and key pitches, occasionally melodies, but the singer also 
participates in creating his or her own vocal line and style. The "orchestra" 
is a richly and subtlety textured background blend. Voices often intertwine, 
with each other and with melody, with chant and with speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The four final operas in the project, the collective "Now Eleanor's Idea," 
conclude a trilogy that began with "Atalanta" and "Perfect Lives"; they may be 
performed live, as they were in an elegant, static staging at BAM last month, 
but are ultimately intended as an epic, serial television opera. Only the seven 
short "Perfect Lives" operas have been made as video thus far, but there is 
every indication that when the project is completed it will be the Joycean epic 
of the new video age. 
</P>
<P>
 John Moran, a young composer and protege of Philip Glass, also transforms 
television images into opera but in a far less elegant, more Generation X 
manner. He has already, before turning 30, produced an opera based on "The Jack 
Benny Show" and one on the life of Charles Manson that was originally also to 
include characters from "Hawaii Five-O" (until CBS refused him permission). 
They are operas that were written not for opera singers but for a theatrical 
troupe, the Ridge Theater. The musical voices are usually electronic. A 
favorite effect is the use of spoken voice (often from television) 
electronically altered and then repeated over and over, as the actors too 
repeat their motions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mathew in the School of Life," Moran, who plays Mathew, is a robotic 
creature who it seems is on his way to something messianic. (The first of its 
three intended parts had its premiere at the alternative space the Kitchen in 
October.) 
</P>
<P>
 So completely strange is the effect of the electronically produced score, with 
its constant allusions to popular culture, and this virtuoso troupe of faux 
opera characters, that it gives the impression of watching an entertainment 
from another planet. And yet, while there is not one aspect about Moran's work 
that one could call traditionally operatic, there is the curious sense, in 
watching it, that it could be nothing but opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to such experimentation, Tod Machover's opera for Penn & Teller is 
little more than a Las Vegas stage act, and that is where it will surely wind 
up, when the magicians ultimately incorporate it into their regular repertoire. 
Penn & Teller do actually sing some lines but nothing you'd actually want to 
hear. Penn produces a pained kind of rock 'n' roll recitative, accompanying 
himself on his electric bass, while the usually silent Teller is an even more 
pained mysterious voice of Houdini from beyond the grave. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this opera had its premiere in October as part of a prestigious and 
influential symposium offered by the Media Laboratory at MIT. Participants 
ranged from Laurie Anderson to Sony Chief Executive Officer Michael P. Schulhof 
to National Endowment for the Arts Chairman Jane Alexander. Even Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.) dropped by on a campaign stop. The audience seemed to include 
just about every CD-ROM developer in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Machover, a prominent composer at the Media Lab who organized the symposium, 
is one of the most interesting and inventive composers using new media -- his 
concerto for hyper-viola (an electronically extended instrument) was performed 
two seasons ago by the Los Angeles Philharmonic. For this occasion he, with the 
help of his engineering colleagues, created a sort of throne that made music 
just by having someone wave an arm in the vicinity, something that inspired 
great histrionics from Penn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The significance of this opera is not just that it was seen, and rapturously 
enjoyed, by many of the people who will be responsible for the vessels culture 
comes in in the future but that Machover could actually create an opera -- and 
one that had interesting music produced by the goofy machine that completely 
upstaged the amusing performers -- intended to be part of a pop nightclub act. 
</P>
<P>
 For Machover, this was nothing more than a bit of good-natured slumming. He is 
a serious composer who has written a short, captivating opera based upon Philip 
K. Dick's visionary science-fiction novel "Valis" and is now developing a new 
opera in collaboration with Peter Sellars. He is a highly versatile composer 
who seems to be able to incorporate Boulezian complexity and rock 'n' roll in 
his work. One of the most sophisticated composers working with technology 
today, he is part of a research organization with backing from the leaders in 
the media industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera, thanks to Machover, has a place in that corporate technological view of 
the future. He even heads what is called Opera of the Future Group. But while 
that is only one vision of the future, the implications are clear. Opera is an 
art form that is rushing into the future maybe faster and more aggressively 
than any time since Wagner proclaimed his the future. And, although you won't 
find it in the big opera houses yet (Houston Grand Opera had originally 
commissioned the Machover-Sellars project, then backed down), the future is 
already here with some important and potentially lasting new work.

VOICES: 'IT'S IN THE BLOOD'; THREE GENERATIONS OF DELGADOS HAVE CRAFTED GUITARS 
FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From behind a battered storefront in an otherwise nondescript stretch of 
Avenida Cesar Chavez in East Los Angeles, the Delgado family has been helping 
some of the world's most famous musicians perfect their craft for more than a 
quarter of a century. Since 1947, three generations of Delgados -- Porfirio, 
Candelario and Tomas -- have crafted handmade guitars for the likes of Los 
Lobos, Jose Feliciano, Arlo Guthrie, Los Romeros, Glen Campbell and Andres 
Segovia. Porfirio and his brother taught themselves how to make guitars through 
a long process of trial and error in their native Durango, Mexico. They later 
moved to Juarez, where they opened a shop and gained such wide acclaim that 
Mexican film star Cantinflas once dropped by to pick up an instrument. But it 
was in Los Angeles, where they opened Candelas Guitars, that Porfirio, 81, 
passed on his love and talent for guitar making to son Candelario. The son, now 
50, did the same with his son Tomas, 24, who now manages the family business, 
handcrafting instruments that sell for as much as $4,500. Recently, Candelario 
Delgado talked about the passion and precision of his art with Times Staff 
Writer Kevin Baxter.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since I was a little kid -- I mean real small -- I always had either a ukulele 
or a mandolin or something to play with around the house. And I always hung 
around the shop. I was baptized at the guitar shop in Juarez. I grew up in it 
and it became part of me. I would hang around the shop and glue this little 
part and glue that. But I would also pick up the instrument and play a chord or 
two or something. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a guitar maker was not something that I was brought up to be. You just 
have it. It was in my blood. And once it gets into your blood, you can't get 
rid of it. I had a very, very good job. I was gone for three years in the Army 
and when I came back I was working in electronics. But I kept going back to the 
shop, going back to the shop. Finally, I figured out I wanted to work making my 
own instruments, my own guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an art, but it's a dying art. I was really surprised when my son 
decided he wanted to do this. He actually came back to the shop when he was 
between jobs. He said he was going to spend some time here until he got this 
other thing lined up. And he surprised himself and he surprised me that he 
really liked it. He won't quit now. About 80% of the people that buy 
instruments from us are not professionals. But they are artists. They love the 
art. They play the music with feeling. They sing. And in their own way, they're 
artists. So we build the instruments for them. And it becomes so personal. You 
become very attached to the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 You go and buy a factory-made instrument and you know very well it's not 
something people put their heart and feeling into. But if it's something that I 
built or that my son built, it's in the blood. Then you got that feeling behind 
it. It becomes part of me, but I'm building it for another person. It feels 
like building a masterpiece for somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 When I'm building an instrument, nobody touches it. I mean nobody touches my 
instruments when I'm working on one. Same thing with my son Tomas, same thing 
with my father. You have your own ideas and you know what you want to build, 
you know what kind of sound you want for the person who's going to play the 
instrument. So you put a lot of yourself into it to build it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't have the art, the love for the art, you're just going to become 
another maker that's making them all exactly the same. You just can't build a 
guitar like everybody else because it would just be a guitar like everybody 
else's. When you build this type of instrument, like we build, you have to know 
what you want. You have to know what kind of sound you want. You have to know 
what your goal is. Then you have to know what kind of wood to use and how to 
combine them. How thick to leave it. How much bracing do you put inside? What 
type of bracing you put inside. You only learn that with time and love for the 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 When you have all the feeling and the heart to make it, every guitar is a 
little different. Because with every guitar, you felt you were going to try 
something different and you were going to build something different. That's 
where the art comes in. And the love, really.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of my life, I've been here (in Los Angeles). I know very little about 
Mexico. But I know the music, I love the music, I feel it when I play and when 
I sing. It was something that my father started and that he perfected so much. 
</P>
<P>
 Like guitar making, guitar playing and singing and all that has changed a lot. 
Now it's very, very advanced. Like Los Lobos. Los Lobos play a big, big 
variation of instruments because they use different types of music. If they 
want to play musica romantica, they go to the requintos . If they want to play 
norteno, they go to the bajo sextos. If they want to play veracruzano, they go 
to the jarana, the requinto jarocho. Even Los Lobos guitarist Cesar (Rojas), 
for some kind of mariachi music, plays a guapanguera, a gitarra de golpe, that 
nowadays most people don't even know what it is. But they had studied it so 
much, they actually use the traditional instrument. And we are the ones that 
know how to make them.

CALENDAR: MOVIES; A FACE THAT TELLS THE STORY; THE SWISS-BORN ACTRESS IRENE 
JACOB HAS A REMARKABLE ABILITY TO EXPRESS HER CHARACTERS' EMOTIONAL UPHEAVALS 
WITH VERY FEW WORDS.

 If you saw Krzysztof Kieslowski's new film, "Red," and fell in love with 
actress Irene Jacob -- it's hard to imagine anyone seeing the film and not 
being enchanted by her -- you'll be happy to hear that off-screen, the 
28-year-old actress is a lot like Valentine, her character in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Radiantly beautiful, of course -- anybody can see that like Valentine, Jacob 
is a knockout. But the subtler qualities that illuminate Jacob's character in 
the film -- her modesty, her thoughtfulness and sensitivity -- are part of 
Jacob as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Most memorably seen in Kieslowski's 1991 film, "The Double Life of Veronique" 
(for which she won that year's best actress award at Cannes), the Swiss-born 
Jacob comes across during an interview in a Westwood hotel as an empathetic 
woman of great intelligence. It's not surprising to learn that her favorite 
actresses are Gena Rowlands, Giulietta Masina and Ingrid Bergman -- Jacob has a 
luminous grace evocative of those stellar women. 
</P>
<P>
 Making her film debut in 1987 with a small part in Louis Malle's "Au Revoir, 
Les Enfants," Jacob has worked nonstop since then, appearing in six films. None 
of them, however, has made use of her talents as fully as "Red" does. 
</P>
<P>
 The final film in Kieslowski's trilogy based on the three colors of the French 
flag -- which represent liberty (blue), equality (white) and fraternity -- 
"Red," which opened Friday, co-stars Jacob with Jean-Louis Trintignant in the 
story of the relationship between a model and a retired judge. Exploring the 
themes of destiny and loneliness, the film is ultimately a moving meditation on 
how mysterious love is, and how it often arrives unheralded from the most 
unexpected quarters looking nothing like we'd imagined it would. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main character in the film is the relationship between this woman and the 
judge because they reveal themselves through each other," Jacob says. "Without 
them together we don't know who they are and wouldn't care. 
</P>
<P>
 "In life, it's often the case that we don't know who we are until we meet some 
other person," she says. "Sometimes we're ready for them, sometimes we're not, 
but we depend on these meetings in the quest to discover ourselves. When 
Kieslowski directed us, he wasn't so interested in what Jean-Louis or I were 
doing -- he was interested in capturing the way these two people were affecting 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob's compelling presence in "Red" is doubly impressive when one realizes 
that hers is a reactive role that gives her little to do other than listen when 
she's spoken to, and observe life going on around her. Using nothing more than 
her expressive face, she telegraphs the upheavals of the soul this woman is 
experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge is important to Valentine because he asks her really important 
questions. She's hungry for this because her life isn't satisfying to her," 
Jacob says. "Her mother lives in another country, she has a boyfriend but he's 
away, and her work doesn't require anything deep from her. She feels alone but 
can do nothing about it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly this man involves her on a profound level, and this is the first 
gift he gives. His next gift is teaching her that there are limits to what you 
can do and that you can't interfere in everybody's life." 
</P>
<P>
 In watching the film, one is struck by the fact that its two main characters, 
as well as two minor ones, are alone virtually all the time. They are alone in 
their cars, in their apartments, doing errands, walking their dogs; their 
moments of connection with others invariably occur over the telephone. Indeed, 
the telephone, the 20th Century's great vehicle of controlled intimacy, is a 
central character in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically we are alone -- even with people we love, there is a limit to our 
closeness," Jacob says. "Kieslowski said this film could be called 'short 
stories of the telephone,' and I think most of us lead this kind of life today. 
It's tempting to say man lives a lonelier, more isolated existence today than 
he did 100 years ago, but look at 'Madame Bovary' -- no, man was plagued by 
loneliness then too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The characters in Kieslowski's films are almost always alone," she adds, 
"because basically what interests him is to find his character alone, not 
knowing what to do." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 'Red" marks a rare appear ance for Trintignant, who became a star in 1956 with 
his performance opposite Bridget Bardot in Roger Vadim's "And God Created 
Woman." Subsequent starring roles in art-house classics such as "A Man and a 
Woman" and "Z" won him an international following; however, Trintignant has 
worked infrequently in recent years because of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up seeing Jean-Louis' films -- 'The Conformist' and 'My Night at 
Maud's' are my favorites -- so it was wonderful working with him," Jacob says. 
"Because of qualities in Jean-Louis, he was able to bring so much to the 
character of the judge -- you can feel the curiosity and compassion beneath his 
pain and cynicism, and he makes you like very much a man who initially seems 
unlikable. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of the film it almost seems that these two people are in a state 
of deep love, but Kieslowski wanted them to maintain a distance," she says. "He 
didn't want us to imagine they'll now start a life together -- he wanted them 
separated by time. Because this is a film about fraternity, Kieslowski wanted 
to look at two people who have no reason to be involved with one another, but 
who share something really important. Ultimately, it's a very optimistic film 
because it's rooted in the belief that people can affect each other." 
</P>
<P>
 With the completion of "Red," Kieslowski vowed that he had made his last film. 
Anyone familiar with the 53-year-old director's works -- his 10-film study of 
the Ten Commandments, "The Decalogue," for instance, or "Veronique" -- is no 
doubt hoping he won't keep his word. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so tired after doing three films in a row ("Red" was preceded by the 
release, since last December, of "Blue" and "White") that he didn't want to 
involve himself again in the process of writing, shooting and editing," Jacob 
says. "I hope he won't feel obliged to stick by his declaration if he changes 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kieslowski has an extraordinarily generous way of working," she continues. 
"He listens to people with great care and uses words himself sparingly. He 
doesn't talk about his story because he's trying to touch elusive and delicate 
feelings. He's interested in the difficulties of life -- loneliness, 
separation, contradiction -- and he tries to speak about these things in a 
concrete way."  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jacob was born in Geneva in 1966, the youngest child and only girl among four 
children. Her father was a physicist, her mother a psychologist, and Jacob says 
she was raised in a Protestant family that "had a revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 "My family was very shy with feelings and never spoke about them, but we 
evolved a little bit. I think part of the reason I was attracted to theater was 
because I wanted to be close to stories because they could help me relate to my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob's interest in performing was ignited when she was 12 and saw the films 
of Charlie Chaplin. "They took my heart," she recalls. "They made me laugh and 
cry, and this was exactly what I was waiting for in a film, to awaken me to my 
feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984 Jacob earned the equivalent of a two-year college degree in languages 
(she speaks English, German, Italian and French); then, at the age of 18, she 
moved to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved to Paris because I wanted to live in an artistic environment where I 
could express myself and argue, and I couldn't find this in Switzerland.  
</P>
<P>
 "I arrived there and it was very lonely for me, despite the fact that my 
brother who's a musician was also living there (her other two brothers are 
scientists). I got a job selling things like dictionaries over the phone and 
enrolled full time at a national drama school. This school was free if you 
passed the audition, which I fortunately did." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years after her arrival in Paris, Jacob was cast in "Au Revoir, Les 
Enfants," and her career has been roaring along at full throttle ever since. 
After wrapping "Red" in 1993, she took nine months off and did a lot of reading 
(Tolstoy, Balzac, Singer and several autobiographies), but since that break she 
has completed two more films. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, she completed "All Men Are Mortal," an adaptation of the novel by 
Simone de Beauvoir, which was shot in Budapest and also stars Stephen Rea. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a wonderful actor," she says of Rea. "He's really very shy, but we had a 
lovely time -- he's quite generous as a partner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play an ambitious actress who's never satisfied," she says of the film. 
"One day she meets this man in the street who's a bum and they have a romance. 
It so happens that this man is immortal -- but he, too, is ultimately mortal 
inside, in that his capacity to love has limits. De Beauvoir wrote this book 
just after World War II and in a sense it was about the survivors of the war 
who were unable to reinvolve themselves in life." 
</P>
<P>
 From Budapest, Jacob went directly to the Berlin set of "Victory," an 
adaptation of a Joseph Conrad story directed by Mark Peploe, for release next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's set at the beginning of the century and I play a violinist in an 
all-girl orchestra in the Far East," says Jacob of the film, which also stars 
Willem Dafoe and Sam Neill.  
</P>
<P>
 "This girl falls in love with the character played by Willem Dafoe, who is a 
very difficult man unwilling to open himself to love. She has a very sad life, 
yet she still has trust, and this is often the case with our heroes. Tolstoy 
said that heroes are those who fight against inner death -- which is to stop 
believing in love and trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob will soon head for the south of France to shoot a sequence in "Beyond 
the Clouds," a film composed of five short stories that will be co-directed by 
Wim Wenders and Michelangelo Antonioni. Based on an idea by Antonioni, the 
script was co-written by both directors. From there, she'll head for the set of 
a film directed by Trintignant's ex-wife, Nadine Trintignant, which stars his 
daughter, Marie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the way, she hopes she'll have a minute to see her family, to 
whom she remains close.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not long ago I went to see my grandparents and I was very sad that day 
because of a separation," she recalls. "As I was leaving, my grandfather said, 
'Goodby, Irene -- you will find more pain!' He thought this was the most 
reassuring thing he could say to me, and I laughed despite how sad I was 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, you can be deep in serious thought one minute, and laughing the 
next, and this is something I try to remember in my work," she says. "I always 
try to touch these two things; our lightness of being which is sometimes 
unbearable, and our depth which is surprising and admirable."

CITY SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS; SYLMAR GETS ITS REVENGE AND A SPOT IN THE 4-A 
FINALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, Durell Price stood on the Sylmar High football field, openly 
sobbing on his brother Deon's shoulder after a one-point loss to Carson High in 
a City Section 4-A Division semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night, Price personally made sure history did not repeat itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 215-pound junior running back rushed for 237 yards and four 
touchdowns in 25 carries to lead Sylmar's 27-19 victory over Carson in front of 
a capacity crowd at Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Spartans (13-0) will face Crenshaw in the championship game 
Saturday at El Camino College in Torrance.  
</P>
<P>
 Price, like the rest of his teammates, drew motivation from last year's 22-21 
loss to Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We practiced with 22-21 on the scoreboard all week," Price said. "I couldn't 
get it out of my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Price, also a starting middle linebacker, benefited from outstanding line play 
in addition to down-field blocks by receivers Mike Cervantes and Eddie Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson (4-9), which forfeited three regular-season victories for using an 
ineligible player, made a fourth-quarter run at Sylmar, but could not come up 
with the big play. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson pulled to 27-19 on a seven-yard pass from Ramon Rodgers to Llewellyn 
Miller and an extra-point with 2 minutes, 18 seconds remaining.

FILM CLIPS: THE FENTON CHRONICLES; COMPOSER A 'VAMPIRE' VICTIM TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steven Smith 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think you know the score on "Interview With the Vampire's" conflict-filled 
production? 
</P>
<P>
 Buried amid the screams of Anne Rice fans over the casting of Tom Cruise as 
Lestat, a less-publicized blood war was being waged just a month before the 
film's opening -- as director Neil Jordan and producer David Geffen rejected 
the score of George Fenton ("Gandhi," "The Fisher King"), a frequent Jordan 
collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think George is very talented," Geffen says, "but he didn't hit the 
bull's-eye on this movie. (The score) was too dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitting: New York-based Elliot Goldenthal, who has created imaginatively 
textured scores for such movies as "Alien 3" and the just-released "Cobb." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Rice's vampires are cursed with having eternity at their disposal, 
Goldenthal found himself in the opposite predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working in Martha's Vineyard, exhausted," recalls the 40-year-old 
musician. "I had a 102-degree temperature. The telephone rang and it's Neil 
Jordan. He said, 'How would you like to do "Interview With the Vampire"?' I 
asked, 'How long have I got?' He said, 'About four weeks.' Then he called back: 
'Oh, I forgot to tell you -- you've got three weeks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the costly, last-minute replacement of a score is far from uncommon, 
especially on closely watched or troubled movies. Oscar winners Bernard 
Herrmann, Henry Mancini, Jerry Goldsmith and Elmer Bernstein precede Fenton in 
seeing their work thrown out -- a situation Goldenthal says isn't always the 
composer's fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Fenton's score was lovely," he says. "But sometimes a composer is 
on the same beam as the director and sometimes he's not -- and the composer 
knows he's going to have to take the heat." 
</P>
<P>
 (Fenton, who was unavailable for comment, wrote the score for another film, 
the Steve Martin comedy "Mixed Nuts," being released later this month.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to create -- wherever I could -- a sense of up-tempo, of fast music, 
because I knew I had to support emotions that are quite dark. Jordan would say, 
'I want more about seduction' -- then we try to define what seduction is in 
music. The biggest cliche in a modern picture about seduction is throwing in a 
sax. Well, what are you going to do in the 18th Century?" 
</P>
<P>
 Goldenthal's solution: dusting off that classical-era aphrodisiac the 
harpsichord, which he also employed to heighten "Vampire's" bleak humor. "The 
hardest thing to do was to pretend I was an 18th-Century composer hired to be 
in the room with these two vampires -- and my job was to make it funny! That 
took forever . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Forever? "Well, in the lexicon of three weeks, forever was a day and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldenthal says that one virtue of the schedule was the lack of time for 
anxiety -- except perhaps during an early pep talk from producer Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'We're all taking a leap of faith here -- you'd better do a good 
job, or I'll kill you,' " Goldenthal remembers cheerfully. "I'm thinking about 
the $70 million it took to do this movie. I figured you could probably kill 
somebody for $50 million."

FILM CLIPS: 'NELL' BOUND; A DIFFERENT SORT OF WILDERNESS TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Natale 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time to play name that movie: A husband and wife move to a remote cabin 
in the north woods with no electricity or running water. The extreme isolation 
leads to a marital crisis. If you guessed "The Shining," you're wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The film that emerged from the real-life lesson is the upcoming Jodie Foster 
vehicle "Nell," about a wild child who grows up with nothing more to survive on 
than her wits. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the one lead to the other? It all began as a play, "Idioglossia," from 
the Greek for private language, by Mark Handley. "You can understand why they 
didn't use that title for the movie," he says. (The screenplay was co-written 
by William Nicholson, based on Handley's play.) 
</P>
<P>
 The character of Nell grew out of his fascination with a true incident of 
twins in San Diego who were thought to be mentally retarded and were largely 
ignored and left to communicate only with one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Handley, 38, then fused it with his own experience of isolation. In a 
Thoreau-inspired moment in the late '70s, Handley and his wife, Dottie, dropped 
out and moved from Chicago to a remote area of Washington's Cascade Mountains 
just north of Leavenworth. The rusticity, he found, was "horrifying."  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the lack of amenities so much as the realization that "I didn't know 
how to communicate with the woman I married," he says. "I hadn't realized how 
much of a hold distractions have on our lives, that we all spend so much time 
ignoring one another in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The character of Nell became a metaphor for isolation, according to Handley, 
and how "it can actually be positively used to build an inner reserve of 
strength." 
</P>
<P>
 The Handleys' marriage survived the six years in the cabin. They recently 
celebrated 19 years as a couple and now live in Seattle. Having already 
generated one play and movie, there's plenty of drama left over from this 
pioneer experiment for another project, Handley says. 
</P>
<P>
 His next art-imitates-life installment of tales from the backwoods is the 
script "The Education of a New Pioneer," which will explicitly tackle the 
eternal question of how to keep the flames of love alive over the long haul. 
"I'm using our life together to show how people build a loving relationship 
over time," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The new script is a rebuke against the romantic notion of love at first sight. 
"I've watched people literally die while waiting for the perfect love to come 
along," he says. "But like a log cabin, love is something you build, log by 
log." 
</P>
<P>
 Renee Missel, the producer of "Nell," who optioned the project when it was 
performed at L.A.'s Oydssey Theater, and built it log by log into a movie, is 
also going pioneer. Or maybe guerrilla is the more appropriate word.  
</P>
<P>
 After a career of studio-funded productions, Missel's next project will be 
shot on High-8 video for less than $1 million. "Guy," written by newcomer Kirby 
Dick, "is a dark, obsessive look at the problems of intimacy between the 
sexes," says Missel. "Actors are very attracted to the piece."

FILM CLIPS / FIENNES' FIRST: 'WUTHERING HEIGHTS' GETS TV REPRIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan King 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over the past year, Ralph Fiennes has become a much-in-demand actor, thanks to 
his Oscar-nominated turn as the savage SS commandant Amon Goeth in "Schindler's 
List" and his acclaimed portrayal of Charles Van Doren in Robert Redford's 
"Quiz Show."  
</P>
<P>
 But a 1992 British production of Emily Bronte's "Wuthering Heights," his first 
feature film, has never been released theatrically in the United States. Filmed 
on location on the stark English moors, the $9-million Paramount production had 
a very brief theatrical release in Britain two years ago and was also shown 
there on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to TNT, though, Fiennes' fans can catch this early work when the cable 
network premieres "Wuthering Heights" on Monday night. Directed by documentary 
filmmaker Peter Kosminsky, this version of Bronte's 1847 novel, unlike the 
classic 1939 adaptation starring Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, covers the 
entire book. Also starring in the tale of ill-fated love is French actress 
Juliette Binoche as the very British Cathy and Sinead O'Connor -- with hair -- 
as Emily Bronte. 
</P>
<P>
 So why wasn't the film ever released here theatrically? 
</P>
<P>
 "TNT has a really excellent reputation for handling a film like 'Wuthering 
Heights,' " says Joel Berman, president of distribution, Paramount Domestic 
Television. "We thought it would be excellent exposure for the film. That's why 
we decided to go that way. At this point, TV would be a better medium for it -- 
rather than get it lost in a theatrical release." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, however, that "Wuthering Heights" didn't ignite the box office 
in England. In fact, the Oct. 26, 1992, edition of Daily Variety described the 
film as a pre-Christmas box-office turkey. The reviews also were not exactly 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a film that is about the turbulent extremes of emotion, in which desire 
festers into hateful destruction, it is curiously and ridiculously -- empty," 
wrote Lizzie Francke in Sight & Sound. As for Fiennes, she said: "It's true 
that Ralph Fiennes, complete with wild whiplash hair and swarthy makeup, does 
not limit his portrayal of Heathcliff to all smouldering, rough sexuality, but 
the contradictions of this rogue male character are never fully explained." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday Times' Henry Cockburn also was not pleased. "Ralph Fiennes' 
Heathcliff looks admirably unsavoury, though his pained expressions grow 
monotonous with time, as though he had permanent indigestion. With Juliette 
Binoche, you hear the voice coach at work; she is best when silent. Together 
they strike an occasional spark, but nowhere near enough to ignite the whole 
film." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was a silver lining. Fiennes' performance made a big impression 
on Steven Spielberg. The director told The Times earlier this year, "I asked to 
see a print of 'Wuthering Heights' and thought it was a difficult part he 
pulled off." Soon after, he offered Fiennes the role in "Schindler's." 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Mateas, senior vice president of programming at TNT, believes that 
Fiennes' growing number of admirers won't be disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is hot, hot," she says. "He's, like, lukewarm in 'Quiz Show' compared to 
what he is in this. It's just a ripping good yarn that will appeal on various 
different levels. It's nice to have something for the younger female group who 
don't always sample us. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody could watch this and say, 'I wonder what the (original) was 
like,' then that is the greatest thing in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wuthering Heights" airs on TNT on Monday at 5 and 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 7 
p.m., Saturday at 7 p.m. and next Sunday at 5 p.m.

CITY SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS; BELL WINS, 27-7, FOR A SHOT AT SCHOOL'S FIRST 
FOOTBALL TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bell High has won City Section titles in volleyball, cross-country and 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles moved closer to their first City football title with a 27-7 victory 
over Manual Arts in a 3-A semifinal playoff game Friday night at Gardena High. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinging to a 13-7 fourth-quarter lead, Bell scored two touchdowns within a 
five-minute span to secure its first berth in the championship since 1984 if 
they can beat Birmingham on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a close game all the way, but we got some lucky plays down the line," 
said Bell running back Vern Benard. "Now we want to move forward and prove we 
can win it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Benard rushed for 142 yards in 18 carries, including a 79-yard touchdown run. 
Dicky Purcell, who had four receptions for 51 yards, and Gary Herrera, who had 
two catches for 60 yards, each scored touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts, which was penalized eight times for 90 yards, surrendered the 
ball on downs three times within the 20-yard line, including twice on fourth 
and goal. The Toilers, though, climbed to within 13-7 after Brian Beckom scored 
on a one-yard run with 9:16 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Any comeback hopes were dashed two plays later when Benard broke outside on 
his 79-yard scoring run to increase Bell's advantage to 20-7 with 8:20 left. 
Raul Saldana scored on a 22-yard interception return with just over three 
minutes left for the final margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we wanted was to practice for four weeks after the regular season," said 
Bell Coach Henry Santiago, who will get his chance to put the Eagles through 
their paces again this week. "Regardless of whether we win in the final or not, 
our goal was just to make it there." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, which lost to Roosevelt in the 2-A final in 1984, opened a 13-0 lead on

 After teammate and best friend Marvin Powell went down to injury, Courtney 
Blount took it upon himself to lead his Birmingham team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Marvin got hurt, that inspired us to play," said the Birmingham running 
back."I had to do it for Marvin because he would do it for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Blount rushed for 209 yards and three touchdowns in 21 carries as Birmingham 
topped Wilson, 27-20, in a City Section 4-A semifinal game at Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell suffered a mild concussion at 7:08 in the second quarter after being 
tackled by Wilson defensive back Jaime Munoz. Powell was taken to County-USC 
Medical Center.  
</P>
<P>
 After Blount scored his third touchdown of the game on a 14-yard run that put 
the Braves ahead, 27-13, with 11:09 remaining in the fourth quarter, Wilson 
fought back. 
</P>
<P>
 Mule quarterback Eddie Gonzales, who was 11 of 22 for 191 yards, connected 
with Luis Sanchez for his only touchdown of the game on a 40-yard pass to bring 
Wilson within 27-20 at the 8:16 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 After stopping Birmingham on downs, Wilson got the ball at its 48-yard line 
with .44 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales drove the Mules to the Birmingham 15-yard line but his third-down 
pass to Sanchez was intercepted by defensive back Rick Courtney in the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birmingham is a really good football team," said Wilson coach Eddie Martinez. 
"We couldn't stop their running game." 
</P>
<P>
 Blount, who rushed for 148 yards in the first half, scored on runs of 19 and 1 
yard, the second of which put Birmingham ahead, 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales, who rushed for 27 yards in seven carries, scored on a one-yard run 
to give Wilson a 13-12 halftime lead.

NOTEBOOK; JEFFERSON HIGH BASKETBALL TEAMS HONOR DECEASED COACH 
</P>

 The Jefferson High girls' and boys' basketball teams have dedicated their 
season to Demorrio Wright, a boys' assistant coach who died Nov. 11 after a 2 
1/2-year battle with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson teachers, administrators and students were among the 600 mourners 
who crowded into Neighborhood Community Church Nov. 16 to remember the 
32-year-old alumnus who played football and basketball at Jefferson. Wright, 
survived by a wife and two children, was buried at Inglewood Park Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Hughes, the girls' basketball coach and a Jefferson graduate who had 
known Wright since the seventh grade, delivered the eulogy. Hughes said Wright 
was a caring and dedicated coach who went out his way to ensure his athletes 
kept up with their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students always gave him respect," Hughes said. "He would stand in front of 
the school every morning and he would make any athlete who came late do 50 
pushups. He did it all the time to push them to go to classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who coached at Jefferson for the past six years, was diagnosed with 
chronic myelogenic leukemia in 1992 after complaining of severe muscle spasms. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, though, continued to coach through his illness. He was hospitalized 
several times and underwent intermittent chemotherapy. "I never said, 'Why me?' 
I'm a fighter. I'll fight till the last season," Wright said in a 1993 
interview. "But seeing the kids trying is always a thrill. It makes me realize 
all the hard work is worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson boys' Coach Andy Fujitsubo said Wright was coaching the team in 
preparation for the Democrats' season opener Wednesday at Roosevelt when he 
checked into a hospital. He fell into a coma three days later and died the next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never complained," Fujitsubo said. "He was always at practice and the 
games. It seemed like he had just entered the hospital when we got the word he 
passed away. All of this happened so fast. It's caught us off guard."

outscored by the Washington Generals, 70-60, Tuesday night in a interconference 
game.

A CLEAR AND DANGEROUS PRESENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert W. Welkos 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While Warner Bros. is pinning its hopes on "Disclosure's" star power, in the 
form of Michael Douglas and Demi Moore, as well as author Michael Crichton's 
provocative, steamy story line, it may be the film's set that eventually steals 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
 For at fictional DigiCom, where Douglas and Moore play out their passions and 
anger, employees work in a multitiered, open-floor complex of glass-walled 
offices as aesthetically appealing as it is ultimately chilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as one man plunges into doubts about who his allies really are, so the 
pleasing confines of DigiCom serve to create a growing sense of paranoia -- who 
is watching whom? -- as employees go about their daily routines, taking phone 
calls, greeting each other on walkways or typing messages on their computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Disclosure" set was the creation of production designer Neil Spisak, who 
along with a crew of 350 carpenters, welders, painters, draftsmen and others, 
transformed Stage 16 at Warner Bros.' giant Burbank lot into an office complex 
so spectacular that even some Warner employees conceded they were saddened when 
it had to come down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who went onto the set got a good feeling out of it," Spisak 
recalled. "They'd all say, 'We'd love to work here.' Ultimately, that was the 
goal. The point of the story is that this is a desirable corporation. They are 
very solvent and a very important commodity in the computer world. You get a 
sense of worth from the corporation." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, the employees all seem to be working together, not 
in some pecking order.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are open floors," Spisak said. "You do see through everybody's office 
and everybody in it. But as things sort of sour, rather than have all that 
working toward your advantage -- it starts to work on your paranoia." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key scenes in the movie occurs when Moore's character, Meredith 
Johnson, engages in a steamy seduction scene with Douglas' character, Tom 
Sanders, with a view of the nighttime Seattle skyline in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Spisak, 38, who has had a double career as a costume and production designer, 
initially hoped to find a building in Seattle that would have a period 
architecture to it that he could then work with, but none was available. 
</P>
<P>
 Using 147 tons of steel I-beams to support the structure, crews worked around 
the clock for eight weeks. When it was completed, DigiCom was 200 feet long and 
rose 3 1/2 stories, or nearly 50 feet inside the 60-foot-high soundstage.

PERFORMING ARTS; YOUTHFUL MAESTRO EYES 21ST CENTURY; MEHLI MEHTA, AT 86, IS 
PREPARING THE WAY FOR A NEW MUSIC DIRECTOR OF THE L.A.-BASED YOUTH ORCHESTRA HE 
FORMED IN 1964. BUT DON'T COUNT HIM OUT YET.

 "Having reached 86, I think it is only prudent, practical and professional to 
start looking for a successor who will eventually take over the Music 
Directorship of the American Youth Symphony."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Announcement in the 1994-95 American Youth Symphony program booklet 
</P>
<P>
 Mehli Mehta is adamant. He is speaking loudly and rapidly, his sentences 
coming with exclamation points attached. He is making a declaration of faith. 
He has just been asked if he is going to retire from the American Youth 
Symphony, the young players' training orchestra that he founded in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I will never retire! We Mehtas never retire! Axiomatic reply. My father 
never retired -- we forced him to retire at the age of 92, and then I brought 
him to England in his last year of life. . . . I said, 'Now you please stop 
working.' He was a real estate man . . . and Zubin will never retire, and I 
will never retire . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But, clearly, as the season announcement indicates, Mehta is covering all the 
bases. A series of guest conductor auditions is already in progress for the 
successor for the Los Angeles-based orchestra, and auditions will continue 
until 1997. So will Mehta retire then? "No, '97 is my Brahms year. It's his 
centenary. No, forgive my saying so, but you can't put me on the spot like 
that. God willing, if I'm all right, then I'll go on. If I'm not all right, if 
I feel that I cannot do my duties well, then I'll say, 'Well, all right, now 
you take over.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A small, thin and dapper gentleman, Mehta sits in a Westside home filled with 
musical mementos (a portrait of son Zubin is displayed prominently), his 
thoughts ranging over an entire life. He is practically bursting to tell his 
story and looks genuinely proud as a photographer snaps his picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Mehta was born Sept. 25, 1908, in Bombay to Parsi parents. He became 
interested in Western classical music at an early age when he heard recordings 
of violinists Kreisler, Heifetz, Zimbalist and Kubelik. At 5, he asked for and 
received his first violin and music lessons. Still in his teens, he began the 
Mehli Mehta Sextet (a salon orchestra that played in Bombay hotels); in his 
20s, already India's leading violinist -- "in the kingdom of the blind," says 
Mehta, "the one-eyed is king" -- he founded the Bombay Symphony, borrowing wind 
and brass players from the local British Army band, and then, later, the Bombay 
String Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 He taught, gave recitals. He was the pied piper of Western classical music in 
a land that didn't know the tune. Muslims and Hindus refused to attend the 
Parsi's concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 With dreams of becoming a world-famous violinist -- having met Jascha Heifetz 
on the master's visit to Bombay in 1932, and Yehudi Menuhin, when the latter 
appeared with the Bombay Symphony -- Mehta came to the United States on a 
student visa in 1945 "to study the violin in the real sense of the word." 
</P>
<P>
 For five years in New York he studied with famed pedagogue Ivan Galamian and 
attended concerts in Carnegie Hall five nights a week. He rattles off the names 
of the great violinists, pianists, conductors he heard there; and remembers his 
seat number, "A-2." But eventually he had to return to Bombay, and after New 
York, life there seemed increasingly unsatisfactory. When, in 1954, sons Zubin 
and Zarin left to study in Vienna and London respectively, "life was unbearable 
for my wife and me," says Mehta. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to obtain a U.S. visa, Mehta headed to England and soon became a 
member, then the concertmaster of the Halle Orchestra under Sir John 
Barbirolli, a major influence on Mehta's conducting. But, when the opportunity 
to come to the United States resurfaced five years later in 1959, in the form 
of the second violin position in Philadelphia's Curtis String Quartet, he took 
it and has been in this country ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday morning rehearsal with the American Youth Symphony, Schoenberg Hall, 
UCLA. Mehta is completely in his element. One might think that the young 
musicians, ages 16 to 25, energize the older man, but it is most assuredly the 
other way around. Wearing his trademark white, long-sleeve smock, Mehta takes 
-- exhorts -- the orchestra through Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, peppering 
detailed instructions with anecdotes, admonitions and broad smiles. He repeats 
short commands like rifle shots, often shouting above the musical din -- "Let's 
get into it, let's get into it." "Sing! Sing!" To the cellos: "I don't see the 
agony in your faces." To the violins: "vibrate, vibrate." To the snare drummer, 
trying to get him to play in the desired way, Mehta tells of the Nazis marching 
on Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
 He mimics the conducting style of Fritz Reiner to make a point about watching 
the baton. He recalls the orderly British regimental parades in India to 
illustrate an idea on ensemble precision and quickly adds that the British kept 
the Indians from fighting each other but that "here is a Muslim and a Hindu on 
the same stand," he says, pointing to his first two violists, "here is peace!" 
He addresses everyone as "dear" -- "Please, I'm talking to you, dear": this to 
a horn player with a goatee. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra obviously likes him, readily responding to his demands, 
attentive to his stories, laughing at his jokes. One musician helps the 
conductor by quietly feeding the measure numbers to him, so he doesn't waste 
time searching the score he rarely looks at. Past break time, Mehta insists on 
continuing and answers the musicians' protests with a sarcastic, "Yeah. So 
what. You're not going to melt." Nearing the end of the symphony he declares, 
"This is a magnificent coda. This is the coda that saved Shostakovich's life." 
As they play it, he is beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 If Mehta has any regrets it is that he took up conducting so late in life. By 
the time Jan Popper called him away from the Curtis Quartet to head the 
orchestra department at UCLA, he was 56. "Fifty-six is not old for a 
conductor," explains Mehta, who also joined the American Youth Symphony at that 
time, "but it's an old conductor for a career." There have been a few moments 
in the big leagues -- he has led the Philadelphia Orchestra on four occasions 
and the Israel Philharmonic -- and his own orchestra has not lacked for 
acclaim. 
</P>
<P>
 Zubin comes up a lot in conversation. Mehta refers to him as "my wonderful 
boy" and "an angel," and it is clear that they are very close. Last season, 
when Mehli was in the hospital with triple pneumonia, Zubin came to the rescue, 
conducting the Youth Symphony in Santa Barbara between his own engagements with 
the National Symphony and the Lyric Opera in Chicago. (He'll be conducting the 
Los Angeles Philharmonic Friday through Dec. 18.) 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks much of the criticism directed at his son over the years has been 
undeserved, but he is calm and philosophical when discussing it. He defends 
Zubin's involvement in the "Encore! The Three Tenors" mega-concert last summer 
at Dodger Stadium by explaining that his son initially refused but agreed in 
the end "just to please his colleagues." Indeed, this is the only (mild) 
criticism father has for son: "He's really doing too much, much too much . . . 
but he's a wonderful boy who just can't say no to anybody. He's got that one 
vice." Mehli quickly adds, however, that Zubin always "delivers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His own conducting has seemed to grow in stature in recent years, and Mehli 
seconds this opinion. "I conducted the 'Fantastic' Symphony a couple of Sundays 
ago (with the AYS), and it was much mellower, much better, much more settled 
than when I did it 10 years ago. . . . It has to improve, otherwise there's no 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing the Shostakovich Fifth next month and Shostakovich Fifth I did so 
many times. But today it's totally different. One finds more pleasures in it, 
let's say. I consider a score as a gold mine: As you go deeper you find more 
gold." 
</P>
<P>
 His enjoyment level is "even higher, even higher" too. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the whole thing," he says. "The day when I stop enjoying making 
music, that's the day when I must completely stop. That will never happen, no, 
no, never happen." He calls his orchestra "my big family." "I'm their 
grandfather. They all treat me very, very lovingly, and it's a whole atmosphere 
of love. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you know that 12 of my boys are sitting in the Los Angeles Philharmonic?

ART; IMAGES OF A LIFETIME; WILLIAM KLEIN'S WORK, FROM HIS GRITTY TAKE ON '50S 
NEW YORK TO HIS DISTINCTIVE FASHION STATEMENTS, ARE COLLECTED IN THREE

 William Klein wasn't looking for trouble. And yet there he was, mingling among 
the students and unionists, the revolutionaries and Trotskyites, the anarchists 
waving their black flags, the looters visiting from the suburbs. Klein just 
wanted to see their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever alarming new government policy had sent these thousands of French 
into the streets last March was irrelevant to Klein's purposes. He had come 
with a camera, but not as a photojournalist, and was more interested in that 
young woman marching on stilts, or the expressions of those watching the parade 
pass by. 
</P>
<P>
 "The casting is so incredible," Klein said of the crowds lining the Paris 
streets. "You go to these demonstrations or parades, there is so much happening 
around it." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein, 65, has spent the last 45 years capturing scenes like these as a 
photographer, filmmaker and painter, often drawn to moments of high energy and 
tension. His earliest black-and-white photographs, done in the 1950s, seemed to 
contradict the bland optimism of the Eisenhower years, finding Klein's hometown 
of New York a claustrophobic mess, with hardened, sometimes violent, people 
adrift in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 His grainy, blurred photographs of young children posed with toy guns, of 
grim-faced adults numbly crowding sidewalks, helped create a new visual 
vocabulary in photography, more confrontational than Henri Cartier-Bresson's 
"decisive moment." And during a decade-long stint as a fashion photographer for 
Vogue, beginning in 1955, Klein helped transform the genteel trappings of 
fashion photography. This wide-ranging career is the subject of a retrospective 
exhibition of 75 pictures at the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles opening 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is just one part of a new avalanche of attention for this native New 
Yorker, who has lived in Europe since being sent there with the Army in 1945. 
(He settled in Paris later that year as one of 25 servicemen to study art at 
the Sorbonne through a post-war program.) A more comprehensive retrospective 
opened Saturday at the International Center of Photography in New York. In 
January, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art hosts a tribute to Klein's 1955 
New York pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Random House has also just released a book of Klein's fashion photography 
titled "In and Out of Fashion," and next year the artist hopes to publish a new 
expanded version of his "New York" book, which, with its grim scenes of 
post-war America, predated Robert Frank's celebrated "The Americans" project. 
"New York" was first published in Paris and London in 1956, but has never 
before been released in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Relaxing in blue jeans and a gray pullover at his studio in the Montparnasse 
district of Paris, Klein notes that for several years during the '60s and '70s, 
he gave up still photography to concentrate on filmmaking. During that time he 
made more than a dozen documentary and fictional films for television and 
commercial release, all French productions, including an award-winning series 
of documentaries on Muhammad Ali. He also made the 1966 film "Qui etes-vous, 
Polly Magoo?" (Who Are You, Polly Magoo?), a farce on the fashion industry. It 
was to be his farewell to the fashion world (though he has since worked 
occasional assignments). 
</P>
<P>
 "When I stopped, photography was not such a big deal," he says. "People took 
photographs, (but) there weren't shows, there weren't personal books 
(monographs), people didn't sell photographs. There was no dialogue between 
photographers and the public, and I felt that was frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now things have changed. People are obsessed by the image, and they can read 
photographs in a different way from what they used to." 
</P>
<P>
 When Klein first published his New York images, he left out more than half of 
them because they were too radical and difficult to read, even to his own eyes. 
His work stood in stark contrast to the popular elegant, even poetic, standards 
set by Cartier-Bresson. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning (Cartier-Bresson) resented what I was doing," Klein says. "I 
worked against people like him. His idea was the invisible camera. He doesn't 
like anybody to take his photograph, he doesn't like to be seen, he doesn't 
like people to see him or react to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be good not to hide the fact that you're taking a 
photograph, and have people react and come in close and also make a commentary 
on what's being photographed: This is a photo, this is my point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 The "New York" project was Klein's first major statement, done during extended 
visits to New York after living abroad for seven years. By now, his hometown 
seemed almost foreign to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be a good idea to look at New York with this 
half-European, half-native eye, and really do something to get back at this 
city that I thought really gave me a hard time when I grew up." 
</P>
<P>
 Raised by his Hungarian-immigrant parents at the cor ner of 108th Street and 
Amsterdam Avenue, Klein grew up playing stickball and touch football in the 
street. "I always thought I was going to be an artist," he says now. "I used to 
draw, and I would read Russian novels until 3 or 4 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 He studied first as a painter and only happened upon photography after making 
some photographic studies inspired by Mondrian. He became interested in street 
photography, recording urban life in his confrontational style. At the same 
time, he was hired by Vogue in the magazine's effort to recruit promising new 
artists. (Painters Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg were also approached, 
although they ultimately never worked for the magazine.) Klein saw the job as a 
welcome alternative to the usual artist's plight of chasing down commissions 
and sales to dealers and collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hated that," he says. "I couldn't do that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 He found that beyond Richard Avedon and Irving Penn's photography, little 
creative work was being done in the fashion field. Clothes didn't matter to 
Klein, and as long as they were visible in the pictures, editors allowed the 
artist nearly free reign. So, instead of fashion cliches with women taking tea, 
or posing stiffly against Roman pillars, Klein introduced surrealistic 
elements: Live models mingled among wax figures of Napoleon and Josephine. 
Women seen through mirrors with telephoto and wide-angle lenses. Such 
techniques have since become standards in fashion photography. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be funny to use smoke in daylight in really dopey 
situations with kids playing in the park -- and an evening dress. It was so 
incongruous. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me these would be jokes. And the funny thing is, nobody would ask me what 
I was doing. They didn't say, 'Hey, what is this supposed to mean?' As long as 
they saw the dress, and the women didn't turn the pages too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 There were some boundaries -- Klein says nearly half of his fashion pictures 
were censored by editors. One image of a woman with a cigarette was axed 
because she was "smoking like a sailor," neither wearing gloves nor using a 
holder. Another series of portraits of emerging film actresses were cut because 
of the technique used: Klein had two fans blowing, tossing the hair 
dramatically, some of it falling in the actresses' mouths. " Disgusting !" he 
was told. 
</P>
<P>
 He did find some creative satisfaction through all the experiments. But he 
adds: "If I didn't have to earn a living somehow, I would never have taken a 
fashion photograph in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 A creative restlessness has kept Klein moving from one project to another, one 
genre to the next. But he is not the type to roam the streets daily with a 
camera. "I get excited when I have a project and when I have a camera," Klein 
explains. "When I don't I don't even think about taking photographs." 
</P>
<P>
 He adds: "I stopped taking photographs in the early '60s and didn't start 
again to be involved in photographs until the '80s. Now, in a way, I think I'm 
going to stop again. I'm really now thinking of doing a movie again. I like the 
liberty of going from one thing to another."

POP MUSIC; CLASS OF '94: A HOLE LOTTA PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Hilburn, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Courtney Love, whose band Hole is one of Calendar's choices for the year's 
most promising pop arrivals, has been a presence in rock for so long that it 
seems hard on first thought to consider her part of a freshman class. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet until her major-label debut this year, Love's fame was based largely on 
her notoriety -- her flamboyant lifestyle, brash personality and marriage to 
the late Kurt Cobain. This was the year that her music kicked in, with an album 
and tour that were ablaze with passion. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman class, open to artists who released debut albums or stepped up to 
major-label status during 1994, was chosen for creative vision, not sales. ( To 
hear selections on TimesLine, see list on Page 74. )  
</P>
<P>
 Here, alphabetically, are the top newcomers, with their breakthrough albums: 
DAVID BALL 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of the wry wordplay favored by this North Carolina native on the album 
"Thinkin' Problem" is the title track, a marvelous salute to -- and sendup of 
-- honky-tonk laments, using familiar drinking-song imagery to express 
lingering heartache: "Yes, I admit I've got a thinkin' problem / She's always 
on my mind / Her memory goes round and round / I've tried to quit a thousand 
times." Ball compounds our interest by singing with all the down-home grit of 
the ultimate honky-tonk vocalist, George Jones. BECK 
</P>
<P>
 Filled with Bob Dylan's old disdain for authority and conventional musical 
boundaries, Beck -- whose song "Loser" was one of the year's defining pop-rock 
moments -- seems as much at home with experimental hip-hop as with folk and 
rock on "Mellow Gold." The young hotshot even has the nerve in "Pay No Mind" to 
strap on a harmonica for a walk down Highway 61, '90s style, describing a world 
in which all the toilets are overflowing, shopping malls are surrounded by 
manure and rock stars are the ultimate joke. JEFF BUCKLEY 
</P>
<P>
 When pop fans today hear that Buckley's father, the late Tim Buckley, was an 
acclaimed folk-oriented singer-songwriter in the '60s and '70s, many will 
assume that the elder Buckley dealt in the gentle, introspective style so 
popular at the time. In fact, Buckley was a fiercely independent and original 
artist whose music was filled with haunting, unsettling twists. In his 
strong-willed debut, "Grace," son Jeff (above, second from left) also looks at 
the human experience -- from last goodbys to desperate overtures -- in ways 
that are haunting and profoundly personal. DIONNE FARRIS 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for songs about love at any price or helpless devotion in the music 
of this former member of Arrested Development. With "Wild Seed -- Wild Flower," 
Farris, an accomplished and adventurous singer, gives us a work of considerable 
substance and style -- songs that look at social problems and relationships 
from a positive, spiritually minded perspective. It's topped off with 
arrangements that sparkle with the soul instincts of Sly Stone and Curtis 
Mayfield. GREEN DAY 
</P>
<P>
 This East Bay trio blends the loony self-parody of the Ramones with the 
razor-sharp insistence of the Clash (minus the politics). With lines like "I 
don't know you, but I think I hate you," the track "Chump" on the group's 
major-label debut album, "Dookie," is today's equivalent of the Ramones' "Beat 
on the Brat." This kind of retrogression isn't normally good in pop, but the 
spirit in these jabs at youthful apathy and confusion is likable and 
invigorating. Classic Beavis and Butt-head line: "Peel me off this Velcro seat 
and get me moving." HOLE 
</P>
<P>
 The eerie thing about "Live Through This," Hole's major-label debut album, is 
that the songs were written before Cobain's suicide. The forceful tales of 
wounded emotions and dark-edged obsessions offer such a vivid account of 
psychological turmoil that it would be easy to imagine them having been written 
afterward. On stage, too, Hole brings the songs to life with a raw punk 
electricity that recalls the passion and character of such rock touchstones as 
Janis Joplin, Patti Smith and Neil Young. FREEDY JOHNSTON 
</P>
<P>
 With an album title like "This Perfect World," you'd expect to get sappy 
romanticism or a songwriter who delights in irony -- someone in the tradition 
of Elvis Costello, Lyle Lovett and John Hiatt, who is capable of wicked humor 
and disarming poignancy. In his major-label debut, Johnston is no sap. These 
bittersweet tales about characters overwhelmed by life's insults and demands 
carry the careful plotting and detail of finely crafted short stories. LUSCIOUS 
JACKSON 
</P>
<P>
 This female quartet got its name from a '60s pro basketball star (Philadelphia 
'76er forward Lucious Jackson), its record contract from the Beastie Boys and 
its musical inspiration largely from hours spent visiting New York punk and rap 
clubs. All those influences come together nicely in the music -- the group's 
album "Natural Ingredients" is a refreshing celebration of urban experience 
that seems remarkably free of the cliches that have plagued so many other 
rock/hip-hop experiments. OASIS 
</P>
<P>
 The punk revolution may have been ignited in London in the late '70s, but 
rock's anger and aggression are now centered in the United States, which is one 
reason that British bands have such a hard time competing with the domestic 
hard-core. However, England's highly melodic Oasis may break through. On 
"Definitely Maybe," the band reflects many of the most enticing elements of 
British rock -- with the swagger and sounds of everything from T. Rex and Sweet 
to the Sex Pistols and Stone Roses -- without sacrificing its own identity. 
SPEARHEAD 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Franti caught the rap world by surprise when he called an end to 
Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy, the widely acclaimed duo that was saluted in 
Calendar's 1992 freshman class. But Franti's new group, Spearhead, justifies 
the move. Rather than repeat the somewhat strident alternative rock/hip-hop 
style of Disposable, Spearhead operates on more graceful soul-R&B terrain. On 
"Home," Franti's socially conscious raps also tend to be more personal and 
tender.

SOME SEE JULIO AS PROP. 187 MARTYR, WHILE OTHERS REFUSE TO TAKE BLAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two important points have been missing in the coverage regarding the tragic 
death of 12-year-old Julio Cano, whose undocumented immigrant parents delayed 
seeking medical care for him at least in large part out of fear of deportation 
on account of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Proposition 187 proponents excuse the tragedy simply by saying that 
Julio's parents should have known that enforcement of the law has been put on 
hold by the courts. But nowhere have they explained how such tragic 
consequences are to be excused if they succeed in their legal efforts to uphold 
this controversial initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Second and most telling, there has been NO report that the parents and family 
will return to Mexico because of Proposition 187. Quite the contrary -- The 
Times reported on Nov. 26 that the family would not even accompany the child's 
body on its trip back to Mexico. It's time to admit that the opponents of 
Proposition 187 were right -- immigrants come here (with or without legal 
documentation) for JOBS. Withholding public services will not send them back. 
Rather it will only create public health and safety risks and make it easier 
and less expensive for unscrupulous employers to exploit this cheap source of 
labor. If we are serious about punishing lawbreakers and controlling illegal 
immigration, we need to chase the lawbreaking employers who violate federal law 
by hiring undocumented workers. 
</P>
<P>
 STEVEN J. DZIDA 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 * Your splashy coverage of the death of Julio Cano as the proximate result of 
Proposition 187 commits The Times to give equal prominence to deaths that occur 
because of illegal immigration. Specifically, whenever an illegal alien pulls 
the trigger or runs a red light and death occurs, it belongs on Page A1.  
</P>
<P>
 To date, The Times has generally declined to give residency status of those 
who break the law. Perhaps you decided that this was prejudicial to certain 
ethnic groups that would disproportionately have its members so identified. 
Latino activists have freed you from this constraint. By taking the name of a 
dead 12-year-old as a battle cry, they have renounced anonymity for illegal 
immigrants. They are willing to stake their case on the merits and demerits of 
the illegals who live among us. 
</P>
<P>
 NED McCUNE 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Dear Proposition 187 proponents: Don't wimp out now. The first death that 
can be attributed to your initiative has occurred. Take credit for it. Your 
oft-stated purpose was to make life so miserable and unbearable for illegals 
that they would self-deport. Well, don't back down now. Stand up for what you 
believe in and claim credit where credit is due.

<P>
 * I voted for Proposition 187, but I feel sorry for the family of Julio Cano. 
But it appears that the family of Julio has replaced grief with the desire to 
make everyone who voted for Proposition 187 feel guilty. I don't. Proposition 
187 had nothing to do with that young man's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Also the Center for Human Rights & Constitutional Law should be ashamed of 
using this young man's death to further their political viewpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it The Times gives more space to a story like this than they do when a 
law enforcement officer gets killed? 
</P>
<P>
 T.S. WIGGINS 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 * It is shameless journalism at best from your newspaper. Any medical expert 
would tell you leukemia does not develop in the human body in two weeks. If 
this young man had leukemia, it would have shown up on a blood test long before 
Proposition 187 passed. If anyone should be sued it should be the doctor or 
clinic who failed to issue a blood test to detect leukemia. Leukemia most 
always is a fatal disease, and the supporters of Proposition 187 are not to 
blame for this boy's death. This problem appeared in this young man's body a 
long time before Proposition 187 was voted on. 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on your newspaper for misinformation, lies and withholding the truth. 
How many LEGAL residents have been denied health care because they have no 
insurance and do not have the funds to access medical care? My sympathy has 
always been with the taxpayer, not with lawbreakers.

PROP. 187 OPPONENTS USE DOUBLE STANDARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am getting more than a little upset at the constant trivializing in The 
Times and other media of the Holocaust in Germany and Europe by opponents of 
Proposition 187. The latest, the wearing of yellow stars by people who have no 
concept of the suffering brought upon the Jewish people, has me particularly 
appalled. If your readers really want to see what the Holocaust was like I can 
send some pictures. For your uninformed readers and editors, here are some 
important facts. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Holocaust sent over 6 million people to death. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Holocaust was directed primarily against Jews, who were legal citizens 
of their countries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 187 seeks to control illegal immigration by people of every 
race, color, religion and nationality, which every other country on Earth does. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mexico was one of the biggest protesters against 187, primarily because it 
does not wish to take care of its own poor and uses us as a safety valve -- 
while vigorously defending their own southern borders against illegals. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the U.S. government had meddled in the Mexican election, it would have 
created an international incident leading to unanimous cries against Yankee 
imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Explain to me the constant railing about the illegality and theoretical 
unconstitutionality of 187 by foes of the measure, but the total disregard for 
the law by these same people as it applies to the illegal immigrants who by 
definition are law-breakers. 
</P>
<P>
 JON E. CURRIE 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills 
</P>
<P>
 * The people of California have overwhelmingly approved Proposition 187. It is 
time for the "No on 187" citizens to accept reality, initiate the will of the 
people and join forces to make 187 work. 
</P>
<P>
 To complete what 187 started, our borders must be secure, illegal aliens 
immediately deported and the process for legal immigration streamlined, 
organized and made fair and available equally to people of all nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians who still oppose 187 will have short political careers. 
Organizations that mount legal battles will only increase the cost to the 
taxpayers who approved this measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Unconstitutional? If anti-187 people are concerned with the law of the land, 
then they should define illegal immigration. Racist and anti-Latino? What about 
claiming illegal acts as justifiable if they are committed by "their own" and 
for "their cause?" Have they forgotten about the people of the rest of the 
world who would also like to immigrate to the United States, but don't have the 
geographical advantage that the people of Mexico are exploiting?

WE NEED MORE TEACHERS LIKE SHEILA HOPPER

<P>
 Because teacher Sheila Hopper is attempting to force the L.A. Unified School 
District to comply with federal guidelines on the administration of 
special-education classes, the entrenched bureaucrats at LAUSD branded her as a 
malcontent and attacked her character ("Jury Says Principal Retaliated," Nov. 
17). 
</P>
<P>
 I still cannot believe the story of the fifth-grade student who could not even 
spell her own name yet was enrolled in a regular class! What is going on at the 
L.A. Unified School District? 
</P>
<P>
 Hooray for Sheila Hopper! There should be more teachers like her.

RESIDENTS SHOULD HAVE DOUBTS ABOUT CRA PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walter Prince, a member of the advisory committee that has backed the proposed 
-- and exceedingly controversial -- Community Redevelopment Agency's earthquake 
recovery plan for the Northwest Valley, wrote an eloquent response recently to 
the doubts voiced by Bobbi Fiedler, a CRA commissioner, as to the wisdom of the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Very eloquent -- and very off base. What Mr. Prince failed to point out is 
that his advisory committee is just that -- a group that advises. Regardless of 
agreements that the CRA might reach with the committee, the agency has the 
power to later overturn them. And Mr. Prince admits in his own letter that the 
CRA has the reputation of being a "conniving, power-mad bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Prince also fails to point out that the membership of the advisory 
committee basically represents the business world. There was minimal 
representation looking out for the concerns of the residents and homeowners of 
the 12th Council District -- the people who would be most affected by the CRA 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 He took issue with Ms. Fiedler when she noted that by diverting property tax 
increase funds to the CRA, Valley vital services such as police and fire 
protection and street improvements would be underfunded and thus reduced. Mr. 
Prince acknowledges that this could happen but blames it on the failure of the 
city to "budget itself correctly with the taxes it now receives." This has 
nothing to do with the CRA plan for earthquake recovery, he claims. 
</P>
<P>
 I disagree. It has a lot to do with the CRA plan for earthquake recovery. 
Diverting tax funds away from vital services will indeed cause them to be 
underfunded, as Ms. Fiedler pointed out. That means we must do with a lower 
level of these needed services -- or must cough up more in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Few homeowners were aware of the CRA proposal, or the very existence of the 
advisory committee, until recently. There now is a swelling tide of protest on 
the part of homeowners and residents opposing this ill-thought-out plan. 
Petitions are being circulated and eagerly signed, to be forwarded to the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope to get a more responsive -- and responsible -- reaction there.

WINNING THE FIGHT AGAINST SOKA PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aaron Curtiss' article detailing the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy 
decision to forgo a proposed "deal" with Soka University (Nov. 23) notes that 
fighting the Soka project "will cost the public millions of dollars regardless 
of which side wins." 
</P>
<P>
 In actuality, one of the reasons that the proposed deal was opposed by 
virtually all of the policy-makers representing the area on national state and 
local levels, as well as most residents, was that the Soka development will be 
far more costly to the taxpayers than the zoning and parkland blueprint worked 
out by the public over decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka ill-advisedly bought a parcel in a small canyon and made plans to build a 
project that is totally out of proportion with the area, by any yardstick. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would be on the hook for paying for bringing in enough roads, fire 
service, sewers and so on into this rustic area to support such a massive 
development? What about all of the other service-demanding growth that this 
project will spawn? The nonprofit, non-taxpaying Soka? 
</P>
<P>
 The average taxpayer will be far to the good by supporting the conservancy's 
effort to compel Soka to be reasonable and move its project to any of several 
more suitable areas than they will if the Soka project is allowed to bring 
massive urbanization and up-zoning to this special area.

 * The mandate of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy is to preserve the 
natural beauty of the Santa Monica Mountains -- not collect acreage, save money 
or provide facilities for other government agencies. If these things happen as 
a side effect of pursuing the mandate, fine. But they must not be the primary 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 They were primary in the recently rejected "compromise" between the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy and the Soka Corp. To preserve does not mean to 
accommodate a mountain development that is 175% bigger than Topanga Plaza. Much 
talk about who gets what does not address the destruction of the environment, 
the mass negative effects on wildlife, destruction of the natural flow of water 
and major impacts on flower and fauna. In addition to major traffic-related 
problems, there would be the resurrection of the Malibu Canyon Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 This would all be for the sake of building a mass urban development that could 
be built in dozens of other fine locations in Southern California. It can be 
built elsewhere, but another large meadow cannot be created in these mountains. 
Mother Nature has none left. 
</P>
<P>
 These mountains must be preserved so that all Americans and visitors to our 
country will have the opportunity to enjoy and glory in their natural beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 23, an L. A. Superior Court judge agreed that the Mountains Recreation 
and Conservation Authority has the power to condemn property and he found in 
favor of the MRCA. All that remains now (after what would seem like endless 
appeals) is for a jury to establish the price of Soka's Gillette Ranch. This 
was a fight that The Times said couldn't be won. We won, and The Times was 
wrong.

DWP SURPLUS CAME IN HANDY ON JAN. 17 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I take exception to Harriet Bilford's letter (Nov. 20) supporting the 
diversion of city Department of Water and Power funds to the police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Her statement that the DWP has "repeatedly gouged the residents of the San 
Fernando Valley," was written by a customer who might not realize that five 
other charges -- none related to either water or power -- are collected on her 
DWP bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of those added charges collected at the direction of Los Angeles City 
Hall go directly to city coffers and are not retained in any way by the DWP. 
First, 10% of each electric bill is added for a city utility tax and goes into 
the city's general fund. Three other charges are added to each bill for the 
city's Department of Public Works -- they are a $4.50 monthly sanitation 
charge, a 0.678% per water bill sewer service charge and a 21-cent low-income 
sewer service charge. A fifth charge, a .0002 cent per kilowatt-hour of each 
electric bill, is an energy surcharge collected for the State of California. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ms. Bilford lived in the Santa Clarita Valley, as I do, she would pay 
Southern California Edison 17% more for her electricity than she does now, 
living in the San Fernando Valley as a DWP customer. And living there, she also 
receives the best water in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Bilford goes on to say that "DWP is one of the few agencies that even has 
any surplus assets!" That's true, mainly because the DWP had been an 
independent agency for many, many years, free of City Hall shenanigans and 
responsible for its own financial stability. Why does any organization, or any 
family for that matter, want a surplus? Why, for use in emergencies or 
unexpected situations. Ms. Bilford should be thankful a DWP surplus was 
available on Jan. 17, 1994.

MATH ERRORS DAMAGE RESIDENTS' FAITH IN CITY; IT TOOK TOO LONG TO ADMIT GOOFS IN 
IMPORTANT CALCULATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you find a significant error on your credit card bill or long distance 
telephone bill, chances are you'll want it cleared up immediately; certainly 
before the arrival of the next month's receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 If your math is grossly out of whack and you underpay the Internal Revenue 
Service and/or the California Franchise Tax Board by some dramatic amount, 
you're guaranteed to hear from them in short order. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you tell your teacher that you don't deserve an F on that calculus exam 
because you're sure you'll figure out the correct answers by the time that 
graduation ceremonies roll around, there are two possibilities, and one 
certainty. You'll get a laugh, or get sent to the principal's office, and 
you'll still have that F. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, things work a little differently for the Los Angeles city 
government, where it can take months (or years) to find or at least explain 
huge numerical errors. It's also a place where those errors can be brushed off 
as inconsequential because the right numbers would have been determined within 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first example involves the Donald C. Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in 
the Sepulveda Basin. One reason that it's important to get the numbers straight 
on this facility is because of the need for possible expansion in sewage 
treatment in the Valley. This is a controversial matter because the plant has 
neighbors who aren't thrilled with its smell or its location. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan for the city's future sewage treatment needs said that Tillman would 
need to expand its capacity by 50% in the next 16 years (wrong) and that its 
capacity could be quintupled over the next century without the need for any 
public environmental review (wrong). 
</P>
<P>
 Exacerbating the incident were the 4 1/2 months that passed between the time 
that this newspaper first inquired about the probability of errors and the 
city's acknowledgment of error. After saying that the mistakes were 
"inconsequential" because they were discovered well before the year 2010, a 
city official said that the delay in 'fessing up was due to a "general 
reluctance on the part of government workers to explain that something is 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they now have some plant neighbors convinced that a conspiracy is afoot, 
that the wrong numbers are the right numbers and that there are secret plans to 
push a major sewage treatment plant expansion through. 
</P>
<P>
 This all brings us to Glaring Error No. 2, which took three years to discover. 
You'll perhaps recall the rather outlandish price tag ($222 million) that was 
set in 1990 in assessing the amount of money that would be needed to improve 
and beautify that main Valley drag, Ventura Boulevard. Well, the city's 
Department of Transportation now admits a math error that overstated the cost 
of the plan by some $74 million. Transportation officials blame a consultant 
for the error, but they concede that they didn't catch it. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors, community leaders and businesses all deserve to have confidence in 
the computations on which this government relies to project everything from 
future sewage treatment needs to specific plans on a major San Fernando Valley 
thoroughfare. If that confidence has been damaged, the city has no one to blame 
but itself.

NEW VALLEY TRANSIT PLAN LONG OVERDUE; 'HUB AND SPOKE' ROUTES WOULD ELIMINATE 
MANY ANNOYANCES FOR COMMUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Like the rest of Los Angeles, the ( San Fernando ) Valley is multicentric. 
Warner Center, Universal City, Chatsworth and Van Nuys (and many other areas, 
for that matter) all provide large numbers of jobs and are hubs of activity 
within the larger region. And yet Greater L.A.'s transportation system is 
quickly evolving into a monocentric network, with the central hub located at 
Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles. This contradiction between the spatial 
form of the metropolitan region and the emerging transportation network is 
troubling, because it reveals the incompatibility of the existing urban form 
and the transportation infrastructure that is supposed to serve the people 
living and working within the region."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Beyond Suburbia: The Changing Face of the San Fernando Valley. UCLA, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you've ridden a bus lately in the San Fernando Valley, you probably know 
exactly what that rather stilted passage means: Once you get off of that bus, 
you're likely to be nowhere near your eventual destination. In fact, you're 
probably at least one long transfer away, and perhaps more. Even then, you may 
have to hoof it for a block or two. That's the basic problem with the current 
"grid-based" bus transportation system, which requires too many transfers. With 
such annoyances, who can blame so many of us for relying on automobiles, or for 
aspiring to have one as soon as financially possible? 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is the so-called "hub and spoke" system, and what Beyond Suburbia 
referred to as a timed-transfer system that directly links buses to other forms 
of public transportation, such as Metrolink and Metro Rail. Such a system would 
also synchronize arrival and departure times among buses, trains and subway 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite simply, the hubs are the places that most of us are trying to get to in 
the first place. The spokes are more direct bus routes that (Gadzooks!) might 
not even require a transfer. Well, in the glacial world of Los Angeles mass 
transit (as in speed, or lack thereof), we may be finally closing in on our 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-1995, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority says it will revamp two 
dozen bus lines that serve 5,200 riders from Warner Center in Woodland Hills in 
the west to the foothill communities in the Valley's northeastern corner. These 
moves must be carefully studied. Considerable care must be taken to ensure that 
the changes serve those who depend upon the buses to get to work and to conduct 
their personal affairs. We hope that similar measures can be taken soon 
afterward for the other Valley bus lines that serve -- in total -- about 
150,000 people on a daily basis. An overhaul that better serves the Valley's 
bus riders is long overdue.

TOP STUDENTS DESERVE PROPER RECOGNITION; SAUGUS HIGH SCHOOL OFFICIALS WERE 
WRONG TO ELIMINATE VALEDICTORIAN'S SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "What is a demanding pleasure? A pleasure that demands the use of one's mind . 
. . .Any knowledge man acquires is acquired by man's own will and effort, and 
that is man's distinction in the universe, that is man's nature, man's 
morality, man's glory."  
</P>
<P>
 -- Ayn Rand. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that Brad Bjelke gained more attention than he ever would have 
for earning a 4.44 grade average at Santa Clarita's Saugus High School this 
past year. That's because the school eliminated its recognition of 
valedictorians, salutatorians and top 10 honors. Bjelke was therefore denied 
the fruits of his own demanding pleasure: the right to be recognized as the 
school's top academic student, and the right to give the valedictory address at 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjelke wound up on national television and delivered his speech on a popular 
Los Angeles radio news show. But why the change at Saugus High in the first 
place? 
</P>
<P>
 One student supposedly felt so pressured by his parents to be No. 1 that he 
allegedly became suicidal. (It was clearly the parents who were the nightmarish 
problem there.) Two girls who were once good friends became enemies in trying 
to outrank one another. Well, big deal. And some students pursued easier 
courses to boost their grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, leveling the academic playing field won't prevent the latter. And it's 
unlikely that there are many schools in which most of the student body is so 
concerned about being No. 1 that they are suffering from anxiety attacks or 
stress-related acne. 
</P>
<P>
 The William S. Hart Union High School board last week decided to continue the 
policy of allowing each school to set its own standard in these matters. We 
side with Canyon High School, which still recognizes its top student. "We feel 
that this is an honor," said student Michelle Briones. How can a school truly 
honor academic excellence without formally recognizing its best?

TRUTH BOWS TO FICTION IN DEBATE OVER SCHOOL PRAYER; PUBLIC CAMPUSES ARE NOT AT 
ALL DEVOID OF RELIGION, AS SOME ARGUE. A PROPOSED CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT 
COVERING ACTS OF WORSHIP COULD BREACH THE RIGHTS OF RELIGIOUS MINORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DAVIS, Chris Davis teaches English and history at Crescenta Valley 
High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Repeat half-truths enough and they become truths. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of Congress have applied this propagandists' credo to religion in 
public education. According to these lawmakers, prayer, God, religion and 
morality are missing from public education and account for America's moral 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 This version of reality seems to be shared by many who believe that the nails 
were positioned on religion's coffin with the 1962 U.S. Supreme Court decision 
banning school-organized prayer and nailed in place with the 1985 decision that 
banned state-sanctioned moments of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet nothing could be further from the truth. If anything, religion has made a 
comeback on public school campuses since the 1980s. The Judeo-Christian God 
thrives on campuses today, perhaps to the detriment of those who do not belong 
to the Judeo-Christian tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress and the courts have already allowed enough religion to find its way 
onto public school campuses without adding prayer through a constitutional 
amendment. Walk onto almost any high school campus during lunch hour and you 
will find clubs meeting, including religious-oriented ones. 
</P>
<P>
 My school's Falcon Christian Fellowship club has more than 75 members. They 
hear speakers, pray and sing praises, and no one tells them not to. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk into my world-history class. California guidelines ask that students 
"review the moral and ethical principals of Judaism and Christianity" when they 
learn about the growth of democracy. So we read and discuss portions from the 
Old and New Testaments. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk into my sophomore English class when we are discussing the language used 
in John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men." Listen to the students debate whether 
such a book should even be read when its characters take God's name in vain. "I 
can understand why someone who is a Christian might be uncomfortable reading 
this book," a student says. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk onto campus and see the classroom doors decorated for the holidays. 
Listen to the carolers roaming the halls, singing songs of Christ's birth. Hear 
the wishes for a merry Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt that Crescenta Valley High School is some kind of city upon a hill. I 
doubt that schools in other parts of the Valley are kicking their Christian 
students out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that seems to be the perception. 
</P>
<P>
 What many seem to forget is that there are pupils happily outside the 
Judeo-Christian tradition on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year a student who is Hindu wrote that she did not think it right for 
some teachers to display their Christianity so plainly in class, suggesting 
that Christianity was the preferred religion. This year a student who practices 
a Native American religion has reminded our English class that native religions 
were the main ones on this continent until Europeans virtually annihilated 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 In one class, students have written about why they are agnostics and atheists. 
Do we make room for nonbelievers? I think the First Amendment says we must, but 
sometimes I wonder if we truly care about protecting the rights of the minority 
from the abuses of the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 the Supreme Court held that public schools must allow religious groups 
to meet if they allow other non-curricular clubs to meet. Federal law mandates 
that schools allow religious clubs to meet on public school campuses. Many 
school districts allow elementary school children to leave campus during the 
school day for religious education. California guidelines on history require 
teachers to teach about the major world religions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some members of Congress are backing a constitutional amendment to put 
prayer back into schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Rep. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) joined 41 other members to 
support Rep. Ernest Istook Jr.'s (R-Okla.) draft of an amendment that would 
give public schools a legal means for re-establishing voluntary organized 
school prayer or moments of silence. It reads: 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing in this Constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or 
group prayer in public schools or other public institutions. No person shall be 
required by the United States or by any State to participate in prayer. Neither 
the United States nor any State shall compose the words of any prayer to be 
said in public schools." 
</P>
<P>
 While this may sound innocuous enough, what is to stop a school's student body 
government from writing a prayer to be read over the intercom? It would not be 
a government-written prayer, but wouldn't the school be saying that this is our 
preferred prayer, this religion is our preferred religion? Wouldn't the school 
be saying that if you don't believe in any religion, you are not welcomed in 
society? 
</P>
<P>
 A constitutional amendment would be redundant if it merely ensured students' 
unfettered right to prayer. The First Amendment already guarantees this right. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers may vote to "restore" religion in the classroom because they have 
wrongly convinced many Americans that it has been thrown out. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth doesn't seem to be worth much anymore; perception is all that matters.

BATTERED WOMEN IN VALLEY CAN TURN TO SUPPORT SYSTEM IN COURTHOUSE; VAN NUYS 
CLINIC ESTABLISHED IN 1991 AND STAFFED BY VOLUNTEER ATTORNEYS PROVIDES HELP 
THAT BENEFITS VICTIMS AND SOCIETY. BUT IT ALWAYS NEEDS MORE LAWYERS AND MONEY.

<P>
 You still see them bent over tables in the cafeteria of the Van Nuys Superior 
Court building -- battered women laboriously trying to fill out the forms to 
ask for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not as bad as it used to be. Years of publicity have brought a higher 
awareness of domestic violence, and 1991 saw the establishment of a program 
specifically to help its victims. But it operates on a shoestring and, like its 
parent organization, is chronically understaffed. 
</P>
<P>
 These injured women cannot afford lawyers, and by law only lawyers are allowed 
to provide the legal advice often necessary to complete the paperwork for a 
restraining order. So unless they can get free legal help, they are left to 
cope as best they can. 
</P>
<P>
 The past few years have seen the creation of a support system staffed by 
volunteer attorneys from the San Fernando Valley. It often works well. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of a composite character I will call Susan, the mother of four 
who has been in an abusive relationship for nine years. Finally, after a death 
threat by her husband, she goes to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 An officer directs her to the Domestic Violence Clinic in a nondescript office 
in a corner of the courthouse cafeteria. There, if she is lucky, she becomes a 
client with a lawyer who will later represent her in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Domestic Violence Clinics were established by the court and the 
Pacoima-based Family Law Center, the Susans of the Valley had no place to go 
for quick, competent legal help. The law has always prohibited non-attorneys 
from practicing law, so clerks and bailiffs felt unable to help with the legal 
problems these victims confronted. Often, after a woman painfully filled out 
the forms to get a restraining order, they were rejected. Many victims gave up 
and simply returned to the abusive relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinics in Van Nuys and the courthouse in San Fernando have assisted about 
10,000 victims since they were established. 
</P>
<P>
 A staff of trained volunteers and a rotating staff of 13 supervising attorneys 
are there not only to help with restraining orders but to counsel victims and 
offer legal alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics on domestic violence in Los Angeles County are staggering. In 
1992, the city attorney's office prosecuted more than 23,000 cases of domestic 
violence. It ranked second in the number of cases prosecuted and is the leading 
cause of injury to women. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is still a gap between the need and the available help. The shortage 
of volunteer lawyers limits the clinics' hours to the morning, leaving an 
unknown but significant number of women without help. Most women are not as 
lucky as Susan and must represent themselves because no lawyers are available 
to appear in their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 The Domestic Violence Clinics are a significant part of the 9-year-old Family 
Law Center, a public agency initially created through the joint effort of the 
San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services in Pacoima and the San Fernando 
Bar Assn. It was originally funded by a grant from the Legal Service Corp. in 
Washington and now is partly supported by Neighborhood Legal Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing a variety of services to poor people in the Valley, it is the only 
legal aid clinic in California that assumes full legal representation in 
tackling the myriad issues involved in child support and family law contests. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice of directly representing clients in domestic cases whenever 
possible sets the center apart from most legal aid clinics, which simply help 
indigent people fill out forms. Clients then must represent themselves before 
the court, often against attorneys. They often do not know, or lose sight of, 
the relevant legal issues. They are often unable to make their cause understood 
by judicial officers from whom they are seeking relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Our hypothetical Susan will have a volunteer Family Law Center attorney to 
explain the court system, represent her before a judicial officer and negotiate 
with opposing counsel. Lacking support other than her abusing husband's salary, 
she will seek a child and spousal support order. Both she and society will 
benefit: She will stay off welfare, and child support payments are far more 
generous than welfare benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, the Family Law Center will work faster than the overburdened 
district attorney at obtaining child support and, unlike the district attorney, 
can also represent Susan on visitation and custody issues. 
</P>
<P>
 With its cadre of 99 volunteer lawyers, the Family Law Center provides close 
to 5,000 hours a year of legal services to the Valley's indigent population. It 
does so with an annual cash flow of only $10,000. A small law firm working the 
same hours would have an operating cost of approximately $280,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its efficiency, only 300 families can be helped at any one time. Every 
day approximately 20 people are turned away because there are not enough 
volunteers and resources such as computers available to help them. Annually 
that means that over 5,200 families go away from the Family Law Center unaided. 
What happens to them is unknown. With no funds and with no legal support, 
welfare becomes one of the few remaining viable options for survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley legal community must sustain the urgency and commitment to the 
Family Law Center. Failing to do so will prove terribly costly, both 
economically and socially. Volunteers Needed 
</P>
<P>
 The Family Law Center is seeking lawyers, psychologists, office workers and 
translators who can donate two or more hours a week. It also needs donations of 
computers, office equipment and office supplies. Those wishing to volunteer, 
make donations or get more information may call the center's executive 
director, Sharlie Allen, at (818) 890-9885.

GOP'S GAIN MAY BE VALLEY'S LOSS; AS REPUBLICANS PREPARE TO TAKE CONTROL OF THE 
STATE ASSEMBLY, THE REGION'S CLOUT IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO DIMINISH WITH THE 
CHANGE OF KEY LEADERSHIP POSITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LITCHMAN, Marc Litchman is a political consultant and a former chief of 
staff to Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) and Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Getting secondary attention amid all the hoopla of the GOP's taking control of 
Congress for the first time in decades is the fact that the Republicans also 
have taken control of the state Assembly for the first time since the 
mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 After the smoke cleared last week from a pivotal race that hinged on a 
$125,000 last-minute contribution to the Republican Party from tobacco and food 
giant Phillip Morris Cos., the GOP emerged with a 41-to-39 advantage in the 
lower house of the Legislature. Barring the unexpected, Democratic Speaker 
Willie Brown is out, and Republican Jim Brulte, a 38-year-old Republican from 
Rancho Cucamonga, is in. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Washington, GOP control of the Assembly will create some immediate 
losses in the San Fernando Valley and some long-term concerns. The prospects 
for the Valley's clout being sustained by the Republicans are dim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's biggest loss is the almost certain ejection of Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), soon to become a member of the minority party, from the 
chairmanship of the powerful Transportation Committee. Katz is a close friend 
and ally of Brown's and a trusted member of his inner circle. It doesn't take a 
brain surgeon to see that the loss of this chairmanship and the downgrading of 
the Valley's biggest booster in the Capitol is substantial. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz led the decade-long effort to build Mission College in his district and 
has used his leadership position to rebuild Cal State Northridge after the 
earthquake. He has kept up the heat on state and local transportation agencies 
to make sure the Valley gets the rail, freeway and other important 
transportation improvements it deserves. Any Republican replacement will be 
ill-positioned to hold Gov. Pete Wilson's bungling Transportation Department's 
feet to the fire on important issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Valley Republicans, Paula Boland of Granada Hills has been there long 
enough to get a big committee, and the rumor is that she will get Public Safety 
-- long criticized as being the liberal graveyard of anti-crime legislation. 
Because of the great concern about crime, this committee should get a lot of 
action and a lot of ink. Hey, maybe Bill Hoge can finally get a hearing on his 
"three strikes and you're dead" bill to impose capital punishment for a third 
violent felony. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, great local optimism that Boland, with her majority status, 
can move the bill through the Legislature on the breakup of the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. This chance would greatly increase if Democratic 
Valley Sen. David Roberti, a district-busting backer, had not lost his seat to 
term limits. Democratic Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, now representing the East 
Valley, might put this popular bill on Wilson's desk if he chooses to team up 
with Boland. But -- and it's a big but -- the Democrats, led by old-school 
liberal Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), still barely control the state Senate, where 
the California Teachers Assn. and the United Teachers-Los Angeles, opponents of 
the breakup, have commanding influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the school district, Boland, in her new position in the majority, will 
face the same problem as many Republicans, who have spent their careers 
splendidly aloof from having to back up their words with action. Will she 
abandon her anti-government rhetoric long enough to fight for the services we 
in the Valley need -- and deserve? Or will she give in to reactionary elements 
of her party and leave the Valley an organ donor for other parts of the state 
with more pragmatic, able representation? 
</P>
<P>
 Will she even choose to tackle problems in the east San Fernando Valley, far 
from her homogenized cul-de-sac's constituents, or will she leave the neediest 
in our community standing alone on a street corner with a tin cup? 
</P>
<P>
 Valley politics and public policy have always been governed by the creed "The 
Valley must get its fair share." And in November, Valley voters rewarded their 
state legislators for putting Valley interests first by putting them out of 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not our streets are safe, our schools produce and our neighborhoods 
are decent places to raise our families is now in the hands of Republican 
majorities in Sacramento and Washington. It will be up to them to put a new 
word in their vocabulary -- deliver.

MIKE PENNER: FOR KANSAS, IT'S A NO-BRAINER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So the mantle of the top college hoops team in the land has changed hands 
again. Nothing surprising there -- except, maybe, for the fact that it changed 
hands in Anaheim -- since the mantle comes with a 72-hour warranty and after 
that you're on your own. 
</P>
<P>
 That final score again: 
</P>
<P>
 Smart Guys 81, Team Thick As A Brick 75. 
</P>
<P>
 That was how the opening game of Saturday's John R. Wooden Classic 
doubleheader was billed, wasn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas, the team with "the backcourt with the highest grade-point average in 
America," according to Coach Roy Williams, the program that had received the 
John R. Wooden seal of approval for playing the best team basketball in the 
country, against Skip-Class UMass, the team reputed to own six GPAs lower than 
the ERA of Greg Maddux, including one curve-buster of 0.75, which must mean the 
student-athlete in question passed Breathing 101 and nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the corridors of academia, these are supposedly very minute men. UMass 
Coach John Calipari has been fending off the body blows for weeks, but as if to 
reinforce the image, The Pond scoreboard, located mere feet above the UMass 
bench, displayed a trailer for the new Jim Carrey movie late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dumb And Dumber" is the movie's title. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas beat UMass by six points in this one, so, according to the formula, 
Kansas out-thought UMass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team got beat and outcoached," Calipari said, hammering the stereotype 
over the head a little harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "They milked the lob play. Roy Williams is a great coach and he knew our kids 
couldn't make the adjustments, so he kept going to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Jayhawk dressing room, Williams praised -- what else? -- the 
thought processes of his starting guards, Jacque (No 'S,' Only One 'B' In Four 
Years Of High School) Vaughn and Jerod Haase, who spent his 1993-94 redshirt 
season in Lawrence amassing semester GPAs of 3.3 and 3.6. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must have the highest GPA of any backcourt in America," Williams said. 
"They're good kids to be around." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a simple plot line, but it falls apart just as easily. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Jayhawks are so smart, what were they doing turning the ball over 14 
times in the first half, compared to five for the Minutemen? 
</P>
<P>
 And if the Jayhawks are more can-think than can-do, how does one explain the 
very UMassian lob-and-dunk game plan that had virtually everyone in the Kansas 
lineup hanging on the rim at one time or another, the 6-3 Haase included? 
</P>
<P>
 You don't beat the No. 1 team in the country if you have no game. The Jayhawks 
may relish their reputation as cerebral overachievers -- amazing how many Top 
20 teams they seem to sneak up on -- but even the Wizard himself will admit 
that brain cells alone aren't what made Lew Alcindor and Bill Walton champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden has said he admires the Jayhawks for "subordinating themselves for the 
welfare of the team," but there can be no subordinating the fact that this team 
features an All-American-caliber point guard in Vaughn, a formidable 
shot-blocker in center Greg Ostertag and the potential of starting a 
mountainous front line measuring 6-10, 7-2, 6-11 across. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty big team, huh?" Ostertag said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, and, as they say, that's tough to teach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas beat UMass primarily by utilizing the 7-2 Ostertag, his 6-10 backup 
Scot Pollard and 6-11 forward Raef LaFrentz to their fullest -- by lobbing the 
ball inside and having them reach up slightly and either lay or slam the ball 
through the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 Minuteman forward Lou Roe got his 33 points, but LaFrentz's 18, Pollard's 12 
and Ostertag's 9 more than compensated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys may not jump as high as UMass,' " Haase allowed, "but they're big 
guys . They're easy to lob to. They're large targets." 
</P>
<P>
 And Vaughn, who skimmed all over The Pond, passing off for 11 assists, scoring 
14 points, may well have been the best player on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow," was how Ostertag described him. "Jacque's unbelievable. The way he sees 
the floor, how he dishes it out, who he dishes it out to, how he draws the foul 
when he needs it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostertag went on and on, finally unable to resist: "He's very smart." 
</P>
<P>
 Here we go again. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell by the way he talks." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone asked Ostertag to provide an example. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a Kansas basketball player with a perplexed look on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to say it," Ostertag answered. "He's floor smart, I guess. 
He just knows what to do in every key situation . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostertag's voice trailed off, and he shrugged and laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said in summation. 
</P>
<P>
 Easier to answer was the No. 1 question. As in, if UMass became No. 1 after 
beating No. 1 Arkansas, shouldn't it follow that Kansas would do the same after 
beating No. 1 UMass? 
</P>
<P>
 "Naw," Ostertag said. "I couldn't care less. No. 1 doesn't mean anything right 
now. We're two games into the season. A lot is going to happen between now and 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could be No. 1 all year, go 35-0 and lose in the Final Four and it means 
nothing. 'The No. 1 team in the country' -- that could end at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were there last year and our next game, we lost to Kansas State. No, we 
could be No. 7 all year and stay quite happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Look what happened to No. 1 on Dec. 3, Ostertag noted. And who could argue the 
point? 
</P>
<P>
 Smart team, Kansas.

ACTION COMES AFTER BOWE WINS; BOXING: CIVIL SUIT AND PROMISED CRIMINAL CHARGES 
STEMMING FROM SUCKER PUNCH ON MONDAY FOLLOW 12-ROUND DECISION OVER LARRY 
DONALD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fight started in a lounge on Monday, moved to a ring on Saturday, spilled 
over into a press tent afterward and figures to end up in Superior Court 
sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight in the ring? Oh yeah, that . 
</P>
<P>
 Once the two sides decided on a ring size, an issue that caused 
screaming-match acrimony, Riddick Bowe at last stalked his elusive opponent 
down and won a unanimous 12-round decision over Larry Donald before a crowd of 
3,574 at the Caesars Palace Sports Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe (35-1) dominated from start to finish in a fight that did not compare to 
events that preceded and proceeded it. One judge had Bowe winning all 12 
rounds. Donald, who danced effectively early, became an easy target in the 
latter rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe stunned Donald with a straight left in the 12th and then went on furious 
pursuit for a knockout, coming up short as Donald, his face bloodied and 
swollen, wobbled to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Riddick fought the better fight," Donald (16-1) said. "He was the better man. 
But I'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
 According to stats provided by CompuBox, Bowe landed more than twice as many 
punches, 219 to Donald's 103. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was only the half of it. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bowe sat in the news conference folding chair afterward, a brawl nearly 
ensued when the former heavyweight champion was served legal papers in 
connection with a civil suit filed against him Friday in Los Angeles Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe, remember, had sucker-punched Donald last Monday at a Forum news 
conference to promote the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Saturday's fight, copies of the complaint, accusing Bowe of assault and 
battery and "Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress," had been passed out 
on press row. 
</P>
<P>
 After his victory, Bowe apologized for the incident and even embraced Donald 
later in the press tent. After Bowe sat down, however, Harry Callicotte, 
wearing a Team Donald jacket, approached the fighter and tried to serve him 
papers, a legal formality, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe refused to accept the document and left. Members of Bowe's entourage, 
though, erupted with anger and had to be restrained, it appeared, from 
attacking Callicotte. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd go over there and the guy would try to clock me," 
Callicotte said. "It's all a part of the procedure. He (Bowe) must have known 
it was coming." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen members of the Las Vegas Police Department stormed the tent 
and separated members of the two camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Callicotte, it turns out, is the boyfriend of Donald's manager's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Roderick J. Lindblom, an attorney representing Donald, said criminal charges 
of assault and battery would be filed against Bowe next week in Los Angeles 
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Bowe will have to appear, and a warrant will be issued if he doesn't 
come," Lindblom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe was unavailable for comment about the suit. Rock Newman, his manager, 
said the fighter was driving back home to Maryland in a motor home. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Nelson, one of Donald's two managers, said Bowe was served after the 
bout so as to not further disrupt the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 As if that were possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said promoter Bob Arum had threatened to cancel the fight at 4 p.m. 
over arguments about the ring size, which originally had been set at 17.2 feet, 
a size the Donald camp thought greatly favored Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, though, had contractual control over the ring size. 
</P>
<P>
 After a screaming match between Arum and Newman in which epithets were 
exchanged, the ring was set at 18.2 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ratner, executive director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission, said 
that beginning Monday, all ring sizes in Nevada will be standardized at 20 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Once all parties laid down their arms, Bowe took a positive, if not 
compelling, step back toward regaining the heavyweight title he lost more than 
a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 His punches, particularly his right, missed wildly at times and showed the 
effects of having fought only once once since November of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Futch, Bowe's 83-year old trainer, called it "ring rust." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe seemed satisfied. And confident. In fact, before the Donald fight, he 
reportedly had secured a contract to fight World Boxing Organization champion 
Herbie Hide next March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I proved without doubt I'm the best heavyweight in the world," Bowe said 
afterward. "I'm real happy with the fight. He never hurt me. The fight went 
about how I expected."

MIKE DOWNEY: HELPFUL HINT: ACT LIKE WOODEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach John Wooden, the Wizard of . . . Anaheim ? . . . lent his name to a 
college hoops doubleheader Saturday at home-away-from-home Pondy Pavilion. Good 
move, Wiz. Those Eastern schools never could win anything that involved you. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything went excellently in Wooden Classic I, beginning with No. 1-ranked 
Massachusetts being knocked off by UMass murderer Kansas, followed by UCLA's 
last-second victory over a school that really knows how to lose in the last 
second, Kentucky. UCLA Coach Jim Harrick had his team prepared, except for 
trying to send in one of his players without any pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from that, Harrick rejoiced over "the fans of Los Angeles," "an 
unbelievable setting," "a fantastic day" and "a terrific game" here at Pauley 
South, also saying, "Regardless of the price of tickets, everybody got their 
money's worth!" Oh, cheer up, Jim. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Kentucky's coach, Rick Pitino, he cost his team this one-point game by 
drawing a two-shot technical foul in the second half. Tyus Edney made both, 
which meant as much as hero J.R. Henderson's two free throws did later. A point 
is a point is a point. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when Pitino said afterward, "We don't like to lose -- we hate to lose, as 
a matter of fact," we trust the coach was aware that he had just lost the 
Wooden Classic by not acting more like Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
 Having opened the season against Tennessee Martin and Cal State Northridge -- 
obviously, Slippery Rock and Cal Lutheran had previous commitments -- the 
Kentucky and UCLA squads were ranked 3-4 in the weekly poll of NCAA coaches. By 
the time they took the floor, the Massachusetts team that was ranked above them 
had already been defeated, 81-75, by Jacque Vaughn and the other jocks from 
Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Between games, NBC ran an interview with Wooden in which he told a funny story 
about Bill Walton, who was not all that funny during college, as I recall. 
Seems Walton believed in doing something his way instead of the coach's way and 
Wooden said he respected any player for standing up for his beliefs, and by the 
way, Bill, "We'll miss you." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the UCLA-Kentucky game, during which Wooden took a bow and 
introduced his kids and grandkids, who, I'm pretty sure, counted for 307 of the 
crowd of 18,307. The coach looked great and we wish he would have accepted 
Harrick's respectful offer to act as UCLA's "honorary coach," if only so that 
when Harrick asked Ed O'Bannon to report in for Charles O'Bannon, maybe Wooden 
would have observed that Ed wasn't wearing any pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed had scraped his hand. Then he wiped them on his shorts, which left bloody 
handprints. Unbeknown to his coach, Ed was standing there in his undergarments 
when Harrick ordered him to go into the game for his brother. Ed said, uh, 
can't, coach, so Charles had to stay out there with four fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereupon poor Charles promptly drew his fifth foul, frustrating him so much 
that Charlie stalked off the court and directly up the nearest ramp, doing the 
fastest exit of a building since Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 By game's end, though, Charles was back, patting his teammates' backs in the 
huddle. With or without him, the Bruins had hung in there. They took a 17-3 
Kentucky run right on the chin, but kept on coming. Cameron Dollar and Tyus 
Edney kept taking the ball and dribble-driving, penetrating, looking out of 
control to the naked eye but actually making things happen, causing the defense 
to drop off UCLA's bigger men. 
</P>
<P>
 Such as George Zidek, the center who looks a million times more confident this 
season. The same Zidek who began the second half with a skyhook, of all things. 
The same Zidek who strongly urged Ed O'Bannon in the huddle, after a UCLA 
timeout with 38.7 seconds remaining, to get him the basketball. Which Ed did, 
watching as Zidek thundered to the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 That one made the score 81-80, Kentucky, with only 18 seconds to play, and who 
stood behind the UCLA huddle after the next timeout, whirling his arm to work 
up the Anaheim crowd on UCLA's behalf? Zidek did. The Z Man makes his mark. 
</P>
<P>
 With the crowd behind them, the Bruins double-teamed a Kentucky ballhandler, 
Rodrick Rhodes, who looked for 6-foot-10 Mark Pope and bounced a 2-foot-10 pass 
to him. Off Pope's kneecap it went, out of bounds to UCLA, and off went Marquis 
Burns of the Bruins, hopping all over the court, happy that he had been the one 
to force the bad pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney did his dribbling thing. He didn't pass, didn't even look to pass. He 
just Curly Nealed his way from place to place, bouncing the ball as the clock 
wound down. Scant seconds remained when Edney finally did what he had been 
doing to Pitino's Wildcats all day -- driving right through them. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney, last seen by this reporter whipping a floor with a towel in the Tulsa 
game, dished to Henderson, who got fouled with 0:00.6 to play. Now, there isn't 
much a man can do in 0:00.6, which is like a second, only shorter. But 
Henderson was only too happy to step to the free-throw line, where he felt sure 
he would sink a pair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah? Tell 'em what you did in the preseason," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, I missed, that's all," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh for five," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not wishing to be given bus fare and sent back to Bakersfield, the freshman 
stepped up, aimed two free throws and drained them. And UCLA players hugged and 
danced and even carried the hero off on their shoulders and felt every bit as 
great as, oh, 1968.

JIM MURRAY: CUE MUSIC, 'HUSTLER' IS IN TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I hate to snitch, but it's my civic duty to tell you there's a hustler in our 
midst. As a matter of fact, it's "The Hustler." 
</P>
<P>
 You remember the movie by that name years ago? You remember the fat guy with 
the pool cue played by Jackie Gleason? They called him "Minnesota Fats" in the 
movie, but the real character it was based on had only been through Minnesota. 
His real handle was "New York Fats." He was born and raised in Washington 
Heights in Manhattan. They changed the name to keep him from suing.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, you don't have to keep your hand on your wallet or sleep with your 
poke under your pillow or steer clear of the pool halls. Fatty has long since 
been out of stroke. You'll play hob getting his age out of him, but it's well 
past the three score and 10 the Bible allots. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in his day, he was a beaut. The things Fats could do with a pool cue were 
works of art. He could put a cue ball in your ear as well as a corner pocket if 
you wanted. He did with a pool cue what Babe Ruth did with a bat, Red Grange 
with a football, Magic Johnson with a basketball, or Ben Hogan with a two-wood. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He used to tour the country, looking for the local billiard celebrities. He'd 
arrive in town off a freight, a bus or an asthmatic sedan full of pool sticks. 
In some cases, the town would have been better off with a visit from Jesse 
James.  
</P>
<P>
 There would be this silhouette filling up the pool hall door. Fats went way up 
in the high 200s in his heyday, but his stroke was as smooth as corn silk and 
as deadly as an adder's.  
</P>
<P>
 He was born Rudolf Wunderone. He came from a long line of working people. His 
father was a building superintendent, which means he had a hammer or a broom in 
his hand most of the time. But son Rudolf had cue chalk and the eight-ball in 
his as soon as he was tall enough to see over a pool table. 
</P>
<P>
 He likes to brag he never worked a day in his life. But it depends on your 
definition of work. Some people would consider circling the globe and making a 
fine living with nothing but a stick and a head full of larceny as difficult as 
hauling hods.  
</P>
<P>
 Fatty didn't just look for "marks." He played the best. Some of the crowned 
heads of Europe caught his act. A lot of guys with Lord and Sir and Baron in 
front of their names lost money to him.  
</P>
<P>
 He never had a sponsor. He played for his own money. There were, of course, 
the occasional burned bettors who felt they had been snookered and might resort 
to mayhem or even homicide, but Fatty had all his teeth and ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatty kept moving. Pool hustlers, like riverboat gamblers or golf course 
pirates, like to remain as anonymous as possible. But Fatty's tonnage gave him 
away. He was as difficult not to notice in town as the Queen Mary.  
</P>
<P>
 Fatty objected to the word hustler. He took the position that the victim 
should be honored. It was like giving up a homer to Ruth, getting knocked down 
by Jack Dempsey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let anybody play for anything," he said when I caught up with him the other 
day at the Bicycle Club in Bell Gardens, the pool and card casino where he's 
heading up the sixth annual Open and Invitational Nine-Ball tournament this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Tournaments like this are a tribute to the old-line legends like Fatty 
Wunderone -- and Willie Mosconi and Ralph Greenleaf. The guys who made the game 
romantic and fodder for films, who lifted the game out of its back-alley and 
disreputable image in the days when "pool hall" had the same connotation as 
"gambling den" or "opium parlor." 
</P>
<P>
 "I never played nobody for money they didn't insist on putting up," says Fats. 
"I didn't have no gun." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't need one. The pool cue was all the firepower he needed. He made more 
money with a pool cue than Al Capone did with a machine gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew every gangster who ever lived," boasts Fatty, who speaks in the high 
hyperbole of a man who made his living by out-psyching the world as he racked 
them up. "Pretty Boy Floyd, Capone, Baby Face Nelson. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I never beat a man didn't ask for it. I beat everybody living in cards, pool, 
dice. I spoke five languages. I could beat you in five languages. I traveled 
all the five continents. I stayed in villas. I played four moves ahead of 
everybody. I was the boss.  
</P>
<P>
 "Golf? I never wanted no golf. That's work. If I wanted work, I'd get a lunch 
pail and a hard hat and join the union. We didn't have no union. I never had no 
work in my life. I took care of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ironed them out. I liked to play the good players. I didn't like to play no 
lambs. Oh, I would if they insisted. I'd give them seven, eight, nine balls. 
They knew who I was. I liked to play the guys thought they were the best in 
their states. I ironed them out." 
</P>
<P>
 I first met Fatty when he was in a kind of temporary retirement 20 years ago 
or more. He was living in Dowell, Ill., with a wife, 27 cats and some dogs and 
birds.  
</P>
<P>
 I was there to cover the Hambletonian trotting race in nearby Du Quoin. Fatty 
cornered me in a booth at the St. Nicholas hotel. The movie, "The Hustler," had 
just come out. Fatty was livid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Them bastids!" he said. "Them Hollywood bastids! They took my life and they 
made it into a moving picture! I'mna sue them bastids for every penny they 
made!" 
</P>
<P>
 I sighed. "Fatty," I told him, "MGM has 1,200 of the best lawyers in the 
world. They could get the Boston Strangler community service. You go into court 
against them with a lawyer from Dowell and they'll wind up owning your cats. 
Don't fight 'em. Join 'em! Cash in on it! Tell 'em you're Minnesota Fats. 
Exploit it. That's the name of the game now. The only ones who win suits are 
lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the best advice I ever gave anyone. The next year, I went back to Du 
Quoin for the race. Fatty showed up at the door. He was driving one of those 
block-long Cadillacs, gold-colored, with the fins on the back. He was dressed 
in a silk shirt, two-toned shoes and elegant tan tailored slacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Murray!" he said, spotting me and opening up his car trunk. "Look!" He 
showed me pool cues, balls, racks -- and big tear sheets proclaiming, "See the 
original Minnesota Fats in exhibition!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to get in," he announced. "I'm the greatest pool player there ever 
was! I'm entitled!" 
</P>
<P>
 He never gave me credit. I should have sued. But I joined him instead. After 
all he was the greatest pool hustler there ever was. In five languages.

MORNING BRIEFING: NEVER TOO EARLY TO PRONOUNCE THE WINNER

 It's Heisman Trophy time again, and Jim Armstrong of the Denver Post writes 
that of all the lengths schools have gone to hype their players for the award, 
none stretched the limits more than Notre Dame in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate was Joe Theismann and the hype had begun two years earlier when 
Roger Valdiserri, Notre Dame's sports information director at the time, and Joe 
Doyle, sports editor of the South Bend Tribune, were watching practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran past us and I said 'There goes Joe THEEZ-man,' " said Valdiserri, 
correctly pronouncing the quarterback's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, Joe Doyle looked at me and said, 'No, it's THIGHS-man as in Heisman.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Add Heisman: The campaign for THIGHS-man was on, but to no avail. Jim Plunkett 
of Stanford won the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which Ivy League player last won the Heisman Trophy? 
</P>
<P>
 Please not again: Art Spander of the San Francisco Examiner is skeptical of 
the rumors that Al Davis will move the Raiders to their original home in 
Oakland: 
</P>
<P>
 "Through the seasons, Lonesome Al has been depicted as devious, heartless and 
mercenary. It is to note he has never, ever been labeled foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It matters not how many tales of Davis returning to Oakland are floated by 
the media or politicians, Al, in the vernacular, ain't coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Considerate: New York Jet quarterback Boomer Esiason on the urgency by the NFL 
to protect the knees of quarterbacks: 
</P>
<P>
 "The good guys in the league hit you high. Reggie White hits you high. He 
doesn't try to ruin your career." 
</P>
<P>
 Fact finding: John Eisenberg in the Baltimore Sun:  
</P>
<P>
 Fact: "There were 46 7-footers in the NBA on opening day." 
</P>
<P>
 Fact: " 'I believe we deserve to go (to a major bowl), based on our play the 
last four games,' says Lou Holtz. (Notre Dame's only victories in its last four 
games were against Navy and Air Force.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Beli-aching: Even though the Browns have a 9-3 record, Coach Bill Belichick is 
still a controversial figure in Cleveland, according to Jon Saraceno of USA 
Today:  
</P>
<P>
 "(Belichick) has been accused of everything but the collapse of the bond 
market. Poor rapport with players. Media unfriendly. Humorless. (Though he once 
said: 'It's important to have a great wife, a loyal dog and a healthy 
quarterback -- not necessarily in that order.')" 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: When Texas Tech plays USC in the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 2, it will be the 
Red Raiders' first appearance in that game since 1939, when they lost to St. 
Mary's, 20-13.

 Trivia answer: Dick Kazmaier of Princeton in 1951.

MILLER HAS SHOWN HE CAN DO A GREAT EVERETT IMPRESSION; PRO FOOTBALL: BUT RAMS, 
WHO FACE SAINTS TODAY, WERE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE.

<P>
 The return of Jim Everett? But he never left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams announced after the 1993 season that they had traded Everett to New 
Orleans for a seventh-round pick in the 1994 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams got rid of a quarterback who had gone 3-6 as a starter last season 
with more interceptions than touchdowns and who blamed others for his 
misfortune, and acquired a quarterback who is now 2-6 as a starter with more 
interceptions than touchdowns and who makes excuses for his failures. 
</P>
<P>
 The cloning of Jim Everett produced Chris Miller, and like twins separated at 
birth, they might be 2,000 miles apart but they are still alike in so many 
ways: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Saints and Rams are 4-8, the only 4-8 teams in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Everett and Miller have thrown seven interceptions each in the fourth 
quarter this season, the only two NFC quarterbacks to have thrown that many in 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Everett has a .304 winning percentage as a starting quarterback in the 
'90s, Miller a .308 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some good games and had some poor games. Right now I'm going one 
week at a time, hoping to play well," Miller said. A year ago, Everett was 
saying the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Everett is gone, his '93 replacement, T.J. Rubley, has been released, and 
the Rams continue to have a problem at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller appears to be one or two more interceptions away from being replaced 
once again by Chris Chandler, who becomes a free agent at the end of the 
season. Tommy Maddox, who was acquired from Denver for a fourth-round draft 
pick, has been given the cold shoulder by the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Just who is the No. 1 quarterback for the Rams in the years to come? 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the kinds of things that we just don't want to discuss in the 
press," said Mike Martz, Ram quarterback coach. "It's just not something we 
want to do. Those are decisions that haven't necessarily been made yet, and to 
start airing it out now without knowing how it stacks up wouldn't be right. . . 
. It's not a secret, I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller should be the Rams' no-doubt-about-it starting quarterback, considering 
that the team is paying him $9 million for three years. But Miller, who said 
his goal this season was to complete 62% of his passes, has completed only 
51.9% and has failed to impress consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I feel Chris came in here and did really what he (wanted?)" defensive end 
Fred Strickland said. "I don't think that has happened this year, or up until 
this point, because of certain situations, like getting hurt. The top spot 
hasn't been sewed up at all because it's more like who's healthy this week, 
that's who starts." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller riled Coach Chuck Knox earlier this season after blaming his misguided 
passes in the Georgia Dome on the wet pants of center Bern Brostek. He said he 
was unable to grip the ball properly, and then later, after a loss to Green 
Bay, he blamed a fourth-quarter interception on wide receiver Flipper Anderson, 
saying Anderson had run the wrong route. 
</P>
<P>
 This week he singled out wide receiver Jessie Hester for the same offense and 
said another of his four interceptions against San Diego had been caused by the 
coaches in the press box incorrectly identifying the opposition's defense. When 
players and coaches chastised him for his remarks, he told them he was 
misquoted, although his comments were caught on the tape recorders of half a 
dozen reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not good; nobody wants to see that," said Anthony Newman, Ram safety 
and defensive team captain. "It's bothersome. If you feel that way -- in any 
job -- you should keep it to yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago Everett called the Ram offense "obsolete," and criticized his 
offensive line for not providing time to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Everett) did it all the time; it's terrible," linebacker Shane Conlan said. 
"That's the worst thing that can happen to a team. Everybody hates losing, but 
when people start calling guys out, that's when you get chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams insist they remain unified, but a loss to Everett and the Saints will 
assure them of a fifth consecutive losing season and raise more questions about 
the direction of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first game between the Saints and Rams this season in New Orleans, 
Everett prevailed, 37-34. He completed 17 of 26 passes for 206 yards with a 
touchdown and no interceptions and said after the game, "This was a big win for 
me. If I was a hot-air balloon, I'd be way up there by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, before suffering a concussion against the Saints, completed seven of 
11 passes for 88 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. Recovered now, 
he goes against a defense that has surrendered the most touchdowns passing, 24, 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order for us to be a quality team, we're going to need somebody to emerge 
at the quarterback position," running back Jerome Bettis said. "It's not a 
discredit to the guys we have, but you just have to have to solid play out of 
the position if you're going to have the chance to be a good team."

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES: THE ONE-STEP OUTRAGE; OPEN SEASON ON NFL 
QUARTERBACKS FOR THOSE WHO RACE IN AND TAKE A STEP BEFORE UNLOADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever football fans tune in the pros this year, the defenses are out there 
showing off the NFL's new morality: 
</P>
<P>
 It is open season on quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive players seem to have lost interest in merely rushing the passer. 
They're apparently out to hurt him now. They're using the most lethal force 
available to them, their helmets, to knock him down. 
</P>
<P>
 One quarterback after another, from Troy Aikman to Chris Miller, has fallen 
with a concussion. And some quarterbacks, Jeff Hostetler and Aikman among them, 
have gone down and out when opponents went for their knees. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is this happening?  
</P>
<P>
 Could it be a football manifestation of the hatred and viciousness in 
contemporary America, where murder is common, where physical abuse is the norm, 
and where hatred is built into everything from popular music to national 
politics? 
</P>
<P>
 Or could it be that the brutality grows out of an NFL rule that authorizes 
pass rushers to take one full step after the ball is gone before crashing into 
the quarterback? 
</P>
<P>
 That rule is an outrage. It has legalized gratuitous violence. And it has 
accustomed a nation of football fans and players to brutal hits on players long 
out of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 A sprinting linebacker races in now from seven to 10 yards away, takes one 
last giant stride, ducks, closes his eyes, and, using the crown of his helmet, 
knocks the passer silly when he's in a helpless position -- physically unable 
to defend himself -- after just throwing the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a name for that in football, spearing. There's another name for it in 
the law books, assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 What's to be done about it? The NFL's leaders should, first, abolish the 
one-step rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they should make it an NFL crime to hit any player who is out of the play 
-- as a passer is after the ball is gone, and as a receiver is when the ball is 
plainly under-thrown or overthrown. 
</P>
<P>
 A defensive player who ignores the ball and sneaks in unawares, smashing a 
defenseless opponent, is not playing a game. He is attacking a helpless human 
being. He should be ejected and fined -- and suspended. MAN OR VEGETABLE? 
</P>
<P>
 To most sports fans, the game's violence is an attractive aspect of pro 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a game, can the NFL penalize players for violence?  
</P>
<P>
 It already does. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL rid itself of sideline violence by enforcing 15-yard penalties for 
hits on out-of-bounds players -- even if they're one inch out of bounds, and 
even if the hit is involuntary and feather-soft. 
</P>
<P>
 What's needed now is the same kind of protection for quarterbacks and 
receivers who are out of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL once got by without such nit-picking enforcement. In the days when the 
Rams had the most feared front four in football -- the so-called Fearsome 
Foursome -- their Hall of Famers never picked on defenseless passers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ball had been thrown, they slowed down -- eased up. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did the NFL's fiercest defensive players ever go for Joe Namath's bad 
knees -- although hits like Aikman has endured this fall would have ended that 
Hall of Famer's career well before it got rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there other reasons for the injury problem?  
</P>
<P>
 Yes. For one thing, 1990s players are bigger and faster. Although steroid use 
seems to be down, some have apparently found other performance-enhancing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that has much to do with the main issue -- the head-to-head 
hitting that is scrambling the brains of the quarterbacks. A wiry 175-pounder 
in an NFL helmet can do that. The thing that's wrong now is the attitude of the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 What if the rules aren't changed?  
</P>
<P>
 Pro football will lose some of its most valuable players. A concussion is a 
critical -- if often underrated -- injury with a cumulative effect that can 
turn a human into a vegetable. 
</P>
<P>
 At 28, Aikman, cognizant of the peril, and having already made millions, has 
taken care of his money. Why shouldn't he now retire and take care of his 
health? Some of his advisers are urging just that. 
</P>
<P>
 To the league, the departure of such players would be an irreparable loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 28 pro clubs but only about eight good quarterbacks," Hall of Fame 
coach Sid Gillman said. "The teams have dozens of good players for other 
positions, but the supply of even adequate quarterbacks is the smallest in 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony is that no other players, in any sport, have to take the abuse that 
quarterbacks routinely get -- few as they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, none of them, not even Aikman, will blow the whistle. They fear a 
cry-baby label. They fear vengeance. BAN THE HEADHUNTERS 
</P>
<P>
 As an NFL concept, it should be illegal to hit to harm, or to hit a player who 
is out of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 What new rules would help?  
</P>
<P>
 The package should include these: 
</P>
<P>
 * Much stricter enforcement for hitting with the crown of the helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Heavy fines and suspensions for hitting head to head -- the most dangerous 
act in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * A specific injunction against hitting passers in the knees. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, NFL rules should outlaw hits below mid-thigh when the 
quarterback is standing or running laterally behind the line, or setting to 
throw or throwing. Defensive men who have been blocked or who are falling 
should be required to make every effort not to roll or scramble into the 
passer's legs. They must instead get up and hit him above mid-thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pass rushers must be making every effort to ease up if they unavoidably run 
into a quarterback who has thrown the ball. It has to be the defensive man's 
responsibility to know if the ball is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pass-defense players must be making every effort to ease up if they 
unavoidably run into a receiver who has dropped the ball or can't reach it. 
</P>
<P>
 In every case, the burden of proof has to be on the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Football properly played is, and should be, fierce but not brutal, violent but 
not life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 These should be the penalties: 
</P>
<P>
 * For hitting head to head or hitting a quarterback in the knees, 15 yards and 
automatic ejection, followed by a fine equal to a game's salary, or a 
suspension for one or two games, without pay. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the referee misses the call, the league should automatically fine the 
player a game's salary or suspend him for a game or two, without pay. 
</P>
<P>
 That would get the attention of the coaches who once punished their players 
for brutality but who now encourage it. 
</P>
<P>
 To assure that most quarterbacks live to fight another year, the NFL's club 
owners should make these changes before next month's playoffs. They aren't 
typical rule changes. Whereas the thrust of most new rules is to enliven the 
game, these are necessary to health and life. 'YOU'VE GOT TO PULL UP' 
</P>
<P>
 Some wonder whether it's realistic to ask defensive players to slow down 
before hitting a quarterback who has already thrown the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it?  
</P>
<P>
 A radio analyst for the Rams is here to tell you that it is. 
</P>
<P>
 He is former Fearsome Foursome defensive end Deacon Jones, who, as a 
quarterback hunter in the 1960s, was so effective that he coined a word for 
what he did -- the sack.  
</P>
<P>
 If, however, the passer could get the ball away -- no matter how close Jones 
-- the collision was invariably less than violent. He invariably eased up. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to pull up," Jones said. "There's always time enough to make that 
decision. I don't want to see them take the toughness out of the game -- but 
there's no pride in hitting a man when the ball is out (of his hands)." 
</P>
<P>
 Distinguishing between hits would be a judgment call for the officials, but 
what they do is make judgment calls -- judging, for example, whether a 
quarterback, when sprinting into the sideline, is an inch in or out when 
nudged. 
</P>
<P>
 It's far more dangerous in the pocket these days. 
</P>
<P>
 And one unforgivable aspect of all the brutality is that it's coarsening the 
players, as well as the officials and the league. 
</P>
<P>
 And a coarsening nation seems to love it all. The huge TV ratings for pro 
football are still going up. But does nothing else matter? Why must the NFL 
live down to the country's new low standards? Why not try to bring back some 
human dignity?

ANALYSIS; IF RAIDERS WANT TO RING IN NEW YEAR, CHANGES ARE NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Players were whispering it: We are loaded. Coach Art Shell was grudgingly 
acknowledging it: This Raider team might be my best. And the media were boldly 
predicting it: Raiders in the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the bright, heady days of summer, when the team, its roster 
brimming with big names, was looking forward to a glamorous preseason trip to 
Spain, a triumphant tour through the 16-game regular season and a glorious 
return to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Size those rings. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months later? 
</P>
<P>
 The cold reality of winter has settled in. Super Bowl? A playoff spot is 
questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders might have looked like a Super Bowl contender on paper. But that 
paper has been crumpled and trashed, along with game plan after game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell surveys the ruins of a once-promising season, losses and controversies 
littering the landscape, and wonders where it all went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I truly had the answer, it would be corrected," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it still can be. With four games left, starting Monday night in San 
Diego, the 6-6 Raiders find themselves one of eight teams fighting for two 
playoff spots. That's assuming that Miami wins the East, San Diego wins the 
West, and Cleveland and Pittsburgh, both 9-3, will make it, one as the Central 
winner, the other as a wild card. 
</P>
<P>
 What do the Raiders have to do to make the playoffs? Here are five 
suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Try working on the same page.  
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler and Shell get into a dispute about the 
play-calling. Receiver Tim Brown complains about the play-calling. Others 
complain about offensive coordinator Tom Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 The word most commonly whispered these days when discord on the Raiders is 
brought up is agenda . Everybody seems to have his own. Too many people seem to 
be more worried about themselves than about the common good. This team's new 
motto should be "Commitment to Ego." The players don't have faith in the 
coaches, and the coaches don't have faith in the players. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell has to take the reins, assert his authority, tell everybody else to shut 
up and try to reinstall a team mentality. Call the plays himself if necessary. 
He's the captain of the ship. He should be prepared to personally steer it to 
safety. If not, he'll go down with it. What does he have to lose? 
</P>
<P>
 2. Try giving the ball to Tom Rathman . 
</P>
<P>
 Much was made of the observation that the Raider passing game was too 
one-dimensional when Brown became Hostetler's only option on too many 
occasions. Well, the same can be said of the running game. It took the Raiders 
six games to realize that Harvey Williams, not Ty Montgomery, should be the 
starting tailback. 
</P>
<P>
 Now how long is it going to take them to realize the running game has also 
become too predictable? At fullback, Rathman is mainly asked to block. And 
considering the poor protection Hostetler has been getting of late, Rathman 
can't do enough of that. But making him a key player in the offense would give 
opposing defenses something else to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 With the San Francisco 49ers, he was a multipurpose back. He rushed for 1,902 
yards and gained another 2,490 as a pass receiver in his eight years with the 
club, scoring 34 touchdowns. He has carried the ball eight times and has caught 
eight passes over the last six games with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Give this man some work. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Try blocking better.  
</P>
<P>
 On paper, this looks like an overpowering offensive line. Left guard Steve 
Wisniewski is a perennial Pro Bowl player. Left tackle Gerald Perry is 
considered one of the most solid in the game. Right guard Kevin Gogan was a key 
lineman for the last two years for the Dallas Cowboys, both Super Bowl-winning 
years. At center, Don Mosebar has started 86 consecutive games for the Raiders 
and has long been considered the anchor of this line. Only third-year pro Greg 
Skrepenak at right tackle lacks experience. 
</P>
<P>
 So where's the beef? The Raiders rank 13th among the 14 teams in the AFC in 
rushing offense and have given up 37 sacks, tied for second most in the league 
with the Denver Broncos behind only the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Hostetler finds himself wandering around, trying to remember where 
he is and, perhaps, why he agreed to come here in the first place. For a Hall 
of Fame offensive lineman like Shell, this is embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Try instilling some discipline . 
</P>
<P>
 After leading the league in penalties a year ago and coming within one of the 
league record of 149, the Raiders are back on top this season with 111. This 
isn't a matter of playing the old Raider way, of employing a hard-hitting, 
intimidating style that puts fear in the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The only fear these days comes from Shell and his staff when they hear yet 
another whistle because so many of this season's penalties have occurred on 
offense, killing drive after drive. Offside, false start, illegal motion, 
holding -- the Raiders have done it all. The offensive unit sometimes looks as 
if its players are meeting each other for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 With all that is at stake, can it be lack of concentration? With all the big 
names on this unit, can it be lack of talent? 
</P>
<P>
 5. Try playing defense for four quarters.  
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the Raiders have played well defensively. Fifth in that category in 
the AFC, they have been dominating at times. 
</P>
<P>
 But not in the fourth quarter, when they have been outscored, 98-49. Not in 
the closing minutes of games against the Chargers and the Miami Dolphins, when 
they couldn't hold leads. Not in the final minutes against the Houston Oilers 
and the New Orleans Saints when a couple of breaks -- a kick that hit the 
crossbar and a bad coaching decision by the Saints' Jim Mora -- saved the 
Raiders from two more collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Albert Lewis blames it on a lack of maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the problem, on defense and offense, the solutions must be found, 
immediately. A bright season is growing dim. Time is short. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders haven't tumbled into elimination yet. But from where they stand, 
it looks a lot closer than does the Super Bowl. AFC Playoff Picture 
</P>
<P>
 The three division winners, plus the three teams with the best record among 
non-division winners, advance to postseason play.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; NOVELTY HAS WORN OFF IN MINNESOTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the Twin Cities, where losing and threats about leaving have finally 
exhausted the townspeople's vast store of good will, the records keep falling: 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 9 -- The Lakers, once a big draw in their ancestral home, are greeted by 
15,892, the Timberwolves' smallest home crowd after four years of playing to 
97% of capacity. The Lakers win by 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 11 -- Another record low, 15,109, sees the Chicago Bulls cruise, 112-100. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 12 -- Another record low, 13,278, sees the Boston Celtics roll, 114-101. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 25 -- Another record low, 13,190, sees the Philadelphia 76ers win by a 
tidy 38. 
</P>
<P>
 And here's a date to note in your calendar: 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 26 -- Clippers at Timberwolves, the Monday night after Christmas, with 
the Vikings playing the San Francisco 49ers across town and the football game 
on home TV. Anyone who isn't being paid to be at the Target center, or isn't in 
on a complimentary ticket, is a fan, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 All but lost because of the Clippers' futility, the Timberwolves started 2-13. 
Even more impressive, they did it with real players: Christian Laettner, No. 3 
pick in the '92 draft; Isaiah Rider, No. 5 in '93; Donyell Marshall, No. 4 in 
'94. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, with better luck and a move up of one place each spring, they would 
have had Alonzo Mourning, Jamal Mashburn and Grant Hill. Instead, it's the 
pouty, the sulky and the rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking them in order: 
</P>
<P>
 Laettner -- To give this sourpuss his due, he cares about winning, tries hard, 
dives on the floor and tries to exhibit leadership, although in his inimitable 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, his exhortation on the dwindling fan base: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a fink like the other people in town who have given up on us. People 
who have given up on us already, we don't want you on the bandwagon when we're 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Laettner's numbers -- 15 points, 6.7 rebounds, 2.3 assists -- represent lows 
in his three-year career but mostly because he can't stay out of foul trouble. 
This is partly because of his many snarls and grimaces at referees in his first 
two seasons. Laettner tries to suck it up these days, but referees, like 
elephants, never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Rider -- He's got the whole package, upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 Talented but raw, he has never had much coaching and doesn't look eager for 
any. He's often late, always undisciplined and seems more interested in his 
slam dunk title (c'mon, they were in Minneapolis, who else was going to win?) 
and commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall -- He just got here, is having trouble guarding small forwards and 
pressing on offense but looks promising. Has shown no head case tendencies, but 
maybe the other guys can show him how. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's management. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Jack McCloskey, who once built the Detroit Pistons into 
back-to-back champions, traded Felton Spencer for Mike Brown (?), Luc Longley 
for Stacey King (??) and a No. 1 pick for Sean Rooks (???). 
</P>
<P>
 There is little in this league more valuable than a Minnesota No. 1. If the 
Timberwolves choose among the top six this season and next, a decent bet, the 
Dallas Mavericks will get their '98 pick, wherever it is, a nice haul for 
Rooks, a second-round draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, the Timberwolves didn't abandon the Twin Cities, without giving the 
Twin Cities a chance to abandon them first. At this pace, they can embark for 
New Orleans by Feb. 1 and the townspeople will throw them a parade. BARKLEY IS 
BACK IN TOWN . . . WE THINK 
</P>
<P>
 In a league run by the young and headstrong, with no great teams and most 
huddled around the .500 mark -- at weekend's start only three were on a 
55-victory pace -- entertainment is at a premium, so without further ado . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Here's Charlie! 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie? 
</P>
<P>
 It's getting tricky welcoming back Charles Barkley of the Phoenix Suns from 
his many injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, Barkley said his goal was to play 82 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he said he might have to sit out the opener because of an abdominal pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he said he would have played except for the ointment he rubbed into his 
eyes at an Eric Clapton concert -- is that what the young people do at those 
things these days?. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he went on the injured list because of the abdominal pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he played one game and went to the sideline again, prompting the Suns to 
predict he would return in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he flew to Milwaukee on his own the next day and played. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he said he'd sit out games on consecutive nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he played the next night in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, it's business as usual, with everything that comes out of his 
mouth inoperative five seconds later. 
</P>
<P>
 "My body is deteriorating," said Barkley, holding court in Chicago last week. 
"There's no medical term for what I've got. I've been playing basketball for 10 
years and when you play like a kamikaze pilot, it's gonna hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "All those times when I was dunking the ball, I should have been laying the 
ball in, never saying I was tired even when I was playing 45, 46 minutes every 
night for those bad teams in Philly. That stuff comes back to haunt you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to start laying that stuff in. I'll be happy with my 35 minutes a 
game. And when the ball is on the floor, let the other team dive for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Danny Manning from the other side of the room, "So what's new about 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, Barkley never averaged 45 minutes in Philadelphia, or 40, but 
the way things are going, the last guy I'm going to complain about is Charlie. 
Welcome back, for however long. DOES SOMEONE HAVE WEBBER'S BRAIN? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chris Webber I know is a gentleman who will do anything he is asked to 
help a team win," Michigan Coach Steve Fisher said. "The Chris Webber I know is 
a sensitive, respectful young man." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah? Whatever happened to that guy? 
</P>
<P>
 Did aliens take his brain and put in Derrick Coleman's? 
</P>
<P>
 Having already embarrassed himself sufficiently, Webber prattled on last week. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted he was "no Jesus," unnecessarily since his new team, the Washington 
Bullets, was then 0-4 with him. 
</P>
<P>
 He accused the Pistons, whom he had hoped to join, of lying when they claimed 
they couldn't make a deal for him. 
</P>
<P>
 He lectured Washington fans on behavior after they booed the Bullets in a loss 
to the Lakers, and on loyalty after expatriate New Yorkers filled the arena and 
cheered a Knick victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have definitely loved to play in Detroit," said Webber, who couldn't 
stand Golden State Coach Don Nelson. "They could have easily had me for what 
they did for Oliver Miller. Then they wanted to come to me but it was too late. 
So I have no intentions or desire to play in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They lied to the fans because they didn't want their fans to be mad but 
believe me, they could have had me." 
</P>
<P>
 On the Washington fans: 
</P>
<P>
 "How you gonna be a fan and do that (boo)? Don't even come to the game, don't 
support us. I've never been to an arena where the crowd cheers for the other 
players." 
</P>
<P>
 The fans never did that in the Bay Area. Bet Nelson is looking better all the 
time, huh, Chris? FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 The gloom still tiptoes in on little cat's feet in the Bay Area, where the 
Warriors went 2-5 without Webber. Said Indiana's Dale Davis after a 123-96 
Thanksgiving rout of Golden State, "(Losing Webber) definitely gives their team 
a different look. Webber is Webber. He plays big and he blocks shots and that's 
taking a lot out of the middle when you take him out of there." . . . Tim 
Hardaway's hot-shooting start hid the fact that he can't explode to the basket 
on his surgically repaired knee. Said Nelson, "He doesn't have the same 
one-on-one capabilities that he had two years ago and that probably won't come 
until next year, so we're trying to get him involved in more screen-and-rolls 
and that sort of thing. We used to just clear a side like I do for Spree 
(Latrell Sprewell)." . . . Tom Gugliotta's Warrior averages: 10 points, nine 
rebounds, shooting 38%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks activated Doc Rivers, 34 and coming off major knee surgery, 
probably to showcase him. "If I play 48 minutes, I'm getting traded," he said. 
. . . Charles Smith is finally winning Knick fans over after getting all those 
layups blocked in Game 5 of the 1993 Eastern championship series with the Bulls 
and struggling last season with a bad knee. "(It was) the toughest time I've 
ever experienced in basketball," Smith said. "And L.A. was pretty bad. Arsenio 
(Hall) was on us every night because we were losing. But New York, I learned, 
could be a tough place to play." . . . Pat Riley went off on the sideline when 
cold-shooting John Starks missed three wild three-pointers against the Bullets 
but pulled the drawbridge up when the press asked about it. "We have to stop 
passing judgment on every single thing that every player does on the court," 
Riley said. "We're getting too judgmental." 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Bowie on former teammate Coleman: "Derrick has never been one to worry 
about somebody else's performance. All he does is bring what he has and the 
other guys have to do what they have to do. What you get from Derrick Coleman 
is 20 and 10. But leadership doesn't come with it. When I was here, everybody 
talked about how he didn't practice and I'm sure that's still happening now. 
I'm his biggest fan as a player because I saw him go to war in the (1992) 
playoffs against Cleveland. But people are what they are, and that's why I 
don't think he can be a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Unidentified general manager to the Boston Globe after Chicago General Manager 
Jerry Krause had let six CBA teams play at the Bulls' practice facility: "How 
come? He's already got one CBA team." . . . Intimates of Bull-White Sox owner 
Jerry Reinsdorf say the fix is in for Michael Jordan to join the White Sox in 
September if he does anything at all at triple-A Nashville next summer. Despite 
the widespread acclaim Jordan reaped in a country mad for anyone who looks as 
if he actually enjoys playing baseball, Jordan slumped into the .250s in the 
Arizona instructional league, so he isn't a lock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nets have applied for a name change. The possibilities are endless, if not 
flattering, but one actually under consideration is Swamp Dragons. . . . Net 
General Manager Willis Reed, taking heat for passing up Wesley Person, now of 
the Suns, to draft nowhere-man Yinka Dare, needs a replacement for injured 
Kevin Edwards and is interested in Anthony Peeler of the Lakers.

LEMOND ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg LeMond, who twice won the Tour de France despite a near-fatal accidental 
shooting during a wild turkey hunt in 1987, retired Saturday because of a rare 
muscle disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 LeMond, 33, the only non-European to win cycling's most prestigious event, 
said he can no longer compete as an elite rider because he is suffering from a 
disease known as mitochondrial myopathy, a chronic disorder that affects muscle 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went from a world-class athlete to a recreational cyclist in a very short 
time," said LeMond, speaking at a Century City news conference in conjunction 
with a U.S. Cycling Federation fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning his third Tour de France in 1990 (his previous victories had 
been in 1986 and 1989), LeMond, of Wayzata, Minn., finished seventh in the 1991 
Tour, the first time he failed to make the top three. He withdrew after 20 
stages in 1992 and did not start the 23-day, 2,000-mile race in 1993. He quit 
after seven stages this year amid speculation that his career was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Although LeMond knew something was wrong the last four years, he could not 
pinpoint the problem. He thought it was age, allergies or weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many thought it was my age, or thought I was too heavy," LeMond said. "I 
started believing that too." 
</P>
<P>
 But after undergoing extensive medical examinations of his cardiovascular, 
hormonal, kidney, immune and nutritional systems, a muscle biopsy taken last 
summer diagnosed the condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Rochelle Taube, LeMond's physician, said the disorder usually afflicts 
children and the elderly, adding it is the first known case diagnosed in a 
healthy person. 
</P>
<P>
 Taube said the disorder was first identified about 20 years ago, but there is 
little research on its symptoms or effects. The disease can be contracted by 
heredity or environmental conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Taube said doctors are examining a possible link to LeMond's shotgun shooting 
accident. About 40 pellets remain in his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no known cure for the disorder, LeMond is expected to lead a 
normal life.

SABAN IS NEW MICHIGAN STATE FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nick Saban, defensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns, was announced as 
Michigan State's new football coach Saturday, replacing George Perles, who was 
fired three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment still needs the approval of the Board of Trustees at its 
meeting Friday, but that will be a formality said university President Peter 
McPherson. 
</P>
<P>
 Saban, 43, was secondary coach and defensive coordinator for Perles from 
1983-87. His "Gang Green" defense helped the Spartans win the 1987 Big Ten 
championship and defeat USC in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Saban left Michigan State in 1988 to be secondary coach for the Houston 
Oilers. In 1990, he was head coach at Toledo. The Browns hired him away the 
next year.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOWL GAMES; LATE STAND BY DEFENSE GETS FULLERTON PAST HANCOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fullerton College's defense, suspect in recent games, made a late stand and 
the Hornets beat host Hancock College, 38-33, Saturday in the K-Swiss Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's James Hartford, the game's most valuable player, scored on a 
23-yard run with 3 minutes 44 seconds left to put the Hornets ahead, 38-27. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hancock rallied for a touchdown with 2:47 left, then got the ball right 
back when running back Mike Jacot fumbled with 2:39 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock advanced to the Fullerton 13, where the Bulldogs had first down and 
1:50 to score the go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 But four incomplete passes later, Fullerton had the ball back. Defensive 
lineman Josh Micklos knocked down the first-down pass. Defensive back Kevin 
Shoup knocked down a pass on second down and Alex Molnar tipped away a pass on 
third down. 
</P>
<P>
 On fourth down, Hancock quarterback Mick Sitarski threw out of the end zone 
and Fullerton took over with 1:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets were able to run out the clock thanks to a nine-yard scramble by 
quarterback Marc O'Brien and Hartford's nine-yard run on third down. Hartford 
gained 81 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we made it exciting for everybody except (Hancock Coach Barney) Eames 
and I," said Fullerton Coach Gene Murphy. He had watched his defense crumble in 
a 34-7 loss to Rancho Santiago, then hang on in a season-ending 52-42 victory 
over Southwestern in the final two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton trailed, 13-0, in the first quarter but rallied with two touchdowns 
in the second. Tony Draft caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from O'Brien and Jeff 
Willis scored on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets took the lead for good, 24-21, when Jacot scored on a five-yard 
run in the third quarter. The lead grew to 31-21 when defensive back Armand 
Boglin returned an interception 18 yards for a touchdown. It was his second 
interception of the game.

PASSIVE NORTHRIDGE EASILY SUCCUMBS TO BARTOW'S BUNCH; MEN'S BASKETBALL: 
POOR-SHOOTING MATADORS ALSO TENTATIVE ON BOARDS IN 84-62 LOSS TO ALABAMA 
BIRMINGHAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If winning basketball games in Los Angeles was always this easy, Gene Bartow 
would still be coaching at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeling from a 1-3 start, Bartow's Alabama Birmingham team got well in a hurry 
against overmatched Cal State Northridge, defeating the Matadors, 84-62, 
Saturday night before 745 in the Northridge Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge, a home sweet homecoming it was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Williams scored 30 points, Travis Harper added 21 and Rod Willie had 19 
as the Blazers dealt Northridge its most lopsided defeat at home in the five 
seasons the Matadors have played at the NCAA Division I level. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (0-3) shot only 35% for the third game in a row, and for the second 
consecutive game the Matadors were paced in scoring by Ryan Martin, a reserve 
guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not getting second shots or shots inside, that's fairly typical for 
a team that lives on the perimeter," Coach Pete Cassidy said of the Matadors' 
shooting woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin scored 11 points. Eric Gray, another substitute, added 10. Peter 
Micelli, Northridge's 6-foot-8 center, also scored 10 points, although he made 
only three of 13 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama Birmingham shot 49.2%, which was good enough because the Blazers also 
pulled in 18 offensive rebounds -- most of them in front of flat-footed 
Northridge players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't jumping after the ball," Cassidy said. "We have to play with a lot 
more reckless abandon on defense, and especially on the boards." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a 6-6 sophomore from Detroit, pulled down four of his five rebounds 
on the offensive end. The left-hander converted each of them into baskets on 
his way to a career-high point total. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight we were more in sync," said Bartow, whose club had lost to College of 
Charleston, American University of Puerto Rico and Auburn. "We did what we 
needed to do defensively and overall looked more like a basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge seems to have that effect on opponents, though Bartow played 
diplomat afterward, complimenting the Matadors on how well they ran their 
offensive patterns and adding, "I think they're going to win a lot of games." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration is fast becoming a problem, however, and the schedule doesn't get 
much easier until February. Northridge has home games Tuesday against Cal State 
Long Beach and Friday against San Diego State before traveling for games 
against ninth-ranked Cincinnati and a good Xavier team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to put a win together soon," Micelli said. "And to win we have to 
be more fundamentally sound than the people we play." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy hinted after the game that a shakeup in Northridge's lineup might be 
in order. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Oronoz, a junior who was expected to add scoring punch, missed all four 
shots against the Blazers. He has made only nine of 28 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dorsey, who paced Northridge's scoring in two exhibition games, was held 
to five points.

PASSING THROUGH, ARRELLANES MAKES MARK FOR VALLEY; ORANGE COUNTY BOWL: HE WRAPS 
UP BANNER SEASON BY SETTING FOUR RECORDS IN 36-28 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Any other ending to this football season would have been unfitting for Jim 
Arellanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The record-setting quarterback for Valley College was spectacular Saturday as 
he led the Monarchs to a 36-28 victory over Rancho Santiago in the Orange 
County Bowl at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say enough about Jim Arellanes," said Jim Fenwick, Valley coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, a 6-foot-4 sophomore transfer from Northern Arizona, set four 
Orange County Bowl records to cap a remarkable campaign with the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 26 of 38 for 425 yards and five touchdowns. The completions, yardage 
and touchdowns set game records. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, who was named the player of the game, also set the game record for 
total yards with 402 (minus-23 yards rushing). He finished his only season for 
the Monarchs with 3,908 yards passing and 30 touchdowns, both Valley 
single-season and career records. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive bowl victory for the Monarchs (10-1), ranked 
ninth in the state. They beat Moorpark, 21-19, last season in the Western State 
Bowl. Rancho Santiago (9-2), ranked fourth, had won nine consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs unleashed their explosive run-and-shoot attack and scored three 
touchdowns through the air within a 1-minute 33-second span early in the third 
quarter to pull ahead for the first time after a 7-7 tie at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 After tailback Ernest Wilson dived into the left corner of the end zone on a 
nine-yard run to give the Dons a 14-7 lead with 13:35 to play in the third 
quarter, Arellanes answered quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 On second and 10 from the Rancho Santiago 28-yard line, Arellanes found David 
Eastham in the right flat and the receiver bolted for a 72-yard touchdown to 
tie the score, 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
 The two combined for another score on a 10-yard pass play with 11:51 remaining 
in the quarter to give the Monarchs their first lead, 21-14.  
</P>
<P>
 Eastham (nine receptions for 148 yards) caught the ball in the end zone even 
though Rancho Santiago free safety Steve Hoalton knocked off Eastham's helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen seconds later, after Valley linebacker Manu Langi intercepted a pass 
by quarterback Simon Fuentes and returned it 10 yards to the Rancho Santiago 
25, Arellanes hit Brian Comer on first down for a 25-yard touchdown to make it 
27-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Comer, Valley's all-time reception leader with 139, set a game record with 205 
yards receiving and tied another with 10 catches. The touchdown, his second of 
the game, gave him 15 this year, a school single-season record. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't make any big adjustments (at the half)," said Arellanes, who set a 
state single-game record with 639 yards passing against Bakersfield on Nov. 5.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who led the Dons with 95 yards in 26 carries, pulled Rancho Santiago 
to within 27-21 late in the third quarter on a one-yard run.  
</P>
<P>
 After a 42-yard field goal by Valley's Tim Cronk, Wilson scored midway through 
the fourth quarter on another one-yard plunge to cut Valley's lead to 30-28. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley then went on an 80-yard drive to score on a seven-yard pass from 
Arellanes to Cameron Perry with 2:48 left. The drive was aided by a 
pass-interference call on third and 32 when Davis Delmatoff threw a 
halfback-option pass to Comer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs allowed 422 yards, including 268 yards passing by Fuentes (24 of 
34), but came up with big plays in key situations.  
</P>
<P>
 They sacked Fuentes four times -- strong safety Chris Shinnick did it twice -- 
and intercepted one of his passes. Monarch outside linebacker Robby Proffer had 
14 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley started the game slowly, giving up a touchdown on Rancho Santiago's 
first possession -- an 11-yard pass from Fuentes to Ace Riggins that culminated 
a 73-yard, 10-play drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs wasted an opportunity after a shanked kick by Casey Wilson on the 
ensuing kickoff gave them the ball at the 50-yard line. Rancho Santiago strong 
safety Andre Holmes blocked a 34-yard field-goal attempt by Cronk. 
</P>
<P>
 They finally got into the end zone with 1:11 left before the half on a 20-yard 
pass play from Arellanes to Comer to tie the score, 7-7.

FOOLISH PLEASURE, WINNER OF '75 KENTUCKY DERBY, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foolish Pleasure, winner of the 1975 Kentucky Derby, has died. The 22-year-old 
stallion died Nov. 17 at the Horseshoe Ranch near Dayton, where he had been 
living since September 1993, owner Ron Vanderhoef said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Foolish Pleasure had been colicky and in discomfort that day and died 
about 6 p.m. during surgery for a ruptured stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Foolish Pleasure was retired at the end of the 1976 racing season after 
winning the Suburban Handicap at Aqueduct in New York, the Donn Handicap at 
Gulfstream Park in Florida and the Arlington Invitational at Arlington Park in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 His most memorable race, however, was his 1975 match race against the filly 
Ruffian at Belmont Park. Ruffian fell during the race and later was destroyed.

HIGH SCHOOL CROSS-COUNTRY / WEST REGIONAL; CONTINUING STRING OF SURPRISES, 
NORDHOFF'S CANCHOLA PLACES 2ND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who figured that Elaine Canchola's meteoric rise toward the top of the 
high school cross-country ranks had flamed out in the state championships got a 
big surprise Saturday when the Nordhoff freshman placed second in the girls' 
race of the Foot Locker West regional at Woodward Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola, runner-up to Buena Park's Heather Garritson in the Division III race 
of the state finals Nov. 26, timed 17 minutes 33 seconds over the 5,000-meter 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Her performance was 34 seconds faster than in the previous week and enabled 
her to qualify for the national championships at San Diego's Balboa Park on 
Dec. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really have a goal," a jubilant Canchola said. "I guess I would say 
that I would have taken any place as long as I qualified for nationals. I 
really wanted that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The top eight finishers in the girls' and boys' races advanced to the national 
finals, and Canchola was one of five local runners to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The others were Amy Skieresz of Agoura, fifth in the girls' race, and Antonio 
Arce of Palmdale, Eleazar Hernandez of Camarillo and Brett Strahan of Hart, who 
placed third, fourth and fifth in the boys' event. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Strahan's performance was surprising after an 11th-place finish in 
the state Division I final, he was regarded as a national-championship 
contender at the start of the season, as were Skieresz, Arce and Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola was an unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 She ran "21-something" in her first race, and in her fourth, finished 13th in 
the Division III sweepstakes of the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational on 
Oct. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 She followed that with a third-place finish in the Ventura County 
championships behind Skieresz and Kim Mortensen of Thousand Oaks, then won the 
Frontier League title. She ran 17:53 in a heat of the Southern Section prelims 
at Mt. SAC before winning the section title with a freshman course record of 
17:35. 
</P>
<P>
 When Garritson, another freshman, pulled away from her in the final mile of 
the state meet, however, many figured that Canchola was out of surprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 She was among the top 10 runners after the first mile Saturday and moved into 
fifth at two miles before surging into second on a downhill portion of the 
course shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Rosa sophomore Julia Stamps was a runaway winner as expected. With her 
time of 16:45, she cut 21 seconds off the course record she had set in winning 
the state Division I title. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz had won Division II titles in the section and state finals but had 
felt unusually fatigued at the end of both races and her confidence was 
lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 The jitters hampered her in the first mile -- she was 13th -- but she moved 
into 11th at two miles before finishing fifth in 17:47. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I relaxed, I started to feel good," Skieresz said. "At the mile mark, I 
didn't think I had much of a chance at qualifying, but I started to feel strong 
at the (midway point)." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen moved up 11 places in the final mile, but her time of 18:07 left her 
in 10th place for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, Jason Balkman of San Jose Lynbrook and Brandon Leslie of Gallup, N.M., 
were among the leaders at the one-mile mark (4:40) of the boys' race, and by 
two miles (9:39) the trio had broken clear of the field with Balkman holding a 
five- and 10-meter lead over Leslie and Arce, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Balkman, the state Division I champion, extended his lead to the finish as he 
clocked 14:58. Leslie timed 15:03 and Arce 15:05. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what I've been waiting for all season," said Arce, who finished 
second in the 3,200 meters in the state track championships in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since track, making nationals has been my No. 1 goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, runner-up in the state Division I final, and Strahan also attained 
that goal, but they came from behind to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez went from 11th to fourth (15:08) in the final mile and Strahan 
stormed from 17th to fifth (15:09). 
</P>
<P>
 "I just dug down in the final mile and decided I was going to use everything 
God had given me," Strahan said. "And today, he gave me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan, who had been hampered by a sinus infection the previous two weeks, 
snapped a streak of sub-par races at Woodward Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his 11th-place finish in the state Division I final, he had 
finished 21st in the 1993 state championships before dropping out of the West 
regional the following week because of a bronchial infection.

NORTHRIDGE GOES OVER MINNESOTA'S WALL, INTO SEMIFINALS; WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL: 
IOWA STATE STANDS BETWEEN MATADORS AND FINAL.

<P>
 Trailing Minnesota, two games to one, in a match that would decide which team 
would advance to the semifinals of the National Invitational volleyball 
championship tournament, Northridge Coach Lian Kang Lu knew the Matadors had to 
neutralize the Gophers' Katrien DeDecker. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to that point, the 6-foot, 2-inch standout from Belgium -- who finished 
with 24 kills, 19 digs and four solo blocks -- had given Northridge one of the 
toughest tests it had faced all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Lu moved 6-2 Heather Anderson into the first spot in the serving rotation in 
place of 5-8 Kathleen Shannon, forcing DeDecker to pick on someone her own 
size, and the Matadors came back for an 8-15, 15-13, 5-15, 15-5, 15-10 victory 
in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (21-8) won for the ninth consecutive time and 14th in 16 matches. 
</P>
<P>
 With Anderson and 6-1 Ana Kristich forming what Lu calls his "Great Wall," the 
objective was accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "(DeDecker) is their leader," Lu said. "We stopped her completely in the 
fourth game, and almost stopped her in the fifth." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was the result of Lu's adjustment more evident than in kill 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting .154, .175, and .091 in the first three games, Northridge jumped 
to .292 in the fourth and .429 in the decisive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, the Gophers' kill percentage fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota (21-15) went .290, .100, and .333 in the first three, then dropped 
to .150 followed by a paltry .058 in the final game. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had six assisted blocks, one solo block and no block errors, while 
Kristich had seven assisted blocks and one error. 
</P>
<P>
 Missy Clements led the offense with 21 kills and 16 digs. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had 18 kills and 18 digs, Aimee Stone added 18 kills and 16 digs, 
while Kristich contributed 15 kills and 11 digs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will face Iowa State (24-10) at 8 a.m. PST today, with the winner 
advancing to the final at 11 against the San Diego-San Jose State victor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors split with San Diego this year, dropping a five-game match on the 
road early in the season, then sweeping the Dons Nov. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams had 3-0 records in pool play with defeats of Connecticut, Sam 
Houston and Oregon State. DARIN ESPER

CS NORTHRIDGE FIGHTS GAMELY BEFORE FALLING; WOMEN'S BASKETBALL: TENACIOUS 
MATADORS HAVE COACH PREDICTING THAT FIRST VICTORY WILL COME SOON.

 The Cal State Northridge women's basketball team fell to 0-3 after losing 
Saturday's home opener against Northern Arizona, but the Matadors didn't go 
down easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, with no seniors on its roster and two freshmen starters, trailed 
by 21 at halftime but threatened to come back on two occasions before losing, 
79-70. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in the second half the Matadors pulled within six points. They opened 
the half with an 18-5 run that put victory within reach at 52-46. 
</P>
<P>
 Two minutes later Northridge trailed, 54-48, after a baseline jump shot by 
freshman guard Pam Karbowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Arizona (2-1), however, went on to increase its lead to 15 with eight 
minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Matadors kept fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 "This group in two years is going to be fantastic," CSUN Coach Kim Chandler 
said. "Right now inexperience is our biggest problem, but they never quit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors got themselves in trouble midway through the first half with poor 
shooting and an array of turnovers. They had stretches of five and three 
minutes when they did not score from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Arizona got its first big lead during the Matadors' five-minute 
scoring drought. The Lumberjacks scored 15 consecutive points to pull away, 
35-16, with 6:33 left in the first half.  
</P>
<P>
 Northridge improved its shooting percentage from 43.5% in the first half to 
63% in the second. The Matadors finished at 54% from the field and 56.5% from 
the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior guard Shannon Crouse led CSUN with a game-high 21 points. Freshman 
guard Lisa Vaillancourt had 14 points and Karbowski, who fouled out with 1:31 
to play, had 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern Arizona didn't shoot well overall (37%) but had some great scoring 
runs at key times. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore guard Amy Yanish led the team with 19 points, which included four of 
five from three-point range. No other players scored in double figures for 
Northern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's first victory will come soon, Chandler believes. "Tonight was very 
encouraging," she said.

DE ANZA VICTORY OVER MOORPARK CUTS TO THE QUICK; WOMEN'S SOCCER: DEFENDING 
CHAMPION WASTES NO TIME SCORING IN 5-0 VICTORY OVER RAIDERS IN STATE SEMIFINAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Julie Ruckriegel of the De Anza College women's soccer team scored 1 minute 
and 10 seconds into a match against Moorpark College Saturday, setting the tone 
for a 5-0 victory over the Raiders in the semifinals of the state playoffs at 
Cosumnes River College. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing on a soggy, puddle-filled field, De Anza took a 2-0 lead on a penalty 
kick by Rebecca Jimenez that beat Moorpark goalkeeper Amy Fisher into the high 
left corner.  
</P>
<P>
 Stacie Savage scored another goal for the defending state champion less than a 
minute into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 That type of offensive pressure had Fisher stymied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kind of looked, and there they were," she said of the two quick goals. 
"They just opened up with a vengeance and really wanted it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark, which finished 10-4-4, threatened to score only once against the 
Dons (17-1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In the closing minutes of the first half, the Raiders moved the ball to the 
front of the De Anza goal, where three players tried to knock it in. None, 
however, were able to get off a clean shot. 
</P>
<P>
 De Anza's defense was as aggressive as its offense. Throughout the match, the 
Dons kept the Raiders from stringing together passes or making clean advances 
with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended a season that saw Moorpark make its best run at the playoffs 
since beating De Anza for the state championship in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, who finished at 3-6-3 in the Western State Conference last 
season, advanced to the semifinals by beating previously undefeated Cypress, 
3-2, on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The team) did a great job and I'm really proud of them," first-year Coach 
Ken Dale said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came a long way this year," fullback Mariah Ventre said. "We made it to 
the state championships and we proved ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played with a lot of heart, and that is why we got here in the first 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 De Anza advances to face Santa Rosa, a 2-0 winner over Bakersfield, in today's 
title game.

 The Moorpark College wrestling team's season ended on a disappointing note 
when John Jimenez and Tim Bonebright were defeated in semifinal matches of the 
state wrestling tournament at Rio Hondo College on Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez, who competes in the 134-pound class, and Bonebright (142 pounds) were 
the top finishers for Moorpark, which qualified 10 wrestlers for the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez (28-12) lost to Cerritos' David Gayer, 3-2, in an aggressive match. 
Several times the referee warned the wrestlers that they could be disqualified 
jostling after the whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 The bout was delayed 10 minutes when Jimenez suffered a cut to the left side 
of his nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez lost to Shane Holloway of Rancho Santiago, 9-1, in the consolation 
round to place fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonebright lost to Eddie Ramos of Fresno City College, 11-4, in the 
semifinals. Ramos was seeded No. 1 in the class and is the defending state 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim went up against the top opponent in the state," Moorpark Coach John 
Keever said. "I know that he did everything he could." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonebright lost to Juan Alvarez from Cerritos College, 6-5, in the fifth-place 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's Kyle Plummer (158) defeated Diablo Valley's Josh Nagar, 4-0, in the 
fifth-place match. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's Jeremy Pratt (167) finished eighth after forfeiting his final match 
because of a shoulder injury.

 Freshman guard Rafer Alston scored seven of his 16 points in overtime Saturday 
night to lead Ventura College to an 82-75 victory over Moorpark in the 
championship game of the Moorpark tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Alston made five of six free throws, the last giving his team an 80-73 lead 
with 19 seconds to play in the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark (6-3) led most of the game. The Raiders opened a 47-37 lead when 
Jaime Jaquez scored on a layup three minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura (9-0) stayed close behind a tough full-court defense, which led to 
numerous baskets off Moorpark turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura finally took the lead, 66-65, when Curtis Gaines, the tournament's 
most valuable player, scored inside with 1 minute 30 seconds left in 
regulation. Alston followed with a jump shot to give Ventura a three-point lead 
with 35 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moorpark forward David Fennell, who scored 14 points, made his fourth 
three-point basket to tie the score, 68-68, with 20 seconds to play.  
</P>
<P>
 Both teams had a chance to win in regulation, but missed last-second shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaquez led all scorers with 17 points. He also had five rebounds.

 Anthony Tauriello scored 22 points and Dan Van Etten added 19 but it was Scott 
Blough who came up big again Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting the winning shot a day earlier to put Simi Valley High into the 
final, Blough sank two free throws with 25 seconds to play to preserve a 68-65 
victory over North Hollywood at Royal High, giving the Pioneers the 
championship of their own tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And what was going through his mind as he stood on the line? 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't miss," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Blough's free throws, North Hollywood (3-1) still had a shot. But Arthur 
Lee's three-point attempt at the buzzer fell short. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to make it," Lee said. "But as 
soon as it left my hand, I knew it would miss."  
</P>
<P>
 Lee finished with 25 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (4-0) opened a 36-26 lead at halftime with a tenacious defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really pleased with our defense," Simi Valley Coach Dean Bradshaw 
said. "It was a great team effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Royal 88, Palmdale 72 -- The Highlanders exploded for 26 points in the third 
quarter behind three three-pointers by Scott Hambly in the third-place game.

CLUB CHAMPIONS SHOOTING IT OUT; GOLF: SEVERAL AREA PLAYERS IN THE FIELD OF

 The Southern California Golf Assn.'s creme de la creme will will compete 
Monday in the 20th Tournament of Club Champions at North Ranch Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-hole event, which begins at 10 a.m., includes 95 men's club champions 
from the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Several area standouts have qualified, including 1993 State Senior Amateur 
champion Paul Ladin of Westlake Village (champion of The Quarry at La Quinta), 
David Saylor of West Hills (Wood Ranch CC) and Mike Turner of Sherman Oaks 
(Woodland Hills CC). 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks will be represented by club champions -- Lee Davis (Los Angeles 
CC), Buz Greene (Saticoy CC), Mitch Phillips (Menifee Lakes CC), Steve Sparks 
(Sherwood CC) and John Thomas (Sunset Hills CC). 
</P>
<P>
 A favorite is Mark Johnson of Helendale, who in 1994 won the SCGA Mid-Amateur, 
the Pacific Coast Amateur and was runner-up to Tiger Woods at the SCGA Amateur. 
Johnson is club champion at Sun Valley Golf Course in La Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 North Ranch's Valley-Oak Course, with a rating of 73.0 and distance of 6,730 
yards from the championship tees, will be played. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said that despite the tournament being a a relative shootout at 18 
holes, players must resist the temptation to play too aggressively. North Ranch 
can be punitive, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a one-shot deal, but you can't gamble on this course," said Turner, a 
two-time L.A. City champion and former Cal State Northridge standout. "You have 
to be patient. The birdies will come because there are a couple of reachable 
par-5s."

 "She's a longer-ball hitter," Gaston said. "The forecast is for rain (today) 
and with the wet conditions, she may have the advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 In the semifinal, Gaston took control early, going 3-up after seven holes then 
coasting to the victory in 14 holes.

MOTHER OF INVENTION; AFTER THE BIRTH OF A CHILD WITH DOWN'S SYNDROME, MARGOT 
CARLSON OF LAGUNA BEACH REDEFINED HERSELF AND WENT TO WORK ON CHANGING THE 
WORLD.

 Margot Carlson still remembers the moment in 1968 that started her 
transformation from stay-at-home mom into the executive director of one of 
Orange County's most successful nonprofit agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sixth child and namesake, Margot Rose, was discovered to have Down's 
syndrome shortly after birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a complete shock," Carlson said. "I remember it was a gloomy day, 
and I was sitting in the dark in the house after the doctor called and told me. 
No one really knew anything about Down's syndrome then. It was like a death." 
</P>
<P>
 But the news wasn't the death of Carlson or her family. Spurred by a desire to 
protect children, she went back to college at 39, earned her master's degree 
and later built Community Service Programs (CSP), one of the largest nonprofit 
organizations of its type in Orange County, to deal with domestic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Her youngest daughter grew up happy and healthy and is now taking the bus to 
work and attending school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was home with the first five children, cooking breakfast, lunch and 
dinner," she said. "But when Margot was born, I wanted to change the world on 
her behalf." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson hasn't quite changed the world. But she's working on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children that we're seeing now are more involved with drugs and alcohol, 
and the families are more dysfunctional," she said with matter-of-fact 
intensity. "We don't have a stable family to reunify them with, and that's a 
big part of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 With a frequent smile that makes her look younger than her 65 years, the force 
behind CSP is small but mighty. She's known for having her facts straight and 
her numbers right. But those who know Carlson best admire her most for turning 
a personal challenge into a corporate success story. 
</P>
<P>
 At an age when most people think about retirement, she continues to make her 
mark in Orange County by running the nonprofit agency like a business, 
something most charities find difficult to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone in this business who is operating on a purely emotional level, you 
have to take a second look at," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot run on good intentions or some unrealistic philanthropy. This 
isn't all volunteer work; I have salaries to pay here." 
</P>
<P>
 There are 168 salaries at CSP, and unlike the scores of other nonprofits that 
depend primarily on fund-raisers and private donations, it receives roughly $5 
million annually in grants from federal, state, county and city governments.  
</P>
<P>
 The 19 programs include a youth shelter in Laguna Beach, victim/witness 
assistance programs, family counseling and a variety of community services 
ranging from domestic violence assistance to aid for victims of sexual assault 
and gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Annually, the victim/witness program alone aids more than 55,000 people, the 
youth services help 30,000 and the domestic violence program assists 3,000. 
After more than two decades, CSP programs exist in just about every city in the 
county -- an accomplishment that has earned respect from law enforcement and 
social service agencies throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "CSP is a big business," said Orange County Assistant Sheriff Doug Storm. 
"While it's a nonprofit, it has to operate like a professional organization, 
and Margot has the ability to run it like one." 
</P>

 Dick Carlson met Margot Bachtell on a Chicago streetcar in the mid-1950s. On 
their way to classes at the Navy Pier branch of the University of Illinois, the 
sophomores struck up a conversation. She first noticed his crystal-blue eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if there's really love at first sight, but there was certainly a 
chemistry there," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Then a young business student, Dick Carlson confessed that it took him a month 
to ask her out. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very beautiful, and still is," he said. "And she has always known 
where she wants to go and how to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 They dated for five years, married and began their large family in the suburbs 
of Chicago's South Side before moving to Laguna Beach in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were stunned when daughter Margot was found to have Down's syndrome 
seven years after their move to Southern California, although they thought 
something might be wrong with their 3-month-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'd look at her, I'd say, 'She's OK,' then I would look at her again and 
say, 'No, I know something's wrong,' " Margot Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the other kids say their parents handled it well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing was presented in a non-panic mode," said Gregory Carlson, the 
eldest. "They aren't the type of parents that would upset us, and Margot (Rose) 
has been an asset to the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Margot Carlson would wince when the boys plunged into the waves with their 
youngest sister and shut her eyes when Keith gave Margot Rose a ride on the 
back of his motorcycle. But Carlson said all of her children have contributed 
to Margot Rose's continuing development. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loves them, and they love her. She grew up in a normal family where she 
was treated like everyone treats everyone, and that's the way it is," Carlson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers the promise her husband made when their youngest daughter's 
condition had been confirmed: 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked at me and said, 'We're going to give Margot everything we possibly 
can, but we aren't going to let it penalize our other kids, and we aren't going 
to let it come between us,' " she said. "And you know, we never have. That was 
the kindest thing he could have said." 
</P>
<P>
 The Down's syndrome diagnosis was a turning point for the Carlson family. It 
was a time of change, compromise and some sacrifice, with Mom trading her 
cookbook for a school notebook -- almost reinventing her role overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The first class she took at UC Irvine was "The Bill of Rights for the 
Developmentally Disabled," and it sent her on her way. 
</P>
<P>
 She landed an internship in 1972 under Arnold Binder, the founder of the 
university's Social Ecology Department, while completing her degree in social 
ecology and juvenile justice. She hoped to learn a lot of things, including 
better ways to guide a handicapped child through the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that when I would come home from school, I would immediately go 
into the bathroom to change my clothes, and all of the kids -- even the dog -- 
would line up at the door," she said. "They would tell me what they needed and 
what they wanted. Once I started, that's what it was like." 
</P>
<P>
 The days working, studying for her master's degree and raising six children 
weren't easy on Carlson or her family, but it was a schedule they all got used 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Carlson said pitching in was something that was expected, and something 
he and his brothers and sisters were glad to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Mom went to school, we covered, taking care of Margot and making sure 
everyone got something to eat," he said. "It wasn't hard or anything, though; 
(Mom) would have all of the meals planned out; all we had to do was fix them 
and serve them. Resenting anything wasn't even in the picture."  
</P>
<P>
 Carlson had to plan meals and bag lunches ahead, often rising at 4 a.m. to 
study. But her children say she never missed a motherly beat as she juggled her 
schoolwork and domestic duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't really figured it out," Keith Carlson said. "I have only two kids, 
and I can't believe how she pulled it off with six. My dad drove to L.A. every 
day and worked his tail off, and she organized our lives."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Binder's guidance, Carlson began developing programs to steer kids away 
from trouble, rather than following the traditional practice of rehabilitating 
them once they've entered the justice system.  
</P>
<P>
 "Prevention and intervention was a new concept," she says. "When I first 
started, rehab was the name of the game, but we thought it would be more 
effective to get the kids at the front end of the system instead of at the back 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 And so began Margot Carlson's climb from idealistic intern to executive 
director -- getting her way up every rung of the corporate ladder within the 
multi-program organization. CSP, formally Youth Service Programs, began in 1971 
with a single teen diversion unit at UC Irvine and now has become one of the 
most respected such programs in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his mother has tapered her hours into a four-day workweek, Gregory 
Carlson said she works as much as or more than ever at CSP, with late nights, 
weekends and overtime she's never thought to track. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be tiring; she uses all of her energy there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the really incredible thing about my mom is that she is still developing 
talents. A lot of people are motivated by money or other material things, but 
she's tried to actually do something that would benefit the community and 
society at large. Her talents keep emerging." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson's talent for developing successful programs and her early ideas 
surrounding youth and criminal justice have proved to be very effective. 
According to Orange County Probation Department statistics, roughly 75% of the 
1,669 juveniles who would otherwise have found themselves in the district 
attorney's office and in the courts last year were diverted into CSP programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Diverted youths and their parents have paid about $5 million in restitution to 
crime victims since the program began. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, they are providing an alternative to the juvenile justice system 
for the lightweight offenders in Orange County," said Rod Speer, of the Orange 
County Probation Department's Juvenile Division, who added that CSP now holds 
the contracts in most of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers and colleagues from the early days remember Carlson as a woman with 
sincere goals and uncompromising principles, one who rarely accepts no for an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Margot, in my opinion, is a very driven person and a very persistent person 
with a lot of tenacity," said Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr., 
who has known Carlson for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She does it with such style and professionalism. When she you hear her 
explain her programs, you're gonna get involved or you're gonna give, one of 
those two things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner agrees, recalling one of the first 
meetings he had with Carlson when he was the director of the Orangewood 
Children's Home. She had approached Steiner to give money to the youth shelter, 
impressing upon him that if there was no place for troubled teens to go, they 
would end up in his facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "She convinced me that it was in my best interest to give her money," said 
Steiner with a laugh. "I thought I had a tight hold on my money, and she picked 
my pocket. I guess I was blackmailed in a nice sort of way." 
</P>
<P>
 From the county supervisors dedicated to teen diversion to the volunteer 
handyman who pops by the youth shelter when something needs fixing, it seems 
everyone Carlson comes into contact with gets involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's because she and CSP have maintained truth in their mission," 
said Larry Leaman, director of the Social Services Agency for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "And she's astute enough to make her point and move on instead of falling on 
her sword."  
</P>
<P>
 Leaman, whose office refers several hundred clients to CSP annually, said he 
has seen his share of well-intentioned people in the nonprofit community come 
and go in his 14 years as head of social services for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of these programs that are attempting to service the community, 
it's a matter of economic survival," Leaman said. "It consumes directors, and 
it's a real burnout job that makes (Carlson) unique. She's still here after all 
these years. . . . She has such high energy that sometimes we wonder where she 
gets it all." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Seated behind her desk at CSP headquarters in Irvine and surrounded by awards 
and family photos, Carlson cradled the telephone receiver with her chin and 
shoulder, speaking with the pleasant-toned authority that is so a part of her 
business persona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really going to squawk if we get screwed out of this one," she said. 
"Let's do our best to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
 The words "tenacious" and "committed" are used time after time to describe her 
-- two traits that no doubt contributed to her ability to make the midstream 
changes in her life. Her business friends are police chiefs, judges and 
high-ranking county officials, yet she often spends time counseling troubled 
teens who seek help from the large agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The compassionate side of her comes out when it comes to the programs dealing 
with kids," said Michael Shumacher, chief probation officer for Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "CSP is one of the first programs to come on the scene to provide organized 
private help for teen-agers, and she has been a very aggressive player when it 
comes to implementing these programs in a very effective manner. She's very 
dedicated." 
</P>
<P>
 She may have stepped on some toes along the way, but she said it's not her 
style to burn bridges or steamroll her way through negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Professionally, from what I can see, she runs it well," said Kevin Meehan, 
executive director of Orange County Youth Service Programs, another nonprofit 
agency that sometimes competes for county contracts with CSP. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Carlson said she and Meehan "have gone around a few times," Meehan 
downplayed the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it as cutthroat and competitive as people like to think it would 
be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for toe-stomping, Carlson said she tries to do as little as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in the business of being at odds with people," she said with a smile. 
"We perform a service that I truly believe Orange County would be poor without. 
Because of that, I do business a certain way." 
</P>

 Padding around the living room in sheepskin slippers, Margot Rose, 26, lights 
up when she talks about her job of putting on sensor tags at a Wet Seal 
warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I get a bonus," she says. "I work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Margot Rose shares the family home with her mother and father. Siblings 
Gregory, 40, Keith, 39, Karen Marie, 36, David, 34, and Richard, 32, have 
moved, some of them raising children of their own nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 It's rare to see Margot Rose without a smile. She watches "Monday Night 
Football" with Keith every week during the season, helps Dad with dinner and 
tells her mother how lucky she is to have her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that hurts now is if I see her slighted in any way," Carlson 
said. "But she's great. I think she's happy." Profile:

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; BALANCING THE EXTREMES; AS THE FIRST LATINO MAYOR OF SANTA 
ANA, MIGUEL PULIDO JR. HAS EARNED THE RESPECT OF A DIVERSE CITY -- AND SOME 
CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miguel A. Pulido Jr. starts the day in the well-worn offices of his family's 
Santa Ana muffler shop, slipping easily from English to Spanish to French as he 
studies the absentee vote count from the recent election, ducks under a car to 
diagnose a faulty converter and takes a call from a Vietnamese supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 He then dashes to City Hall for a briefing on pending projects, pays his 
respects at a viewing for deceased Latino community attorney Wallace Davis, and 
rushes to Costa Mesa's swank Center Club for a gathering of the nonpartisan 
Latin American Voters of America. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he takes his seat on the council dais for an evening forum on 
community policing, he is 30 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido -- who was sworn into office Tuesday as Santa Ana's first Latino mayor 
-- has earned both respect and criticism for his ambitious effort to juggle 
engagements and his diplomatic knack for wooing a wide range of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Mexican-born Pulido, 38, may face the greatest challenge of all: 
finding a way to unite and satisfy a city of extremes that includes the 
conservative white residents who have long held considerable voting clout and 
the vocal Latino community activists who have eyed his politicking with growing 
disdain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are those who criticize him for not being a single-issue elected 
official," said former Mayor Daniel H. Young. "The fact of the matter is he's 
the mayor. . . . Let me tell you, from a guy who has eight years on the beat, 
Santa Ana is one of the toughest cities to represent.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have every nationality, every income group, every political persuasion, 
all of whom are struggling to get to the forefront. You have to be a supremely 
talented listener. You have to be someone who has a genuine interest in all 
points of view, or you just flat won't succeed. That's where I think Miguel has 
the right talents." 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido, a handsome yet shy former solar engineer and tennis player, was 
elected to the City Council in 1986 after his family successfully fought the 
city's attempts to raze their business, the Ace Muffler shop on 1st Street.  
</P>
<P>
 Back then, he was a little-known activist who tenaciously battled Santa Ana's 
powers that be. Since then, he has emerged as an accomplished politician, adept 
at working state and federal government officials to pull in millions of 
dollars in grants for the city.  
</P>
<P>
 But Pulido's agility in sporting different hats when addressing different 
audiences has alienated him from some Latino community leaders, who say he 
shapes his opinions to what constituents want to hear, often shows up late or 
not at all to community events, and hasn't shown enough sensitivity to the 
city's low-income immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you say you're going to be there, you have to follow through," said Rueben 
Martinez, a downtown barber and bookseller who supported Pulido strongly in his 
early years but has since become disenchanted. "That's where you get your 
credibility and integrity built. Through the years, he's gained some and he's 
lost some. He's always sitting on the fence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the recent election, Pulido came under fire from some Latino 
community activists for sending out a final-hour mailer to white voters that 
stated he opposed Proposition 187 because it "does not go far enough" in 
cracking down on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a week earlier, he had publicly stated that he was opposed to the 
measure, but cited different reasons, namely that Proposition 187 would deny 
children access to education and health care. Those sentiments were absent from 
the mailer, which instead focused on the threats that some "illegal aliens" 
pose to public safety and on Pulido's efforts to clear the city of the homeless 
and limit the number of people who can live in a residence -- key concerns to 
many Santa Ana voters.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was an awful piece. Of course it hurt him," Martinez said. "It did not 
show any passion, and no sensitivity." 
</P>
<P>
 The new mayor, however, says his position on the controversial initiative 
remained consistent, and that he sent out the mailer to stress his opposition 
to illegal immigration.  
</P>
<P>
 Pulido points out that his family emigrated legally from Mexico. He says he is 
proud of his cultural heritage and fluency in three languages, and he enjoys 
strumming his guitar as his father sings traditional Mexican ballads that his 
grandfather wrote and passed down.  
</P>
<P>
 The Latino community, he says, is as diverse as the white community.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel the connection some people assume I feel. I don't think any one 
voice can speak on behalf of all Hispanics," Pulido said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido was born in Mexico City to Miguel Armando Pulido, an engineer, and 
Maria Soledad Pulido, whose French ancestry piqued the younger Miguel's 
interest in the language before she died when he was 19.  
</P>
<P>
 His father, now 68, immigrated to California in 1960 for a Van Nuys factory 
job that never materialized. Instead, his father worked in the Placentia 
cornfields, fixing transmissions on his own time until he earned enough, after 
a year, to bring his wife and four children to join him in the rundown 
farmhouse they called home. 
</P>
<P>
 When the young Miguel was bused to Commonwealth Elementary School in Fullerton 
for kindergarten at age 5, he spoke no English and was the only Latino boy in 
his class.  
</P>
<P>
 "On my first day of school, my mother made me two pieces of paper to carry 
with me," Pulido said. "The one in my right pocket said, 'My name is Miguel 
Pulido and I live at 801 S. Placentia Drive.' The one in my left pocket said, 
'I have to go to the bathroom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido used both slips that day, he said, and took his first steps toward the 
assimilation that he prides himself on. By sixth grade, he was class president, 
assuring fellow students that he would do his best, but warning that he 
couldn't promise A's or free soda.  
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in a very Anglo environment, and because of that, I'm very 
comfortable in diverse environments," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pulido went on to Ladera Vista Junior High and Troy High School, both in 
Fullerton, and to Cal State Fullerton. In 1992, he married Laura Saari, an 
Orange County Register reporter whom he met while she was interviewing him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Pulido quit his job as a solar engineer in 1984 and emerged onto the 
political stage as a devoted son fighting to save his family's business, he 
grabbed attention for his intelligence and measured eloquence.  
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Al Amezcua, who is putting together a committee of community leaders 
to serve as the mayor's "eyes and ears," remembers meeting Pulido at the 
muffler shop when he brought his old Honda there for repairs. Shortly after, 
Pulido called Amezcua for advice in mounting a challenge to the city's plan to 
raze Ace Muffler for a shopping mall.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember him really for the first time taking a very strong position on 
what he believed in, and doing things the smart way, not screaming, not 
yelling, but making presentations stating his positions in a very calm, a very 
sound way," Amezcua said.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that while Pulido is not "a flag raiser for the Mexican community," he 
has shown great talent in working with "every segment of the community," from 
staunch Republicans to Democrats, from Korean business owners to Vietnamese 
senior citizens and wealthy whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why he's the man of our times," Amezcua said. "This city needs someone 
who is able to pull everyone in, and almost be at the pulpit to ensure that all 
voices and all perspectives and everybody's position is taken into 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 When two youths were killed in a drive-by shooting near his uncle's house 
several years ago, Amezcua took a personal interest in pushing for the city to 
address the gang problem. He called Pulido, who met him at a Taco Bell near the 
muffler shop -- a hangout Pulido jokingly refers to as his office.  
</P>
<P>
 Out of that meeting eventually came Pulido's anti-gang plan, which includes 
the city's Project PRIDE, a youth employment program, and an effort to build 
more community centers.  
</P>
<P>
 Pulido also has worked with Councilman Robert L. Richardson to try to curtail 
residential overcrowding, and has lobbied to lure a new federal courthouse to 
Santa Ana, along with a host of other federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido also spearheaded an effort to get Santa Ana designated as a 'federal 
enterprise community," which would ensure tax breaks for businesses and 
eligibility for more social service grants. (The city's application is still 
under review in Washington.) And although he came onto the council fighting 
City Hall, Pulido quickly distanced himself from the acrimonious battles that 
then plagued the board.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first several months on the council I did nothing but listen and listen 
and listen to see what was occurring," Pulido said. "I think some people 
weren't happy with that because they wanted me to grandstand. But that's not 
what I was about."  
</P>
<P>
 His attentiveness has won him praise from some of the city's neighborhood 
associations, organizations made up predominantly of homeowners in the city's 
better-kept neighborhoods.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has always been concerned about neighborhood integrity and about the 
people who live in the neighborhoods," said Lorri Schmitt-Tudor, president of 
the Washington Square Neighborhood Assn. "I have never had the feeling that he 
was dividing people up in terms of ethnicity. He has a genuine concern. He's a 
very caring man. He wouldn't be doing what he is doing for all of us if he 
wasn't."  
</P>
<P>
 But his critics offer a different portrayal, saying that while Pulido may have 
an open ear for some people in town, he has not been as receptive to 
lower-income residents, many of them non-voting immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 "This guy likes to go to Washington, D.C., instead of going into the barrios," 
said onetime supporter Martinez. "He goes into the nice neighborhoods in town, 
but we're human beings too. He's going to have to clean it up, and if he does, 
I'll be there for him, because we need to be united. Can he do it? We need to 
find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Others have harsher criticisms. When Pulido offered differing statements on 
Proposition 187, some Latino community activists charged the behavior was all 
too typical.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think he lacks the integrity and the character and the commitment and the 
political will to lead a diverse community," said John Palacio of the Mexican 
American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "Pulido, in my judgment, 
exemplifies a career politician who will say or do anything to remain in 
office."  
</P>
<P>
 Palacio and others say they were already wary of Pulido after he sent out a 
similar final-hour election mailer in 1986 calling illegal immigrants a "public 
nuisance."  
</P>
<P>
 "The support that he had in the Latino community was very soft, but we heard 
he was going to be a new Pulido, a new leader," Palacio said. "What we really 
saw was vintage Pulido, a man who will sell his community out for political 
gain." 
</P>
<P>
 The criticisms illustrate one thing, said former Mayor Young: that governing a 
city of extremes is a delicate business.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think he faces some extremely difficult challenges to make everyone 
comfortable," Young said, "but I think he's up to the task." Miguel A. Pulido 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: No, born in Mexico City, lives in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married to newspaper reporter Laura Saari; no children. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Watching and playing tennis, speaking and reading French, 
vegetarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 On his early days in California, living in a Placentia farmhouse: "When I 
first got there I was Tom Sawyer -- making treehouses in the avocado trees." 
</P>
<P>
 On learning to speak English: "I didn't speak English as a kindergartner. I 
was the only Spanish-speaking kid in the class. . . . At home our parents would 
make us write in Spanish, speak in Spanish, but at school my parents wanted 
everything to be in English." 
</P>
<P>
 On juggling his new job as mayor with his work at the muffler shop: "I can 
work very effectively. I know I'm going to have to leave the muffler shop more 
than I did before -- but it is a part-time job."

UNVARNISHED COLORADO; A LOCAL'S GUIDE TO GLITZ-FREE BRECKENRIDGE, AN OLD MINING 
TOWN WHERE THE SLOPES ARE STEEP AND THE PARTYING'S HEARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GONZALES, Gonzales is a free-lance writer based in Breckenridge and 
Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last winter, as a ski bum living here, I paid $350 a month for a room in a 
dilapidated mobile home, subsisted on a daily diet of oatmeal and canned soup, 
and in my job as ski photographer, spent countless hours trying to convince 
tourists that family portraits taken during blinding snowstorms make fabulous 
Christmas cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, when it came time this autumn to return to Breckenridge for 
another ski season, I balked. Sitting down with my journal, as I often do in 
fits of indecisiveness, I began writing the pros and cons of moving back to the 
mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The cons came quickly. I wrote about the cold. I wrote about the expense. I 
recalled the day last December when I was testing my brand-new skis and broke 
my collarbone into three pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Then my thoughts shifted, and I wrote about the sunrises I'd witnessed in 
Breckenridge, when the tips of the mountains looming over the sleeping town 
were stabbed with sharp, orange light. I wrote about Mountain Java, the cafe 
where my friends and I escaped snowstorms and our poorly heated homes. I wrote 
about walking home from the Gold Pan Bar late at night, reeling both from the 
night's revelry and the vastness of the night sky awash with stars or 
snowflakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I'd filled two pages, before I'd even begun writing about skiing, I 
knew I would return. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedged between the sharp peaks of central Colorado's Ten Mile Range and the 
streaked flanks of Bald Mountain, Breckenridge (or "Breck," as locals call it) 
embraces returning ski bums and visitors alike with a genuineness and an 
amiability you don't often encounter in other Colorado ski resorts. Breck's 
1,500 residents take fierce pride in the town's historic past, in the beauty 
and accessibility of their rugged surroundings and in their reputations as 
tireless partyers. But more than anything else, Breckenridge prides itself on 
what it isn't: namely, prefabricated and pretentious. 
</P>
<P>
 You only have to make the 30-minute drive northwest from Breckenridge to Vail 
for a quick lesson on what a prefab, made-to-order ski town looks like. 
Arriving in Colorado's largest ski resort, you're immediately struck by Vail's 
resemblance to a giant, pseudo-Tirolean shopping mall, complete with concrete 
parking garages, elevated walkways and a clock tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Vail, Breckenridge lavishly caters to a diverse range of visitors. At 
their disposal are two sprawling slopeside resorts, several art galleries, 
horse-drawn carriage rides and an impressively equipped municipal recreation 
center, complete with a two-story-high indoor water slide. But Breck is not the 
progeny of the ski industry: Four decades ago, when Vail was a mere gleam in an 
ambitious developer's eye, Breckenridge was celebrating its centennial as a 
hardened high-country mining town. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Victorian buildings line Breckenridge's Main Street, and scattered 
throughout the town are unimproved mining sheds and burro barns, their wooden 
doors hanging open as if their original owners had left only yesterday to 
prospect elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 As for pretensions, Donald and Ivana have yet to bicker in a Breckenridge lift 
line, and you won't find Oprah Winfrey bellying up to the bar at the 
Breckenridge Brewery. An absence of celebrities, however, isn't the only reason 
Breck lacks the snobbishness of Aspen or Telluride. Many Breckenridge apartment 
and homeowners are still willing to rent to seasonal workers, and there are 
still enough lift operators, waiters and ski instructors living in Breckenridge 
to save it from feeling like a theme park for fur-swaddled Floridians. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 100 years after its founding in 1859, Breckenridge attracted 
fortune-seekers eager only to exploit what was inside the mountains, not on 
their slopes. Though Colorado's largest gold nugget, "Tom's Baby," was 
discovered nearby, the town's isolated location, high altitude (9,600 feet) and 
bitter climate kept steady prosperity at arm's length. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Waugh and Jennifer Kemp, members of the Summit County Historical 
Society, are determined to prevent Breck's long and rollicking history from 
being smothered under snow and the dollars people pay to slide down it. Waugh 
and Kemp fiercely oppose developers hoping to replace Breckenridge's burro 
barns with gleaming apartments, and they lead historic walking tours through 
town to introduce residents and visitors to Breck's colorful and sometimes 
outrageous past. 
</P>
<P>
 Outrage, according to Kemp, is the very reaction of some tour-takers when they 
learn that turn-of-the-century miners in Breckenridge paid 25 cents for a bath 
in a Main Street boarding house, compared to five cents for a rendezvous with 
one of the prostitutes who lived on "Nickle Hill."  
</P>
<P>
 My strongest reaction, however, was the nausea I felt upon being shown the 
several examples of "hair art" on the walls of the restored Briggle House, 
built in 1896. To pass the long, cold winters, Victorian housewives swapped 
swatches of human hair and used them to weave ornate, multihued wreaths.  
</P>
<P>
 When World War II broke out and the U.S. government halted all gold mining, 
Breck's population plummeted and the remaining 250-or-so residents found 
themselves inhabiting a near-ghost town. Then, in the early '60s, a Kansas 
lumber company, encouraged by the success of other fledgling ski resorts, 
opened the first ski lift on Peak 8. (Early Breckenridge surveyors may have 
been adept at sniffing out gold, but they weren't much for naming mountains.) 
Since then, the ski area has steadily grown to include Peak 9 and Peak 10, and 
last year, Breckenridge Ski Resort's current owner, Ralston Resorts, opened 
Peak 7, a bald, steep hump open to expert skiers willing to traverse its face 
or hike to its summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the size of the Breckenridge ski area -- at nearly 2,000 acres of 
skiable terrain, it's one of Colorado's largest -- and its gradual, piecemeal 
development, it's no surprise that skiers lose themselves among Breck's 126 ski 
trails faster than they lose gloves on chairlifts. Herein lies the advantage of 
being a local. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifts that crisscross the canyon between Peaks 8 and 9 dumbfound skiers 
new to the mountain, leaving some of the choicest terrain to residents and 
experienced Breckenridge skiers. Fortunately, for $21 (plus a $42 lift ticket) 
a skier can take a three-hour tour with a Breckenridge Ski Resort guide and 
learn how to navigate the intricacies of the trail system. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've found your bearings, however, you'll find the skiing in 
Breckenridge rivals that of any North American resort. Though Breckenridge lift 
tickets and season passes are also valid at nearby Keystone Resort and Arapahoe 
Basin (all three ski areas are owned by Ralston Resorts), boredom rarely rears 
its ugly head at Breckenridge. Breck boasts more advanced-skier terrain than 
any other Rocky Mountain resort except Crested Butte; both resorts claim 57% of 
their slopes are tailored to experts.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My first season at Breck, I skied every day but one or two and still hadn't 
exhausted its possibilities. However, I did find some favorites: When I wanted 
to scream down long, groomed cruisers or float through powder-rich glades, I 
headed for Peak 10. I dropped into Peak 9 mogul runs such as "Inferno" and 
"Devil's Crotch" when I wanted to exhaust my legs and frazzle my nerves. On 
Peak 8, I giddily partook of vertiginous, above-tree-line bowl-skiing or headed 
for Breckenridge's newest pride and joy, Peak 7, where skiers hike up a long 
ridge to the summit and then throw themselves at the mercy of the gravity gods. 
Last winter, whenever weather allowed, there was a long line of skiers and 
snowboarders filing up the ridge line to the Peak 7 summit, like a phalanx of 
Gore-Tex-bedecked lemmings eager to leap to their doom. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who hikes uphill for an hour with his skis or snowboard over his 
shoulder so he can curdle his blood with a quick plummet through the powder 
wants to go somewhere later and boast about it. Breckenridge is well-equipped 
for base-of-the-mountain braggadocio. 
</P>
<P>
 At tony Cafe Alpine, which claims to be the first restaurant in Colorado to 
serve tapas (Spanish appetizers), skiers regale each other with mountain-top 
exploits while munching on blackened tuna sashimi and trout canapes; those 
craving more basic, carbo-heavy grub head for the burgers and pizzas at 
Downstairs at Eric's, where locals follow an odd custom of drizzling their 
pizza crusts with honey. 
</P>
<P>
 Just down Main Street from Eric's are some of my favorite watering holes: the 
Alligator Lounge, a basement-level blues joint; the Bar-B-Que, which serves an 
assortment of Colorado micro-brewery beers and platters of ribs and 'slaw; and 
the Breckenridge Brewery, which serves a rich, amber ale called Avalanche, 
aptly named for the morning-after pounding it administers to your head if you 
imbibe one too many. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times over the winter, Breck craves a party too big for one bar to 
hold. In November, the town throws a "brewski tasting" street festival, during 
which participants taste micro-brews from around the country. In January, 
Breckenridge goes international with its Snow Sculpture Championships, in which 
teams of sculptors from around the world race the clock while fashioning 
intricate works of art from massive and gradually melting blocks of snow. The 
same month, there's the notorious Ullr Fest -- when the Norse god Ullr (say 
"OOHler"), responsible for creating snow, is appeased with a full day of 
parades, fireworks and wintry debauchery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there's one place in town that doesn't need a special event to encourage 
debauchery, it's the Gold Pan -- the bar upon which Breckenridge's night life 
is anchored. The Gold Pan isn't the oldest bar west of the Mississippi, as some 
claim, but it's old enough to know how to give your sensibilities a good 
whippin' if you saunter in heedless to its long history as a serious drinking 
saloon. Built in 1881, the Gold Pan still features its original swinging doors, 
which were recessed off the sidewalk so inebriated miners wouldn't knock down 
passersby when stumbling outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gold Pan was recently purchased by Reggie Grey, owner of the Adams Street 
Grill, a Main Street eatery known for its candle-lit gentility. Waugh, the 
historian who filled me in on the Gold Pan's history, says that when the 
restaurateur bought the bar, everybody was worried he would "yuppify" it. "He 
did clean it up and remodel it," says Waugh. "That lasted about a week." 
</P>
<P>
 On any given night, the Gold Pan is full of young, hard-partying locals 
playing pool or listening to a local band thrashing it out by the front 
windows. Many of them sport the shaved heads, pierced facial features and baggy 
garb that have lent the sport of snowboarding a reputation as being a ski-town 
fashion show for the young and surly. Snowboarders are probably the most 
visible and fastest-growing segment of the Breckenridge ski-bum community. 
</P>
<P>
 But Breckenridge, which was one of the earliest ski areas in Colorado to 
welcome snowboarders to its slopes, is largely exempt from the much-publicized 
animosity between skiers and snowboarders (a.k.a. "shredders"). 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Briner, Breckenridge's director of ski operations, attributes the 
harmony on his mountain to Breck's longstanding policy toward snowboarders: 
There is no policy. "We don't have a 'shred-iquette,' " says Briner. "We have 
rules for the mountain, and everybody, whether on snowboards, telemark skis or 
alpine skis, has to follow those guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, something compels snowboarders to distinguish themselves 
physically from skiers. Last year one of my mobile-home roomies, Kyle Metzler, 
a recent graduate of Colgate University in New York state, had come to 
Breckenridge to teach skiing. Early in the season Kyle took up snowboarding and 
shaved his head. Then he let his hair grow out to a fuzz and bleached it until 
it glowed. Then he bleached his eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, when I met Kyle and his girlfriend Charity Brehl to go snowboarding 
(yes, I'm a snowboarder, but my eyebrows are still their natural color), 
Charity pulled me aside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kyle's in a bad mood," Charity said. "Tell him he looks really jacked in his 
new clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, snowboarders are sensitive guys, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle and Charity also introduced me to another 'boarder, Mike Buckley, who 
recently arrived in Breckenridge and who fits the profile of a classic, 
living-hand-to-mouth ski bum. Mike, 21, hasn't found a place to live yet; for 
two weeks he's been sleeping in the car he drove here from Iowa City. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a station wagon, so it's not too bad," says Mike, "even though I have to 
lie down to change my clothes. Of course it's freezing cold, so I don't want to 
take my pants off too often anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Though his living conditions might leave something to be desired, Mike 
couldn't ask for a better workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after arriving in Breck, Mike landed a job at Mountain Java, where 
Breckenridge locals jump start their cold-numbed brains with elaborate elixirs, 
such as "Soul in a Bowl," a mixture of espresso, Mexican chocolate and spices, 
and fuel their ski legs with huge, hot bagels. Mountain Java's windows face the 
ski mountain; shelves filled with books, postcards and magazines surround its 
tables. By the front door is a bulletin board plastered with "skis for sale" 
and "need a place to live" notices.  
</P>
<P>
 In two years of nearly incessant traveling, I've come to regard Mountain Java 
as one of the closest places I have to a living room. I've also found that 
there is no better spot from which to watch the day turn to dusk. It's a 
favorite ritual of mine to sit near the front windows, a mug of coffee before 
me, and catch the dying daylight smudge the rivers of snow streaming down the 
ski mountain with a faint shade of purple, while the lights of Breckenridge, 
the closest place I have to a hometown, blink on. 
</P>

 Somehow, I suspect my ski-bumming days are not over. GUIDEBOOK

WEEKEND ESCAPE: TAMARACK LODGE; MAMMOTH COZY; A SCENIC HIDEAWAY FOR 
CROSS-COUNTRY SKIERS, WITH GOURMET MEALS AND MILES OF PRISTINE TRAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Zamichow writes for The Times' Metro 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With my boyfriend facing the trauma of a 40th birthday, we left town. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a better way to beat the blues than pausing at the top of a 
snow-packed bowl with your cross-country ski tips pointed in a death-defying 
angle downhill? 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived at Tamarack Lodge, in Mammoth Lakes, in the middle of a snowstorm. 
After picking up our key from the log-cabin lodge, we tromped through knee-deep 
snow to our tiny studio cabin about 30 yards from where we parked, toting bags 
and our ski gear. 
</P>
<P>
 While most skiers in Mammoth head to the lift lines for downhill slopes, 
Tamarack provides cross-country enthusiasts with more than 25 miles of 
maintained tracks, cutting through forests, skirting various lakes and opening 
into spectacular mountain views. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled in the hillside overlooking the Lower Twin Lakes, the lodge is a warm, 
friendly place with a roaring fire in the stone hearth. Sitting more than 8,000 
feet high in the Eastern Sierras and almost three miles from town, Tamarack 
feels like a world away -- no televisions or radios. Nor is there ever any real 
reason to leave -- you can cook in the cabins, bringing groceries when you 
arrive, or eat sumptuous meals at the lodge dining room, a short ski or walk 
from the cabins. 
</P>
<P>
 A word of warning -- if you do plan to eat at the lodge, make dinner 
reservations when you reserve your lodging accommodations. (We arrived on a 
Saturday in March, the dreaded birthday, only to find that the Lakefront 
Restaurant was completely booked. The maitre d' re-evaluated the seating 
capacity and arranged a late-night dinner for us when she realized she faced 
two guests who were about to melt down.) 
</P>
<P>
 Little did we know that chef Steve Mejia had wooed and won most serious diners 
in the area, including the downhill-ski crowd, by offering such fare (with soup 
or salad and veggie) as house-smoked pheasant linguine ($23.50), 
rosemary-and-walnut-crusted venison medallions with a sun-dried cherry and 
green-peppercorn sauce ($26.50) and rack of New Zealand lamb with red-onion 
confit and a Merlot-rosemary demi-glace ($26.50). The food is rich and 
mouth-wateringly satisfying. Perfect after a long day skiing. Or after a 
five-hour drive from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamarack's ski school will rent equipment and provide lessons for adults as 
well as children. They also offer skating skis, the latest fad to hit the 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
 On short skating skis, you propel yourself forward much the same as you do 
with ice skates, balancing your weight from one leg to another. Your toes point 
out, creating a huge V-shape with the skis. We tried them at dusk our second 
night. The initial feeling? Ungainly. Worst-case scenario? Your feet slide off 
in opposite directions as you do a split in the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tamarack, once you arrive, you need never use your car again (though we did 
go to town for a much-appreciated massage). The trails start right behind the 
lodge and cabins, so you walk out the door, put your skis on and take off, 
heading for the numerous snow-covered lakes at the foot of the mountains. The 
trails -- all in Inyo National Forest and groomed until April 15 -- are 
well-marked, with colored tags indicating which are advanced, intermediate and 
beginner. This way, novice skiers won't be surprised by a steep, twisty, 
tree-riddled course. 
</P>
<P>
 The countryside is dotted with lodgepole and ponderosa pines whose limbs are 
usually heavy with a coat of snow during the winter. At points, the trees knit 
together overhead, making a cathedral-like dome over the trail. Elsewhere, you 
emerge from thick forest into breathtaking vistas of mountains and lakes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When we first skied up to Lake Mary, about a two-mile trek from the lodge, we 
were startled to hear strains of the "Brandenburg Concerto" in the midst of the 
forest. As we got closer and closer to the lake, the music became louder. 
Rounding a bend, we came across the Lake Mary Cafe -- a real-live restaurant 
that serves hot chocolate, as well as food, and can be reached only by skiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, not knowing about this place, we'd brought our lunch in 
knapsacks. When we asked if we could buy cups of steaming cocoa and eat our 
sandwiches in the empty cafe, we were brusquely turned out. (For us, it was the 
only rude note in an otherwise pleasant stay.) So we selected a large log by 
the lake, sheltered from the wind, and devoured our lunch while the chickadees 
landed at our feet. This season, a second cafe -- Lake Pokonobe -- is open for 
winter wanderers.  
</P>
<P>
 Tamarack was our first experience with meticulously groomed trails. Before, on 
other ski trips, we had either followed in the crude tracks left by previous 
skiers, or we'd cut our own trail, which can be a laborious task in fresh, deep 
snow. Tamarack's trails allow you to think more about your form than staying on 
your feet. We also set our own course, departing from the trails to explore and 
to practice S-shaped telemark turns. Whether or not you stay on the tracks, you 
are required to pay for a daily pass. (The full-day pass for Tamarack guests is 
$12; half-day, $8; and twilight, $7. Seniors and youths, from 11 to 17, pay $10 
for a full day; $7 for half-day; and $5 for twilight. Children under 10 ski 
free. Outsiders pay slightly more.) 
</P>
<P>
 Our favorite trips were the ones that took us to the farthest points from the 
lodge, such as Horseshoe Lake and Lake George, at 9,008 feet.  
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, we would wend our way back to our cabin, which we 
upgraded on our second day to a one-bedroom with a small living room and 
fireplace. There, overlooking the lakes, we built large fires, cooked up 
spaghetti dinners, dried our ski boots and mapped out our next excursion. 
Although the kitchens come equipped with basic pots and pans, remember to bring 
your own cooking essentials, such as salt, pepper and oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamarack can accommodate 110 guests, 30 in the lodge and the rest in a cluster 
of cabins that all have kitchens, private baths and gas heat. Some have 
fireplaces or wood-burning stoves. Our first somewhat-cramped cabin had 
neither. We figure where there's snow, there ought to be fire. So we switched. 
It was well worth the $21 extra per night -- our second cabin had a comfortable 
kitchen with a table overlooking the lake, a living room replete with 
Scandinavian wood furniture and a comfy sofa. Best yet, it had a fireplace as 
well as a bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 Our lodging included breakfasts at the Lakefront Restaurant. Every morning, we 
skied to the lodge, unstrapped our gear, and went in for a hearty meal of, say, 
silver-dollar buttermilk pancakes with maple syrup, or thick wedges of citrus 
French toast with Grand Marnier fresh berry compote, or the three-egg Sierra 
omelet, filled with bell peppers, ham, onions and cheese. Facing the prospect 
of vigorous exercise, and perhaps, face-biting cold weather, we rationalized 
eating enormous quantities and thoroughly enjoyed every breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1924, Tamarack Lodge has passed through various hands before landing 
with its current owners, Carol and David Watson, nine years ago. The Watsons 
launched a $1.5-million restoration and modernization effort shortly after they 
bought the place, and today they can laugh about the first winter when it 
didn't snow until Jan. 5 and the time the pipes froze and they had to bring 
guests supermarket bottled water to brush their teeth. When calling for lodging 
reservations, be sure to ask about special packages -- information that's not 
always volunteered. We were able to switch to lower rates on arrival and ended 
up staying longer than we had intended. It turns out that nothing makes a 
person feel quite as youthful as skiing six hours amid pine-dotted mountains 
and chiseling telemark turns upon an untouched white slope. Budget for Two

SINGLES; GOING IT ALONE; CLUBS AND RESORTS CAN GIVE A LIFT TO SINGLE SKIERS WHO 
FIND MEETING PEOPLE AN UPHILL STRUGGLE

 For a sport with such a friendly reputation, skiing can be downright 
antisocial when it comes to singles. The happy groups whooshing down the 
slopes, their faces glowing with good health and good vibes; the hot toddies by 
a warming fire after a long day in the bracing cold, the intimate cafes and 
cozy chalets just made for cuddling -- this is perfect couples stuff and fine 
for a batch of friends on a group vacation. But show up solo, and you could be 
facing a solitary day in the snow, a lonely table at dinner and an even 
lonelier trudge back to your single room -- for which you can usually expect to 
pay a surcharge, since lodging rates almost always are based on double 
occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like cruises and Caribbean resorts, ski vacations are often tough on singles, 
both socially and financially," says Jens Jurgen, publisher of Travel 
Companions, a 13-year-old newsletter for solo travelers. " At many resorts, a 
solo skier will pay as much for a room as a couple." 
</P>
<P>
 But things are looking up on the slopes. Recognizing a potential competitive 
edge, a growing number of resorts are offering singles a break on prices, 
particularly early and late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, for example, Northstar-at-Tahoe has slashed the daily rate for 
a single condo room and lift ticket by 36% -- from $171 to $109 -- for those 
who come before Dec. 22 or after March 19, as well as selected Sunday through 
Thursday nights throughout the season. Colorado's Copper Mountain, has a 
singles package of $98 per night, 46% off the regular $180 rate, including lift 
ticket and access to the resort's huge racquet-and-athletic club, before Dec. 
15 and after April 10. And Jackson Hole, Wyo., offers singles discounts of up 
to 40% on double-occupancy rates at 20 lodgings throughout the season 
(excluding holiday periods). 
</P>
<P>
 Club Med, a traditional haven for singles in the Caribbean, has a ski resort 
at Copper Mountain, Colo., where solo guests share double rooms in a slope-side 
lodge with a fireside lounge and two restaurants that offer opportunities for 
easy mingling. Seven-day packages range from $970 to $1,500; nightly rates are 
$150-$195 (add a 30% surcharge for private rooms.) Prices include lodgings, 
lift tickets, all meals, two-hour morning and afternoon group ski lessons, 
aerobics classes and the usual Club Med evening talent shows and dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way solos can get a break on prices -- and find companionship -- is to 
join one of the 3,000 ski clubs in North America that organize group trips to 
resorts around the country. Clubs often rent a house or condo for the entire 
season at a resort within driving distance, which members can use at bargain 
rates. (To receive a list of Southern California clubs, send a self-addressed, 
stamped envelope to the Los Angeles Council of Ski Clubs, 3686 Division St., 
Los Angeles, Calif. 90065.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some travel agencies specialize in group ski tours. Moguls Ski & Sun Tours in 
Boulder, Colo., puts together dozens of trips around the United States and 
Canada each season, many of which welcome solo joiners as a way of filling up 
chalet and condo rooms for the best possible group rate. The agency can also 
get clients a substantial break on air fares. Although Moguls specializes in 
tours for college students, co-owner Stephen Hall said plenty of trips have 
members ranging from 20 to 60 years old. For those who favor cross-country 
skiing, several outfitters offer group trips, during which singles are paired 
at lodgings whenever possible to avoid any surcharge. Berkeley-based Backroads 
runs five- and six-day ski trips to California's Royal Gorge, Tahoe Donner and 
Squaw Valley, Washington's Methow Valley, Banff and Yoho in the Canadian 
Rockies, Stowe, Vt., and the Eastern Townships in Quebec. The company 
guarantees that customers who book at least 60 days in advance and ask to share 
quarters will pay no single supplement if a roommate cannot be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sierra Club, which specializes in bargain-priced eco-adventures, 
accommodates solos on its five- to seven-day cross-country ski trips in 
California, Colorado, Minnesota and Alaska's Kenai Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Of course, money isn't everything when you're traveling solo. Camaraderie can 
also be a major consideration in choosing a skiing destination. Group trips 
have a built-in social component, but what if you're going it alone? 
</P>
<P>
 "All ski resorts are not created equal when it comes to singles," said Ron 
Rudolph, senior editor of Snow Country magazine in Trumbull, Conn. "The best 
places provide plenty of opportunities for singles to meet and greet -- plenty 
of common areas like bars and lounges, activities other than skiing, and a 
village or town with a lively life of its own." 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, Snow Country publishes a readership survey of favorite resorts in a 
wide range of categories, including "Singles' Favorites." The results of the 
most recent poll, published in the September issue, found five resorts tops 
with its single readers: Beaver Creek, Colo.; Deer Valley, Utah; Whiteface/Lake 
Placid, N.Y.; Sun Valley, Ida., and Steamboat, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll results reflect the magazine's mature, affluent readership, but 
Rudolph's personal list of favorites for singles includes Breckenridge, Colo., 
for its lively bar and shopping scene; Heavenly, which straddles California and 
Nevada, for the lively casino life on the Nevada side; Aspen, Colo., with lots 
of night life and street action, and old-time Western ski towns such as 
Telluride, Colo., and Crested Butte, Colo., which Rudolph says are just 
naturally friendly places to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Hall, of Moguls tours, also likes Breckenridge and Aspen, but his top 
pick for singles is Vail, Colo., where, he says, "the whole emphasis is on 
going out and socializing."  
</P>
<P>
 Whichever resort singles choose, experts agree that the best way to ease in 
socially is to take a ski class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Classes offer a non-stressful social environment where you'll typically be in 
the company of eight to 10 other skiers of your ability level and can easily 
find companions for meals and explorations around town," said Rudolph. "A 
weeklong program is ideal, since as the week goes on, class members often get 
really close, meeting up for cocktails after skiing . . . having dinners 
together. By the end of the week, people often are exchanging addresses and 
telephone numbers and promising to do it again next year." Most ski resorts 
offer some sort of instructional program. In its issue of December 1993, Travel 
& Leisure magazine described 23 of the best ski schools. Prices in the Travel & 
Leisure report have changed a bit since last year, but the recommendations 
provide a good insight into different resorts' ambience and teaching 
approaches. Copies of the issue can be found at most libraries or by contacting 
Travel & Leisure's back issues department at (800) 888-8728 (copies are $5 
each.) Information about ski schools is also is reported regularly in specialty 
magazines, such as Snow Country, Ski and Skiing, available at newsstands.

DESTINATION: THE WEST; OFFBEAT OFF THE SLOPES; OUT-OF-THE-ORDINARY WINTER 
SPORTS THAT OFFER THRILLS ALONG WITH THE CHILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Epstein is a Costa Mesa-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deciding on a ski destination once depended on such quaint notions as vertical 
drop and size ofskiable terrain. Today, even the most die-hard skiers can 
experience the high point of their ski week -- figuratively and literally -- 
off the slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 And the more off-the-wall, the better. Not to slight sleigh rides or run down 
snowmobiles, but they just don't cut it when your cutting edge is as sharp as 
your skis'. Even heli-skiing, if you can afford it, isn't exactly news. 
</P>
<P>
 So this season, try something different. Pilot a luge. Attend ice driving 
school. Go up in a glider plane, or snap on crampons for a tour of icefalls at 
the bottom of a frozen canyon. No experience necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't pry yourself from your skis, check out the country's only 
recreational ski-jump school. You can learn daffies and other aerial maneuvers, 
or simply make like Eddie the Eagle, the popular, semi-blind English ski jumper 
who soared his way to fame in the Calgary 1988 Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Moose and more in Jackson Hole: If you've always assumed that winter is a 
lousy time to view wildlife -- with most species in hibernation or departed for 
warmer climes -- high-tail it to Jackson Hole, Wyo., and book passage with the 
Great Plains Wildlife Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more viewing time per animal in winter," says staff naturalist Lorrie 
Lee. "The animals are down in the valley, so you don't have to drive so much, 
and because it's cold, they don't move a lot. Everything is still, quiet, 
defined." 
</P>
<P>
 Even on four-hour sunrise expeditions (which depart from Jackson at 8 a.m.), 
winter clients see at least 10 species -- from elk, moose, buffalo and bighorn 
sheep to bald eagles and trumpeter swans. The full-day expedition, meanwhile, 
includes lunch, a snowshoe walk and hands-on research. This year's major 
project: tracking porcupines for a fire-ecology study. Now, that sounds like a 
sticky business. 
</P>
<P>
 Half-day sunrise expeditions cost $65, or $35 for children 3 to 12. Full-day 
expeditions are $135 for both adults and children. Vehicles are equipped with 
roof hatches, spotting scopes and binoculars. The Great Plains Wildlife 
Institute will pick you up at any hotel in Jackson. Telephone (307) 733-2623.  
</P>
<P>
 Build an igloo in Canada: Why would anybody -- besides an Inuit, that is -- 
want to learn to build an igloo? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's odd and unusual, of course," says Trent Schumann of Calgary, 
Alberta-based Mountain Quest Adventure Co. "Most people come for the novelty. 
For back-country skiers interested in overnight touring, we offer a formalized 
course -- snow architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're staying in Calgary or at any Banff, Alberta-area resort (such as 
Lake Louise or Sunshine Village) and want to learn to build an igloo -- or snow 
cave or trench shelter -- Schumann will pick you up for a one-day or overnight 
excursion into the Kananaskis backcountry, about a half-hour south of Banff and 
a 75-minute drive from Calgary and Lake Louise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give them snowshoes, walk a few miles into the woods, pull out the snow 
shovels and snow saws and start building," Schumann explains. "Igloos are nicer 
than tents. It normally doesn't get much lower than freezing inside, which is 
pretty amazing, considering it can get down to 20 below zero outside. "  
</P>
<P>
 An igloo-building day trip is about $60, including tools, snowshoes, lunch and 
transportation. For about $143, an overnight trip adds supper, winter camping 
gear, breakfast and lunch. Tel. (800) ANY-TREK (269-8735).  
</P>
<P>
 Ups and downs of Squaw Valley: Forget 55-degree cliff runs -- you can get dead 
vertical and live to tell about it at Squaw Valley U.S.A., on the north shore 
of Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Bungee Squaw Valley is at the edge of a 500-foot precipice, adjacent to the 
High Camp Lodge at 8,200 feet. The platform is 75 feet up, and your fall is a 
maximum of 65 feet -- so there's at least 10 feet between you and the ground. 
The operation claims more than 15,000 jumps, by jumpers 10 to 87, with nary a 
nick. Ready to take the plunge? 
</P>
<P>
 Five, four, three, two . . . one jump is $40, additional jumps $15. Your leap 
on video is $20, photos $13-$15. Open daily from 11:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Tel. 
(916) 583-4000 . 
</P>
<P>
 Soaring over Telluride: The Peaks at Telluride, a Colorado hotel-spa complex 
and the town's only high-rise, boasts a small climbing wall. But another 
Telluride enterprise allows visitors to climb thousands of feet higher. "Glider 
Bob" Saunders takes you soaring above the town and ski area in his sail plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't confuse this activity with para-gliding, which involves a parachute, or 
hang-gliding, where you launch yourself off a cliff. "Hang-gliding is notorious 
for injuries," Saunders says. "Sail planes are safer than golf. The most 
dangerous part of an airplane is the motor, and we don't have one. There's 
nothing to go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The sleek craft -- there's space only for the pilot and one passenger -- is 
towed in the winter to an altitude of 12,000 to 13,000 feet and released. The 
high altitude might draw thrill-seekers, but Saunders says the quiet and 
scenery are the real attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Rides cost $75 for a half hour and $120 for an hour (times are approximate.) 
Telluride Soaring is located at the Telluride Regional Airport. Tel. (303) 
728-5424.  
</P>
<P>
 Park City jumps and daffies: With a bit of instruction, even "very timid, very 
nervous people" can handle ski jumps, says coach Larry Stone of the National 
Sports Foundation at Utah Winter Sports Park, site of the only recreational 
ski-jumping program in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," he adds, "Forget it if you've got a fear of heights -- better go 
cross-country skiing." 
</P>
<P>
 Lessons begin on itty-bitty snow bumps. First-timers can come away with an 
18-meter jump (about 40 feet), but that's length; they only get two or three 
feet off the ground. There's also a 38-meter jump, but the 65- and 90-meter 
competition jumps are reserved for the kind of daredevils made famous in the 
opening shots of ABC's "Wide World of Sports."  
</P>
<P>
 Stone says that in the park's freestyle-aerial program, skiers with "basic 
skills" can tackle such aerial moves as helicopters (a 360-degree spin), 
daffies (a walking motion) and splits. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics would seem to bear him out: Since the park opened in 1992, 
officials have logged only a handful of injuries, none serious, in thousands of 
jumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Lessons in distance jumping (Fridays to Sundays) and freestyle (Saturdays 
beginning Dec. 31) are $20 for adults, $12 for ages 13 through 17, $8 for 12 
and under. National Sports Foundation clinics take place from 1 to 3 p.m., with 
sign-ups at noon. Tel. (801) 645-7660 or (801) 649-5447.  
</P>
<P>
 Whooshing in Calgary: You don't need to go faster than a speeding bullet to 
feel like one at Canada Olympic Park in Calgary, built for the 1988 Winter 
Games. When you're blasting down the track only a few inches above the ice, 30 
miles an hour will do just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 To ride the luge, a one-person open sled, you put on a helmet and elbow pads, 
lie on your back and guide the sled feet-first for a 35-second ride down the 
bottom third of the Olympic track -- 500 yards with five curves. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can join three other people on a new self-steering, self-braking sled 
called the Bob Bullet, which rockets down the entire Olympic one-mile run at 
speeds of up to 60 miles per hour. Bullet riders are enclosed up to neck level 
in the padded sled and wear seat belts and helmets during the 1 1/2-minute

 Ice walking in Jasper: During the summer months, a prime attraction of Jasper 
National Park in Alberta, Canada, is a drive along the spectacular "Icefields 
Parkway," a 142-mile-long highway that passes dozens of glaciers. But for an 
up-close-and-personal glimpse of ice and snow when you're ready for a break 
from the slopes at nearby Marmot Basin Ski Area, it's tough to beat the park's 
Maligne Canyon Icewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Three magnificent frozen waterfalls -- the highest of which is 120 feet -- are 
the highlights of the three-hour walking tour, which is 1 1/2 miles each way 
and takes you past limestone formations and snow and into huge caverns along a 
frozen river at the bottom of a 150-foot-deep canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some years we can walk behind the falls, and it's as if you're in an ice 
cave, with an eerie bluish light," says park interpreter Murray Morgan.  
</P>
<P>
 The canyon is a half-hour drive from Marmot Basin, about four hours from 
either Calgary or Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 Jasper Adventure Center ice-walk tours begin at 10 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. Cost is 
about $16, $8 for children 6 to 12 and includes boot s , crampons to help 
prevent slipping, and local transportation. Tel. (403) 852-5595.  
</P>
<P>
 Slick driving in Steamboat: Get in a car and slide, skid and spin your way 
through a class on ice driving. And while you learn how not to lose control on 
the highway, you can enjoy the thrill of doing just that -- in a safe 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need to go fast to get your adrenaline up," says Mark Cox, manager 
of the Bridgestone Winter Driving School at Steamboat Springs, Colo. 
"Especially when you're going sideways."  
</P>
<P>
 Snow-banked guard rails "pardon" driver error on a mile-long road course with 
eight turns. Indoor classes explore concepts of car control in low-traction 
situations, such as on rain-soaked pavement.  
</P>
<P>
 "An L.A. off-ramp the first day it rained was one of the slipperiest 
situations I've ever encountered," Cox says. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-day, level-one session, at $90, includes about an hour of theory and 
two hours on the track. The one-day level-two course, $190, adds videotape 
analysis and more hands-on practice. Level three, a day-and-a-half-long course, 
is $340 and focuses on performance-oriented techniques. Phone (303) 879-6104 or 
(800) WHY-SKID (949-7543).

SAFETY; SKI PATROL TO THE RESCUE

 "Don't break a leg," my non-skiing friends would say as I headed off on a ski 
trip. "That's just a myth," I would respond, thinking they had been overly 
influenced by those New Yorker cartoons showing a skier with his leg in a cast 
sitting by the lodge fireplace with a glass of cognac in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I joined the Ski Patrol and learned that people do injure their legs 
while skiing -- and their arms, their heads and especially their knees and 
thumbs. Some even die. 
</P>
<P>
 Jasper E. Shealy, director of the Human Factors Laboratory at the Rochester 
Institute of Technology, has studied skiing injuries for 24 years. He estimates 
the United States' 10 million skiers suffer about 150,000 injuries each season, 
a third of them to the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Ski Areas Assn. reported in May that last season there were 84 
skiing accidents resulting in serious injuries, including 41 deaths, 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Shealy and industry sources have speculated that improvements in equipment and 
grooming of the snow to remove bumps and icy spots makes it easier for skiers 
to ski fast, which means they are more seriously injured when they fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Shealy says 85% of the people killed in skiing accidents are males, most in 
their late teens or early 20s -- the same age group with the highest death rate 
in automobile and industrial accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, injured skiers are assisted by professional rescuers who require 
payments for their services. In the United States, the National Ski Patrol, 
which is made up primarily of volunteers, provides this service free at most 
ski areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ski Patrol was founded in 1938 by Charles "Minnie" Dole, a skier who had 
been badly injured in a skiing accident and later lost a friend killed in a ski 
race.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Ski Patrol has 25,000 volunteers in 10 regional divisions and 2,000 
professionals registered in a separate pro division. Many of the professionals, 
who undergo the same first-aid training as the volunteers, work at the largest 
ski areas, especially in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of those people who can't conceive of a vacation without snow and 
skiing, I had always admired and envied the Ski Patrollers I watched at resorts 
all over the country. They wear cool uniforms (usually rust and blue for the 
volunteers), cut in front of the lift line and pull injured skiers down the 
slopes in toboggans. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until I joined that I realized they also spend a lot of time 
practicing first aid in the mud and rain before the ski season begins, carrying 
bamboo poles back and forth to mark trails and explaining to skiers why there 
are no bathrooms on the back side of the mountain. They have to be on duty at 
the top of the mountain before 8 a.m. to make sure everything is in order for 
skiers and after the lifts close late at night for "sweep," one last run down 
to look for stragglers. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrollers have also taken on more "law enforcement" duties because of an 
increase in lawsuits brought by injured skiers against ski areas during the 
'80s. Most resorts have developed risk-management programs with stricter rules 
against skiing out of bounds, jumping and reckless skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the endless training and testing in first aid, skiing and 
handling the toboggan used to bring injured skiers off the mountain -- 
including picking up the 60-pound fiberglass sled and carrying it on the chair 
lift. 
</P>
<P>
 Every ski area has its own rules and procedures for the Ski Patrol, which is 
run by volunteers but must abide by management's policies. Most ski-area 
managers realize that the Ski Patrol provides an invaluable service, and they 
reward its members with such perks as meal tickets and free lift tickets for 
family members. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step in becoming a patroller is usually a "ski-off" on the area's 
toughest slopes to choose candidates with the necessary skiing skills. The 
candidates who pass the ski-off then begin an intensive, 60- to 80-hour course 
similar to that taken by emergency medical technicians, but with more on skiing 
and cold-weather-related injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Once candidates have passed the course they begin "S & T," or ski and toboggan 
training. The culmination of the process is the dreaded "basic patroller" test 
of skiing and toboggan handling. Passing the test entitles the new patroller to 
wear that coveted rust-and-blue parka. 
</P>
<P>
 The test is grueling -- candidates tend to be on the mountain from early 
morning until mid-afternoon on the day of the test. But veterans point out that 
today's patrollers are really wimps: In the old days, the test culminated with 
a ritual in which all the new patrollers were required to climb the mountain -- 
with their skis on. 
</P>

PLAN TO EXPAND CRENSHAW REDEVELOPMENT NEARS VOTE; POLICY: PROPOSAL IS AIMED AT 
REVITALIZING RIOT-DAMAGED AREAS. BUT SOME COMMUNITY MEMBERS CALL IT UNWARRANTED 
GOVERNMENT INTRUSION. 
</P>

<P>
 A long-debated proposal to greatly expand the Crenshaw Redevelopment Project 
-- and spur new and controversial development to the area surrounding Baldwin 
Hills Crenshaw Plaza -- is scheduled to come before the Los Angeles City 
Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the city's Community Redevelopment Agency would increase the 
project area by more than 150 acres to encompass Leimert Park Village, Santa 
Barbara Plaza and areas along Crenshaw Boulevard. City officials would be 
empowered to use bond financing for redevelopment projects and eminent domain 
to condemn commercial properties that stand in the way of development. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is backed by Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, whose district includes 
the targeted area. Some community members, however, oppose it as unwarranted 
government intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment proposal arose after the 1992 riots leveled many 
neighborhoods, including some properties surrounding the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw 
Plaza. City officials said rebuilding could be accelerated through 
redevelopment laws and financing. A survey of the area surrounding the plaza 
identified enough properties to justify a larger redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would extend along Crenshaw between Coliseum and 52nd streets, 
Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard between Coliseum and McClung Drive, and along 
parts of Buckingham Road and Santa Rosalia Drive. Parts of Degnan Boulevard, 
Leimert Boulevard and 43rd Street north of Leimert Park would also be included. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the area, about a quarter of the buildings have vacancies and are 
deteriorated, said Bill Price, the agency's project manager. The area's crime, 
graffiti and neglected parcels also point to the need for redevelopment, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Barbara Plaza, once a major commercial retail center for the community, 
exhibits deteriorating conditions and underutilization of buildings and land," 
he told the city council last week. 
</P>
<P>
 During the discussion, Ridley Thomas urged colleagues to support the project. 
"Make no mistake about it, when we talk about the revitalization of this city, 
it seems to me that the effort aimed at revitalizing Crenshaw Boulevard and the 
surrounding areas is . . . simply essential," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were echoed by some area residents and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The redevelopment process is more than being for or against a project for 
political, personal or philosophical reasons. The redevelopment process is for 
guarding the future," said Aldrea Henry, part a 19-member citizens panel that 
reviewed the project. "And it is for this reason I stand before you . . . to 
say we need this project for the future of South Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried . . . rehabilitation through private funds," added Ray Clark, 
an area attorney and another member of the advisory panel who said he spent 
more than $150,000 to overhaul his law office building in 1983. "Redevelopment 
is needed in the Crenshaw Plaza," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as surely as some see redevelopment as the area's salvation, others have 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We applaud beautification throughout the Crenshaw Corridor," said Rodney 
Rumelsberg, whose wife inherited a property in the corridor. "We have a concern 
though . . . to make sure the purpose of this redevelopment is not to take from 
middle class property owners -- by emminent domain -- their property and give 
(it) to wealthy developers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activist Michelle Grumet said one goal of the project was to 
transform the area into a new transit corridor that -- like Metro Rail's 
Hollywood route -- will bring haphazard development that blights a neighborhood 
while profiting a few landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project is not about recovery. This project is about Metro Rail. This 
project is about the transportation corridors and the General Plan of the city, 
where they want high-density development," Grumet said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the redevelopment agency says 19 properties in the area were damaged in 
the riots, it ignores the fact that the number is a fraction of the area's 283 
individual lots and 250 structures, Grumet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few buildings that are really blighted . . . most of the 
problems in Crenshaw could be fixed up. You don't need the CRA," she said. "But 
this is happening because the city and the CRA need the tax increment funds, 
they need the money. The city is in financial difficulty. And this is a way to 
bail it out."

HATE CRIMES STIR FEAR IN ISLAMIC COMMUNITY; MUSLIMS ARE CONCERNED OVER RISE IN 
ATTACKS AIMED AT THEM IN RESPONSE TO EXTREMISTS' ACTIONS ABROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Over a sea of bowed heads during a recent religious service at the Islamic 
Center of Southern California, the words of the sermon lingered heavily as 
solemn worshipers absorbed the message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Islam is a burden," the speaker admonished the multiracial crowd. "But do not 
ask Allah to lighten your burden. Ask Allah instead to strengthen your back." 
</P>
<P>
 The message could not come at a better time. In the wake of two recent arson 
attacks on Islamic mosques -- one in September in Yuba City in Northern 
California, another in October in New York -- the local Islamic community is 
trying to steel itself against a rising fear of hate crimes directed at 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent terrorist acts committed by Muslims in the Middle East, such as the 
fatal Oct. 19 bombing of a Tel Aviv bus, coupled with American media coverage 
many in the Islamic community perceive as portraying their religion in a 
negative light, have Muslims throughout Los Angeles fearing further acts of 
retaliation aimed at them in response to other people's crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not condone violence, even if it is in the name of God. Yet every time 
you hear the terms 'Islamic militant,' 'Islamic fundamentalist,' and 'Islamic 
terrorist,' we become targets," said Aslam Abdullah, editor of The Minaret, a 
nationally distributed magazine published by the Islamic Center, which is 
located in the Wilshire area. 
</P>
<P>
 A fresh wave of hate mail and threatening phone calls have flooded the center 
lately, Abdullah said. A bomb threat three months ago forced staff to evacuate 
the building, including more than 60 young children who participate in the 
center's preschool through first-grade program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that it's very frightening, knowing these things can 
happen and do happen," said Jasser Hathout, an Egyptian immigrant whose two 
children attend the Islamic Center school. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the center's congregation, one of the largest in Los 
Angeles with close to 1,500 members, have also reported incidents of verbal 
harassment on the street, on college campuses, and in other public places. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate calls to the center peaked after the Nov. 21 KCET presentation of "Jihad 
in America," a documentary about extremist Muslims that was criticized by the 
Islamic community as having perpetuated unfavorable Muslim stereotypes.  
</P>
<P>
 The Public Broadcasting Service defended the film as balanced and meticulously 
documented. But Mona Hathout, who shares her husband's concern for their 
children's safety, saw it as yet another drop of fuel added to years of press 
coverage feeding anti-Muslim sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, it's the extremist elements that are newsworthy," she said. 
"Your average American Muslims who go about their business, take their kids to 
school and go to work, they're not newsworthy. So what ends up happening is 
that you don't get a balanced presentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mid-1980s, crimes of bigotry against Muslims and Middle Eastern 
immigrants -- including physical attacks, vandalism, and phone threats -- have 
been reported throughout Los Angeles County, increasing each time there is an 
international incident in which Muslims play a negative role. 
</P>
<P>
 According to reports compiled by the county's Commission on Human Relations, 
the most dramatic increase in anti-Muslim hate crimes, not including verbal 
harassment, occurred during the Persian Gulf conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Although local acts of hostility against Muslims have been on the downswing 
since, the recent harrassment experienced by the Islamic Center, other Islamic 
religious and cultural centers and individual Muslims is being heralded as a 
sign that anti-Muslim activity in Southern California is again on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The swell of anti-immigrant sentiment that carried Proposition 187 to victory 
last month also has local Muslims worried, since a large number of the 200,000 
Muslims living in Los Angeles County are nonwhite immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is shattering the American dream for a lot of Muslim families who came 
here fleeing persecution, only to find themselves discriminated against," said 
Salam Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in 
mid-Wilshire. 
</P>
<P>
 The council wants to create a greater voice for Muslims in Los Angeles, 
encouraging them to report hate crimes to authorities and become involved in 
efforts to set the record straight on Islam in the eyes of the general public 
through community outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council holds regular interfaith discussions with leaders from 
other religions, greater outreach must be done through schools and city 
government in order to dispel the myth that associates Islam with political 
extremism, Al-Marayati said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to see the positive side of Islam, that our charities go to 
the homeless and needy, and that we are taxpayers like every other American," 
he said. "Our whole mission is to integrate American Muslims into society, and 
it's mainly a problem of overcoming powerlessness." 
</P>
<P>
 One goal is to network with other Islamic groups throughout the state, 
encouraging them to also pursue greater interaction with mainstream society. 
Another is to fund a system for documenting and analyzing anti-Muslim hate 
crimes, Al-Marayati said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Abdullah, some local Muslims have become reluctant to frequent 
mosques and other Islamic gathering places out of fear of victimization, with 
several younger Muslims going so far as to change their names, and women 
adopting Western dress. 
</P>
<P>
 But many others, like Sri Lankan immigrant Nabila Idroos, continue their 
normal routines and maintain their traditions with a bit of caution and 
unyielding faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't always worry about what's going to happen in the future," she said 
cheerfully, her hair covered by a white scarf. "We just trust in God and go on 
with our lives."

PARALEGALS STATE THEIR CASE; 'LEGAL TECHNICIANS' OFFER A LOW-COST ALTERNATIVE, 
BUT ARE STILL THE TARGET OF LAWYERS, BAR ASSOCIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't that long ago, perhaps a little more than a decade, that Lois 
Isenberg used to keep her mouth shut at parties. Not about everything, just 
about what she did for a living. It seemed that whenever she mentioned that she 
was an independent paralegal, an attorney would step forward and begin a nasty 
verbal assault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until the 1980s, it was always an underground movement," Isenberg said. 
"We had to be quite circumspect about what we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg may still be cautious, but she is no longer so circumspect. As 
president of the California Assn. of Independent Paralegals (CAIP), and head of 
a mid-Wilshire paralegal firm, Isenberg fronts a growing movement to grant 
independent paralegals greater authority to provide legal services. She has 
faced powerful opposition from local, county and state bar associations, which 
view her and her compatriots as engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and 
a threat to business, and which have prosecuted independent paralegals in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 To some attorneys, Isenberg and her colleagues are better suited to their 
traditional roles of typing or doing research under the supervision of lawyers, 
where the paralegals don't run the risk of overextending their legal expertise 
and where they don't pose an an economic threat to them.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite such opposition, independent paralegals -- or "legal technicians," 
as they are also called -- are flourishing, and in the past decade have greatly 
expanded their portfolio and presence.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, paralegals -- both independent ones and those who work for lawyers -- 
were projected by the U.S. Department of Labor to make up the nation's 
fastest-growing profession. Today, there are more than 3,000 independent 
paralegals statewide, in addition to the more than 10,000 traditional 
paralegals working in law firms. And whereas 20 years ago few Californians got 
divorced or declared bankruptcy without lawyers, 70% of divorces and 
bankruptcies in some smaller counties are now filed without attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made great sense to do it this way," said Culver City financial planner 
Gael Kennedy, who used independent paralegals for two divorces. "(The divorces) 
were just a matter of, 'How do you do the paperwork?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Love, a Rancho Cucamonga fund-raising executive who with her husband 
arranged an adoption, a child custody case and his divorce from a previous 
spouse through paralegals, agreed. "As long as you don't try to do something 
complicated, you really don't need legal representation." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the newfound prominence in the use and number of independent 
paralegals has been fueled by one simple factor: economics. At $150 an hour and 
up, most people find lawyers' fees out of reach and overpriced for simple legal 
needs such as divorces, landlord-tenant disputes, guardianships and immigration 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 When a client knows what he or she wants, Isenberg said, such matters usually 
can be resolved by having an independent paralegal type and file the proper 
documents and then letting the legal system take its course, often for about 
one-third the cost of a lawyer. According to Kennedy, her divorces cost 
one-fifth of what they would have if she used attorneys. Love's paralegal fees 
for all three services totaled about $700. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't get an attorney for less than $150 an hour and with a $2,000 
retainer, you can use that up overnight," said Richard Lubetzky, a Beverly 
Hills attorney and a director of CalJustice, a nonprofit consumer legal reform 
association.  
</P>
<P>
 For Isenberg, the role of paralegal activist is not one she had envisioned 
when she entered the profession in 1973. A producer of educational films, 
Isenberg was asked to lend her marketing skills to a paralegal opening a 
divorce firm in Santa Monica. But after a week, Isenberg said, the paralegal 
"got up from her desk, walked to the door and said, 'I don't want to do this. 
This business is yours.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg, who was between films, grabbed at the chance to enter the emerging 
profession. After learning the basics of divorce form preparation from 
attorneys and other paralegals, she opened a business in her Los Angeles home, 
operating for several years on referrals. In 1980, Isenberg moved to her 
present offices on Wilshire Boulevard, but still kept a low profile, fearing 
reprisals from local and state bar associations, which have prosecuted 
paralegals for "UPL," or unfair practice of law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a little ad in the Yellow Pages and that was it," Isenberg said. "It 
was difficult at that time to be doing what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the help of sympathetic attorneys who were promoting mediation as an 
alternative for divorcing couples, Isenberg cautiously expanded into other 
types of legal assistance. Now, in addition to child support, custody and 
marital settlements, Isenberg's office prepares paperwork for adoptions, 
paternity suits and quitclaim deeds. Two years ago, Isenberg became president 
of CAIP, a 6-year-old organization that has since doubled its membership to 200 
paralegals. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while lawyers and representatives of bar associations say they regret that 
attorneys' fees have become prohibitive, they also say that paralegals are not 
the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the mission is to deliver low-cost legal help for the middle-class and 
poor, there are better solutions than this one," said P. Terry Anderlini, a San 
Mateo attorney and a past president of the state bar. "We don't need to set up 
a bureaucracy to license mini-lawyers who don't deliver a quality product to 
their clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderlini says that while independent paralegals may have knowledge in narrow 
fields of the law, the problems of clients can invoke a larger web of legal 
complicity. A simple divorce, he said, may involve other legal issues, such as 
trusts and estate planning, which may or may not be in the purview of 
paralegals. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't come into your office and have their problems in a nice, neat 
legal box," said Anderlini, who proposes the introduction of low-cost legal 
clinics staffed by paralegals and overseen by attorneys in lieu of paralegals 
being given greater autonomy. "You have to be cross-trained to know and 
identify legal issues."  
</P>
<P>
 With this, Isenberg says she has little disagreement. Paralegals, she said, 
are bound by law not to provide any information other than what forms to use to 
proceed in certain civil matters. If matters become more complicated, said 
Isenberg, she refers clients to a trusted cadre of lawyers, and indeed, good 
paralegals know when they need to step back. Isenberg herself supports the 
notion of having paralegals pass qualifying tests before they can begin 
practicing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the muddy issue of what constitutes legal advice is what has 
entangled independent paralegals with bar associations. In fact, one state bar 
committee charged with examining the role and possible regulation of "legal 
technicians" concluded that the concept was "undefinable." Yet the upshot, 
Isenberg said, is that the door is open for qualified paralegals to be 
prosecuted on an array of technicalities. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, she said, a paralegal was accused of giving legal advice 
because, among other things, she instructed a client to sign documents in black 
ink. In others, paralegals have been sued by bar associations for providing 
forms and legal self-help guides. 
</P>
<P>
 To Isenberg, the real source of attorneys' ire is the same reason clients use 
paralegals: the paralegals' relatively low fees. Isenberg says lawyers fear 
losing business if independent paralegals are allowed to operate freely in the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally a turf war," she said. "They just see it as someone taking their 
(business)."  
</P>
<P>
 That notion is disputed by Anderlini, who says that the fields paralegals work 
in do not usually appeal to many attorneys. "I think (a turf war) is the way 
independent paralegals would like to see it," Anderlini said. "But the vast 
majority of practitioners I know don't see these matters as moneymakers." 
</P>
<P>
 But Don Fischbach, president of the state bar, concedes that while some of the 
complaints he fields from fellow attorneys regarding paralegals concern the 
unfair practice of law issue, other lawyers do "see it solely as a turf war."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; POSTERS TRACE HISTORY OF BLACK PANTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Until the lions have their historians, tales of hunting will always glorify 
the hunter.  
</P>
<P>
 This African proverb acts as a bookend to "All Power to the People," a 
showcase of protest posters, graphics, newspapers and government documents 
produced during the height of the Black Panther Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Compiled by the West Los Angeles-based Center for the Study of Political 
Graphics, the 94-piece exhibition is at the Southern California Library for 
Social Studies and Research, 6120 S. Vermont Ave., through Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't understand the present if we don't understand history," said Carol 
Wells, one of the founders of the center and curator of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we really want to understand history, we have to look at these posters." 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old library and the center are nonprofit operations that collect 
material on social struggles and political movements. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition, which borrows its name from a 1969 poster by Black Panther 
artist Emory Douglas, takes the viewer on a historical tour from the beginnings 
of the party to its triumphant days of political empowerment and its demise 
through government intervention and intra-party splintering. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the issues that the Panthers tried to struggle against -- racism, 
illiteracy, health care, hunger -- are still issues today that need to be 
confronted," Wells said. "This is a show of what the Panthers wanted to 
accomplish and what happened to them. We are providing an introduction of what 
they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Scenes of police brutality and racial violence captured on film or depicted by 
artists hang side-by-side, testament to the volatility of an era of black 
political empowerment that followed the 1965 Watts riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Part 1 of the series, "A Call to Arms," outlines how the party was modeled 
after the Community Alert Patrol, a watchdog organization formed to protect 
black citizens of Watts from unlawful police actions. Founded by Huey Newton 
and Bobby Seale, the Black Panther Party called on its members to bear weapons 
for self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The notorious 1970 poster of Newton in Panther garb, sitting in a peacock 
chair wielding an African spear in one hand and a machine gun in the other, 
opens the second series, "Serving the People." Eighteen posters and other media 
report the party's political ambitions, from free medical health clinics to a 
grocery giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other sections depict how the party grew and then was dismantled by 
violence and government subversion. FBI documents obtained through the Freedom 
of Information Act hang as evidence of government action to stymie the party's 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Struggle Continues," the last portion of the display, brings the party to 
the present with poster No. 90, "Free Geronimo Pratt." Pratt, who was the 
party's deputy minister of defense and head of the South-Central chapter, is 
serving a life sentence in the 1968 killing of a schoolteacher and the wounding 
of her husband. Pratt has steadfastly maintained that he was elsewhere at the 
time of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Panthers split in 1970, Wells said, Pratt was forgotten during his 
trial by infighting party members.  
</P>
<P>
 "When we do these (types of) exhibits, we don't expect people to agree. There 
are different ways in seeing the world," Wells said. "In collecting these 
posters, we are the historians for the 'lions.' " ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: WATTS; PROJECT'S DAY CARE CENTER EASES WORRIES 
</P>

<P>
 Adrienne Harvey, 8, never much liked going to work with mom. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing her homework, "I used to sit there, eat breakfast, eat lunch. 
. . . Sometimes I'd draw and color," Adrienne said, recalling the days spent 
waiting for her mother, Janetta, to end her shift as program manager at 
Nickerson Gardens Residents Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Those days are over. Adrienne is now one of 70 children who attend Nickerson 
Gardens' recently opened SAGE Before and After School Child Care Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel comfortable bringing (my children) to work. Now, I'm more 
relaxed," said Janetta Harvey, a 10-year resident. "I can concentrate on my 
work, which is very important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The center is specifically designed to help the housing development's single 
working mothers like Harvey, who must juggle her schedule to attend to the 
needs of Adrienne and her 12-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is the brainchild of Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who has 
advocated such centers for the six housing projects in her district. The U.S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, the largest government contributor 
to the project, only had money for one. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the biggest needs I have learned about in housing developments is a 
need for child care," said Waters, who enlisted the help of more than a dozen 
federal, state and local agencies for the implementation of SAGE. "We have many 
single mothers who would like to get off of welfare and get a job or get an 
education, but they don't have a place to take their children." 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployment rate at Nickerson Gardens is 60%, compared to Los Angeles 
County's 7.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $1 million in public funding sources were used in the making of the 
center, including a contribution of $500,000 worth of prefabricated buildings 
from the state Department of Education. HUD awarded a $95,000 grant to the 
Black Women's Forum, a nonprofit group that aims to empower black women 
economically and politically, to coordinate the implementation of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal Stairs, a nonprofit child development agency based in South Los 
Angeles, manages the center, which has 14 staff members. But in two or three 
years, management will be turned over to Nickerson Gardens residents, six of 
whom are undergoing training, said Gathoni Maina, the center's director and an 
accomplished artist.  
</P>
<P>
 SAGE operates out of six bungalows. There are also two playgrounds and 
computers for the children, who are 5 to 12 years old. They are exposed to 
diverse cultures through art, dance and discussions, and are encouraged to 
participate in sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "SAGE believes in offering children a range of activities that will help 
children know how to make choices," Maina said. "I grew up in Kenya and was 
exposed to many cultures. At the center, that's what the children are learning, 
not just about the U.S.A, California or South-Central." 
</P>
<P>
 In the art room, the walls, ceilings, tables -- everything but the floor -- 
are covered with the children's handmade art projects. 
</P>
<P>
 They spend an average of three hours a day in this room, said Rosie Garcia, 
the center's art teacher. "The concept here is hands-on art," Garcia said. "We 
even have parents who come here and don't want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 The center also has arranged for Loyola Marymount University students to tutor 
the children with their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Hawkins, 30, a single parent of two, said she couldn't afford private 
child care and believed she needed an education to better care for her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the center wasn't here, I would be totally lost," said Hawkins, who is 
pursuing a nursing degree at Southwest College. "I need this break. Now I don't 
have to worry about (my children) at all." ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; LIBRARY OFFERS 3 NEW CARD CATALOGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRETT MAHONEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Koreatown branch has been doing it for years -- Chinatown's too. The 
Little Tokyo branch hadn't started yet but was considering it. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Los Angeles Public Library got the hint and introduced catalogue 
cards in Korean, Chinese and Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Public Library has one of the nation's largest popular 
collections of Asian language books and materials. But to find them with the 
card catalogue, patrons had to stumble through phonetic, English or Romanized 
translations of Asian titles, authors and subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Jae Min Roh, Koreatown's branch librarian, said that his patrons, 60% of whom 
speak Korean, ignored the Romanized card catalogue. Korean books that had 
phonetic translations on their spines usually went untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm familiar with the system and it was even difficult for me to understand 
the Romanized titles," Roh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanized pronunciations usually correspond to more than one Asian character 
and can carry more than one meaning.  
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the difficulty that his patrons were experiencing, Roh and his staff 
began preparing their own catalogue cards using Korean characters. In the last 
five to six years they have written nearly 3,000 of their own cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinatown branch took it a step further. Its staff, who said more than 
half of their 800 daily patrons speak Chinese, began creating their own 
Chinese-character card catalogue in the late 1970s. But during the '80s they 
joined the computer age and began electronically printing their Chinese-symbol 
catalogue cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our patrons created a computer program which allowed us to do it," 
said Carol Duan, the branch librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the lead of the branch libraries, the library administration began 
issuing catalogue cards using the Asian language symbols in July, said Violet 
Kuroki, head of the catalogue department.  
</P>
<P>
 The branch libraries have recently begun to use the official cards. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Little Tokyo branch library, where 90% of the patrons speak Japanese, 
the staff had not created their own card catalogue but were happy to receive 
the new cards prepared by the library administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives (the patrons) more independence and control. Now they can browse 
through the catalogue without having to ask the professional staff for help," 
said Susan Thompson, branch librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is to get the Asian symbols on-line. The public library's 
technical services staff is working on updating the automated circulation 
system and computerized catalogue to display Chinese, Japanese and Korean 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Little Tokyo branch is at 600 E. 3rd St. (213) 612-0525. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Koreatown branch is at 2613 W. Olympic Blvd. (213) 381-1453. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Chinatown branch is at 536 W. College St. (213) 620-0925. BRETT MAHONEY

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; RENOVATION TO BRING STORES, 300 NEW 
JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major renovation of the sprawling Angelus Furniture Warehouse will bring a 
new grocery store and drugstore to the area, as well as 300 jobs in 
construction and retail. 
</P>
<P>
 The $9.5-million Angelus Grand Plaza development came about in a partnership 
between Angelus' owner and the East Los Angeles Community Union (TELACU). 
</P>
<P>
 Renovation will begin in January to make room for a Food 4 Less supermarket, a 
Sav-On drugstore and a Chief Auto Parts. Angelus will continue operating its 
retail business there during construction and will eventually occupy the entire 
50,000-square-foot second floor, increasing its space by 30,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Irwin Greenberg, 61, who has done everything in the family business from 
warehouse jobs to driving trucks, said the renovation project will be the 
highlight of his career. Greenberg has worked at Angelus, started in Downtown 
by his grandfather Harry Siskin in 1901, since he was 11.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is the thing that I'm most proud of," said Greenberg, whose daughters 
and sons-in-law are also involved with Angelus and other family-owned furniture 
stores in Huntington Beach and Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The 220,000-square-foot building sits on 5.5 acres at 3650 Olympic Blvd. amid 
manufacturing plants and warehouses. It can be seen from afar with its red 
circled "A" on its tower. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, glider wings were manufactured at the plant in addition 
to furniture. The furniture was sold only to decorators and retailers until 
after the war, when the company's manufacturing jobs were moved to North 
Carolina and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, the company merged with W.J. Sloan and was bought out by Beck 
Industries in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 But Greenberg wanted to get back into the furniture business his family had 
started, so he bought the company back in 1973 and then most of the property 
nine years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with reports that show East Los Angeles residents traveling out of the 
area to do most of their shopping because of the lack of retail stores and 
supermarkets, Greenberg and his family sought help with financing the 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-story section of the building that connects two two-story sections will 
be torn down and converted into a courtyard, and escalators will be added. A 
walkway on the outside of the building and smaller retail shops will also be 
constructed, as well as a parking structure in the back lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase, which includes the supermarket, drugstore and auto parts 
store, has been financed with the help of grants from the U.S. federal 
Department of Housing and Urban Development and by RLA, formerly Rebuild L.A. 
The nonprofit development group helped secure the financing from banks even 
though Greenberg said some still expressed uncertainty about the business 
prospects in the East Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Southern California economy is still one of the worst in the 
United States today," he said, "but I believe there are pockets here and there 
that can, if developed properly, be very profitable, and East L.A. is one of 
them." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; FAMILIES PROGRAM NEEDS DONATIONS

<P>
 The Latino Family Preservation Program, an effort started by the county 
Department of Children's Services to keep families intact and out of the foster 
care system, needs donations of Christmas toys, food and money for its third 
annual Christmas party.  
</P>
<P>
 The party will be held Dec. 21 at the program's offices, 2501 Davidson 
Drive.Food baskets, toys and a visit from Santa Claus will be provided for 400 
children in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino Family Preservation Program serves East Los Angeles, Boyle Heights 
and City Terrace, areas where a high number of children are referred for 
emergency shelter and foster care, said Director Alfonso Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very poor kids in this area, so we are trying to have a very nice 
and significant day for them this Christmas," Garcia said. "The kids really 
enjoy it. It's something they really look forward to." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the task of the social workers and therapists who work with the 
families in crisis is to make sure basic needs are met, such as help with 
paying an electric bill or getting food in the cupboard. The program is 
currently helping 1,200 children in 400 families, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to keep some of the emergency needs from disrupting family life," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the program worked with more than 1,000 children. Garcia believes 
many would have gone into foster care if not for counseling, emergency food and 
parent education provided by its social workers.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: MOUNT WASHINGTON; A GARDEN BLOOMS AT SOUTHWEST MUSEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A patch of dirt still occupies the space where fruits and vegetables will grow 
next spring, but the rest of the ethno-botanical garden at the Southwest Museum 
is thriving with native vegetation that will be used as a teaching tool for 
visiting schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in January, docents will guide students through the garden that 
occupies a hill on the east side of the museum, teaching them how Native 
Americans used plants such as sage, yucca, prickly pear cactus, pinon pine and 
deer grass for medicines, baskets, tools, dyes and food. 
</P>
<P>
 The garden is divided by railroad ties, and a path leads to seven different 
North American environments where mostly California native plants have been 
placed. A desert section includes cactus, lupine and yucca, while the bog area 
has a pond planted with tulle and cattail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a swamp!" said fifth-grade students visiting last week from Kenmore 
Elementary School in Baldwin Park. Others declared, "It's a swimming pool." 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrating the use of a certain yucca plant, Barbara Arvi, curator of 
education, took strips of a leaf and pounded it between two stones until the 
flesh had broken away, revealing long fibers that can be tied together to make 
a paintbrush.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the things they did you can see comes out of their plants," Arvi told 
the students, holding up the fibers.  
</P>
<P>
 Special care must be taken with some of the plants to show how people used 
them in everyday life. Deer grass, for example, must be pruned a certain way to 
produce the plumage used for the inner cordage, or foundation, of baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 With $60,000 in donations and volunteer labor, the garden has taken root over 
the last three months. But now the money has run out, and Arvi hopes to find 
new resources to complete the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 She hopes to plant a vegetable and fruit garden that students can study and 
harvest, with Native American red, blue, pink and speckled corn. Each section 
of the garden will have a learning station where children can put their 
knowledge to work with the help of docents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be pounding acorns and grinding corn, so the kids can actually see 
the use of these plants," Arvi said.  
</P>
<P>
 The garden will expand the number of visitors the 80-year-old museum can hold, 
giving some of the students a chance to roam while others tour the inside. One 
of the reasons for the garden, in addition to its educational value, was to 
accommodate the 60% of children who are turned away from the museum each year 
because of a lack of space, Arvi said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35,000 children visit the museum each year, and another 10,000 will be 
able to visit once the garden is open to the public, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The museum, at 234 Museum Drive, is open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Tuesday through 
Sunday.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: LEIMERT PARK; NETWORK LINKS TEENS IN U.S., S. AFRICA 
</P>

<P>
 The boys asked one another about school, teachers, what's in fashion and one 
another's favorite music -- a typical conversation between high school students 
who have just met. 
</P>
<P>
 This one, though, was unfolding over thousands of miles. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kaos Network, a coffeehouse-style arts center in Leimert Park, seven 
African American teen-agers spent a morning querying their South African 
counterparts about everything from hairstyles to South Africa's shifting 
political landscape via videophone. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephone and video hookup, set up between Los Angeles and Grahamstown, 
South Africa, allowed the students to exchange words and images. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look like one of the guys in (the rap group) Kris Kross!" exclaimed 
Bongani Noyikwa after seeing the black-and-white image of Chris Bailey, a 
Westchester High School senior sporting an oversize jacket and close-cropped 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the laughter that broke out around the room, Bailey replied, "Well, if I 
was, I would have a lot more money and live someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
 Miles Griffith, a student at the Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies, a 
Westside high school, took the microphone to ask Mfuzo Nano what he thought of 
newly elected South African President Nelson Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, great!" Nano said enthusiastically. "Mandela, he is the king of kings." 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural exchange was staged by the Southern Africa Education Campaign, a 
Washington-based organization begun last year that sponsors educational and 
cultural events for Americans and Africans here and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign seeks to promote stronger American ties with South Africa and 
neighboring countries such as Angola, Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, 
Lesotho, Mozambique and Swaziland. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaos founder and filmmaker Ben Caldwell provided the videophone communication 
for the session. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign coordinator Lisa Cannon said she wants to ensure that the attention 
centered on South Africa's recent historic elections does not fade in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to lose impetus in the interest in Africa," she said. "Too many 
images of Africa kids see on TV here are negative -- war, poverty, abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The students chosen to connect with the South African group are in the Los 
Angeles Community Outreach Program, an independent college preparatory and 
motivational program. 
</P>
<P>
 Program founder and director Clifford Brazil said there is much that his 
students -- the majority of whom are from central Los Angeles -- can learn from 
their South African peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are parallels they can make to our own society," he said. "We are 
beyond certain struggles that they haven't gotten through yet. Talking to 
people in another part of the world puts things in a different context." 
</P>
<P>
 Zosukuma Kunene, 18, startled the South African group when he sat down at the 
microphone and started speaking in a rapid mix of English and Zulu. "My parents 
are South African, but I was born in London, after my father was exiled," said 
Kunene, who grew up in View Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been there since the eighth grade. . . .I'm still not sure if I 
want to live in South Africa, but I do plan to go to school there for a 
semester." 
</P>
<P>
 Although students easily discovered that they listened to the same reggae 
bands and shared a disdain for school uniforms, more complex issues sometimes 
left both groups at an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nano asked Charity Bailey what she considered herself -- black, African 
American or simply American -- the 17-year-old hesitated and answered black. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey asked Nano if he considered black Americans to be true African 
brethren? 
</P>
<P>
 Nano hesitated, then his reply came crackling over the mike. "I consider you 
all to be Americans, equal to all other Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 That, said Bailey instantly, would be nice, "but it's not true. . . .We are 
not equal as you say." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; PLAZA REPORTS BRISK AFTER-HOLIDAY SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the heels of the recent opening of a T.J. Maxx discount clothing outlet, 
anchor stores at Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza reported higher sales and 
increased foot traffic the weekend after Thanksgiving, traditionally the year's 
biggest weekend for sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Marj Aldolph, general manager of Sears, described sales figures as "superb" -- 
22% higher than last Thanksgiving weekend.She attributed the success to the 
store's recent $2.5-million face lift and its proximity to the adjacent T.J. 
Maxx. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Robinsons-May and the Broadway reported improved sales over last year, 
said plaza marketing director Linda Gray.  
</P>
<P>
 T.J. Maxx, part of the national retail chain that sells discounted name-brand 
clothing and other items, opened at the plaza Nov. 15. And foot traffic has 
been consistently busy since the opening, said store manager Yun Conger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing a steady increase of people in here now," Conger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Day manager Yendas Harper said that while foot traffic has indeed been good, 
it has yet to compare with more established T.J. Maxx locations such as the one 
at Del Amo Fashion Center in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of T.J. Maxx, which occupies six upper-level storefronts, boosts 
mall occupancy from 68% to 85%. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Bruning, vice president of the mall's developer, Alexander Haagen 
Properties, said holiday sales are already 25% over last year.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; AZALEA FESTIVAL WON'T MOVE TO MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mariachis won't be competing with azaleas after all. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has unanimously decided against moving the 30-year-old Azalea 
Festival from March to May and making it part of a Cinco de Mayo celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the council has scrapped plans altogether for a city-sponsored Cinco 
de Mayo celebration, bowing to concerns it would shortchange other ethnic 
groups in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy with the council's decision to keep our festival," said 
Mildred Ward, 75, this year's Azalea Queen. "I love mariachis and Spanish 
stuff, but I don't think it should rob the city of our traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival -- azalea is the city's official flower -- honors women over 60 
and includes the selection of a queen and her court. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the council discussed organizing a Cinco de Mayo festival to 
recognize the city's predominantly Latino population. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, city staff members recommended incorporating the festival into a 
celebration of Cinco de Mayo, which commemorates the anniversary of the Mexican 
victory over the French in the city of Puebla on May 5, 1862. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cinco de Mayo is hardly celebrated in Mexico, it is an important 
holiday for Americans of Mexican descent. 
</P>
<P>
 Objections to the move were raised by Azalea Festival supporters and some who 
charged that the council was being partial to Mexican events at the expense of 
the city's other ethnic groups, such as Salvadorans and Guatemalans. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already holds a carnival on Sept. 16, Mexican independence day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this decision means the council is becoming more sensitive to the 
entire community, and not just to Mexicans," said Victorio Gutierrez, a teacher 
at South Gate High School who opposed the Cinco de Mayo celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to allocate $5,000 toward the Azalea Festival 
organizing committee. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; CITY UNVEILS BUSTS OF KENNEDY, COLOSIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dignitaries poured in from all over Mexico: the tycoon from Baja 
California, the mayor from tiny Copandro in the heart of the country, the aging 
patriarch from the northern border town of Magdalena de Kino in Sonora state. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Enrique Loaeza Tovar, Mexico's consul general in Los Angeles, came to 
Bell Gardens for the long-awaited unveiling of the bronze busts of two slain 
political leaders revered in the Latino community: Luis Donaldo Colosio and 
John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to strengthen ties between the predominantly Latino city and 
Mexico, the City Council decided to commemorate the eight-month anniversary of 
the assassination of Colosio, who was the leading presidential candidate when 
he was gunned down in Tijuana on a campaign stop. 
</P>
<P>
 A 23-year-old factory worker was convicted of the killing in October and 
sentenced to 42 years in prison amid suspicion he did not act alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colosio was viewed as a reformer and that's why they killed him; we have to 
make people aware of that," said Councilman Rudy Garcia, who organized the 
effort to purchase the busts, which are in the City Hall lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to honor Kennedy, who, as the nation's first Roman 
Catholic President, is well respected among Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nov. 22 ceremony at City Hall coincided with the 31st anniversary of 
Kennedy's assassination in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said the city had planned to consign the two busts from the sculptors 
who designed images of the slain president for the Kennedy Museum in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did some shopping around and found they were asking between $6,000 and 
$7,000 per bust," Garcia said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We thought the price kind of high, so we decided to ask sculptors in Mexico. 
. . . It just made sense considering the makeup of our city." 
</P>
<P>
 According to 1990 census figures, 87% of Bell Gardens' 42,300 residents are 
Latino, the vast majority of them of Mexican heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city searched for a competitive price south of the border, it 
received an offer it found hard to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of Michoacan in central Mexico offered to donate a free Colosio bust 
if Bell Gardens agreed to purchase a separate bust of Kennedy from an area 
sculptor. The city paid $3,500 to Jose Luis Padilla, a sculptor from Morelia, 
Michoacan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a large number of colosistas (former Colosio followers) who still 
feel strongly about the man in Michoacan, especially in Morelia," said Miguel 
Escobar, press attache at the Los Angeles consulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Five officials from Michoacan, including three mayors, traveled north for the 
unveiling. Also in attendance were Colosio's father, Luis Colosio Fernandez, 
and Colosio's sister, Laura Colosio Murrieta. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an outpouring of serene reflection that day; it was as if one were 
in Mexico it was so impressive," Escobar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio's widow, economist Diana Laura Riojas de Colosio, died of 
complications from pancreatic cancer earlier this month in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colosio was a potential hero in the making, just like Kennedy," Garcia said. 
"Now we know that anyone who speaks out of turn with that kind of power is 
bound to get snuffed out." SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: WILSHIRE; LAWYERS AID CHILDREN AFFECTED BY AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Very often, those most vulnerable to the impact of HIV and AIDS are children 
who have the illness or whose parents are infected.  
</P>
<P>
 Orphaned or at risk of losing one or both parents, and sometimes suffering 
discrimination because of their own medical condition, these children are often 
in critical need of legal assistance. To help meet this need, two organizations 
dealing with children affected by HIV/AIDS launched a project last week to help 
them with their sometimes overwhelming legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is the Los Angeles Pediatric AIDS Network, a collaborative venture 
of the Wilshire-based Alliance for Children's Rights and the Los Angeles 
Pediatric AIDS Network.  
</P>
<P>
 Called L.A. PALS, the project consists of a network of more than 400 volunteer 
attorneys from the Los Angeles area who will assist low-income juvenile clients 
with issues such as legal guardianship and adoption, health care problems, 
access to Social Security benefits and services, civil rights, foster care, 
special education and blocked trusts, all at no cost. 
</P>
<P>
 General income limits for eligibility are: $18,265 for a family of one (such 
as a child who has been orphaned but was left a trust account or life 
insurance); $20,887 for a family of two; $23,475 for a family of three, and 
$26,100 for a family of four. 
</P>
<P>
 Families with income levels surpassing the general limits are also welcome, 
project manager Brenda O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to ensure that all kids have legal representation," she said. "We'll 
make referrals for families who can afford legal assistance, and take on 
families who can't." 
</P>
<P>
 One key problem faced by the children of AIDS patients is the need for legal 
guardianship if their parent or parents are overcome or die of the disease, 
O'Neal said.  
</P>
<P>
 Children who are infected can also face the denial of medical and social 
services, as well as civil rights violations such as being denied access to a 
day-care center based on the child's medical diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many children affected by HIV/AIDS live beneath the poverty level 
without access to legal representation, many end up going without the social, 
medical and educational services they are entitled to, O'Neal said.  
</P>
<P>
 The idea is that the volunteer attorneys will act as advocates for low-income 
families whose lives have been affected by the virus, ensuring these children's 
needs are met. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal services will be offered Spanish as well as English, and many of the 
volunteer attorneys are willing to travel to meet their clients at home, O'Neal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alliance for Children's Rights is the only free legal services 
organization in Los Angeles County that is devoted entirely to children.  
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception three years ago, the alliance has provided legal 
assistance to over 2,300 children. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Pediatric AIDS Network is the principal provider of medical 
and social services to children affected by HIV/AIDS in the city.

COVER STORY; DRESSED FOR SUCCESS; AT 26, DESIGNER KARL KANI SITS ATOP HIS OWN 
FASHION EMPIRE. AND ALTHOUGH HE HAS LEFT THE STREETS, THE STREETS HAVEN'T LEFT 
HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT WYNNE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Karl Kani started selling baggy jeans out of the trunk of his car in 
Brooklyn, N.Y., eight years ago, he wasn't trying to rock the fashion industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Kani, now head of his own fashion design firm that started in a Crenshaw 
storefront and is now based in the warehouse district Downtown, created the 
fall-off-your-butt-jeans, oversized-shirt-hanging-out, hip-hop-homeboy style 
now wildly popular coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 26, he sits atop Karl Kani Infinity, which he predicts will yield more 
than $40 million in sales this year. Kristi Ellis, an editor at the West Coast 
fashion industry journal California Apparel News, called those figures "an 
exceptional number." 
</P>
<P>
 His success is phenomenal not simply because someone so young could fly so far 
so fast, but that in an industry dominated by white designers and 
manufacturers, a black man with no formal education is not only competing, but 
also leading. 
</P>
<P>
 He has done this in just three years, coming to Los Angeles without a car and 
settling in with a friend in an apartment over the Crenshaw storefront, where 
they eked out a living selling their funky clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovered by the Cross Colours apparel company in 1992, Kani developed his 
own line for the firm and left earlier this year as it went belly-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has left the streets -- he now lives in the Hollywood Hills -- the 
streets haven't left him. 
</P>
<P>
 His sales staff is headed by A.Z. Johnson, a boyhood friend from Brooklyn who, 
in turn, has hired others from the inner city, an example Kani implores other 
businesses to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The hip-hop magazine Vibe calls Kani an "empire builder" who is "bringing his 
ghetto reality to the masses." But will Kani's good fortune last in an industry 
rife with overnight smashes -- and crashes? 
</P>
<P>
 Kani is determined to cut out failure like a bad piece of fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never feel like I'm where I want to be at. I always want to be better than 
I was yesterday," said Kani, whose real name is Carl Williams. Before moving to 
Los Angeles, he changed it to Kani -- an alternative spelling of "Can I?" -- as 
part of his new image. "I'm hungrier now than I've ever been before." 
</P>
<P>
 Clive (Paul) Taylor, owner of New York Looks clothing store on Crenshaw 
Boulevard, was one of the first customers for Kani's line. "It's kind of 
different, it's unique, it's attractive," Taylor said, adding that the majority 
of customers for the pants, shirts and shoes are males ranging from teens to 
mid-thirties. "It's a good portion of my business." 
</P>
<P>
 But style alone does not guarantee success. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis has seen dozens of high-flying beginners nose-dive. "In this day and 
age, it's more important to be a good businessman and marketer than a good 
designer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kani, shy yet exuding a cool, tough demeanor (he has several Rottweilers), 
said he is a businessman first. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Cross Colours, which at one time had 300 employees and manufactured its 
own clothes, Kani runs a lean operation with just 15 employees, licensing his 
manufacturing (and the resultant headaches) to several companies. 
</P>
<P>
 His passion is earning cash, creating clothing a means to do that. At 18, just 
out of high school, where he enjoyed time on the football field and baseball 
diamond more than the classroom, Kani eschewed a formal education in favor of 
honing his business skills on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 He began with a simple idea: big jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never liked our jeans fitting tight," he said. "If you wear a Size 34, 
we'd buy a pair of (Size) 40 jeans but the waist would be too big. So I just 
figured, why not increase the size of the leg of the pants?" 
</P>
<P>
 With the blessing of his parents -- his father is a real estate developer and 
his mother a doctor -- and support of his older sister, he sold clothes out of 
his car and home. 
</P>
<P>
 He even sought out high-profile performers at rap concerts to wear his 
designs, which also included sweats with leather trim. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that really kept me striving was seeing black people being 
successful in the music industry," he said. "I wanted to be a part of that, but 
I knew I couldn't sing or dance or rap. I couldn't do all that, but I could 
provide clothing for these people who were out there, who could make me famous 
at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Kani's jeans and a variety of custom-made shirts, jackets and sweat suits with 
leather trim graced such big-name rappers as Heavy D, LL Cool J and Big Daddy 
Kane. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning, there was no real game plan. It was more like a fun, 
gimmick type of thing," Kani said. "But when I started seeing the response I 
was getting and the way people were reacting to it, then a game plan came to 
mind that 'I need to take this thing to another level because I'm getting a 
good response and I can create history.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But it was hard to make history selling jeans and jackets one pair at a time. 
Kani figured California was the place to be. Business costs were cheaper there 
and he figured it would be easier to make a name in the less crowded garment 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It cost me too much to produce in New York," Kani said. "I found out a lot of 
bigger companies were producing here in Los Angeles like Guess? . . . I knew 
that to be successful, you had to be part of what was happening. The garment 
industry was definitely happening in Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Los Angeles, Kani and boyhood chum Johnson opened Seasons Sportswear 
in the Crenshaw district. Johnson, whom Kani considers one of his closest 
friends, had moved from Brooklyn to the West Coast a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The culture shock was swift. Accustomed to driving around Brooklyn in a new 
BMW and strutting about with a pocketful of cash, Kani had to adjust to a 
warmer climate and a bank account as barren as the Arctic. He had sold his car 
and devoted much of his savings to business costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the fact that we were living in the store showed you what kind of money 
we had," Kani recalls. "It was just lucky for us the store happened to have 
showers. We were barely making it. People looked at us like we had a lot of 
money because we were making clothes and we always dressed good. But that was 
all a front." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johnson, 28, now a vice president in charge of Kani's upcoming children's 
line: "We made a little, not much." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair quickly became a team, as Kani honed his design skills and Johnson, a 
former shipping and receiving manager for Ralph Lauren in New York, worked the 
financial end. 
</P>
<P>
 Business grew steadily in Los Angeles, but the Crenshaw store was still the 
minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the big leagues, in the form of Cross Colours owners Carl Jones and T.J. 
Walker, came calling. Kani and Johnson closed their store in 1992 shortly 
before moving over to Cross Colours. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Threads 4 Life, Cross Colours' parent company, hired Kani to create 
his own line for the company. At the time, Jones and Walker were hailed as the 
premiere African American fashion designers and manufacturers, with millions of 
dollars in sales and a reputation as modern-day Midases. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Cross Colours, besieged by accounting and shipping 
problems, all but disintegrated under an ocean of debt. Jones and Walker 
continue to work today strictly as free-lance designers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kani surfaced with his name and image intact and he formed Karl Kani 
Infinity, starting shipments in May. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Cross Colours owners did, Kani plays up his background. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let people know that I started from a street level and that if I can do 
it, then surely anybody else can do it because I ain't no different than any 
other kid that grew up in the inner city," said Kani, who sometimes models his 
clothes in advertisements that feature men with hard stares in gritty street 
scenes.  
</P>
<P>
 "Blacks are seeing that they cannot only be successful in music and sports, 
but now they're tapping into the industry of clothing, which was unheard of, 
really, for any blacks to be really successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His sales staff of six, like him and Johnson, come from inner-city Brooklyn. 
(A few employees are from Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
 Said Johnson: "A lot of them don't have 100% schooling on sales. We hire them 
and teach them and they end up better than people that were schooled for it. If 
you grew up in the city, you're a natural-born hustler. The inner city kids 
value a dollar more -- they value it a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Kani's clothing does not come cheap, as the outfit he wore during a recent 
interview -- motorcycle boots ($130), cream-colored baggy twill pants ($75) and 
a virgin wool shirt ($150) -- attests. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kani makes no excuses. "You can't have good quality and low prices," he 
said, adding that he may soon come out with a lower-priced offshoot like Ralph 
Lauren has done with his Chaps brand of clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kani, whose passion for fashion is exceeded only by an obsession with weight 
lifting, holds court in a warehouse at 5th and Molino streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolts of mint green, blue and red-and-yellow striped fabrics fight for space 
along the brick hallways. Kani conducts business sitting on a black leather 
chair fronting a table topped with a huge slab of glass etched with his name 
and logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging on the walls of his office are samples of the clothing he will 
introduce in the spring: earth-toned, long-sleeve shirts -- some with zippers 
in front -- hockey shirts, cream-colored pants, relaxed-fit jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 Kani also has plans to expand into the women's and children's market, although 
he has no firm date on those launches. Earlier this year, Kani put out his own 
brand of street-tough urban shoes -- mostly motorcycle and hiking boots and 
leather sneakers in blacks, browns and earth tones. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's changing the look. It's more classy, top of the line," Taylor of New 
York Look said. "He's cut back a little on the street look. He has a 
conservative look and a trendy look." 
</P>
<P>
 Kani said he must change to stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put out so many styles before that now we're starting to change a little 
bit. A lot of people are doing a lot of the things we used to do, and we want 
to look different," he said. "By staying real and staying focused and always 
changing your style, you're always going to stay ahead of the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "For 1995, we're coming into a very basic, relaxed look. We're 
noticing that a lot of people are getting away from the big, oversized baggy 
jeans. They're getting into relaxed-fit jeans," he said. "Right now the earth 
tones are still going to be popular for us. We're going to expand our tops. We 
found that button-down collar shirts and things like that are getting to be 
more a part of our business. A lot of people want to look dressy but still have 
a sport look to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever that look is, Kani hopes to get there first.

CABLE TV FRANCHISE UNDER FIRE; UTILITIES: A DELUGE OF COMPLAINTS PROMPTS L.A. 
OFFICIALS TO THREATEN TO REVOKE CENTURY'S OPERATING AGREEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Disturbed by a deluge of complaints about Century Cable Television, Los 
Angeles city officials are threatening to begin proceedings to revoke the 
company's operating franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Telecommunications reports that 57% of the 
complaints the department receives about cable carriers concern Century, even 
though the company serves only 23% of the city's cable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Telecommunications, which oversees cable 
providers in the city, has notified Century that the number of complaints about 
the company is higher than at any time in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Century has a grace period of roughly 45 days to rectify the situation before 
the department recommends to the Board of Telecommunications Commissioners, an 
appointed body, that the city begin revocation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're only as good as they deliver, and they're not delivering," said Susan 
Herman, general manager of the Department of Telecommunications. "They are the 
most complained-about company that we deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Century acknowledges that it has received the city's warning. But company 
officials attribute the current problems to growing pains in the cable 
industry, and they say they are taking steps that have already improved 
customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been conducting focus groups with our customers, and they have said 
they think it is becoming a new and better system," said Pennie Contos, general 
manager of Century's Santa Monica office, which handles much of the service for 
the Westside.  
</P>
<P>
 Customer satisfaction, to be sure, is not the only hurdle Century must 
negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all cable operators, Century faces new competition, primarily from direct 
satellite television broadcast services, which beam to satellite dishes secured 
on rooftops and offer programming nearly identical to cable. And telephone 
companies, which boast strong customer loyalty, are gearing up to offer video 
dial tone services. 
</P>
<P>
 Century's reputation in Westside cities, though not sterling, seems better 
than it is in Los Angeles. In Beverly Hills and West Hollywood, for example, 
the company has actually improved its services, according to officials from 
both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our enforcement efforts," said John Risk, president of Communications 
Support Group, a consulting firm that has contracted with the City of Beverly 
Hills to oversee its cable franchise. "We call Century five times a day to see 
how long it takes them to answer the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Los Angeles it's a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Telecommunications has determined that Century, based on the 
number of complaints it receives, is guilty of a material breach of its 
franchise, Herman says. Among the problems: responding too slowly to customer 
service calls, poor TV reception, distributing inaccurate information and 
billing customers for services they do not want. 
</P>
<P>
 "Century's customers are paying the highest rates in the city, but the service 
is the worst and the customers know it," Herman said. "It adds insult to 
injury." 
</P>
<P>
 To begin revocation proceedings, the city's Board of Telecommunications and, 
ultimately, the Los Angeles City Council, must first agree to revoke the 
company's franchise.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Century came close to losing its license to operate in Los Angeles 
over similar issues, Herman said. However, the company improved its customer 
service record and the city took no action. 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest attempt at a turnaround, the cable operator started hiring new 
staff this summer and has developed a strategy to improve its reputation.  
</P>
<P>
 The changes at Century start at the top, with new managers both on Century's 
regional level and in the Santa Monica office. Contos herself has been with the 
company only a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the new managers oversee what the company terms "customer care 
etiquette." The cable company has also hired 20 new employees to make follow-up 
phone calls to Century customers who have received repair or installation 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, Century is experimenting with a new three-person customer 
service team that can solve simple technical problems over the telephone. The 
Santa Monica office plans to hire 10 additional customer service operators. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also developing a new program to train its customer service 
employees in telephone etiquette, cable technology, the details of the 
company's billing system and new programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Repair and installation services are on the increase at Century, the company 
says. The company will add Sundays to its current six-days-a-week schedule for 
house calls, and it will provide repair, installation and other types of 
technical services until 9 p.m., Contos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at the business in a new way," Contos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, remain unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sylvia Siegel, president of Consumer Cable Cop, a consumer group based in 
San Francisco: "It's just a PR ploy."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornerstone Theater has put an urban spin on the classic legend of Faust. This 
time, the aging philosopher who sells his soul to the devil is portrayed by a 
Chicano family of seven from Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's fun about the play is that it's about a very real family dealing with 
real issues in Watts, presented in a fantastical way," said Bernardo Solano, 
who wrote "Los Faustinos," and directed the 31-member cast with Julliette 
Carrillo.  
</P>
<P>
 Charged with issues of spirituality and cultural identity, the play traces the 
results of the Faustino clan's ill-considered pacts with Mephisto, the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each family member is associated with one of the seven deadly sins," Solano 
said. Each exchanges his or her eternal soul for a personalized piece of heaven 
on Earth, such as a Hollywood career, a romance or a big-screen TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a third of the play, performed with a largely local cast at San Miguel 
parish hall, is done in Spanish. Local resident Robert Ceja composed the 
original score.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Show times: Today at 2 p.m., each Saturday and Sunday until Dec. 18; Fridays 
and Saturdays at 7 p.m. Dec. 10 performance will be interpreted for 
hearing-impaired. Admission: "Pay what you can." (213) 567-8634 or (310)

SOCCER PREVIEW; YOUNG GUNS; WORLD CUP FEVER MAY HAVE DIED DOWN, BUT THE STARS

 The soccer fever that swept the city and the nation during World Cup '94 is 
still cooking at the local high school level. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport is growing, with 11 schools in the Los Angeles area fielding new 
boys and girls teams this season, including Eagle Rock's arrival in the City 
Section Northern Conference, and LaSalle's entrance into the Santa Fe League, 
where they will battle traditional rivals Cathedral and Salesian. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson, meanwhile, moves to the tough Southeastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the changes, as the season moves into its second week of the 1994-95 
season, established powers Belmont, Bell, Garfield and Bell Gardens retain 
their status as local teams most likely to dominate. Strong Lincoln and Fremont 
squads should also challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a closer look at some of this season's better local high school boys 
programs. A look at girls soccer will appear in an upcoming issue. Bell Gardens

season) will be shooting for their 15th consecutive playoff appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches Orlando Brenes and Bob Osegura have built a veritable dynasty in Bell 
Gardens. Last year's 3-1 victory over Burbank Burroughs in the CIF final sealed 
their third such title in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Up front this season, the Lancers will field seniors Cesar Reynoso and Gustava 
Garita. The pair combined for 20 goals last season and they should even be 
stronger this year. Joining them on the flank will be Costa Rican newcomer Juan 
Carlos Balonos, a sophomore who also plays basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior David Vasquez will lead a solid defense from the sweeper position. 
Vasquez is a strong tackler who takes on the opposing squad's scoring threat. 
Seniors Simon Oliveras and Moises Calderon round out the defensive backfield, 
and Lancers football quarterback Victor Lopez, a junior, returns as goalkeeper. 
Salesian 
</P>
<P>
 When you can call a 14-2 record a rebuilding year, you know the Mustangs must 
be good. "This year's team is much stronger," Coach Sal Sarmiento said. 
Finishing second to archrival Cathedral in the Santa Fe League really irked 
Sarmiento, and he's itching for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs' 5-5 ball-control offense is directed by the league MVP, senior 
defender Moises Delgado. Sophomores Oscar Barrajas and Saul Flores will provide 
the 1-2 punch on offense. The younger Flores is a deadly finisher. Cathedral 
</P>
<P>
 Things will be a little tougher for Cathedral in the Santa Fe League this 
year, as LaSalle and Bell-Jeff enter an already tough field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to get accustomed to playing at a higher level," assistant coach 
Art Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Making life easier for the Phantoms will be the return of senior forward Eli 
Seobaltazar, who scored 12 goals last season. He will be set up by sophomore 
Daniel Solis, a crisp passer, and senior midfielders Rene and Richard Barrogon, 
twin brothers with a scoring touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Tommy Delatorre is a great sweeper and provides leadership on the back 
line. He is supported by senior Albert Gonzalez and junior Joel Guttierez on 
defense. Consistent senior Ernie Jimenez returns in goal. Belmont 
</P>
<P>
 Still smarting from last year's disqualification for an ineligible player 
after defeating Bell in the City Section championship, the Sentinels (10-1-2 
last year) will find the going a bit tougher this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning starters Eric Hernandez and Jose Salmeran scored 27 goals between 
them last year and are being counted on again to provide the bulk of the 
offense. Senior midfielder German Gonzalez and speedy sophomore Hector Alvarado 
will feed them the ball. Junior defender Edwin Barahora returns as the corner- 
and free-kick specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 The main task for the Sentinels is to fill holes at goalkeeper and on defense, 
where Coach Nancy Carr-Swain said "lack of skill and maturity" are the main 
problems. Lincoln 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers may just be the surprise team to watch this season. Building upon 
last year's strong second-half showing and a narrow 2-1 loss to Chatsworth in 
the playoffs, coach Richard Velez is aiming to topple Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers' 4-5-1 attack may be one-dimensional, but what a dimension in 
senior forward Melvin Hernandez, who caught fire in the summer league and 
scored 17 goals. Hernandez's cousin, sophomore Edwin Argueta, is a natural 
sweeper who will be counted on to get the ball downfield. Sophomore goalie Jose 
Guevara plays linebacker for the Tiger football team. Garfield 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Gerardo Campos returns with a stacked squad (8-1-3 last season) that was 
undefeated until they ran into Belmont in the playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Romeo Cordoba returns as the Garfield finisher with new junior Oscar 
Fuentes joining him at forward. The Bulldogs are solid in the midfield, with 
seniors Gerardo Gomez (the passer) and Junior Romero (the scorer) manning those 
roles. Solid senior defender Armando Rosales will play the sweeper role. 
</P>
<P>
 Untested junior Angel Martinez is penciled in as the starter at goalkeeper. 
Huntington Park 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans, 1-4-3 last season, seek to improve upon that record by returning 
an experienced squad this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we had no time to prepare the team," Coach Herman Waller said. 
"This fall, we had a lot of practice time together." 
</P>
<P>
 Waller will rotate senior forwards Jesus Cadenas (a 4.0 student), Leobarto 
Guttierez and Juan Cortez in the striker position, as the Spartans will go with 
a 3-3-3-1 formation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to keep the striker fresh to the opposition," explained Waller. Speedy 
senior Ricardo Esqueda (All-City Cross Country) will quarterback the offense 
from the sweeper position. Sophomore Antonio Zuletta will start in goal. 
Roosevelt 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Miguel Roura will field a seasoned Roosevelt team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year's 3-2 loss to Granada Hills in the second round of the City Section 
playoffs was a heartbreaker," Roura said. "I think with the experience of this 
team we can go farther this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior captains Juan Ruiz and Cesar Rodriguez set the tone offensively from 
the midfield with a ball-control attack. Senior Fernando Jimenez is the center 
forward, flanked by seniors Jesus Perez and Jefferson transfer Gilberto Gomez. 
The Roughriders will not be able to lean on outstanding senior sweeper Geraldo 
Sandoval much early in the season, as he is just three months removed from a 
broken leg. Senior goalkeeper Hector Hernandez makes opponents work hard for 
their goals. Manual Arts 
</P>
<P>
 The Toilers return only five players to a squad that failed to qualify for the 
playoffs last year. But new coach Juan Quintanilla says he will not play a 
conservative, defense-oriented game to compensate for the lack of experience, 
but use an attacking 4-4-2 rotating system. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Jorge Mejija is a deadly finisher and freshman Arturo Ayala is, as 
his coach puts it, a great shooter and a thorn in the opposition's side. Senior 
forwards Murizio Lopez and Arturo Pidera will bring the ball up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Walter Osario and sophomore Raul Estrada are attacking defenders who 
support the offense whenever possible, leaving sophomore Henry Mendosa, a 
strong, complete sweeper, to guard against any counterattacks. Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 The Romans (8-2-1) look to improve upon a side that lost in the first round of 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are stronger in every facet of the game," Coach Jose Mendez said. "We have 
depth, we have guys that could start on 90% of other teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez will field an international team this season: Skilled sophomore 
forward/setup man Brook Berhanu is from Ethiopia, and solid senior sweeper 
Isiah Harvey is from Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the Romans' 3-3-3-sweeper formation are sophomores Julio Chavez 
and Sergio Escalante. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Osman Romero and junior Jovan Vasquez shore up the defensive front. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question mark is at goalie. Bell 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles coach Oscar Mercado has his work cut out. Bell (12-1-1) was a favorite 
to win it all this season -- until the L.A. Salsa professional team came along 
and took his three best players for their under-19 squad. 
</P>
<P>
 This leaves Bell, who lost last year's championship game to Belmont, severely 
short on proven talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not afraid of the challenge," Mercado said. "I've got skilled newcomers, 
I just have to get them together and into shape." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is still solid: junior Jose Urena is an excellent goalkeeper and 
defenseman, and he is supported by a fellow junior defenseman with a scoring 
touch, Luis Garcia. Fremont 
</P>
<P>
 The Pathfinders slipped and fell last year, not making the playoffs only a 
season after being in the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a younger team than last year, but far more skilled," said coach 
Luis Rosales. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pathfinders return 10 players. The key will be the Alex Sandoval-to-Pablo 
Gonzalez connection. If these two juniors click, the offense will be set. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont is loaded at forward, with juniors Oscar Monroy and David Sanchez 
flanking Gonzalez in the middle. Helping Sandoval in the midfield is freshman 
Primativo Cruz, already being touted as the best ever at the school. Locke 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints face a rebuilding year after losing players who combined for 28 
goals last season to graduation. Last year, the Saints made the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all is bleak. Senior forward Orlando Ortega scored five goals in a 
limited role last year and senior striker Jimmy Benitez hopes to get more of an 
opportunity to finish this season. Senior goalkeeper Gustavo Lambera and 
sophomore sweeper Edwin Mira will be asked to shore up a defense that will be 
leaned upon more heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints will be implementing a 3-4-3 formation this season with an accent 
on the long ball. South Gate 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Tony Dauer faces his usual problem: His soccer team has been tied up 
with football until its loss last week in the quarterfinals of the City Section 
playoffs. Still, Dauer will try to improve upon a Ram team that struggled to a 
hard-luck 5-6-2 record, then was disqualified in the playoffs because of 
ineligible players. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Carlos Aguilez and junior defender Freddy (Puma) Orillana are 
the only sure starters the Rams have. 
</P>
<P>
 "After those two, there is a considerable talent drop," Dauer said. 
"Hopefully, some of the kids will develop." Dorsey 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey returns almost all the pieces of its 4-2-3 playoff team of a year ago. 
Unfortunately, the most important piece, Nelson Gavidia, is playing pro soccer 
in Spain. Still, the Dons have enough firepower to remain respectable. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior goalkeeper Frank Figueroa has matured into a fine player over the 
summer, said Coach Gervin Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior sweeper Marvin Gonzalez will hit forwards David Villatoro and Edgar 
Gonzalez with long passes downfield as Sanchez will attempt to bring the 
"English style" long ball offense into the Dons' arsenal. Solid junior defender 
Lionel Duarte keeps opposing forwards at bay.

FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS REACH GRAND FINALE; 4-A DIVISION: CRENSHAW TAKES ON SYLMAR 
FOR ANOTHER CHAMPIONSHIP ON BEHALF OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC CONFERENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When other high school football coaches scoff at the records of his Southern 
Pacific Conference colleagues, Dorsey Coach Paul Knox finds it difficult to 
just sit back and listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will ever stop," Knox said of the seedings for the City 
Section 4-A playoffs. "Every time there is a team with an undefeated record in 
league, they think they are better than a team from our conference with three 
or four losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, those skeptics have been proven wrong. Consider that 16 of 
the past 18 City 4-A titles have been won by Banning, Carson or Dorsey. The 
Colts lead the pack with nine titles. 
</P>
<P>
 And the playoffs are running true to form this year as well. ll five Southern 
Pacific Conference entrants won their first-round games, and three of the four 
semifinalists -- Carson, Crenshaw, and Dorsey -- are from the conference. The 
exception was top-seeded Sylmar, which beat Wilmington Banning, 28-27, in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro, the fifth entrant from the Southern Pacific Conference, also made 
it to the quarterfinals before losing to Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Saturday, the Southern Pacific Conference will go for No. 17 when 
Crenshaw plays Sylmar. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you play in a tough conference where everyone is fairly even, you get 
use to playing intense games every week," Knox said. "You don't have any 
letdowns." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, who finished with a 7-0 record in the Southern Pacific 
Conference, are making their first City 4-A final appearance. They won a City 
3-A championship in 1991, their only football title. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw has two outstanding running backs in Farrel Payton and Brandon Seals, 
who combined to rush for 252 yards and five touchdowns in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars have arguably the best defense in the City, led by defensive ends 
Kabeer Smith and Kirk Olivers, linebackers Adrian Anderson and Marshon Caulton, 
and defensive back Drake Beasley and Terrell Jones. All six players were 
selected to the Southern Pacific Conference first team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have sowed the seeds of our hard work and labor," Crenshaw Coach Robert 
Garrett said, "and we are reaping the benefits. Now we can be recognized as a 
true football team in our community and not a junior varsity team to Dorsey." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman has the magic touch. In addition to leading the 
undefeated Spartans (12-0) to the City title in 1992, Engilman also guided 
Manual Arts to 3-A titles in 1983 and 1984. Sylmar is led by tailback Durell 
Price, who has rushed for 1,770 yards and 26 touchdowns. Floyd Chalk, Tyrone 
Morgan and Gerrod Taylor are also capable running backs. Quarterback Greg 
Marquez has passed for 19 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver-defensive back Davon Young is the Spartans' second-leading scorer 
with 15 touchdowns, including seven on punt, kickoff and interception returns.

 AMERICAN OPEN 
</P>
<P>
 Dmitry Gurevich, a grandmaster from Illinois, won the 30th edition of the 
American Open last weekend in Long Beach. Gurevich overcame a fifth-round loss 
against GM Walter Browne to collect the $2,000 first prize in the 96-player 
Open section. His 7-1 score included wins against SMs Mark Duckworth and Jesse 
Sales and IMs Jack Peters and John Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne and Tal Shaked tied for second at 6 1/2-1 1/2. Each went undefeated, 
although Browne barely survived a fierce attack by Shaked in their seventh 
round showdown. Next at 6-2 were Levon Altounian, Fernando Miguel, Peters, 
Sales, Valdis Saulespurens and Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Torres took the under-2300 prize. Harutyun Akopyan, Sharon Burtman, 
Allan Karman, Show Kitagami and Bruce Weiner shared expert honors. 
</P>
<P>
 Rex Bridgeford scored 6 1/2-1 1/2 to lead 55 players in Section II 
(under-2000). Bill Johnson, Russell Laidman and Hiu Yong split first prize with 
6 1/2-1 1/2 scores in the 53-player Section III (under-1800). Section IV 
(under-1600) attracted 73 players; Feliks Akopian and Isidro Oviedo shared 
first place at 7-1. Mazahir Shaikh topped Section V, which consisted of 16 
unrated players, with 7 1/2- 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Hanken, who has organized the last six American Opens for the Santa 
Monica Bay Chess Club, was "very pleased" with the overall turnout of 293 
players. Hanken had guaranteed $18,200 in prizes and he feared a financial loss 
when his pre-tournament mailing went astray, but the tournament showed a small 
profit. 
</P>

RESPONSIBILITY ON TRIAL IN DUI CASE; COURTS: LAGUNA BEACH PHYSICIAN FACES 
SECOND-DEGREE MURDER CONVICTION FOR KILLING TWO PEOPLE WHILE DRIVING DRUNK. 
DEFENSE ARGUES THAT HE DIDN'T INTEND HARM. PROCEEDINGS BEGIN MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The trial of Dr. Ronald Allen won't be a "whodunit." The physician accused of 
driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol admits he crashed into and 
killed a Mission Viejo couple in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When testimony begins Monday in Orange County Superior Court, jurors have a 
tougher job -- deciding whether Allen is a murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare application of state law, Orange County prosecutors are seeking two 
second-degree murder convictions against Allen, arguing that his prior brushes 
with police, combined with his medical background, made him aware that driving 
while intoxicated can be deadly. The defense says Allen never intended to harm 
others and should instead be convicted of vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court in 1981 ruled that prosecutors could seek 
second-degree murder convictions in traffic fatalities. But its use against 
intoxicated drivers remains unusual, in part because it poses a heavy legal 
burden for prosecutors: They must show that the defendant knew the risks and 
yet acted with a "conscious disregard" for human life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, how do you prove that? It's not like you have a guy who 
yells 'Hey, I'm drunk and I'm going to drive and I don't care if I kill 
someone!' before he gets behind the wheel," said Assistant Dist. Atty. John D. 
Conley. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Highway Patrol, alcohol-related traffic crashes 
claimed 467 lives in Orange County between 1989 and 1993. But murder charges 
are filed in only two or three cases each year, according to the Orange County 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of drunk drivers who kill are charged with vehicular 
manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of 11 years in prison. 
Second-degree murderers are sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Factors used to differentiate between the two include the level of 
intoxication, the defendant's driving history and the circumstances of the 
crash, Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 A classic second-degree murder case involves a convicted drunk driver who gets 
behind the wheel, speeds and kills someone. A typical vehicular manslaughter 
case might involve a driver with no history of driving while intoxicated who 
strikes a pedestrian stepping into the street, Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The distinction, the line between the two, can be a very thin one in some 
cases," Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some defense attorneys, however, fear that prosecutors also allow emotions or 
media attention to play a role, although prosecutors deny it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me they file (murder charges) when there are sympathetic victims, 
and that is simply not fair," said Allen's defense attorney, Assistant Public 
Defender Michael P. Giannini. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach doctor is accused of injecting a "substantial" level of 
Valium, drinking and driving erratically before the July 11 collision on 
Santiago Canyon Road that killed Mark and Noreen Minzey and injured 12-year-old 
Karie Minzey as the family returned from a softball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say they decided to file murder charges because of Allen's history 
of driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993 -- shortly before the fatal crash -- Allen was arrested on 
suspicion of public intoxication, hit-and-run driving and resisting arrest 
after he allegedly rammed his car into three parked vehicles in Laguna Beach. 
That case was pending at the time of the fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before the crash that killed the Minzeys, Allen was cited for speeding. 
But the officers who stopped him did not discover an outstanding warrant for 
his arrest stemming from another collision in April, 1992, when Allen allegedly 
rear-ended a car while driving drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1992, Allen had consumed alcohol shortly before he was stopped by 
a law enforcement officer in Palm Springs. The officer admonished Allen after 
learning of his profession, saying "You should know better than that," 
according to earlier court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Giannini and Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko have declined to comment while 
Allen's case is pending trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Giannini has said in the past that prosecutors are overcharging his 
client. Giannini has always stressed that Allen has never been convicted of 
drunk driving and said he was going through extreme emotional difficulties at 
the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 When the fatal accident took place, Allen was nearly bankrupt, suffering from 
stress and depression and had just learned his father died. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors recently rejected filing murder charges in the high-profile case 
of a Buena Park man accused of drunk driving and killing La Habra Police 
Officer Michael Osornio on Halloween. After reviewing the circumstances of the 
crash, and suspect Marco Ramirez's lack of criminal history, prosecutors 
charged him with vehicular manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors will be asked to make a similar call Monday, when the California 
Highway Patrol plans to make its case for charging Shane Young, 25, with murder 
for running down and killing 16-year-old Jasmine Cook, a friend and neighbor, 
in an October crash in Silverado Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP spokeswoman Angel Johnson said there is evidence Young was racing another 
car and may have been intoxicated. Young also has a history of speeding 
citations, court documents show. 
</P>
<P>
 Reidel Post, executive director of Mothers Against Drunk Driving of Orange 
County, said she has only praise for the Orange County district attorney's 
office and how it handles drunk-driving fatalities. Post said she agrees with 
prosecutors' decisions in most cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very, very difficult cases to prove in court, and overall I am very 
pleased with their efforts," Post said. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts say prosecutors typically need overwhelming evidence before they 
can successfully prosecute a murder case. One reason is that jurors may 
empathize with the defendant, said Gregory Christopher Brown, assistant 
professor of criminal justice at Chapman University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a case of 'There but for the grace of God go I,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County prosecutors won their first second-degree murder conviction 
against a drunk driver in 1986, when Michael Reding was found guilty of killing 
Pamela Trueblood of Fullerton and her three young children. 
</P>
<P>
 But what started out as a symbol for tougher treatment of drunk drivers in 
Orange County has since become a reminder of the legal difficulties involved in 
such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana later faulted a judge for 
allowing jurors to hear evidence about Reding's possible drug use and 
overturned Reding's conviction. In a retrial, jurors said they grappled with 
the issue of malice and ultimately voted to find Reding guilty of vehicular 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Trueblood, who lost his family in the crash, said he still feels 
cheated by "the legal system -- I can't call it a justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 Trueblood, who frequently speaks out to warn the public about driving while 
intoxicated, recalled being unable to identify his young son's mangled body 
after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "A car is a very good means of transportation, but it is also a deadly, 
destructive weapon, and I don't think there are too many people who don't know 
that they shouldn't be drinking and driving," he said. "But I understand 
firsthand that it's hard to prove in court." Drunk Driving Injuries Down 
</P>
<P>
 Drunk driving-related deaths and injuries in Orange County have declined 
substantially over the last five years, except for a slight increase in deaths 
in 1993, the most recent year for which information is available: 
</P>
<P>
 Deaths

TRUSTEES DEFEND PREFERENCE FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: ONE STARTED HIS OWN 
ONE-STUDENT FACILITY. THEY CITE CHOICE, SAFETY, SAY THEY CAN STILL SERVE 
DISTRICT. 
</P>

 Tom Chaffee has lived about half his 42 years in this city. He earned a 
diploma in 1969 from Valley High -- where his eldest daughter was graduated in 
1993 -- and last year won a seat on the Santa Ana Unified Board of Trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 But this fall Chaffee, a conservative who has been extremely critical of 
Orange County's largest school district, pulled his four school-age children 
out of the system he helps run and enrolled them at Bethel Baptist, a private 
Christian school. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee said he made the controversial decision after his children were the 
targets of half a dozen alleged threats or incidents of harassment he believes 
were responses to his opposition to bilingual education and other classroom 
reform initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really, really, really concerned with my kids taking the heat for me 
being on the school board," Chaffee said. "I'm not going to sacrifice my kids' 
education for my political position." 
</P>
<P>
 But to Kathi Jo Brunning, president of the district's Parent-Teacher Assn., 
Chaffee's decision is "like a slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's pretty depressing," she said. "If a school board member doesn't 
have enough faith in his own school district, then I don't think he can 
adequately represent the school district. It's kind of like a reverse conflict 
of interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee's colleague and frequent opponent on the board, Robert W. Balen, has a 
daughter who spent nine years in Santa Ana public schools but for the past two 
years has attended Mater Dei, a private Catholic high school elsewhere in the 
city. Another Santa Ana trustee, Rosemarie Avila, home-schooled her children 
for years before being elected, a move she was criticized for during her 
campaign for the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the county, newly elected Garden Grove Unified Trustee Terry 
Cantrellruns Bethel Baptist and has educated his children there, including one 
daughter who is in 12th grade at the school. Debbie Hughes, a Saddleback Valley 
Unified Trustee, home-schools her child. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange Unified, board member Max Reissmueller has been targeted for recall 
by some employees because of his decision this fall to home-school his 
6-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because I think that I can educate my child better than the public 
system doesn't mean that I can't work to improve the public system," said 
Reissmueller, a 26-year-old father of three who, like Chaffee, is aligned with 
conservative Christian groups. "If I thought the public school system were 
perfect, then I'd put her in. If everything were perfect, there'd be no reason 
to change anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Reissmueller has advocated privatization of Orange Unified to free schools 
from state and federal mandates. In October, he removed his daughter from 
Chapman Hills Elementary and filed papers with the county to establish Orange 
Christian Academy, naming himself as principal, his wife as teacher and his 
daughter as the student body. 
</P>
<P>
 Reissmueller also scoffed at the idea that enrolling children in public 
schools should be a qualification to sit on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school system belongs to the community, not just the parents," he said. 
"It's the community that's paying for the education and it's the entire 
community that's affected by the education." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many in Santa Ana said they are upset that Chaffee abandoned district 
schools rather than use his power on the board to solve the problems he found 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you want your City Council member to live in another town?" asked Mark 
Perew, a parent and school district activist who is considering a bid for the 
board. "Or do you want them to be there on a daily basis, involved with the 
community and have a stake in what happens?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Kaim, who heads the Sandpointe Neighborhood Assn., said Chaffee's move 
was "almost an insult to the district." 
</P>
<P>
 "He got on our Board of Education partially by saying he was a parent in our 
schools," added Debby Huffman, who represents Santa Ana on the California 
Teachers Assn. state council. "That's a little bit of an uncomfortable 
situation for him to now take them out. We're doing a wonderful job. I don't 
know what his problem is." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee said he believes in public education but became concerned when his six 
children -- who are in the audience at nearly every school board meeting -- 
were allegedly mistreated on and off campus after his election to the board in 
November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee contended that a classmate tried to set his son's hair on fire in the 
boy's locker room at McFadden Intermediate School. He said a McFadden teacher 
belittled his daughter and gave her a poor grade because of her father's voting 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Both children were also terrorized by gang members, Chaffee said, contending 
that one boy told his daughter he would "assassinate your father just like John 
Kennedy." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said they were aware of the incidents and had discussed them 
with Chaffee, but that he had never suggested any connection between his 
children's troubles at school and his position on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally shocked that he's connecting what's happened with kids and 
teachers and other kids to his politics," said McFadden Principal Brenda 
McGaffigan. "I'd love to have a chance to talk with him to draw him back in. I 
don't want anyone to go away thinking bad things about McFadden." 
</P>
<P>
 McGaffigan and Assistant Supt. Joe Tafoya said Chaffee met with his daughter's 
teacher to discuss the grade, and police were notified of the alleged attack on 
his son. The teacher did not face any disciplinary action, McGaffigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Supt. Don Champlin said that if any harassment were suggested, he would 
investigate. "We absolutely will not stand for that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation escalated May 22, when Chaffee called police to report his home 
being vandalized: toilet paper wrapped around the trees, eggs thrown at the 
house, girl's underwear "stained with feces and blood" left on his front lawn, 
and a dead bunny placed in the family's motor home, according to Chaffee's 
report to police. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, police officers found gang symbols etched into the side of the 
motor home, said Santa Ana Lt. Bob Helton said.  
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee has since moved to a rented house, and uses a commercial mailbox as 
his public address. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to bad-name the schools at all. There are some real good quality 
programs there, but there are a few students who don't agree with me, and they 
couldn't refrain from taking that out on my kids," Chaffee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My real problem was that my kids' life was beginning to turn upside-down 
because of my position on the board. I needed to do something to break that up. 
That wasn't my reason for joining the school board." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee said he switched his two younger children from Jefferson Elementary to 
Bethel to keep the close-knit family together, though there were no serious 
problems at Jefferson. Besides, Chaffee said, he was dissatisfied with the 
children's test scores and believed they would learn more at Bethel. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuition at Bethel is about $200 a month for each of the four Chaffee children, 
plus registration fees of $210 to $245 each. 
</P>
<P>
 California School Boards Assn. President Sherry Loofbourrow, a Newport-Mesa 
Unified trustee, said there are individual instances where it makes sense for 
trustees to put their children in private schools, but that in general, it 
sends the wrong message. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the responsibility to not turn his back on the system but to improve 
the system," Loofbourrow said of Chaffee. "If you make a commitment to be a 
school board member, it's a total commitment. You can't lead unless you lead 
completely." 
</P>
<P>
 But Avila, who typically votes with Chaffee on the bitterly divided school 
board, said that until conservatives gain a majority on the Santa Ana board she 
sympathizes with the need to seek better education elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a parent, you have to do what's best for your children. As a school board 
member, you have to do what you can to make things better for everybody," she 
said. "Sometimes you weigh it. And you always have to go with, 'A parent would 
do this,' rather than, 'A school board member would do this.' "

TO BOLDLY GO . . . ; AT STAR TREK FEST, REPORTS OF CAPTAIN'S DEATH ARE GREATLY 
EXAMINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Capt. James T. Kirk has finally shed his mortal coil. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no moments of silence, no prayers, no sympathy cards for the 
fallen hero at a Star Trek convention Saturday afternoon. Many of the thousands 
who packed the Anaheim Convention Center eulogized the hammy starship 
commander, who dies in the current box office hit "Star Trek: Generations," in 
their own way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time," said Brian Schmidt, 26, a computer graphics artist from 
Huntington Beach. "He's had a good 30-year run. It had to happen. He's in a 
dangerous profession. How could you not die sometime?" 
</P>
<P>
 The universe can be a cold place. 
</P>
<P>
 One of four major Star Trek conventions in the Los Angeles area each year, 
Saturday's gathering attracted the usual assortment of costumed and ardent 
fans. Series followers, often called "Trekkies" or "Trekkers," seemed far more 
concerned with what the convention had to offer.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of them dressed as their favorite character, enthusiasts snatched up show 
memorabilia, waited patiently in line for autographs, and argued over such 
issues as whether an android character in the current film should retain his 
"emotion chip." 
</P>
<P>
 The convention marked the first major congregation of Star Trek fans since the 
death of Kirk, a character whose television and movie exploits have elevated 
him to a pop cultural icon. Portrayed by actor William Shatner, the captain's 
over-the-top antics won him worldwide adoration as an intrepid space pioneer in 
79 television episodes and seven movies. 
</P>
<P>
 But like Schmidt, few seemed to take pity on the venerable Kirk, whose demise 
passes the Star Trek torch onto a new generation of space explorers. Heather 
Wenger, 24, of Mission Viejo actually applauded Kirk's departure from the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was cheering," said Wenger, who dressed as a crew member of television's 
"Star Trek: The Next Generation." "I'm not a real fan of the original series. I 
don't even see why he was in the movie. They didn't need him." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, some Star Trek conventioneers demonstrated more tender feelings for 
the deceased space pioneer. For 45-year-old history teacher Rudolph Cordero, 
who wore a Kirk uniform to the convention, the demise of his hero was deeply 
saddening. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I watched him die, I felt like a part of me died too," said the Eagle 
Rock high school teacher. "I've been with him since 1966. It really hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Cordero said Kirk symbolized the original television series, which he admired 
for its progressive and moralistic teachings. The show and Kirk embraced ethnic 
diversity and promised a better future for Earth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may have killed my captain," Cordero said. "But his message lives on." 
</P>
<P>
 While somewhat indifferent to Kirk's downfall, Eva Hirsch of Los Angeles said 
the current movie could have enhanced the emotional punch for audiences by 
bringing in Mr. Spock, the character played by actor Leonard Nimoy who was 
Kirk's second in command and came from the planet Vulcan. The 44-year-old fan 
said the new movie should have shown Spock experiencing a "mind-link jolt" at 
the moment of Kirk's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been nice to see Mr. Spock shed a tear," she said. "He has a 
human half, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 But for other enthusiasts, death, like so many other things in the universe, 
is negotiable. After all, they remember Spock's death in the second film 
installment, only to see the emotionless, green-blooded officer star again in 
the next three Star Trek films. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way they play with time, they could easily resurrect him," said Bob 
Lafferty, 46, a computer graphic artist from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Majors, 42, a bookkeeper from North Hollywood, also believed Kirk could 
cheat death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me slightly sad that he's gone," said Majors, a fan of the original 
television show since it aired in 1966. "But they can always bring him back. 
Look at Spock, or it could be another dream sequence-type thing like 'Dallas.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most concerned about Kirk's death at the convention hall was 
Jeffrey E. Truskolaski, a real estate auctioneer from Irvine. Truskolaski bears 
an uncanny resemblance to Shatner. 
</P>
<P>
 Truskolaski, who passes out business cards that proclaim "William Shatner 
Look-Alike," said he has been posing as the space hero for about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I'm worried." he said. "I hope they bring him back. It will help 
business."

UP TO 70% CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH MIDDAY MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Surfers were out in force Saturday to take advantage of prime wave conditions 
ahead of the storm expected to arrive in Orange County early today. 
</P>
<P>
 "With no strong on-shore breezes, the ocean is smooth, not choppy," said 
Marine Safety Lt. Steve Davidson at Huntington City Beach, where an estimated 
2,000 crowded the west side of the pier to catch the waves. Despite the day's 
overcast skies and high temperatures in the low to mid-60s, he said, "it's good 
for surfing." 
</P>
<P>
 Though rain is forecast, beach officials predicted that many of the wave 
riders would be back for more today, especially since strong winds are not 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters are calling for cloudy skies and a 60% to 70% chance of rain in 
Orange County, with the precipitation expected to end by midday Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Barbara and Ventura coastal areas, some thunderstorms are 
forecast.  
</P>
<P>
 The National Weather Service predicts half an inch of rain along Orange 
County's coasts and valleys, with heavier downpours in the mountains, said 
meteorologists at WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow is expected above 7,000 feet, which would exclude Orange County because 
none of its terrain reaches that altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The precipitation is being driven by a cold front that started in the Gulf of 
Alaska at midweek and has been moving through the northern and central parts of 
California. At the same time, moisture has been building along the Southland 
coast for the past few days, WeatherData meteorologist Kris Farnsworth said, 
and that will fuel the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds along the beaches today will be from the west to southwest at 17 m.p.h., 
with waves at two to three feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures across Orange County will range from midmorning lows in the 
mid-40s to mid-50s, to afternoon highs in the lower to mid-60s. Temperature 
Drops 
</P>
<P>
 With the forecast calling for rain to sweep across across Orange County, 
temperatures will be cooler today. Expected highs and lows in selected cities: 
03,14,05,06 Low High Anaheim 49 63 Santa Ana 50 62 Irvine 49 62 El Toro 51 64 
Laguna Beach 47 61 Dana Point 48 60

TRIAL CASTS SPOTLIGHT ON BRUTAL HOME INVASIONS; CRIME: VICTIMS OVERCOME FEAR OF 
RETALIATION TO DESCRIBE VIOLENCE ALLEGEDLY COMMITTED BY VIETNAMESE YOUTHS WHO 
ARE ACCUSED OF PREYING ON ASIAN FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Taiwanese mother barely opened her front door when several clean-cut 
Vietnamese youths rang the bell of her West Covina home last year, looking for 
"Dave." 
</P>
<P>
 But that tiny crack was all they needed. Wielding guns, they burst in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are the moneybags?" they demanded, after cutting the phone lines, tying 
up family members, putting blankets over their heads and manhandling them. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime was one of hundreds of home invasions that plagued Asian families in 
the San Gabriel Valley last year. Authorities believe that more than 200 of the 
invasions reported to the three sheriff's substations in the San Gabriel Valley 
were committed by a group of young Vietnamese men on trial in Pomona Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 As proof, deputies cite a remarkable statistic: In the 12 months since the 
four men and three accomplices were arrested, only eight home invasions have 
been reported.  
</P>
<P>
 The crimes, called home invasions because they are planned and executed with 
military-style precision, are traditionally committed by Asian criminals 
against Asian families, but they are also growing more popular with other 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Home invasions often go unreported because victims are too terrified of 
retribution to go to the police. But the Taiwanese family in West Covina -- 
which lost $10,000 in cash and jewelry -- decided to talk, and so did 40 other 
victims, many of whom laboriously took the witness stand last week.  
</P>
<P>
 As they told their harrowing tales in several Asian languages, the four 
defendants, members of a Southern California gang called V Boys, sat 
impassively in manacles. Three others have pleaded guilty and are serving time 
in state prison.  
</P>
<P>
 The four defendants are Vu Nguyen, 21; Vinh Chau Tran, 22; An Thanh Nguyen, 
21, and Tri Quoc Vuong, 18. They are charged with 34 felony counts of 
residential robbery, residential burglary, sexual battery and assault with a 
deadly weapon, and face 15 to 71 years in prison if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
 Charges of assault with a deadly weapon were filed because the defendants 
burned many of the victims with lit cigarettes to force them to reveal where 
money and jewelry were hidden, said Larry Morrison, the deputy district 
attorney prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang also stole passports, green cards, credit cards and Social Security 
cards, all of which can be readily sold on the black market, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that Southeast Asian gang members often cruise San Gabriel Valley 
neighborhoods looking for telltale signs of Asian occupants: A Chinese good 
luck symbol hanging over the front door, shoes left on the front porch, 
Asian-style shrubs and gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the gangs strike during the day, when only aged parents and mothers 
with small children are likely to be home. They ask for a fictitious person, 
then force their way in with guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon leaving, they often take a family photo with them, a chilling reminder 
that they will seek revenge if the crime is reported, authorities say. The fear 
of retribution is so strong that prosecutors last week asked The Times not to 
publish the names of victims who testified against the V Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses in the case have provided police with a long catalogue of brutality: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 12-year-old Chinese boy from Rosemead required eight stitches in the head 
after being pistol-whipped because the suspects believed that the family had 
not handed over enough cash, Morrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 * An 80-year-old Chinese woman in Rowland Heights who failed to produce enough 
money was handled so roughly that her arms turned black and blue from bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Filipino family of nine in Hacienda Heights was terrorized on 
Thanksgiving, 1993, when the suspects tied up and threatened two children, ages 
3 and 5. The family was so traumatized that they were unable to celebrate the 
holiday this year, said Deputy Basil North, who investigated the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects "would go out and rob on a daily basis, then go back to the 
motels where they lived with their girlfriends and drink beer and party," North 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four V Boys were arrested Dec. 3, 1993, while fleeing from a residential 
robbery in West Covina, police said. During a police chase, they threw two guns 
from their red Toyota Supra, which were recovered and found to have been stolen 
from a Rowland Heights home earlier that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Home invasion robberies, along with extortion of small shopkeepers, have long 
been a problem in Asian communities worldwide. Asian criminals know that Asian 
families often keep cash and valuables at home and they know that fear and 
cultural differences may deter them from going to the police when victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia is experiencing a crime wave of home invasion robberies, as is 
Calgary, Canada. Sacramento County has logged 99 home invasion crimes this 
year. In Orange County, bandits repeatedly dunked a 2-year-old's head in the 
toilet until the mother handed over $500 in hidden cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hayward, victims were shot with a stun gun. In Stockton, robbers scalded an 
elderly woman with boiling water. At least seven victims have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminals from other ethnic groups appear to be following the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in Pomona Superior Court recently found three black defendants from 
Belize guilty in a home invasion robbery of an East Indian family in Diamond 
Bar in which a 13-year-old girl was raped.  
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Asian gangs have branched out to white victims, targeting 
homes in Westminster and San Juan Capistrano. Police have also reported at 
least five cases of Latinos committing home invasions against Latinos in Santa 
Ana and Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some copycat crimes happening," North said. "Home invasions have 
been going on for a long time; it's just never been as prolific."

CAN'T PHONE HOME; DESERT FOLKS ENJOY NO LINK TO OUTSIDE -- BUT IT HAS ITS 
PERILS

 One night last June, a rattlesnake sank its fangs into Debbie Robinson's hand 
while she was watering the lawn outside her desert home, about 25 miles 
northeast of Palmdale. As the deadly venom spread, the 43-year-old Robinson 
became dizzy and nauseated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because her husband was away, Robinson had no one to turn to for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she was as alone as almost anyone can be: Robinson lives in one of 
the few outposts in Los Angeles County that still does not have telephone 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the shakes real bad," Robinson recalled. "I knew that if I did nothing, 
I was going to die. If I'd had a phone, I could have dealt with it in a few 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's life was saved because her husband pulled into the driveway just as 
she was going into convulsions. He drove her to the nearest pay phone -- five 
miles away -- and summoned paramedics. A helicopter whisked her to a hospital 
in Lancaster for anti-venom treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, a bus driver, is just fine now, and more committed than ever to a 
longstanding campaign to get phone lines extended to the unnamed, rural area 
inhabited by about two dozen families along and near East Avenue O, the only 
paved road in the isolated neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But the efforts of residents -- living in domiciles ranging from the 
Robinson's cozy, converted general store to run-down mobile homes -- have been 
thwarted for more than 10 years by costly connection fees, bureaucratic 
bungling and squabbling among the neighbors themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when people all over the country are plugging their fax machines, 
modems and voice mail systems into the information superhighway, the Robinsons 
would settle for a simple dial tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say: 'Where could you possibly live where there's no phone?' " said 
Debbie Robinson's husband, John, 44, a construction worker. "People just won't 
accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone relates everyone to a phone number," Debbie Robinson said. "If you 
don't have a phone, you're not worth much." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 John Crutsinger came here in 1943, paying $30 an acre for a piece of the world 
that he thought would allow him to live a safe distance from urban life. He dug 
a well, built a house and moved from a neighborhood near Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get away from all that I lived with down there," said Crutsinger, 
now 85. Even the few neighbors he now has are too many. And the thought of 
Palmdale being only a short drive away is no comfort. "Pretty soon, they all 
moved here anyway," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Miller, 65, lives nearby with his wife, Cora, in a house that has three 
large boats in the yard. Miller, a former aerospace worker who moved to the 
area in 1985, said a Palmdale man paid him to store the vessels, then abandoned 
the boats and moved to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers' house is surrounded by a wall made of thousands of old automobile 
tires. The wall is there to keep out the sand and tumbleweeds, and to a certain 
extent, the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, what do you hear?" asks Miller standing in the yard. "Just the 
wind blowing." 
</P>
<P>
 About the only intruders are dune-buggy riders and motorcyclists who sometimes 
trespass onto the property. He keeps a handgun close by. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get trash (collection), we don't get the telephones, we don't get 
cable TV," Miller said. "We don't get a good response from the Sheriff's 
Department. You have to be self-sufficient out here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Robinsons moved here a decade ago, assuming phone service was available. 
"When we looked at the place, there was a phone book on the floor," Debbie 
Robinson recalled. "We never gave it a second thought." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, people in the area had to drive to the nearest town, Lake Los 
Angeles, and use pay phones beside the Saddleback Market or Burger Basket to 
make calls. 
</P>
<P>
 When they asked the phone company about establishing service to their home, 
the Robinsons were told it would cost them $13,000 upfront just to have the 
lines extended. They and other residents have considered cellular phones, but 
they feel the fees are prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Filer, supervisor of the California Public Utilities Commission's 
consumer affairs branch, has heard complaints from other residents of remote 
areas who do not have telephone service. But he dismisses arguments that 
telephone companies should automatically provide these neighborhoods with 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 "They moved out there," Filer said, "so they're going to have to pay the 
expense to bring service there." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell and GTE officials say the few unwired neighborhoods that exist in 
Los Angeles County are mainly in the sparsely populated far northern desert 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 If these residents ask for service, the phone companies will provide the first 
750 to 1,000 feet of line for free. After that, they charge state-approved fees 
that add up to thousands of dollars per mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The utilities insist that they are only covering their labor and equipment 
costs. If they discounted these prices, they say, city and suburban customers 
would be subsidizing the cost of hooking up more isolated households -- a 
practice the state Public Utilities Commission frowns upon. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 census found that only 3.4% of Los Angeles County's 3.2-million 
households had no phones. The study did not determine how many households were 
in areas where no telephone service was available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most die-hard of isolationists along East Avenue O now consider a 
telephone a necessity of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives complain that they are too tough to contact. Employers must signal 
them via pagers or wait for them to call in. Suspicious cashiers are loathe to 
accept a check from a customer who has no home phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 A much more urgent reason to have a telephone is for medical emergencies. John 
Miller has undergone two heart bypass operations, and his health remains 
fragile. He says he sometimes passes out from overexertion while working in his 
yard. "I'd like to have a phone because I'm getting to the point where I'm 
scared," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the cost, he said he once offered to install the roadside phone 
lines himself, but the telephone company refused to let him. 
</P>
<P>
 An old-fashioned mobile phone system gives him limited access to the outside 
world. It occupies a corner of his living room, where the walls are adorned 
with black velvet sword-and-sorcery paintings, an Elvis Presley clock and a 
framed Elvis Presley gold record. 
</P>
<P>
 The gold record was a birthday gift for his wife, an Elvis fan who commutes 25 
miles to work as a Palmdale restaurant hostess. When she arrives or leaves 
work, she can signal her husband through his pager, which costs $19 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers use their mobile phone, which is subject to interference from 
other radio sets, sparingly. Even so, their September bill was $102, and 
previous ones have topped $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Up the road, Crutsinger said he did not miss having a telephone until 10 years 
ago when his wife suffered a stroke and he had to send a friend for help. When 
he later asked the telephone company about getting hooked up, he said he was 
quoted a price of $22,000. "I couldn't afford that," Crutsinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, he tried a cellular phone for a month but found it far too 
expensive. "The bill was $225 or something like that," he said. "I found out 
that every time you touch that thing, it costs you money. I turned it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Crutsinger's wife, who never fully recovered from the stroke, is now in a 
nursing facility in the Las Vegas area near their daughter. Crutsinger said 
that without a telephone, he cannot often check on her medical status. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeated inquiries, Pacific Bell offered in January to hook up 18 
households in this area if all of the families signed up for service -- and 
each kicked in $965 upfront. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, the plan was abandoned because only the Robinsons and five 
other families had paid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Robinson pressed the phone company to come up with a less ambitious 
proposal. A revised plan was devised, but there was confusion about just what 
it offered. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Robinsons understood the revised plan, they and three other families 
would each chip in about $4,300 to get the lines extended to their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a July 15 letter, Pacific Bell announced that with these four families 
paying the costs, telephone service would be extended to all 18 households. To 
those not able to afford the hookup fees, this was a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Kubon, who lives off a dirt road just west of Crutsinger's house, 
raises dachshunds and nurtures a rock and cactus garden. She relies on a 
citizens band radio when she needs help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not out here because we're loaded," Kubon said. "We're just average 
yokels." 
</P>
<P>
 Another resident who would have gotten a free phone hookup was Humberto Moro, 
a sewing machine repairman who speaks limited English. His daughter, college 
student Katia Moro, said phone service would be a big help because family 
members now have to hurry to the pay phones when traffic accidents occur near 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Robinsons and the other paying families were outraged that they were 
expected to subsidize the establishment of telephone service, and they refused 
to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever wanted something really bad, and you could finally afford it -- 
but only if you bought one for everyone else on the block?" Debbie Robinson 
fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 After inquiries by The Times, Pacific Bell said it had misunderstood the 
intentions of the paying families and that the July 15 letter was in error. The 
company sent a technician back to the desert to recalculate the cost of running 
lines only to the Robinsons and the other households willing to pay for the 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Their most recent proposal puts the total cost at $14,150. So far, the only 
ones willing to pay a share of that are the Robinsons, the Millers and 
Crutsinger. That comes to about $4,700 per household. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a steep price for the Robinsons, but Debbie Robinson said she is 
determined to get the funds, even if they have to take out a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "One way or another," she said, "I'm going to get a phone."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: MY LIFE AS A FASHION CRITIC HAS ITS UPS AND DOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not a week of the Simpson trial goes by without my learning something of 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week I found out that fashion writing is not my field, at least in the 
view of two lawyers unfortunate enough to have fallen victim to my critiques. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, I'm talking about Robert L. Shapiro of the O.J. Simpson defense 
team and Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter, the prosecutor in the Heidi Fleiss 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing Shapiro's appearance at a news conference outside the County Jail, 
I'd written that he was "wearing a garish warm-up suit and an odd baseball 
cap." 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon, I received a letter from Shapiro by fax: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Bill: 
</P>
<P>
 I read your column this morning and was surprised to see that you have become 
a fashion critic. I wish to point out the following. . . . For your 
information, the jogging suit was what was worn proudly by members of the 
United States Olympic team, and my odd baseball cap was a gift from Commander 
Kent Ewing, a college classmate who launched the naval attack in Operation 
Desert Storm, and honors his aircraft carrier, the USS America. 
</P>
<P>
 Sincerely 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro." 
</P>
<P>
 OK. I didn't recognize the patriotic value of either of these garments. On the 
other hand, I'm not disloyal, either to the Olympic team or the U.S. Navy, as 
Shapiro seemed to imply. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before, I'd written that Deputy D.A. Alan Carter "came across as a 
rough-at-the-edges street lawyer, coat unbuttoned, shirt looking a bit 
wrinkled." 
</P>
<P>
 When I wrote it, I'd thought it would give Carter a career boost. I figured 
some smart pol, reading that, would run Carter for public office as a 
street-smart crime fighter, a lawyer with the common touch so badly needed in 
our criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 But when I encountered Carter in a crowded Criminal Courts Building elevator 
Thursday I could see he took an entirely different view. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't think much of my attire, he said. On the contrary, I replied, I 
thought you looked good. "Street lawyer" was meant as a compliment. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Carter didn't think I had expressed my feelings well. He said the 
column was poorly written. That started a discussion that ranged from my 
literary ability to my character, matters that were absorbed with great 
interest by the 20 or so others jammed into the elevator with us. The exchange 
ended when we reached the 12th floor and I got off. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter and Shapiro have a point. Who am I to comment about fashion? My family 
approves the ties I put on in the morning before I'm allowed out of the house.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's important to understand about the Simpson trial is that there is a 
paucity of news in this particular, inconclusive stage, with its procedural 
hearings and jury selection. Yet the media machine can't stand idle. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the time is spent covering events that don't produce news, as happened 
Thursday when I made it into the courtroom for the first time during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the very act of getting in was news. Each news organization is allowed 
one seat and ours is occupied by Andrea Ford, who is covering the trial. But 
there was an extra ticket for the afternoon session and, after I had waited in 
line, it was given to me. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the door, I was impressed even though I frequently see some of the 
leading characters in the trial around the courthouse and watch the sessions on 
television. It was a bit like being at the Super Bowl after years of viewing it 
on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson looks better in person than on television, resembling a businessman 
being tried for a white collar crime instead of for murder. In fact, the whole 
cast has a much more animated appearance. Judge Lance A. Ito, whom I learned 
later was coming down with a bad cold, moved matters along briskly. Simpson 
seemed involved and interested. The lawyers appeared relaxed. 
</P>
<P>
 The session was devoted to questions about Simpson's County Jail confinement. 
The nature of these questions was not disclosed. Ito gaveled the court into 
session. The lawyers disappeared into a back room to discuss the questions. 
When they emerged, they told Ito the questions had been resolved. With that, 
Ito adjourned for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On such a day, the pressure to produce news when there is none creates a lot 
of tension and bad manners. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw this demonstrated after the court session when a mob of camera crews and 
reporters followed defense attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. out of the Criminal 
Courts Building at lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Microphones were jammed into his face. Questions were fired at him. Cameras 
were recording. The news people and Cochran moved slowly toward the street, as 
if they were engaged in a strange ritual dance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no place for an innocent passerby. Somewhere along the route, a woman 
who had nothing to do with the case had her foot trampled by a cameraman. When 
she complained, he denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's your footprint on my shoe," she said. At this point the cameraman 
blamed it all on her, saying she should have stepped aside. "I said, 'I'm 
coming through,' " he told her. 
</P>
<P>
 To his companions, he complained: "A hundred people coming at them with 
cameras and they expect the world to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 The world may stop for the Simpson trial when things get hot, but this wasn't 
the day.

CRIME IN L.A. DECREASES 13%; LAW ENFORCEMENT: FBI ALSO CITES DOWNWARD TRENDS IN 
SAN FERNANDO, SANTA CLARITA AND ANTELOPE VALLEYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON and DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime was down in Los Angeles during the first half of 1994, according to FBI 
figures released Saturday, buttressing law enforcement's hopes that the city's 
annual homicide mark may drop below 1,000 for the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, 378 homicides were reported during the first six months of 1994, 
contrasted with 532 during the same period last year. For all seven crimes 
covered in the survey, the decrease was 13%, outpacing an average 6% drop for 
U.S. cities of more than 1 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Downward trends were also reported across the Antelope, Santa Clarita and San 
Fernando valleys. In Lancaster, there were 12.3% fewer crimes; in Santa 
Clarita, 3.7% fewer crimes, and in Glendale, 8.8% fewer crimes -- including a 
marked decline in murders, from four to one for the periods reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the FBI statistics did not separate Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley 
communities from the rest of the city, the Los Angeles Police Department 
reported earlier this year that violent crimes in the Valley had decreased by 
12% and homicides by just more than 50% -- from 77 in the first half of 1993 to 
38 in the first six months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The decreases locally mirrored a three-year nationwide trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime reported to the nation's law enforcement agencies in cities of more than 
100,000 residents was down 3% for the first half of 1994, contrasted with the 
same period last year. That six-month decline followed yearlong decreases of 2% 
in 1993 and 3% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime rate includes homicides, robberies, rapes, aggravated assault, 
burglaries, theft and auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI divides serious crimes into two categories: crimes of violence such as 
murder and rape, and crimes against property such as burglary. Among the 
violent crimes measured for the first six months of this year, murder decreased 
2%, forcible rape 6%, robbery 4% and aggravated assault 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the property crime category, burglary was down 6%. Larceny and motor 
vehicle theft each declined 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, authorities have said the decrease in crime may have resulted in part 
from a higher police presence linked to community policing efforts and to 
unusual events such as the Northridge earthquake in January and the World Cup 
last summer -- both of which also put more uniformed officers on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors also may include more active neighborhood crime-prevention 
activities, an increased police focus on areas with high crime, a continuing 
truce among some African American street gangs in South-Central Los Angeles, 
another truce among Latino street gangs in the San Fernando Valley, and a 
Mexican Mafia edict against drive-by shootings that has cooled tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald M. Caplan, a former federal law enforcement official who is dean of the 
McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, said he could not explain the nationwide 
decrease but cautioned that the public "should not take comfort in the overall 
level of violent crime." 
</P>
<P>
 "Data collection is not so refined that one can safely predict a trend in this 
area," Caplan said. "Besides, the figures don't tell everything in view of 
frightening new crimes like carjackings and gang shootings that affect so many 
of our neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Demographics might explain some of the modest decline, Caplan and others 
suggested, such as shrinking numbers of Americans in the 18-to-26 age group, 
which accounts for most violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Chaiken, an authority on crime figures at the Justice Department, remarked 
that "people also are working more to protect themselves, which is why we have 
seen a decline in burglaries and car thefts." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate annual report released Saturday, the FBI listed 1993 crime rates 
for all the nation's cities with populations over 10,000. The final figures 
showed that an estimated 14.1 million serious offenses were reported last year 
to law enforcement agencies across the nation, or 5,483 crimes for every 
100,000 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being lower for the second consecutive year, the 1993 violent crime 
rate of 746 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants was 13% higher than the national 
crime rate of five years ago and 38% above the rate 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggravated assaults accounted for 59% of the violent crimes reported last 
year, robberies were 34%, forcible rapes 5%, and murders 1%. Guns were used in 
32% of all murders, robberies and aggravated assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI said the proportion of violent crimes committed with firearms has 
increased in recent years. In 1989, firearms were used in 27% of all violent 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2.8 million arrests were made in 1993 for all serious offenses, 
with some arrests representing multiple crimes. Of all those arrested last year 
for crimes other than traffic offenses, 45% were under the age of 25, and 81% 
of all those arrested were male. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Los Angeles and the Antelope Valley cities of Palmdale and Lancaster 
fell above the national crime rate. Smaller area cities such as Burbank, Santa 
Clarita and Calabasas were below it, according to a Times computer analysis of 
the FBI figures. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midyear report comparing this year to last, Pasadena recorded the 
biggest drop -- nearly 20% -- in its overall crime rate. Nonetheless, that city 
recorded the same number of homicides -- nine -- for the first six months of 
this year, contrasted with the same period last year, the study by Times 
director of computer analysis Richard O'Reilly shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks recorded the lowest crime rate for the six-month period among 
big cities in the region -- 1,333 per 100,000 people for the first six months 
of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other communities recording significant reductions in their crime rates were 
Inglewood -- despite an increase in homicides from 23 to 26 -- and Garden 
Grove. Pomona also recorded a significant reduction in its crime rate, 
notwithstanding 24 homicides for the first six months of 1994, up from 16 for 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles rate was 3,922 per 100,000. Highest among big cities in the 
region was San Bernardino, with 6,521 per 100,000 for the first six months of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Robert L. Jackson from Washington and Julie Tamaki from 
Los Angeles contributed to this report. Crime in Valley Cities

<P>
 Along with its mid-year report on crime in the nation's larger cities, the FBI 
released its annual publication listing the 1993 crime rates in all cities of 
over 10,000. These are the totals for cities in the San Fernando Valley region. 
They include murder, forcible rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, 
larceny-theft and motor vehicle theft. 03,15,13,16 Crimes per Area Population

BURBANK TO PAY NEARLY $700,000 FROM MALL BUYOUT FUNDS; FINANCES: PROCEEDS FROM 
THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY'S $10-MILLION MEDIA CITY CENTER DEAL WILL BE TAPPED TO 
REFUND A SAN DIEGO DEVELOPER THAT TRIED FOR 12 YEARS TO BUILD A SHOPPING 
FACILITY.

<P>
 The $10-million buyout deal ending the Burbank Redevelopment Agency's interest 
in the troubled Media City Center shopping mall will be reduced by at least 
$698,000 that city officials promised to give an earlier, unsuccessful 
developer of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hahn Co. of San Diego will receive the money. Hahn tried unsuccessfully 
for 12 years to build a shopping center in Burbank before the Alexander Haagen 
Co. stepped in to develop the Media City Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The payment to Hahn would decrease the amount of money taxpayers receive from 
the agency's $120-million investment in the Media City Center by about 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city collects $1.2 million in annual sales taxes from the mall, 
millions of dollars in other revenues have been diverted to Haagen through a 
series of costly deals since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the Burbank City Council gave up the city's right to half of the 
mall's profits in return for Haagen's promise to pay $10 million over the next 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, city officials called the buyout a success, emphasizing the size 
of the $10-million payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen retains 100% of the profits and the right to lease the land on which 
the mall sits for $1,000 a year for up to 95 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we get cash from the transaction, they don't get paid," Assistant City 
Manager Steve Helvey said of the Hahn Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we didn't have money from other sources to pay Hahn," Helvey 
said. "The agreement (with Hahn) called for money from a specific source, and 
that specific source wasn't generating any money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hahn Co. was selected in 1975 to build a two- to three-level mall with 
four major department stores that was projected to open in 1987. By that time, 
however, the firm failed to secure a fourth major department store considered 
vital for the entire project. Consequently, the company did not purchase the 
land on which the mall was built from the Redevelopment Agency as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Burbank council members determined the Hahn Co. was in default, but 
had acted in good faith and was entitled to a refund of about half its 
investment -- with interest -- so long as the city earned more than $1 million 
from a new developer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hahn Co. had invested a total of $1.1 million that was paid to the 
Redevelopment Agency -- $500,000 advanced for the land purchase, $100,000 in 
administrative costs, and a $500,000 deposit guaranteeing the firm's sincere 
effort to complete construction of the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn's money, Helvey said, was placed in the agency's General Fund for use in 
appraising the property and relocating businesses from the site, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the Hahn Co. sought the refund. But Helvey repeatedly stated that 
the money would not be paid until the Media City Center turned a profit for 
Burbank. Hahn's former vice president of development, Daniel Felix, wrote 
Helvey in 1990: "Your convenient interpretation that so long as the Agency does 
not come into direct receipt of funds, Hahn is not entitled to a repayment 
under the agreement . . . is patently indefensible." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Haagen was selected as the project's new developer. The mall opened 
two years later and has reportedly lost millions of dollars in revenues ever 
since, partly because of high vacancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has never received any profit from the mall, and Haagen, in papers 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, has stated the mall lost 
money the last two years. But the council decided that the receipt of the $10 
million from Haagen justifies the payment to Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen and the Redevelopment Agency agreed to part ways after the developer 
made a series of financial demands he said were necessary to ensure the mall's 
long-term viability. 
</P>
<P>
 With the buyout agreement, city officials say they will finally be able to 
settle the agency's debt to Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was money we owed for a long time," Vice Mayor Dave Golonski said. "The 
Haagen deal was not influenced at all by the fact that we had to pay Hahn." 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn's general counsel for real estate, Douglas Hageman, reserved judgment on 
the latest deal until his company's dispute with the city is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assuming we get paid," he said, "we'll be satisfied."

CAN'T PHONE HOME; DESPITE EFFORTS, AREA NEAR PALMDALE REMAINS UNWIRED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One night last June, a rattlesnake sank its fangs into Debbie Robinson's hand 
while she was watering the lawn outside her desert home, about 25 miles east of 
Palmdale. Robinson, a 43-year-old bus driver, became dizzy and nauseated as the 
deadly venom spread. 
</P>
<P>
 She had no one to turn to -- her only companions that night were her four dogs 
and 50 chickens. Her husband was away. 
</P>
<P>
 She was more alone than almost anyone in the modern-day United States. 
Robinson lives in one of the few outposts of Los Angeles County that still 
lacks telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the shakes real bad," Robinson recalled. "I knew that if I did nothing, 
I was going to die. If I'd had a phone, I could have dealt with it in a few 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's life was saved because her husband pulled into the driveway just as 
she was going into convulsions. He drove her to the nearest pay phone -- five 
miles away -- and summoned paramedics. A helicopter whisked her to a hospital 
in Lancaster for anti-venom treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson is just fine now, and more committed than ever to a longstanding 
campaign to get phone lines extended to this unnamed rural area. About two 
dozen families live on and near East Avenue O, the only paved road in the 
isolated neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But the efforts of these residents -- living in domiciles ranging from the 
Robinsons' cozy converted general store to rundown mobile homes -- have been 
thwarted for more than 10 years by costly connection fees, bureaucratic 
bungling and squabbling among the neighbors themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when people all over the country are plugging their fax machines, 
modems and voice-mail systems into the information superhighway, the Robinsons 
would settle for a simple dial tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say: 'Where could you possibly live where there's no phone?' " says 
Debbie Robinson's husband, John, a 44-year-old construction worker. "People 
just won't accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone relates everyone to a phone number," adds Debbie. "If you don't have 
a phone, you're not worth much." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Crutsinger came here in 1943, paying $30 an acre for a piece of the world 
that he thought would allow him to live a safe distance from urban life. He dug 
a well, built a house and moved from a neighborhood near Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get away from all that I lived with down there," says Crutsinger, 
now 85. Even the few neighbors he now has are too many. And the thought of 
Palmdale being only a short drive away is no comfort. "Pretty soon, they all 
moved here anyway," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 John Miller, 65, lives nearby with his wife, Cora, in a house that has three 
large boats in the yard. Miller, a former aerospace worker who moved here in 
1985, says a Palmdale man paid him to store the vessels, then abandoned the 
boats and moved to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers' house is surrounded by a wall made of thousands of old automobile 
tires. The wall is there to keep out the sand and tumbleweeds, and also to a 
certain extent, the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, what do you hear?" asks Miller standing in the yard. "Just the 
wind blowing. There it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Just about the only outside visitors are dune buggy riders and motorcyclists 
who sometimes trespass onto the property. He keeps a handgun close by. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get trash (collection), we don't get the telephones, we don't get 
cable TV," he says. "We don't get a good response from the Sheriff's 
Department. You have to be self-sufficient out here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Robinsons moved to East Avenue O a decade ago, assuming phone service was 
available. "When we looked at the place, there was a phone book on the floor," 
Debbie Robinson recalls. "We never gave it a second thought." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, people in the area had to drive to the nearest town, Lake Los 
Angeles, and use pay phones beside the Saddleback Market or Burger Basket to 
make calls. 
</P>
<P>
 When they asked the phone company about establishing service to their home, 
the Robinsons were told it would cost them $13,000 up front just to have the 
lines extended. They and other residents have considered cellular phones over 
the years, but they feel the fees charged for both incoming and outgoing calls 
are prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Duane Filer, supervisor of the California Public Utility Commission's consumer 
affairs branch, has heard complaints from other residents of remote areas who 
do not have telephone service. But he dismisses paying the costs, telephone 
service would be extended to all 18 households. To those not able to afford the 
hookup fees, this was arguments that telephone companies should automatically 
provide these neighborhoods with service. 
</P>
<P>
 "They moved out there," Filer says of the residents in phoneless areas, "so 
they're going to have to pay the expense to bring service there." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell and GTE officials say the few unwired neighborhoods that still 
exist in Los Angeles County are mainly in the sparsely populated far northern 
desert areas, such as along East Avenue O. 
</P>
<P>
 If these residents ask for service, the phone companies will provide the first 
750 to 1,000 feet of line for free. After that, they charge state-approved fees 
that add up to thousands of dollars per mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The utilities insist that they are only covering their labor and equipment 
costs. If they discounted these prices, they say, city and suburban customers 
would be subsidizing the cost of hooking up more isolated households -- a 
practice the state Public Utilities Commission frowns upon. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 United States Census found that only 3.4% of Los Angeles County's 3.2 
million households had no phones. 
</P>
<P>
 This study did not determine how many of those households were in areas where 
no telephone service was available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most die-hard of isolationists along East Avenue O now consider a 
telephone a necessity of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives complain they are too tough to contact. Employers must signal them 
via pagers or wait for them to call in. Suspicious cashiers are loathe to 
accept a check from a customer who has no home phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 A much more urgent reason to have atelephone is for medical emergencies. John 
Miller has undergone two heart bypass operations, and his health remains 
fragile. He says he sometimes passes out from overexertion while working in his 
yard. "I'd like to have a phone because I'm getting to the point where I'm 
scared," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the cost, he says he once offered to install the roadside phone 
lines himself, but the telephone company refused to let him. 
</P>
<P>
 An old-fashioned mobile phone system gives him limited access to the outside 
world. It occupies a corner of his living room, where the walls are adorned 
with black velvet sword and sorcery paintings, an Elvis Presley clock and a 
framed Elvis Presley gold record. 
</P>
<P>
 The gold record was a birthday gift for wife Cora, an Elvis fan who commutes 
25 miles to work as a Palmdale restaurant hostess. When she arrives or leaves 
work, she can signal her husband through his pager, which costs $19 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers use their mobile phone, which is subject to interference from 
other radio sets, sparingly. Even so, their September bill was $102, and 
previous ones have topped $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Up the road, Crutsinger says he didn't miss having a telephone until 10 years 
ago when his wife suffered a stroke and he had to send a friend for help. When 
he later asked the telephone company about getting hooked up, he says he was 
quoted a price of $22,000. "I couldn't afford that," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, he tried a cellular phone for a month but found it far too 
expensive. "The bill was $225 or something like that," he says. "I found out 
that every time you touch that thing it costs you money. I turned it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Crutsinger's wife, who never fully recovered from the stroke, is now in a 
nursing facility in the Las Vegas area near their daughter. Crutsinger says 
that without a telephone, he cannot often check on her medical status. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeated inquiries, Pacific Bell offered in January to hook up 18 
households in this area if all of the families signed up for service -- and 
each kicked in $965 up front. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later the plan was abandoned because only the Robinsons and five 
other families had paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Robinson pressed the phone company to come up with a less ambitious 
proposal. A revised plan was devised, but there was confusion about just what 
it offered. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Robinsons understood the revised plan, they and three other families 
would each chip in about $4,300 to get the lines extended to their houses. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a July 15 letter, Pacific Bell announced that with these four families 
paying the costs, telephone service would be extended to all 18 households. To 
those not able to afford the hookup fees, this was a godsend. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Kubon, who lives off a dirt road just west of Crutsinger's house, 
raises dachshunds and nurtures a rock and cactus garden. She relies on a 
citizens band radio when she needs help. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not out here because we're loaded," Kubon says. "We're just average 
yokels." 
</P>
<P>
 Another nearby resident who would have gotten a free phone hookup was Humberto 
Moro, a sewing machine repairman who speaks limited English. His daughter 
Katia, a college student, said phone service would be a big help because family 
members now have to hurry to the pay phones when traffic accidents occur near 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Robinsons and the other paying families were outraged that they were 
expected to subsidize the establishment of telephone service, and they refused 
to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever wanted something really bad, and you could finally afford it -- 
but only if you bought one for everyone else on the block?" Debbie Robinson 
said, fuming. 
</P>
<P>
 After inquiries by The Times, Pacific Bell said that it had misunderstood the 
intentions of the paying families and that the July 15 letter was in error. The 
company sent a technician back to the desert to recalculate the cost of running 
lines only to the Robinsons and the other households willing to pay for the 
installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Their most recent proposal puts the total cost at $14,150. So far, the only 
ones willing to pay a share of that are the Robinsons, the Millers and 
Crutsinger. That comes to about $4,700 per household. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a steep price for the Robinsons, but Debbie says she is determined to get 
the funds, even if they have to take out a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "One way or another," she says, "I'm going to get a phone." No Service 
</P>
<P>
 An unnamed rural outpost in the eastern Antelope Valley, home to about a dozen 
families, is one of the few communities in Los Angeles County with no phone 
service. (graphic)

VALLEY BRIEFING: GOING FOR THE GREEN / FREEWAY CREWS IMPROVE THE VALLEY'S 
LANDSCAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If modern life sometimes makes it difficult to stop and smell the roses, it 
can be even tougher to get a whiff of the eucalyptus or coast cedar on a 
five-lane Southland freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those willing to ease up on the throttle and take a look (and sniff) 
around, Los Angeles-area roadways offer a sort of herbal museum for commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 And the exhibit is changing. As budgets have shrunk and water supplies 
dwindled over the past decade, the open road has begun to take on a new look. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 550 miles of freeway in Los Angeles County, with 6,000 acres 
landscaped. Landscape Budget 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans now spends a maximum of $23,000 to landscape one acre of right of 
way. A residential landscape project may cost twice that amount. Manning the 
Landscape 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, Caltrans provided about one maintenance worker for every 12 
landscaped acres. Budget cuts have dropped that ratio to one worker for every 
30 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Acres per worker since 1970 1970: 12 1980: 25 1990: 32 Why plant? 
</P>
<P>
 There are two primary reasons for planting along freeways, Caltrans officials 
say: first, to control erosion, especially along embankments; and second, to 
preserve the look of the area as much as possible. Thriving in the dry lands 
</P>
<P>
 Such water-guzzling foliage as ice plant and ivy -- once the two most common 
ground-covering plants along local freeways -- have gone the way of 
gas-guzzling automobiles. Drought-resistant, low-lying shrubs as the spiny 
acacia redolens and myoporum parvifolium now proliferate, saving both water and 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Watering: Caltrans has also begun moving to automated sprinkler systems, 
saving water and lives, officials say. Automated systems shut off during 
rainstorms, and crews no longer have to park trucks, often dangerously, along 
narrow shoulders to turn the sprinklers on and off. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trees: The freeway trees of preference must be low-maintenance varieties and 
able to withstand the pollution, heat and pests of roadside residency. 
Landscape architects also prefer types that, once established, can thrive 
without irrigation. Common types used locally include: several species of 
eucalyptus, the California pepper and deodar cedars. 
</P>
<P>
 * Native or not: Through some conservationists have been critical of the use 
of non-native species in freeway landscapes, Caltrans says that although it 
uses natives whenever possible, some non-native plants better withstand the 
rigors of the roadside. Also, some soils used, especially along stretches of 
road in commercial areas, are not native, and native plants may not thrive in 
them. The eucalyptus is among the most well-known of commonly used non-native 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't eat the oleander: A bushy evergreen shrub that grows as high as 12 
feet and decorates many freeways with white, yellow and pink flowers, all parts 
of the nerium oleander plant are poisonous to humans. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Joint Effort: Caltrans used to team up with the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department in planting for erosion control along local freeway right-of-ways. 
One such project occurred in the early 1970s along a stretch of open space 
adjacent to the Golden State Freeway between Castaic and Gorman. County fire 
helped seed the hillsides and plant tree cuttings there that would result in 
low- or no-maintenance foliage, says Herb Spitzer, county Fire Department 
forester. Cuttings from mulefat trees were taken from Santa Clarita washes and 
planted into hillsides. Shrubs such as salt bush were used because they would 
regenerate after fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize that what they see there was planted. They think it grew 
naturally,"  
</P>
<P>
 -- Herb Spitzer, Fire Department forester

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; SEN. 
GRAMM BECOMES FIRST OF GOP PRESIDENTIAL PROSPECTORS TO VISIT O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Courtin' the county: That sucking sound heard in Newport Beach on Saturday was 
the first drain on GOP dollars being swooshed up by potential presidential 
contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The first one in town after November's national Republican sweep was U.S. Sen. 
Phil Gramm (R-Texas), who schmoozed Saturday with top GOP financial donors, 
party leaders and activists at the offices of Newport Beach developer Buck 
Johns. Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kansas) will try to drop by in mid-December, Johns 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican presidential candidates are breaking speed records to Orange 
County, Johns said, now that California plans to hold its 1996 winner-take-all 
primary in March, making this a key early primary state. Previously, the 
candidates would come here to raise money, but now they have to raise money and 
grass-roots support, said Johns, a board member of the conservative Lincoln 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have a lot of fun," Johns said. "These people are going to be 
coming to town, and they are going to keep coming, and they are not going to 
stop. We are in the eye of the storm." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Storm watch: Another intense storm is brewing on the Democratic side, where 
folks are lining up to take on Orange County Democratic Party Chairwoman 
Dorianne Garcia, after the party's battering in last month's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible challengers to Garcia are all former candidates defeated in 
November: Jeanne Costales, who lost in the 71st Assembly District to incumbent 
Mickey Conroy (R-Orange); Mike Farber, who was defeated by Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove) in the 46th Congressional District; former Anaheim 
Councilman Irv Pickler, who lost to Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) 
in the 68th Assembly District; and Jim Toledano, who was defeated by Republican 
Marilyn C. Brewer for the open seat in the 70th Assembly District, which 
includes Laguna Beach and Newport Beach. Citizens-to-be

 Hoping to show the potential of the Latino vote in Southern California, the 
National Assn. of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials released a report on 
the growing number of immigrants who are eligible to become U.S. citizens. 
According to the report, there are 3.7 million non-citizen adults in 
California, including 1.6 million amnesty applicants. There are 143,652 Orange 
County immigrants who have applied for amnesty, three-fourths of whom live in 
five cities: 03,14,12,15 Amnesty % of all O.C. City applicants applicants Santa

 Not this time: In an election season filled with suspicion of voter fraud, 
Republicans were skeptical when they heard that Santa Ana Councilman Ted R. 
Moreno, a Democrat, had taken out 15,000 applications to register voters. But, 
as it turned out, only 84 of them were returned before the Nov. 8 election. And 
no one was more surprised than Moreno. "I thought it was a thousand," he said. 
Despite the commonly held belief that he was behind the voter registration 
drive, Moreno said he simply got the applications from the county and then 
turned them over to the owner of a Santa Ana-based Spanish-language newspaper, 
who planned to distribute them through the local soccer leagues. Apparently, 
the plan fell short of its goal.

 Movin' on up: The GOP takeover of the state Assembly means some local 
Republican lawmakers stand to get some nice promotions when they reconvene this 
week. Here's how it looks: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ross Johnson of Placentia: Mentioned as chairman of the powerful Rules 
Committee, although he might pass it up to focus on his bid for the state 
Senate seat being vacated by Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach, who is joining 
the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Doris Allen of Cypress: Also eyeing Bergeson's seat, but may be in line to 
head the Education Committee, despite concerns by some of her conservative GOP 
colleagues that she's too friendly with the California Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mickey Conroy of Orange: Expected to become chairman of the Utilities 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 * Curt Pringle of Garden Grove: Could become top dog on the powerful Ways and 
Means Committee; also being mentioned as heir apparent to GOP leader Jim Brulte 
of Rancho Cucamonga if the latter becomes Assembly speaker.

 * Immediately after the November election, Dornan said he wanted to join the 
crowded field of Republicans considering a run for President and hoped to make 
a decision during the Thanksgiving weekend. But conventional wisdom says you 
need $25 million to get your foot in the door. Dornan's not there yet and, at 
this point, he remains undecided.

STRICKEN DRIVER LOSES CONTROL, HITS BYSTANDER

 A motorist suffered a fatal heart attack behind the wheel Saturday, causing 
his car to careen into a pedestrian waiting at a bus stop and then slam into a 
health clinic wall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, a 47-year-old man whose name was withheld pending notification of 
relatives, probably died before his car struck the pedestrian or the building, 
authorities said.The motorist was later pronounced dead at Anaheim Memorial 
Hospital. There were no passengers in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The pedestrian, a 35-year-old Placentia man, suffered chest injuries and a 
broken leg, but was reported in stable condition Saturday at the UCI Medical 
Center in Orange Saturday afternoon. His name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred just after 7 a.m. as the motorist drove south on North 
State College Boulevard near La Palma Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The car passed through the intersection, then jumped the curb, hit the 
pedestrian and rammed into the brick wall of the Your Family Medical Group 
clinic, 555 N. State College Blvd. The car also struck the bus shelter and a 
nearby clinic signpost. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody was inside the closed clinic, and the pedestrian was apparently the 
only one waiting at the bus stop.

PHONY CHARITIES TARGET HOLIDAY SPIRIT; SCAMS: IT'S ALSO PRIME FRAUD SEASON. 
AUTHORITIES WARN PROSPECTIVE DONORS TO ASK QUESTIONS AND NEVER GIVE CASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Money that should be used to purchase stuffed animals and Christmas dinners 
for the needy each holiday season is sometimes diverted to phony charities, and 
consumers wishing to contribute to the less fortunate should be wary, 
authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 The scams can vary widely, from door-to-door solicitation to telemarketing 
"boiler rooms," officials warn.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really sad when it happens to an agency, because you have no control 
over who uses your name," said Karen McGlinn, director of Share Our Selves, a 
Costa Mesa community group that was recently exploited by a man posing as a 
solicitor for the charity in front of a grocery store.  
</P>
<P>
 According to Daniel Langan, director of the National Charities Information 
Bureau in New York, $500,000 to $1 billion of the $106 billion given annually 
to churches and charities goes to scam artists or is otherwise misused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small percentage, but a lot of bucks," Langan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charities or organizations whose names have been used by phony solicitors in 
the past tend to be the more well-known, such as United Way, the Make-A-Wish 
Foundation, Share Our Selves, local boys and girls clubs and even the Red 
Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Tips that experts give to avoid donating to phonies include:  
</P>
<P>
 * Don't give to telephone or door-to-door solicitors. If someone does come to 
your door, ask for an envelope and address so you can mail a donation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never give cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be leery of charity names that sound like other organizations, such as the 
National White Cross instead of the National Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask what percentage of the charity's funds are for programs and services as 
opposed to fund-raising and administrative costs. Any administrative and 
fund-raising costs above 25% are questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure the charity is registered as a 501 (c)(3) organization with the 
Internal Revenue Service. If it is, it is legitimate and your contribution is 
tax deductible.  
</P>
<P>
 * Ask if the charity is audited on an annual basis and, if so, whether a 
report is available. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the Disneyland Community Service Awards and other privately 
sponsored recognition awards programs screen and then recognize exemplary 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If an organization can show they have earned these awards, it is a good sign 
because these panels thoroughly screen the charities," said Marlene Eckert, 
vice president of marketing and public relations at Make-A-Wish Foundation in 
Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 Another mark in a charity's favor is to have a corporate sponsor or be the 
recipient of a private grant. Charities must be screened as part of the process 
for receiving grants from private organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors can ask for a list of the charity's board members; if the solicitor 
cannot provide this information, that is a red flag, according to Eckert.  
</P>
<P>
 People also can inquire whether the solicitor is raising money on a commission 
basis.  
</P>
<P>
 "If they are, that is not a good sign, because you want either a volunteer or 
a full-time employee of the organization to be soliciting," said Eckert. 
</P>
<P>
 Be aware of solicitations for organizations that have no activities or 
presence in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other words, none of the benefits go to Orange County residents," said Bob 
Gannon, supervising deputy district attorney in the Orange County consumer 
environmental protection unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers should also be suspicious if phone solicitors insist on getting 
donations immediately, or send out "runners" to pick up the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legitimate organizations are going to be there next week, next month, so they 
(donors) don't need to express the money to them," said Gannon. "There have 
been a couple times where the solicitor asked the donor to Federal Express the 
donation." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest number of complaints filed by consumers with the Orange County 
district attorney's office concern telephone solicitors who fraudulently pose 
as representatives of recognized charities, Gannon said, although no figures 
were available. 
</P>
<P>
 A donor's best bet is to request everything in writing, said Langan, of the 
National Charities Information Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is in writing you can be sure that 99% of the time they are honest, but 
you just shouldn't give if you have any doubt," said Langan.  
</P>
<P>
 However, even mail solicitation is subject to fraud.  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, Ruth Kwan, an attorney for the consumer protection section of 
the city attorney's office, had a case where a phony solicitor used the 
letterhead of the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. to get gift certificate donations 
from businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation, charities are spreading the word about phony solicitors 
with the holiday season in full swing.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our concern goes beyond anything that is specific to us," said Make-A-Wish's 
Eckert. "We want the public's money to go where they think it is going, and we 
don't want charitable organizations to be put in a bad light." Checking a

AIRLINER MAKES EMERGENCY LANDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Southwest Airlines plane made an emergency landing at Burbank Airport on 
Saturday morning after the pilot reported mysterious fumes that forced several 
passengers to be treated for irritation in their eyes and throats, an airline 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 54 passengers aboard Flight 1067, which originated from Oakland 
Airport, noticed fumes toward the rear of the cabin about 10:50 a.m., while the 
aircraft was 30 miles north of Burbank, its destination.The pilot then radioed 
to request clearance for an emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mystery," said Tim Myers, a spokesman for Southwest Airlines. "At this 
point, we do not know what caused the fumes." 
</P>
<P>
 After the 737-300 model carrier landed safely, airport paramedics treated an 
undisclosed number of passengers with oxygen and several others for reports of 
chest pain or burning eyes and throats. No one was hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 While first reports described smoke in the cockpit of the airliner, 
technicians checked the equipment and found no irregularities, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground officials speculated that a passenger might have been carrying a Mace 
or aerosol-spray container that discharged during the flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is why aerosol containers aren't allowed on board aircraft in the first 
place," said Jim Mayfield, operations supervisor for the 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are constant pressure changes during flight, and if these containers 
leak, their contents can be spread through the craft's air-conditioning 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 Airline officials said the plane would remain grounded Saturday while 
investigators looked into the origin of the fumes.

3 YOUNG MEN HURT BY GUNFIRE OUTSIDE ARCADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A confrontation between two groups of youths outside a popular recreation 
arcade left three young men wounded Friday night, the second shooting incident 
near the arcade since August. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, aged 16, 18 and 19, suffered gunshot wounds to the legs and 
buttocks, police said.All three victims were treated at local hospitals and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 The names of the victims were not released, a precaution taken in part because 
investigators believe the incident may be gang-related, Fountain Valley Police 
Lt. Mike Hanrahan said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the younger two apparently were involved in the dispute that led to 
the shooting, authorities said, the 19-year-old was a bystander struck by a 
stray bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 10:30 p.m. after two carloads of youths pulled 
into the parking lot of the Huish Family Fun Center on Magnolia Avenue, police 
said. Someone fired several rounds from a small-caliber automatic weapon out a 
car window, then fled the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanrahan said no arrests had been made in the case. "We don't have any real 
leads that are workable at this time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a 17-year-old was shot in the leg after an argument between two 
groups of youths at a nearby fast-food restaurant, then collapsed in the 
parking lot of the Family Fun Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Johansson, the arcade's longtime general manager, said that he is 
committed to ensuring the safety of those who enjoy using the center's bumper 
boats and batting cages and has increased security significantly in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 He also stressed that those involved in Friday's incident -- as in the 
previous one -- were neither patrons nor employees of the arcade.

FUTURE OF THE TROUBLED ANTELOPE VALLEY FAIR IS UNCERTAIN; ATTRACTIONS: LAST 
WEEK'S DISMISSAL OF SEVEN EMPLOYEES IS THE LATEST IN A SERIES OF MISFORTUNES. 
BUT OPTIMISM ABOUNDS AS THE GOVERNING BOARD SEEKS A NEW EXECUTIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 For the Antelope Valley Fair board, the past 12 months have been anything but 
carefree. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointees who oversee the half-century-old Lancaster celebration and 
local fairgrounds have endured the departure of two general managers, a drop in 
fair attendance, allegations of conflict of interest and an audit that 
uncovered dozens of state rules violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the tough times continued as fair board members, grappling with a 
$600,000 deficit in their 1994 budget, laid off seven employees, including the 
fair's marketing director and the supervisor of its new telecommuting center. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the fair's administration has been in such disarray without a 
manager that it missed a Nov. 21 state deadline for the event's 1995 budget and 
had to request an extension until January. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Charla Abbott insists that despite the recent setbacks, the 
future of the fair is not as gloomy as it might appear. 
</P>
<P>
 "This fair has survived because of the strong community support and will 
continue to do so for that reason," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials agree, saying the Antelope Valley operation has experienced 
turmoil aplenty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say they've had more than their share," said Kim Myrman, director of 
the state's Division of Fairs and Expositions, which oversees California's 80 
state fairs. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Antelope Valley was one of only three fairs statewide that she 
allowed to turn in a late budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provide extensions only in pretty extreme circumstances, and not having a 
chief executive officer meets that definition," Myrman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state fair director is confident that the Antelope Valley Fair will 
soon bounce back, particularly after undergoing a rigorous review last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, conducted by the state and made public in late 1993, contained 196 
recommendations. Noted violations included purchasing alcohol for a board 
reception with state funds, working temporary employees more days than allowed 
and improperly investing funds in a local bank with ties to a fair director. 
</P>
<P>
 A final report on how the Lancaster fair has corrected these problems is 
expected to be submitted next month. 
</P>
<P>
 But Myrman noted, "It's my understanding that the vast majority of those 
things were remedied over the past year." 
</P>
<P>
 If board members "focus their attention on getting a good chief executive 
officer, that operation will continue to be a viable one for the residents of 
the Antelope Valley," Myrman said. "I believe they clearly understand what they 
need to do and will do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley Fair operations are governed by a nine-member board. Two seats 
are vacant, awaiting appointments by Gov. Pete Wilson. The fairgrounds are the 
site of an 11-day festival at the end of each summer and special events 
year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott said the budget deficit occurred partly because the fair spent a lot of 
money renovating its aging buildings, while underestimating how much revenue it 
would take in. The fair's annual budget is about $3.5 million to $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott said the board plans to dip into its reserve funds and cut spending to 
cover the shortfall. "At the end of October, we had stopped all capital 
improvements," she said. "All nonessential expenditures are on hold." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent layoffs also will save about $16,000 a month. Abbott said all of 
the people who received pink slips were temporary employees, who were allowed 
to work only up to 119 days a year, under state guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a member of the fair's permanent staff will take over supervision of 
the new telecommuting center, which offers desks, phones and computer equipment 
to Antelope Valley residents who would otherwise have to drive to workplaces in 
the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, funded by state and local grants, was set up after the Northridge 
earthquake damaged freeways and made it difficult for many Antelope Valley 
residents to commute to and from work. Abbott said the board is committed to 
keeping it open. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's most immediate challenge, she said, is to hire an interim general 
manager, then a permanent one. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Latta, who took the post in March of 1993, resigned two months ago to 
take a similar job with the National Date Festival and Riverside County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The board then enlisted an interim manager, Roger Vitaich, who left in 
mid-November to return to the California Fair Services Authority, according to 
Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott said the board is now looking for another interim manager to complete 
the 1995 budget and begin preparations for the next fair. At the same time, it 
will conduct an exhaustive search for a permanent administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Also unresolved are conflict-of-interest allegations leveled last summer 
against board members Betty L. Smith and Steve Landaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office is reviewing allegations that Smith and 
Landaker inappropriately voted on fair contracts that may have benefited their 
employers, a trash collection service and a billboard company. 
</P>
<P>
 Landaker, who denied any improprieties, resigned several months ago. Smith 
remains on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the fair's finances and personnel matters are in order, the new manager 
is expected to focus on relocating the fairgrounds, which have been a longtime 
fixture at Division Street and East Avenue I. Fair officials say the 80-acre 
site is too small and too close to residential areas, where neighbors complain 
about fair-related traffic and noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Palmdale and Lancaster officials are trying to lure the fair to their 
cities, although how such a move would be financed remains uncertain. The new 
fairgrounds could include such expanded attractions as an auto-racing arena, an 
amphitheater and a convention center. 
</P>
<P>
 With such improvements on the horizon, Abbott says she prefers not to dwell on 
the tough times the fair board has weathered over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see a downside to it," she said. "I see a number of challenges that I 
as president and my board have been faced with. I've enjoyed every minute."

<P>
 A naval officer from Seal Beach suffered minor injuries early Saturday when 
the taxi he was riding in careened out of control and crashed into a night 
club, injuring 40 people on a dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Steve West, 26, complained only of a headache Saturday after the crash, 
said his wife, Jennifer, in Seal Beach.West, a graduate of the U.S. Naval 
Academy, was in Philadelphia for the Army-Navy football game, which the Army 
won 22-20 later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very shook up when he called," said Jennifer West, who spoke briefly 
to her husband after the crash, and was awaiting another call Saturday night. 
"I'm still worried about him. He may have whiplash for all I know." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident at Philadelphia's Club Deco happened shortly after midnight when 
the cab, driven by Jalal Masih, hit two cars, jumped a curb and then crashed 
through a plate-glass window into the bar, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said three people were hospitalized in guarded condition and a 
fourth was listed as stable. Others, including Masih, were treated for minor 
injuries and released. The cause of the accident was under investigation.

SOCCER TEAM SENDS AN ANTI-DRUG MESSAGE

 Midfielder Art Temblador and his coach, Octavio Zambrano, used their heads to 
bounce a soccer ball back and forth Thursday before 150 cheering Sunset Lane 
Elementary School students. 
</P>
<P>
 Temblador and Zambrano, of the professional Los Angeles Salsa soccer team, 
carried out their maneuver to illustrate a point: You must use your head to 
play the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You also must use your head to succeed in school and in life," Zambrano, 36, 
told the students, who belong to the campus anti-drug club Just Say No. 
</P>
<P>
 Temblador, 19, told the students he grew up in a tough neighborhood in Corona, 
where he constantly fought peer pressure to use drugs and concentrated on 
fulfilling his goal to become a professional soccer player. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream always was to become a soccer player and I did it," Temblador said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zambrano said Salsa's visit to Sunset Lane kicked off the team's plan to make 
free presentations at schools and community events in an effort to persuade 
Orange and Los Angeles county children to reject drugs, stay in school and 
strive to make their dreams come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will catch their attention with the soccer ball and then talk about more 
serious things," he said. "When kids see someone they look up to saying no to 
drugs, then it makes it easier for them to say no too." 
</P>
<P>
 The students Thursday said they were impressed by the presentation. Zambrano 
and Temblador gave away autographed soccer balls and team pictures and 
demonstrated some basic soccer moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelma Jun, 11, said she learned a valuable lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came to show us how to play soccer and gave us reasons to stay away from 
drugs," she said. "If you do drugs, you won't ever be able to follow your 
dreams because you'll just mess up your mind. You need your mind to make good 
decisions -- the right decisions."

MANY SKEPTICAL OF SCHOOL RATINGS; EDUCATION: COMPARING SUCH ITEMS AS TEST 
SCORES IS INADEQUATE FOR JUDGING OVERALL QUALITY, CRITICS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The recently released California High School Performance Report, which rates 
the combined academic performance of students, has prompted both pride and 
skepticism among local school officials and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino High received the highest scores of the 42 high schools evaluated 
in the San Gabriel Valley, and Arrow High, a small continuation school in 
Glendora, received the lowest. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics cite deficiencies in the report, and even proponents say the figures, 
used alone, are not a good indicator of how good a school is. 
</P>
<P>
 "By itself, the report is typically misused," said Pat McCabe, a research 
evaluator for the state Department of Education. She supports the report but 
said it is often misinterpreted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The schools with the high scores are praised and the low-scoring schools are 
beat up. Parents need to look at overall state ranking, how well they compare 
against other schools, and are they growing and improving?" McCabe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is also missing information on the percentage of students who go on 
to community colleges and vocational schools, she said. Others condemn the 
report for its use of data from 1992-93, saying enrollment and test scores 
change every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are useless and empty figures," said William Bibbiani, senior research 
analyst for the Pasadena Unified School District, where the average performance 
score was a relatively low 40.0 out of 100. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just the rehashing of old numbers by state department statisticians. 
Sure the figures are correct, but the numbers are meaningless," Bibbiani said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Education created the annual performance report 
in 1982 to help show schools their strengths and weaknesses and to show 
comparisons with a group of 100 schools with similar demographics. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was also designed to give the public a glimpse inside local schools 
and can be helpful to parents in deciding where to move. Under a state law set 
to take effect in May, the report would also be used to assist students wanting 
to change school districts. McCabe said the data is best used in conjunction 
with a local school report.  
</P>
<P>
 Each school in the state was given a rating based on test scores from the 
Scholastic Assessment Test, Advanced Placement test, American College Test and 
the California Learning Assessment System, a statewide exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators whose schools scored highly were pleased but were quick to note 
that the scores are not the only indicators of good education. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're proud, but we aren't elitist about it. There are a lot of good schools 
who didn't score as high," said Thomas Godley, superintendent of the San Marino 
Unified School District. "We have good students and support from parents, which 
is a major factor in successful schools these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety percent of San Marino district parents join the PTA and help with 
everything from reviewing textbooks to volunteering in the classroom, said 
Christine Rogers, president of the San Marino PTA Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Godley said the high school's small size is another reason.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have 1,000 students and know every kid by name, so it's very hard for a 
kid to get lost in the big critical mass," Godley said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Arrow High, for students who are behind on course credits, were 
not alarmed at receiving the lowest marks in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of us here think the report means anything," Principal Jon McNeil said. 
"When you look at raw data, you need to look at all the data. The performance 
scores are just not an accurate indication of what we do here every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Arrow High has an enrollment of 103 students, many of whom come from troubled 
families and have disciplinary problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we are one of the finer alternative schools," McNeil said. "We see a 
lot of kids who were once good students but fell off the edge due to some 
family crisis. Our job is to put them back together again." 
</P>
<P>
 The report itself does a disservice to some cities, critics such as Bibbiani 
say, because it implies that students can't get a good education in urban 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This report rewards the affluent suburbs and smites the rest of us," Bibbiani 
said. "Poor kids drop out because they need jobs, which has no bearing on the 
quality of the school."

DEVASTATING FIRE HELPED BRING MALIBU TOGETHER; RECOVERY: SOME PROCLAIM THE '93 
BLAZE AS THE FLEDGLING CITY'S COMING OF AGE. 'THERE IS A BOND. WE ARE LIKE A 
FAMILY,' SAYS A LOCAL BUSINESSWOMAN. 
</P>

<P>
 Disaster tests any community. But for fledgling Malibu, incorporated in 1991, 
last year's firestorm ranks as perhaps the city's defining event. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year has passed since flames destroyed 270 houses, stripped the 
rugged hillsides of vegetation and changed the face of this seaside community 
of 11,730 residents, many of whom came to Malibu for privacy and scenic beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 The city government, which was still in the process of getting its municipal 
legs when the disaster hit, also was altered by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Some proclaim the fire as the city's coming of age. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a chemical change in this community," said Karen York, who along 
with her husband, Arnold, owns the weekly newspaper Malibu Times and founded 
Operation Recovery, a support group for fire victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was outreach and support from the whole community. There is a bond. We 
are like a family." 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks of the disaster, Operation Recovery was formed, holding weekly 
meetings that became a lifeline for some residents, who called themselves 
"burn-outs." 
</P>
<P>
 Out of mutual sorrow, many fire survivors who had known each other only 
superficially became close friends. Political foes set aside differences to 
work toward common interests. And the community, often a dichotomy of heavily 
developed east Malibu versus largely rural west Malibu, worked seamlessly to 
aid survivors of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city grew up," said California Coastal Commissioner Madelyn Glickfeld, 
whose house burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing about 500 east Malibu residents who had lost their homes, 
Operation Recovery quickly became a political force. Its members persuaded city 
leaders to alter building regulations and begin replacing the La Costa 
neighborhood's water system, which was inadequate for fighting fires. (La Costa 
is a hillside neighborhood in east Malibu, just off Pacific Coast Highway 
between Rambla Pacifico and Carbon Canyon.) 
</P>
<P>
 At City Hall, where some residents had accused the City Council of 
micro-managing the staff, city employees were given broader latitude to handle 
the crisis. Among other changes, seven additional employees were hired, time 
was set aside on the council's weekly agenda for fire survivors to speak, and 
building permit fees and planning review requirements were waived. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fire victims have complained that the city's inevitable red tape slowed 
rebuilding efforts, but they and others say that, despite the delays, the 
ordeal of the fire helped local government mature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council has had to evolve from a being a homeowners association to 
being a professional body," said Ron Goldman, a local architect. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager David N. Carmany agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most big cities develop their personalities in the first decade 
(after incorporation), and this has helped the city of Malibu," Carmany said. 
"Before the fire, it felt like 'Mayberry RFD'; now we have voice mail. . . . 
There is definitely a resiliency, a can-do spirit here. People are going to 
find solutions to their problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Jean Craig, a 10-year resident of Malibu whose home in La Costa burned, 
the majority of fire survivors say they knew their neighbors by face but not by 
name. After their homes were destroyed, shell-shocked residents gathered at 
Operation Recovery meetings to confront what seemed an endless parade of 
insurmountable problems -- inadequate insurance, burned foundations not covered 
in policies or tough, expensive geological conundrums. The group grew close 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the fire, I used to see this kindly man I would say hello to as I was 
walking my dog by his house," said Craig, who is writing a first-person account 
of the fire and its aftermath for a book she plans to self-publish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked together to rebuild our homes. . . . If I had a crisis, I could go 
two doors down and knock on the door and Zane (Meckler) would be there. There 
are six people I could do that with now whom I could not do that with before." 
</P>
<P>
 Meckler, a 21-year resident of Malibu and a former president of the Malibu 
Democratic Club, says that in the six months after the fire, Operation Recovery 
meetings were like religious gatherings. He says the sessions were both painful 
and therapeutic. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors would see each other at the Operation Recovery meetings and "the 
more harried they would become, the more (they) would huddle together and say, 
'Whaddya think,' " Meckler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our friends are now people all over the hill. . . . These are live human 
beings now, not just names on a list. . . . We check on each other. . . . A lot 
of things in common were unearthed by the fire. Jean's now not only a neighbor 
but a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Although largely untouched by the fire, west Malibu residents held a 
fund-raiser for Operation Recovery. Churches, a synagogue and other groups 
helped residents get basics such as clothing and shoes, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire did create a sensitivity in the people of west Malibu who thought, 
'There but for the grace of God go I,' " said Jody Stump, who lost her La Costa 
home. "Before, there was this strange schism. It still exists, but there is a 
sensitivity and tolerance that we're all Malibuites." 
</P>
<P>
 Support from Malibu's business community also forged new bonds. Dry cleaners 
offered free cleaning of smoke-damaged clothes, restaurants served meals 
gratis, and nurseries gave away plants. And residents responded in kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I threw a bar mitzvah for our son and normally we would buy at a 
discount store," said Michael Rubin, who lost his home in the fire. "But I 
said, 'Let's give the business to Pete' (the owner of Country Liquor). We had 
about a $500 bill. All these people lost the bulk of their business last year. 
We wanted to give it to them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere was residents' newfound cooperation demonstrated more tangibly than 
through Operation Recovery. The idea for the group came when a bereft Arnold 
York, whose La Costa home burned to the ground, called an Oakland survivors 
group created after the 1991 fire there, looking for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us, 'If you are going to rebuild, you're going to have to get 
organized, because it was a crisis a week,' " said York. Craig says York in 
many ways became a visible symbol of recovery efforts, much as actor Edward 
James Olmos did by sweeping up broken glass in the days immediately after the 
Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 With a brain trust of talent -- including lawyers, architects, writers, 
artists and entrepreneurs -- the fire survivors had the makings of a small but 
potent lobbying force. Subgroups were created to haggle with insurance firms 
and address such fire prevention questions as creation of a volunteer fire 
department and a new water system. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, it was almost a 12-step program, I'm not kidding," Arnold 
York said as he sat in his Malibu Times office at the bottom of Las Flores 
Canyon Road. "It was solace, but we also had an agenda to rebuild. We told our 
insurance companies that if they didn't behave themselves we would issue them a 
report card. We focused political energy on them and told them we were going to 
make what they said public so they could be held accountable. We wanted to hold 
their feet to the fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressure also was applied to both the city and the Fire Department. Malibu 
Times reporters doggedly covered all rebuild issues, supplemented by editorials 
on the subject, mostly written by York. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Malibu Times became a mouthpiece for all of us in the sense that it had 
anything you needed to know in it, from information about the Red Cross (to) 
recovery groups or how to reach the state Insurance Department," Meckler said. 
</P>
<P>
 York, a lawyer who bought the newspaper in 1987, had been seen as a vitriolic 
critic of the city government. But he and other critics set aside most of their 
differences with the city to work toward fire relief, according to members of 
Operation Recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire brought together strange bedfellows," said Art London, a retired 
attorney whose Carbon Mesa home burned and who has mostly disagreed with York 
about local politics. "People who are hostile to the city and people who are 
supportive of it worked together for a common cause. Differences were not 
relevant. It made some of these people sound like apologists." 
</P>
<P>
 Counted among the accomplishments of Operation Recovery is a set of new 
"custom development criteria" for the La Costa neighborhood. Established in the 
late 1920s, the area was one of the first developments in Malibu. About 110 of 
La Costa's 250 houses burned. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by fire survivors in the neighborhood, La Costa residents organized into a 
homeowners association. After getting signatures from a most residents, the 
group successfully lobbied the city to increase the neighborhood's allowable 
house size from 1,885 square feet to 3,400 square feet for the area's typical 
50-by-100-foot lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The new standard was more generous than the 10% house-size increase that the 
city initially granted to fire victims because house sizes in La Costa had 
remained largely unchanged since the community was first developed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "To get 60% of Malibu residents to agree to anything is nothing short of 
extraordinary," York said. "We had to move houses, change views. It wasn't 
easy. People had to set aside their own private desires to do what was best for 
the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fire, the City Council was loathe to relax its strict building 
restrictions, responding largely to pressure from west Malibu residents 
concerned about protecting open space. But after the blaze, the council was 
forced to moderate its restrictive stance somewhat to meet the reconstruction 
needs of east Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 The tragedy clearly affected city government. There was doubt that the young 
city, with just 12 full-time employees, could handle the demands of cleanup and 
rebuilding. To "staff up," Carmany hired seven more full-time employees. To do 
so, Carmany said, the city cut its spending on outside consultants and used the 
savings to pay for the new hires. 
</P>
<P>
 But as painful as the recovery has been, the consensus is that the community 
and city came together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government around here was a hobby," Arnold York. "It has become a necessity. 
The fire matured our counsel . . . (and) welded us into a very active small 
town."

DAYS MAY BE NUMBERED FOR ARTIFICIAL OIL ISLANDS; LONG BEACH: WITH THE AMOUNT OF 
CRUDE PRODUCED DROPPING OFF, THE LONG HISTORY OF DRILLING APPEARS NEARING ITS 
END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Palms and banana trees rustling in the ocean breeze. Hibiscus and impatiens in 
bloom. White water tumbling into the sea. It's a perfect little tropical island 
-- in the middle of Long Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But step off the boat and you see that it's all a facade, propped up with 
struts and cable, like the television set of "Gilligan's Island." 
</P>
<P>
 This granite atoll -- one of four in the harbor -- isn't graced with grass 
shacks, it's gridlocked with pipelines and storage vats. Inside the fringe of 
palm trees, men and women in hard hats scoot around on forklifts or lug heavy 
pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone flips a switch and the waterfall dribbles to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The real reason for all of the hardware on Grissom, as this island is called, 
can be observed off to the edge, where a technician in a trailer studies a 
video monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture, supplied by a tiny television camera 5,200 feet beneath the 
surface, shows shiny black globules, clustering like grapes, skittering along 
the rim of a pipe toward the surface in an odd, bouncy motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil has been a part of Long Beach for more than 70 years -- a get-rich-quick 
medium, then a source of urban blight as messy oil derricks proliferated and a 
large swatch of Long Beach real estate began to sink alarmingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost 800 million barrels later, it's a mostly clean, smooth-running 
operation on four "tropical" islands and a mainland platform, using a motivated 
crew of 200 ("Where else can you work on an island in the Pacific and go home 
at night?" said one engineer) and all the smart drilling technology. 
</P>
<P>
 But its days appear to be numbered. The so-called Long Beach unit, stretching 
from downtown Long Beach out into the harbor, was producing about 150,000 
barrels of oil a day in the 1960s. Now it turns out a lean 47,000 barrels with 
a host of new mining techniques to scour each nook and cranny for undiscovered 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still a lot of the black stuff down there, experts say, but some oil 
companies are thinking about the day they pack it in. Some already have. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months ago, three companies looked at the balance sheet in Long Beach and 
decided they weren't going to pay any more royalties to the city's 13,000 
"townlotters," the individuals who own the mineral rights to the real estate 
properties sitting on top of a small portion of the oil field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was inevitable that there would come a time when the working interest 
owners (the oil companies) would start losing money," said Arco official Steve 
Freeman. "We're at that point now." 
</P>
<P>
 As lessors of the mineral rights, the oil companies, which have been paying as 
much as 49% of the profits to the townlotters, always had the prerogative to 
pull out when profits got skimpy. It was written into their leases, oil company 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco, owner of THUMS Long Beach Co., which manages the oil field, will 
continue to be involved in the production part of the business. But Phillips 
Petroleum will stay only as a minor investor, and Chevron is pulling out 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement sent the townlotters, most of them heirs and small investors 
who had been reaping an average of $350 a year, scrambling to their 
calculators. Starting this month, if the townlotters -- about 13,000 of them -- 
want to hold onto their claims, they'll have to ante up a proportionate share 
of the oil field's operating costs, just like any other investor hoping for 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The townlotters' share of the operating costs would average about $92 a year, 
according to oil company officials.  
</P>
<P>
 The so-called townlot, the portion of the oil field that lies under the city, 
represents about 8% of the Long Beach unit.  
</P>
<P>
 If townlotters stick around until the operation closes down, they'll have to 
bear a share of the multimillion-dollar shutdown costs, according to the terms 
of the lease agreements with the oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer you stay in, the more exposed you are to having to help pay for 
the abandonment of the field," said Mel Wright, whose wife, Jonine, shares the 
mineral rights to a small piece of property in the Belmont Shore area. "Every 
day that goes by, it gets a little closer." The alternative is to sell to other 
investors or just abandon their claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma of the townlotters highlights a $64,000 question being asked by 
everybody with a stake in the unique urban oil field, which is still studied by 
visiting oil technicians from around the world: How long can it continue to 
produce oil profitably? 
</P>
<P>
 Xenophon C. Colazas, the city's director of oil properties, thinks there are 
more than 10 good years left. "That's my opinion, of course," says Colazas, a 
petroleum engineer who has worked in the Long Beach unit for 34 years. "It all 
depends on economics." 
</P>
<P>
 One part of economics is the price of oil, which has been holding at a modest 
$13.50 a barrel for several months, but which dipped to a measly $8.50 last 
December. In 1990, as Iraq invaded Kuwait, Long Beach oil brought $24 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it goes the way it did in December," says Wright, a former oil company 
executive who works as a petroleum consultant, "they'll have to abandon the 
field. This is a business. People are in it to make money." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, THUMS (an acronym for Texaco, Humble, Union, Mobil and Shell, 
the five companies that combined in 1964 to bid on leasing the field) continues 
to put money into the oil islands in an effort to sop up every sticky drop of 
crude down there. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, for example, the company has begun using sophisticated 
drilling bits that can cut sideways into once-inaccessible pockets of oil. 
Technicians are using new solvents that dissolve crusty asphalts to free the 
flow of crude and are employing computer programs that monitor flows and 
pressure buildups in the wells. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these, along with an aggressive drilling program, increased 
productivity last year by 2,500 barrels a day, from about 44,500, THUMS 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Area supervisor Chris Hartman stands over a computer monitor in a little 
office and scans a graphic showing water pressure and production rates for the 
more than 300 wells on Grissom. (The islands are named for four astronauts who 
died in accidents in 1967, three in the notorious launch-pad fire of that year, 
including Virgil I. (Gus) Grissom.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have to go with a pressure gauge from well to well and write the 
data down by hand," Hartman says. "This frees you up to do something more 
productive." 
</P>
<P>
 But all the new techniques and equipment can't get around the increasingly 
watery mix that the wells are producing from the aging field. 
</P>
<P>
 When drill bits first cut into the Long Beach unit in 1965, THUMS wells 
brought up a rich, sludgy brew that was only 20% water. Lately, wells on the 
oil islands have been bringing up a thin gruel that is more than 92% water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water cut increases as the field gets older," Colazas says. 
</P>
<P>
 More water means more processing -- and higher power bills for a company that 
already spends more than $22 million a year for electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil business has been very good to Long Beach, which technically owns the 
Long Beach unit, and to the state of California. City officials estimate that 
Long Beach has pulled in $433 million in revenue from the field in the past 55 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the city's profit, however, came before 1964, when the state 
Legislature, asserting that the city is only the state's trustee rather than 
sole beneficiary of the field, enacted legislation giving the state the lion's 
share of oil revenues. An earlier bill, using the same rationale, had allowed 
the state to seize $122 million in accumulated oil revenues from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1964, the state has drawn an estimated $4.3 billion from the Long Beach 
unit; the city has earned a relatively modest $246 million. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the city expects to get $1 million in tidelands oil revenues, plus 
about $3 million in interest from a fund set up to pay to prevent land above 
the field from sinking, an occurrence known as subsidence. The state stands to 
earn $41 million. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still remnants of the early oil business around town, but long gone 
are the black gushers, drilling towers and brawling roughnecks of the 1920s and 
1930s. Nowadays, the city's oil business apart from the Long Beach unit 
consists of a few fields around the city, such as those near Signal Hill, with 
seesawing oil pumps called rocking horses. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1921, an 80-foot-high black geyser, which took four days to cap, 
marked the first productive oil well in the city. By 1924, Signal Hill (which 
incorporated as a separate city that year) sported a Sherwood Forest of 
derricks, with enormous Erector Set towers bristling across the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first oil from the lucrative Wilmington field, which stretches from 
Wilmington to Seal Beach, wasn't drawn until 1939, when a wildcatter touched 
off a gusher on the west side of town, near the present Pacific Coast Highway. 
It was soon clear that this was a monumental field -- the third largest in the 
United States -- and that its richest part was under Long Beach Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 As rig operators rushed to exploit the field, however, the spongy layers of 
shale and sandstone on which Long Beach was built began to sink. By the late 
1950s, a bowl-like cavity, 29 feet deep at its lowest point, had appeared 
around Terminal Island in the Port of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings cracked, subterranean pipelines snapped and railroad tracks twisted 
like paper clips. Removal of the oil was undermining the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists proposed injecting water into the subterranean cavities. An 
intensive program of injection quickly solved the problem, stabilizing the 
ground and, in some cases, raising it a few inches. Independent operators who 
had resisted the program, thinking it would dilute their returns, found that 
injection often loosened hard-to-retrieve seams of oil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like other cities, Long Beach had resisted offshore drilling for aesthetic 
reasons. But in 1962, voters approved a highly restrictive drilling referendum 
to exploit the rich deposits under the harbor.  
</P>
<P>
 The referendum permitted offshore drilling as long as it was done from a 
series of small islands, landscaped to "blend with the shoreline and add to the 
natural beauty of the offshore area." 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a Southern California solution to a messy problem. THUMS built 
an "ersatz archipelago," as one writer described the islands, complete with 
Tahitian-looking panels to muffle machine noise and pastel-paneled "condos" to 
disguise drilling equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing the number of people who ask how they can stay in those hotels 
out there," says William Guerard, oil and gas supervisor for the state 
Department of Conservation and a former field inspector in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Their unusual appearance aside, the islands were monumental engineering 
achievements. More than 640,000 tons of rock was barged in from Catalina Island 
to form outer rims, and 3.6 million cubic yards of sand was dredged up to fill 
the centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1965, 1,305 offshore wells have been drilled, about a quarter of them 
injection wells to prevent subsidence. Oil, water and gas are separated in huge 
vats, then the petroleum products are funneled into a network of 140,000 feet 
of steel pipeline that carries them to mainland refineries. 
</P>
<P>
 The water is filtered to remove minerals and bacteria that might gunk up the 
drilling equipment, and reinjected. 
</P>
<P>
 THUMS' engineers, geologists, riggers and roustabouts are ferried from a dock 
near the Queen Mary to their stations on the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind one of those condo facades one recent day, workers guided 90-foot 
lengths of steel pipe, dangling from a winch, through a rotating platform.

BOYS' BASKETBALL 1994-1995 / SMALL SCHOOLS; BERRY HOPES HIS VOICE WILL SPUR ON 
HERALDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Berry is hard to miss at Whittier Christian. If his 6-foot-5 frame 
doesn't attract attention, his booming voice will. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry has taken it upon himself to be the motivator for the Heralds this 
season as they attempt to defend their Olympic League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Berry quietly went about his work in the shadows of 6-8 brothers 
Tyler and Trevor Ream and wound up on the all-league first team. 
</P>
<P>
 With his new vocal game to back up versatile court moves, Berry is hoping to 
be heard across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself to be a leader this season," he said. "I've been doing a 
lot of talking in practices, trying to get everyone psyched up." 
</P>
<P>
 Berry remembers the quick exit from the playoffs after a first-round loss to 
Downey Pius X last February; it's a memory he would like to forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "They caught us off guard," he said. "We didn't respect their outside 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 For Whittier Christian's opponents, those words might sound strikingly 
familiar. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry has riddled many defenses that haven't respected his shooting range. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I have a smaller defender, I want the ball in the low block," he said. 
"But if I'm hot, I want the ball outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier Christian Coach Bob Brown, who has coached teams at the school for 16 
years, said Berry provides a matchup problem for opposing teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has incredibly efficient post moves, but he's also an excellent 
three-point shooter," Brown said. "The defense can't sag off on the perimeter 
because of his shooting ability." 
</P>
<P>
 With Trevor Ream back for his senior year, Brown has the luxury of posting 
both players simultaneously or putting Berry on the outside to take advantage 
of double-teams on Ream. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of teams, they are a tough pair to match up with," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, the defense tended to double Tyler (Ream) and I got a lot of open 
shots," said Berry, who averaged 9.2 points. "Against Capistrano Valley 
Christian, they held Tyler to six points but I had about 21." 
</P>
<P>
 Berry is not big on keeping his statistics in his shirt pocket; just give the 
Heralds a victory and he goes home happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if I score nine points or five or 15, I just want to win," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry hopes to walk on at Louisiana Tech next year, which could be considered 
a big-time step for a small-school player. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Berry thinks he's found a way to get onto the Louisiana Tech team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think kids who live around Louisiana will want to go there because 
they're on probation," he said. "That could open a door for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Berry's father attended Louisiana Tech and during Thanksgiving the family 
visited the school, a sign that Berry is not just a dreamer. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry is also realistic about the importance of schoolwork after seeing his 
grades slip at Whittier Christian. The marks began to slump from A's and B's as 
a freshman to B's and C's last year. 
</P>
<P>
 However, another remedy was not far away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schoolwork used to be a breeze for me, but it's recently hit me hard," he 
said. "I'm starting to wise up though." 
</P>
<P>
 As with anything else for Berry, it's only a matter of time.

BOYS' BASKETBALL 1994-1995 / SMALL SCHOOLS; KIMBLE'S POTENTIAL KEEPS HIS COACH 
ON THE SIDELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's common for small schools to have high turnover rates among coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Player enters school. Parent coaches team. Player graduates from school. 
Parent stops coaching team. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Huntington Beach Claremont, George Watson has returned to coach the 
Cougars for a second year even though his son, Gavin, has moved on to Ventura 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson's main reason for staying was Steve Kimble, the all-league forward who 
averaged 22 points for the Cougars last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to come back this year because of Steve and a couple other guys," 
Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble and a handful of teammates are usually all Watson can get on the floor 
for his practices. 
</P>
<P>
 With only 150 students in the private school, good athletes are hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kimble has been a diamond in the rough for Watson, a 6-foot-9 former 
USC star who also played for the New Jersey Nets. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Kimble had double figures in points, rebounds and assists five 
times and teamed with Gavin Watson for more than 90% of Claremont's offense as 
the Cougars finished with a respectable 7-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gavin Watson gone, Kimble will have to take on even more responsibility, 
but that's something he's been doing his whole life. 
</P>
<P>
 His younger brother, Dan, has muscular dystrophy and the 16-year-old has 
recently been confined to a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrasting lives the brothers lead is something they both openly share 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a 50-50 chance I would have contracted the disease," Kimble said. "It 
could have just as easily been me in a wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble said his brother is a big sports fan, and he regrets him not having the 
chance to play one-on-one or take batting practice while growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I wish he could do is play sports," Kimble said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble now wishes he would have attended a different school to play sports. 
When Kimble entered Claremont, he did not consider himself an athlete, but the 
Cougars' small-time program did not deter him. 
</P>
<P>
 He played his freshman year on a hapless team that went 0-16, but during his 
sophomore year things began to turn around for the Cougars, and Kimble grew 
attached to the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimble now wishes he would have tried the public school route, where he 
believes he would receive more attention from college recruiters.  
</P>
<P>
 "I play with the guys from the public schools in the park and I hold my own 
against them," he said. "George is a good coach and I've learned a lot from 
him, but I would've been better tested at a public school. I live in the 
(Lakewood) Mayfair district and I think I could play with them."

HOMES ON-LINE -- CALL IT VIRTUAL REALTY; TECHNOLOGY: THANKS TO ADVANCES IN 
ORANGE COUNTY AND THE VALLEY, MORE AND MORE CONSUMERS ARE REAL ESTATE SHOPPING 
BY COMPUTER -- WITHOUT ALL THAT DRIVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 "I want this one!" says 3-year-old Evan Donnelly, pointing to the color 
photograph of a tile-roofed house scrolling up on his parents' computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, this house is too small -- I can tell," said Mary Donnelly, sitting with 
her son in their Yorba Linda bedroom and turning toward her husband, Brian. "Go 
to the next one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a click of the mouse, the computer brings up another house matching the 
Donnellys' list of preferences. The routine is a familiar one for the family, 
which spends its evenings shopping for their dream home -- without ever leaving 
Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Not keen on spending their weekends driving aimlessly through unfamiliar 
neighborhoods, the Donnellys use time after work "visiting" properties via 
computer, weeding out obviously unsuitable houses. Using a CD-ROM program 
developed by a company in Brea, the couple say they have found a high-tech way 
to eliminate some of the tedium, frustration and stress from home buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "With two children, looking for a home can be an exhausting process," Mary 
Donnelly said. "This makes it easy." The Donnellys aren't alone in turning to 
computers for help in home shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 When more than 17,000 real estate brokers gathered in Anaheim in November for 
their annual national conference, the group focused on how to give clients more 
electronically packaged information. Computers anchored almost every booth as 
attendees gathered to buzz about the latest high-tech marketing tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Most agents have come to realize that colorful yard signs, open 
houses and a smiling realtor are no longer the best way to sell a home. Now 
using sophisticated data sources to compete, realtors from the San Fernando 
Valley to Fountain Valley are among the first in the nation to use on-line 
systems. And as major real estate companies rush to travel the so-called 
information superhighway, yesterday's real estate broker could be left rolling 
behind like a fallen hubcap. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtors are betting that, like the Donnellys, their clients will demand more 
and better information before they begin shopping for a home. Though some 
brokers are nervous about giving up some control, most predict that shoppers 
will one day work only with brokers who provide the most complete and current 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "The floodgates are about to open," said Mark Surfas, director of on-line 
communications at Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate in Mission Viejo, one 
of the nation's largest real estate brokerages with more than 2,300 offices. 
"We're blending a lot of different technologies together and turning this into 
a real estate information Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These days, shoppers can select their next dwelling on computer kiosks located 
in seven California malls, including one in Mission Viejo. A kiosk is slated to 
be installed in the Glendale Galleria and five other malls next year. Computers 
have replaced model homes in Aliso Viejo, where buyers instead look at 
computerized images of home designs developed by two Orange County companies. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the ultimate home-buying experience, consumers may one day use virtual 
reality centers -- with computer-generated, three-dimensional house designs -- 
to "walk through" rooms of houses or even entire neighborhoods without ever 
going outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 While on-line networks aren't yet available in most of Southern California, 
the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors has unveiled a new system where 
buyers can use a computer network to choose a home, electronically fill out 
escrow and title information, and get preliminary mortgage approval in a single 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the only board in the country doing this. I take my hat off to 
them," said Almon R. Smith, executive vice president of National Assn. of 
Realtors, which is developing a nationwide system based on the Valley model. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is sweeping the entire industry. When you get down to it, real estate -- 
more than anything else -- is about the flow of information. Everyone's trying 
to figure out how to link things together." 
</P>
<P>
 With 7,500 members, the San Fernando board is the nation's third largest 
realty board and the largest in California. It is also the first to offer its 
members a network that stores up to 10 color photographs of each home listing, 
full descriptions of the house, recent home improvements and information on 
local schools. Designed by Pacific Bell, the system can also create a list of 
properties tailored to a buyer's specifications and print out maps showing the 
location of every home. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Century 21 office located just up the street from the Northridge Meadows 
apartment complex where 16 tenants died in the Jan. 17 earthquake, Lisa and 
Bill Smith are shopping for their "first real home." The couple saw their condo 
damaged in the earthquake, but neither are willing to give up on the Northridge 
area. They admit, though, that neighborhoods littered with earthquake-damaged 
homes add a special challenge to home buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see right here, the chimney is gone," said their realtor Marc D. 
Schwartz pointing to a picture of a Northridge home on the computer.  
</P>
<P>
 "On your typical listing, it would just say, 'needs some TLC' or 'slight 
earthquake damage.' With the computer listing we can tell right away we don't 
want it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz plugs in the Smiths' specifications -- three bedrooms, maximum price 
of $160,000, favorite neighborhoods -- into the computer and pulls up 75 
properties. The couple quickly scans through computerized photos of the homes, 
discarding the undesirables, especially those with serious earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants a big house, and I want a big garage," said Bill Smith, 30, who 
owns a window cleaning company. "This saves us so much time because we discuss 
it right here. Especially when you have kids, you don't want to spend the day 
driving around." 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are changing so rapidly, we had to change or we'd be left behind," 
said Alice McCain, president of the Valley realtor board. "We wanted to be on 
the forefront." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mission Viejo Mall, a computer kiosk designed by New Home Search offers 
buyers photographs and floor plans of homes. Using CD-ROM technology, buyers 
tour both new and resale homes just by touching a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking for a home is a grueling process," said John Giamo, head of Visual 
Listings Inc. in Brea, who joined with Jeff Meyers of the Meyers Group, a 
Newport Beach real estate data company, to create New Home Search in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now in the comfort of your home or in your broker's office, you preview the 
homes. For someone who wants to cut down on the problems, this is perfect," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Visual Listings also produces a real estate CD-ROM, packed with up to 25,000 
listings. About 30 consumers, including the Donnellys, receive the disc free in 
their homes each week as part of a test program and about 100 brokerages 
subscribe to the CD-ROM service for $35 a disc. The company charges about $20 
to brokers to place a listing for a resale home in the database and charges 
$150 to builders for new properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the service say the cost of manufacturing a CD-ROM is prohibitive 
-- though the company said each disc costs only about $6 to make and could go 
lower -- and point out that listings can expire quickly. Giamo admits that the 
program is still developing, but said computer users will be able to access the 
company's listings on the Internet by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Giamo said the system developed in the San Fernando Valley is tailored to meet 
brokers' needs, not those of consumers. His system, he said, is designed 
specifically for home buyers. And that, he says, makes Orange County realtors a 
little nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very frustrating situation with Orange County brokers; they have 
not embraced the technology, but consumers love it," Giamo said. "There is some 
fear of them being out of a job -- that is not the intent. We're just a 
marketing tool." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Smith, executive vice president of the East Orange County Assn. of 
Realtors, which with 2,100 members covers Santa Ana, Orange, Anaheim Hills and 
Tustin, acknowledged a certain resistance to change. But his group's agents can 
now put home listings on the Prodigy on-line service and said eventually all 
brokers will be on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been looking at similar things to what San Fernando Valley has done. 
We find our members are very receptive to some of the new high-tech 
innovations," Smith said. "But there is always some resistance to anything 
new." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a realtor for 25 years, predicts that Orange County brokers, despite 
initial reluctance, will eventually all be on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet, a global connection of computer networks and databases, will 
help provide a more intimate place to shop for a home. Offers and listings are 
already appearing on the World Wide Web, a subdivision of the Internet where 
members can advertise. The system allows for text to be combined with sound and 
even video, providing an opportunity to show many features of a home. 
</P>
<P>
 One is those companies is BayNet Co. in Palo Alto, which uses the World Wide 
Web to offer listings of houses for sale in the San Francisco area. Formed in 
July, BayNet contracts with listing companies to provide details on new and 
resale homes. It charges agents $35 for each listing and charges real estate 
brokerages $1,000 a month for up to 15,000 listings. It also contracts with the 
San Mateo Times to reproduce its real estate section and other news articles 
on-line.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our home listings are being accessed by 1,500 viewers a day -- some as far 
away as Japan and Hong Kong," according to Gabriel Gross, founder of BayNet. 
"Our next target is Southern California, where the Internet culture is not as 
strong as it is here." Some of America's largest real estate brokerage firms -- 
Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate and Century 21 Real Estate Corp., both 
based in Orange County -- are taking note, spending millions of dollars to get 
their hundreds of thousands of brokers wired with the latest high-tech sales 
gadgets.  
</P>
<P>
 Coldwell Banker is expanding its fledgling Scoop software program so that by 
early next year, consumers can walk into a Coldwell Banker office to look at 
pictures of various homes, check out schools and shop for a mortgage loan on 
the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential Real Estate Affiliates of Costa Mesa is building a $1-million 
center on the East Coast with interactive television to view homes -- virtual 
reality centers where potential buyers will "walk" through dozens of homes 
without leaving the office. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing missing are sales agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no salespeople there -- but you can find out about everything: 
homes for sale, mortgages and escrows," Prudential spokesman Ron Tepper said. 
"The real estate transaction is the most barbaric thing there is. We want to 
change that and give consumers what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not all brokers embrace multimedia home shopping. Realtors, through their 
local realtor boards, are used to controlling the information available 
regarding local homes for sale, and don't like the idea that listings could be 
accessed directly by a consumer. Some especially challenge the theory that one 
day a broker may no longer be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is still a lot of electronic sizzle," said Dick Rafferty, a broker with 
Electronic Realty Associates in Fountain Valley. "People don't buy homes off 
the computer. They have to go look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many realtors say that while computers can provide buyers with more 
information, buyers will still need a professional real estate broker to guide 
them during the sale. One of those is Garden Grove realtor Pat Neal, past 
president of California Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 "While it's going to be difficult getting the brokers to accept letting buyers 
have more control, we have to change because the clients have already jumped 
ahead and are demanding it," she said.

JAMES FLANIGAN: FLAT PRICES AT THE MALL BELIE ROILING CHANGE

 What better time than the Christmas shopping season to find surprises and 
possible investment bargains in the changing ways of the retail business and 
the defiantly vibrant apparel industry that puts clothing in the stores? 
</P>
<P>
 The subject is especially timely in the wake of Congress' overwhelming 
approval of a new international trade agreement, because global trade supplies 
at least a third of the merchandise you see in stores. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the season, first of all, is pretty good. Shoppers are turning out in 
department stores and such specialty retailers as Ann Taylor, Talbotts and 
Mervyns. But some discount stores in strip shopping centers -- Caldor, 
Bradlees, Clothestime -- report sales as flat or down from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a home-oriented Christmas," says analyst Joseph Ronning of Brown Bros. 
Harriman. "Consumers feel confident and are deciding this is the year to buy 
the big-screen TV or CD player." 
</P>
<P>
 The major department store companies, Federated, May, Broadway, Dillard, 
Dayton Hudson, "are doing good business -- better in fact than their low stock 
prices give them credit for," says analyst Lee Backus of Buckingham Research, a 
New York investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Backus thinks the market hasn't yet awakened to a confident consumer and to 
values in the stores and in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 America's highly competitive retail and clothing industries are unsung heroes 
in the fight against inflation. The cost of clothing in the consumer price 
index has gone up only 1.6% a year since 1990 and only 2.4% on average over the 
last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 And behind those restrained prices lies nothing short of a profound change in 
the way America moves the merchandise. Retail companies, from department store 
chains to discount outlets, have become highly efficient thanks to adroit use 
of computers in ordering merchandise and keeping inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 But one result of such efficiency is retail consolidation -- notably a 
shrinkage in the number of small dress shops -- with a major impact on clothing 
makers and other industries and institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business will never be as it was," says George Rudes, owner of St. 
Germain Inc., a Los Angeles manufacturer of women's fashions. Rudes, who has 
been in the garment trade for 40 years, recalls getting a start from his 
father, who had a fabrics business in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "He handed me an envelope with a piece of cloth and sent me into a building 
with garment manufacturers on every floor. I'd go to every one, show them the 
fabric and say I've got 800 yards in inventory, do you want to buy?," Rudes 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if stores that day were demanding more dresses in white twill or brown or 
whatever I had, then the manufacturers would buy the cloth and turn it into the 
hot fashion of the moment," he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days -- and until recent years -- apparel makers had many and varied 
customers. "It might be a small dress shop that would come with $4,000 worth of 
business a couple of times a year," says Rudes. Sales representatives would 
call on 200 accounts in Chicago, 150 accounts in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the business today bears no resemblance to five or 10 years ago," says 
Joel Presser, a Dallas-based regional sales representative who works for Rudes 
and other manufacturers. Today, major store chains order by computer from lists 
of approved vendors. The equivalent of the young man with the piece of cloth 
are fabric houses in Malaysia and Sri Lanka as well as South Carolina and 
Southern California hooked into a computer network with major store chains. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the United States, sales reps don't call on individual stores but on 
company headquarters -- on Limited in Columbus, Ohio, May Department Stores in 
St. Louis and J.C. Penney's in Dallas. "With closed circuit television, they 
patch you into 1,500 stores," says Presser. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are constant cost reductions for retail companies and a more 
exacting business for garment manufacturers, who find themselves in direct 
competition with suppliers in poorer, much lower-wage countries. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how you get restrained prices at U.S. shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Change makes casualties. The Chicago Apparel Center has leased 12 floors to 
the telephone company because they're no longer needed for manufacturers to 
display wares to customers; two floors are empty at the Dallas Apparel Mart. 
And Los Angeles' California Mart is restructuring its debt and coping with 
declines in traffic and tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But change doesn't mean decline. The U.S. apparel industry, while it has 
shrunk in total companies from more than 24,000 a decade ago to about 22,000 
today, and seen a 20% drop in employment to under 1 million, is not a fading 
business. U.S. apparel output has risen more than 20% to some $70 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the work and wages are better," says Jean Gipe, director of the Apparel 
Technology and Research Center at Cal Poly Pomona, a major resource of the 
Southern California garment industry -- which actually is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Gipe: "Computers and laser cutting machines make producing a garment 
today a far cry from the old worker at a sewing machine with a bundle of 
fabrics." The more skilled contemporary worker typically makes $7 an hour 
compared to $5 for the sewing machine operator. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, only some garment makers have joined the technological future; a 
lot of your clothing is still produced in gritty, low-wage factories. 
Nonetheless, the industry outlook is confident. At the American Apparel 
Manufacturers' recent convention, the hot topic was not fear of foreign 
competition but how to take advantage of export markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudes is both optimistic and coldly realistic. He knows that the garment 
business has become tougher with retail consolidation. The disappearance of the 
"mom and pop" dress shop has cut in half the number of outlets for his St. 
Germain line of women's apparel. "There's no security in the business," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Rudes' company, with about $37 million in annual sales, is 
doing better than ever because he formed a new division that sells junior 
clothing to Neiman Marcus and other major chains. In a word, Rudes adapted. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is not alone. "The apparel industry today has extremely talented 
people," Rudes says. "They are tremendous and I don't think any industry in the 
country can tell you more about how to do business." 
</P>
<P>
 News of the season is good indeed: Here are two traditional industries, retail 
and apparel, adapting to a changing world and offering reassuring proof that 
many people still have the gumption and energy of the kid with the fabric.

REPUBLICAN VICTORIES HAVE FARMERS SMILING AGAIN IN NORTH CAROLINA. BUT WITH 
HEALTH ACTIVISTS MAKING GAINS AND CIGARETTE JOBS DISAPPEARING, THESE REMAIN 
RESTLESS DAYS IN; TOBACCO COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUDY ABRAMSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in early autumn, tobacco farmers in this North Carolina hamlet and up and 
down the Tobacco Belt from here to Florida harvested the kind of crop that 
comes once in a decade: barn-busting yields of spectacularly perfect golden 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 But growers in the region, which produces most of the flue-cured tobacco that 
is rolled and smoked around the world, still felt under siege. As the bumper 
crop came in, the tobacco economy faced not only the possibility of whopping 
new taxes, but the devastating prospect of federal authorities regulating 
nicotine as a drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign against smoking had created jitters from the rich, flat fields of 
Pitt County to the cigarette capital of Winston-Salem, where machines roll and 
spit out millions of packs a week. Even here in the heartland of the weed, 
anti-smoking ordinances have sailed through local jurisdictions, and Durham, a 
community that long boasted of being the City of Tobacco, now promotes itself 
as the City of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more tobacco people wondered whether their future was behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Nov. 8, with the crop gone to market, a measure of joy returned to 
Tobacco Row. The Republican capture of the U.S. House of Representatives ousted 
Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Los Angeles) from his post as chairman of the House 
subcommittee on health and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman had been the most effective force in the galloping anti-smoking 
movement and the most implacable critic of the tobacco industry. By contrast, 
the House convening in January will be far less inclined to grapple with the 
health effects of smoking. Rep. Thomas J. Bliley (R-Va.), Waxman's probable 
successor as chairman of the subcommittee, has made it clear he isn't 
interested in pushing through more legislation to tighten the screws on the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effect of the election is to dim the gigantic spotlight on us," said 
Thomas Griscom, a spokesman for Winston-Salem-based R.J. Reynolds Co. "That 
being the case, we have a chance to step back and look at issues in a little 
more realistic way." 
</P>
<P>
 But scarred veterans on both sides of the great tobacco debate, beset by 
changes all around them, still look to the future with some trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are three of their stories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Davenport's great-grandfather bought land here in Pactolus right after 
the Civil War, and early one spring nearly 130 years ago, he set out his first 
crop of tobacco. From that day to this, the family has been inextricably bound 
to the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 As faithfully as the seasons have come and gone, the Davenports have put out 
their plants in March and April; stripped, bundled and cured their leaves 
during the sweltering summer, and taken them to market in the fall. Over the 
years, they have survived droughts, floods, hailstorms, hurricanes, hornworms 
and infestations of the dreaded Granville wilt. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Davenport, 48, and his brothers, Lawrence and Paul, shared in a 
momentous harvest. Hot, dry days and warm, humid nights caused the plants to 
develop robust root systems, each one a little factory generating nicotine for 
storage in the fat, green leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 With the demand for domestic tobacco falling, though, the Davenports and all 
the other tobacco farmers in the state were forced to take a 10% reduction in 
their allotment -- the acreage they are allowed to plant under a 60-year-old 
federal price-support program. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the brothers with 125 acres. Even so, the bumper crop meant lower 
prices. Now, taking into account next year's probable demand and the amount of 
leaf already in storage, there is a good chance that further quota reductions 
will be announced in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Davenport was feeling "gloomy, singled out and picked on" a few 
weeks ago, he and his brothers say they now feel rejuvenated. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a relief, what a relief!" he exclaimed. "For us, it is a very big deal 
that Waxman is no longer chairman of the health subcommittee. I can tell you 
that we feel a lot better, because the silent majority has finally come out of 
the woodwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, tobacco farmers across North Carolina will 
begin preparing their seed beds for next year's crop. Most will plant in 
January, but the Davenports, who have their own greenhouse for seedlings, won't 
start preparations until February. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, meanwhile, a cigarette tax hike is in limbo. Any move by the 
Food and Drug Administration to regulate nicotine as an addictive drug appears 
less likely. 
</P>
<P>
 But Waxman wasn't tobacco's only problem. The Labor Department has proposed a 
ban on smoking in the workplace, and the Justice Department announced an 
investigation into whether cigarette manufacturers breached antitrust laws or 
lied about spiking the nicotine content of cigarettes to hook customers. All of 
this has come in the wake of an Environmental Protection Agency finding that 
inhaling secondhand smoke increases the risk of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wonder what we can do to fight back, how we can fight back and why we 
fight back," Davenport said several months ago. "Eleven billion dollars a year 
is already collected in tobacco taxes, and it's already being used. If they 
raise taxes and consumption goes down, then there is going to be less tax money 
in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina's affair with tobacco goes back to the 16th Century. Its 
economy, social structure and institutions have been significantly shaped by 
the fortunes of America's first export. 
</P>
<P>
 The Davenport farm is in North Carolina's No. 1 tobacco-growing county, Pitt 
County. But the 15,000 acres now producing plants in the county amount to just 
half the acreage of a decade ago. Small farmers have fallen by the wayside, 
opting to rent or sell their allotments to big operators who can afford to 
mechanize. Some still derive nearly all their income from tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Davenports, however, have used their tobacco earnings to expand and 
diversify. For years, their father operated a grocery and hardware store, and 
in the 1960s he started an agricultural chemicals business. The brothers have 
gone into fertilizers, invested in a cotton gin and created a brokerage for 
wheat and soybeans. They have installed irrigation equipment and planted trees 
in nooks and crannies unacceptable for crops. The 300 acres their father farmed 
have grown to 2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the expansion into cotton, corn, wheat, soybeans and peanuts, 
the brothers still make 60% of their farm income from tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't make any money on corn," Davenport said. "We jumped into cotton, 
thinking it might pull us out, but it didn't. Same thing with peanuts. Aside 
from tobacco, it's wheat and soybeans that keep us alive. But that's not at the 
farm level; it's because we're the middleman." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Warden never smoked until he was past 40. He started six or seven years 
ago -- purely to spite the anti-smoking movement. He not only took up 
cigarettes, but started puffing cigars and lighting up an occasional pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 His aggravation is still unabated, and he keeps thinking up new ways to rail 
against what he considers a blatant intrusion on his individual rights. 
</P>
<P>
 His personal checks are imprinted with a tobacco plant. When he mails his 
monthly bills or pays a restaurant tab, he affixes a stamp with a message: 
"This bill was paid with tobacco money." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco has been good to Warden. It has made his life in Winston-Salem much 
easier than that of his father, who painted houses and dug graves for a living 
and died before his time, Warden says. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco money bought Warden a nice house in Lewisville. It bought him a couple 
of saddle horses and sent his son to college. It has taken care of him and his 
family for 33 years, ever since he came out of high school and got a job 
carrying trays of cigarettes from a rolling machine to a packing room at R.J. 
Reynolds Tobacco Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a hitch in the Army, Warden has spent his life at R.J. Reynolds. 
Now in the research department just across the street from the company's 
Whitaker Park cigarette plant, he is among the better-paid blue-collar workers 
in America, making about twice the salary of the average North Carolina 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 The average wage at R.J. Reynolds is more than $50,000. Operators of the 
rolling machines that now turn out billions of cigarettes a year in 
Winston-Salem can make close to $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great company," Warden said, "a great company." 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of Joe Wardens in Winston-Salem. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Winston that Richard Joshua Reynolds created the blended cigarette 
that has made North Carolina's flue-cured golden leaf world-famous. 
</P>
<P>
 The family and the company showered the community with support for worthy 
causes, and even prompted Wake Forest University to pick up and leave that 
locale for Winston. Over the years, the city has expressed its gratitude in 
innumerable and conspicuous ways, putting the Reynolds name on its airport, a 
high school, parks, streets and a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking, needless to say, has not gone out of style. Although nonsmoking rooms 
can be found in motels and nonsmoking sections in restaurants, smokers still 
light up in public places without inhibition. The community of 160,000 is a 
citadel of the smokers' rights movement, and Warden is one of its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, when the city of Greensboro plunged into a heated debate over 
an ordinance to create smoke-free places, Warden was among those who went off 
to show solidarity with embattled smoking forces. He was among the leaders of a 
caravan of 145 busloads of R.J. Reynolds employees last year who lobbied for 
tobacco and smokers' rights in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Clutches of smokers outside government office buildings raised their fists in 
support, he recalls. And as the demonstrators walked by congressional 
buildings, office workers held packs and cartons of cigarettes at their windows 
in a show of solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 But such demonstrations of support are not enough to save an industry. Warden 
and people like him are apprehensive about their future. Time was when a job at 
R.J. Reynolds was a job for life. One generation followed another into the 
plant. But that has changed. In the last 20 years, employment in the 
cigarette-making business in North Carolina has dropped by nearly a third. 
Soon, employment at R.J. Reynolds will be down to a little more than 8,000 -- 
about half what it was at the beginning of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what's really changed," Warden said. "You don't have that job security 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carla Fried is a nurse, the wife of a physician, the mother of two boys and, 
by conventional definition, an anti-smoking activist. 
</P>
<P>
 She teaches tobacco control in the Guilford County schools, serves on the 
national board of an organization called Stop Teen-Age Addiction to Tobacco, 
and continues to be a central figure in a well-publicized and long-running 
effort to limit smoking in public places in Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
 She has never met the Davenport brothers or Joe Warden, but she considers them 
-- like herself and the 12-year-old habitual smokers she counsels -- victims of 
the tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Davenports and Warden, however, she mourns Henry Waxman's loss of 
clout. "We were wiped out by it," she said, "wiped out." 
</P>
<P>
 Her work with students, she predicts, will be unaffected by the change in 
political currents. For public relations reasons alone, she said, the tobacco 
companies would never advocate a rollback in school programs that educate 
students on the hazards of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 But elsewhere, the anti-smoking movement is bound to suffer, she said: "The 
job before us is not impossible, but now it is going to be much more difficult. 
It is obvious that we will have to work very hard to find moderate Republicans 
who are concerned about public health." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before launching serious work on new coalitions, Stop Teen-Age Addition 
to Tobacco has opened a letter-writing campaign, urging Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), the Speaker of the House in waiting, that Bliley not be made chairman 
of the subcommittee chaired by Waxman. 
</P>
<P>
 When she came to North Carolina from New York to attend nursing school nearly 
20 years ago, Fried was a heavy smoker. In the big city, some restrictions were 
being imposed on smokers even then. But not here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, I was in hog heaven," she recalled. "I could go into a department store 
and shop with my cigarette in my hand. At the grocery, I could light up and 
relax while waiting in the checkout line. It was wonderful!" 
</P>
<P>
 Fried began smoking when she was 17 and continued through her first pregnancy. 
She quit only when her first toddler developed a chronic cough and she realized 
that the child had required a doctor's attention every month during his first 
year. Thus was born an anti-smoking crusader in smoking country. 
</P>
<P>
 She no longer works as a hospital nurse. Her dining room has been converted 
into an office that serves as headquarters for her struggle with the tobacco 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Fried is the first person to serve as a tobacco-control instructor in the 
county school system, counseling students found violating rules against smoking 
in schools. Her experience with young smokers and her husband's encounters with 
them in the emergency room at Wesley Long Community Hospital have galvanized 
her commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not an anti-smoker. I am not an anti-smoking activist," she said. "I 
could never be against smokers, because I used to be one, and I feel so sorry 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 During the battle over the Greensboro smoking ordinance, Fried says, she and 
others were subjected to threats. She lost her baby-sitter, whose father was an 
executive at Greensboro-based Lorillard Tobacco Co. The families stopped 
speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was eventually approved by a 2-1 margin in a 1989 citywide 
referendum, even though Lorillard is one of the town's biggest employers and 
Guilford County is home to a host of small tobacco farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the movement spread. Raleigh, the state capital, adopted similar 
restrictions. When the Legislature, under pressure from the tobacco lobby, 
preempted further local measures, other jurisdictions across the state rushed 
to consider ordinances before the state law took effect. Several adopted more 
stringent codes. The fight isn't over, however. Tobacco forces have lawsuits 
pending against the restrictions in Raleigh and against a move for smoke-free 
public buildings in Guilford County. 
</P>
<P>
 Fried considers herself on the side of the "worker bees" in cigarette 
factories and farmers who grow the golden leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the farmers to know we are not trying to put them out of business. In 
fact, we have written to Congress, making it clear that if there is an increase 
in the cigarette tax, we want a portion of it to go to the farmers," she said. 
"The anti-health industry isn't doing that. It uses the farmers as a front 
group, and its executives instill fear in their worker bees by making them 
think they will lose their jobs, that they will become poor and that they won't 
be able to send their children to school." Troubles Along Tobacco Row Both 
tobacco production and cigarette consumption are trending down in North 
Carolina, the heart of tobacco country.

READ THIS STORY ON RUDENESS! NOW! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, so the guy sitting next to you conducts every phone conversation as if he 
were in a hurricane. So the boss doesn't even nod back when you wish her a good 
morning. So all the folks in your department dip into the Kleenex box on your 
desk when they have the sniffles and not one of them has ever bought you a new 
box. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? These are just petty workplace grievances, and everybody has to 
endure a certain amount of rudeness, right?  
</P>
<P>
 Wrong.  
</P>
<P>
 It's true that a lot of rudeness fills the hours between starting time and 
quitting time. Rudeness is as embedded in the workplace culture as time cards, 
fluorescent lighting and computers, and it goes a lot deeper than bellowing and 
filching. In fact, all of society is a lot ruder these days, and what goes on 
at work is a reflection of that. Ask anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean you should put up with it. Although rudeness may be 
difficult to exorcise from the workplace, to let it continue is costly, say 
experts in workplace behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Rude treatment, by bosses or colleagues, can make workers miserable on the 
job, cause high turnover and result in lower productivity and lost customers.  
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, the experts say, rudeness reflects a lack of respect for other 
individuals or a lack of understanding of proper workplace behavior. It's 
generally a top-down kind of thing. The executives and managers set a company's 
code of behavior -- largely unwritten -- and either enforce the rules or permit 
rudeness through failure to correct it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People imitate what their superiors do, and so managers and senior managers 
are models," said Bill Buck, manager of clinical services for the employee 
assistance program of LifeLink, a Laguna Hills managed mental health benefits 
company.  
</P>
<P>
 Today's business climate has introduced even more opportunities for rudeness 
in the workplace. With new forms of communication such as electronic mail and 
faxes have come new pitfalls. Greater diversity in the work force means 
courteous behavior has more nuances. The recession and its aftermath of 
re-engineering and massive layoffs have brought a particularly debilitating 
form of disregard for the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard times seem to embolden some impolite managers, as if they feel that with 
so many people looking for work, employees are a dime a dozen. The employees, 
in turn, become more insecure and thus less apt to challenge rude behavior when 
confronted with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who are typically tough managers . . . tend to get worse when an 
organization is downsizing or re-engineering," said Joseph R. Weintraub, an 
organizational psychologist and a professor at Babson College in Massachusetts 
who studies rudeness in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew J. DuBrin, a professor of management at New York's Rochester Institute 
of Technology who specializes in organizational behavior, said companies have 
taken a "rude approach to laying off employees and downsizing. It's not handled 
with gentility." 
</P>
<P>
 DuBrin tells of employees who helped formulate a company's downsizing plans 
and then, when the task was finished, were told they would be gone too. 
</P>
<P>
 Think that's rude? Consider his tale of the worker who was assigned to type up 
a list of names of people to be laid off at his company. When the worker 
thought he had completed the task, his manager walked by and casually said, 
"Now put your name on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 Really. It happened. 
</P>
<P>
 As you might expect, not everybody agrees on what is rude behavior and what is 
poor management or unintentional messages born of poor communication skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are some behaviors that will make most everybody's list of 
workplace rudeness. Here are a few: 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting full credit for a project to which subordinates or colleagues 
contributed significantly. Standing uninvited but impatiently over the desk of 
someone engaged in another conversation or on the phone. Jabbering at 200 words 
a minute in a phone-mail message, then berating the recipient for not returning 
your call. Tying up people's faxes with information they would have told you 
they didn't want had you asked. Leaving a teaspoonful of coffee behind so you 
won't have to brew the next pot. 
</P>
<P>
 On what's rude and what's not, Laree Kiely is of a different school of 
thought. She's an assistant professor of business communications at USC's 
Business School who says it's best to sidestep the question altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rudeness is a value judgment," said Kiely, who is also director of the 
school's Teaching Center. "It means different things to different people. It's 
a generalized term and yet culture-specific. One culture says something is rude 
and another says it is not." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling one another rude or labeling actions as rude or polite "doesn't get us 
anywhere" in attempting to smooth workplace relationships, Kiely said. Instead, 
she thinks folks should learn new ways of interacting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is," Kiely said, "people have never really learned how to 
communicate with each other in straight ways without doing damage to their 
relationships, or negotiating their relationships so both have some room to 
change and some room to stay exactly the way they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Judith Martin, who as Miss Manners writes books and a syndicated column 
on etiquette, is much too mannerly to call anyone rude. But she is most certain 
about what is proper workplace decorum and what is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Manners (we call her that to avoid the impolite behavior of referring to 
her as "Martin" rather than "Mrs. Martin," as she would prefer) says diversity 
or no, there are certain standards of behavior that apply in professional 
circumstances in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "People understand this," she said. ""People who are in the work force and 
society, even if they have separate manners privately, learn, if they are to be 
at all successful, general American standards." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Manners attributes a lot of workplace breaches of etiquette to "this 
peculiar attempt to pretend that the workplace is not a workplace, that it is a 
social place where you go and celebrate birthdays, have parties, do things of 
that nature, call everybody by their first names, talk in a personal way and so 
on, which all sounds charming and lovely."  
</P>
<P>
 But it is not so pretty, Miss Manners maintains, because although colleagues 
may be friends, in the workplace they must be co-workers first and foremost. 
Otherwise, she maintains, productivity suffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Manners would prefer that co-workers address one another by last name and 
courtesy title, such as "Mr. Smith" or "Mrs. Jones." 
</P>
<P>
 Professional demeanor, she said, demands some "formality, some distance, so 
that you behave in a respectful and decent manner to people whether you like 
them or not."  
</P>
<P>
 Most business behavior experts say the first-name habit in many segments of 
the workplace is far too entrenched for a return to the etiquette of the past. 
In fact, one consultant advises workers to join in the very kind of workplace 
socializing Miss Manners disdains. 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Brinkerhoff, in his book "101 Commonsense Rules for the Office," 
advises readers to use an honorific such as "Sir" or "Mrs." when addressing the 
boss. But with colleagues he counsels the trappings of friendship: learning and 
using first names, participating in celebrations and collections for gifts, 
joining the coffee club, listening to (but not spreading) gossip and attending 
office parties (but not getting drunk in front of the boss).  
</P>
<P>
 There is one area of general agreement, however. Experts say business must 
take a stern view of discrimination and sexual harassment, behaviors that take 
rudeness a giant step forward into the zone of the contemptible -- and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lack of diversity was an incredible crime against civilization," Miss Manners 
said. "People were devalued because of race or gender -- that was a 
longstanding rudeness I hope we're coming out of. . . . It's part of the 
widespread problem of people not understanding you're there in the business 
role and the business role is what they should be looking at, not gender, not 
race or any other irrelevant factors. . . . It's professionally rude to notice 
these things even in a positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, perhaps, the group 9to5, National Assn. of Working Women, takes 
a somewhat lenient position on the issue of compliments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people out there who think that sexual harassment is nothing more than 
pitching woo in the workplace would say women's groups like ours would have 
women running to attorneys when men compliment women on how they look. That's 
not true," said Maripat Blankenheim, 9to5 public relations director. "It is 
rude to comment on a part of the body. That's rude -- not to say, 'You look 
nice.' And if they persist, it's sexual harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 For most workers, though, workplace rudeness stops well short of illegal 
behavior. Blankenheim says it's mostly a case of lack of common courtesy or 
sense.  
</P>
<P>
 So how is rudeness to be rooted out? From the experts, the first word is for 
managers and executives, who must establish a general code of conduct, set the 
example and carefully and with sensitivity enforce it. Allowing -- or worse, 
encouraging -- sniping, gossiping, backbiting, favoritism and other workplace 
sins is detrimental to the department's work and eventually to the manager's 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 For workers confronted with rudeness (or, as Kiely of USC might put it, poor 
communication), the most often recommended approach is the straightforward one: 
Go directly to the person involved and privately and gently state what is 
bothering you. ("It's really difficult for me to get my work done while you're 
on the phone. I wonder if you could speak more softly from now on.") 
</P>
<P>
 Phrasing your concern in terms of how it affects work or productivity is 
always the high road, the experts say. Remember: The offender may not realize 
he or she is being rude. Never say things such as, "Everybody is bored by 
hearing about your engagement for the gazillionth time." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are times when that approach will fail, or when the problem is so 
sensitive (a pungent body odor, for instance) that you can't bear to discuss it 
with the person in question. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when it's OK to turn elsewhere for help -- sometimes the boss or, if 
your company has one, a counseling service. If there is no such in-house 
service, consider speaking to an outside counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 If the offender is your boss or the boss's best buddy, you have fewer choices. 
Consider first whether you can put up with it (assuming it isn't illegal). If 
not, you can go to a counselor, seek out one of your boss's peers who is 
approachable and friendly with your boss, or quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Babson's Weintraub, who also operates a consulting group called Organization 
Dimensions, said that when consulting and leading seminars, he asks how many 
companies have had the problem of a worker with an offensive body odor. "More 
than 50% say they have had the problem," he said. "The most common response is 
avoidance, especially if it's a mixed-gender situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Avoidance is not the solution, because the employees may then take action, 
such as "leaving a bar of soap or Right Guard for the person, which is not how 
you want your employees treating each other," Weintraub said. "You (managers) 
have got to bring it up, got to sniff around on your own." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor should address the issue privately and as tactfully as 
possible, but without being so tactful as to be vague. Most people don't intend 
rudeness or don't know they are being rude, and that seems especially true of 
those whose breath or body odor is offensive to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Manners reminds us that another person's body odor is, for the most part, 
an "unmentionable." "The mere mention of it is an affront," she said. She 
advises workers with vexed nostrils to ignore the problem unless "you really 
can't stand it." Then, she said, it could be handled by the boss or a 
disinterested third party. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's smells or noises or general insensitivities, the workplace 
behavior experts warn it can spell trouble with a capital T. If left unchecked, 
"bit by bit, rudeness creates an attitude of ill will," DuBrin said. "People 
will have less loyalty and feel less compunction to leave the company on short 
notice . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the company is rude enough, it won't be able to retain the caliber of 
employees it wants," DuBrin said. "A lot of employees don't want to work around 
rude, insensitive people. The better trained, more talented will move on. . . . 
And if employees are too rude to customers, people stop shopping at the store. 
Rudeness can have a negative payout all around." 
</P>
<P>
 In short, workplace rudeness stinks. How RU-UDE! 
</P>
<P>
 It's ugly, but somebody had to round up this list of typical instances of 
workplace rudeness -- and how to deal with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody takes public credit for work you've done. Speak up, confronting the 
person right there, or "let the comment pass and then follow through, perhaps 
approaching a supervisor with a memo and in person, asking that (the) 
contribution be recognized in public." Maripat Blankenheim, 9to5  
</P>
<P>
 You make a suggestion or comment and the leader of the meeting ignores you. 
"The person might raise his or her hand again, and say something like, 'Perhaps 
I didn't frame my suggestion correctly; I'd like to clarify.' Then continue." 
Andrew J. DuBrin, Rochester Institute of Technology  
</P>
<P>
 A group of workers has formed a clique, often speaking to each other in a 
language the rest of the workers don't know. "If the manager orders 'only 
English' be spoken, it is just a Band-Aid. The supervisor needs to learn why 
there is the division, try to figure out the dynamics and form goals that will 
get the entire group working together." Laree Kiely, USC  
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers are having a loud discussion nearby while you're trying to work. 
"People aren't . . . intentionally trying to be noisy and rambunctious. If you 
went to them and said, 'I'm trying to get this report out,' most likely they'd 
feel bad and not do it again." Blankenheim  
</P>
<P>
 The "office pest" won't take hints to leave you alone. Simply say, "I'm sorry 
but I have work to do." If that doesn't do the trick, "you must tell the boss 
that you really can't get any work done under those circumstances." Miss 
Manners  
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers treat the candy dish on your desk as the departmental feeding 
trough. Remove the dish from sight. "An occasional offer . . . would perhaps 
alert the beneficiary to the fact that the treat did not merely grow wild on 
your desk." Miss Manners

VIEW FROM WASHINGTON / ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT; INSIGHT; PLAY THE BUDGET-BUSTER 
SWEEPSTAKES WITH GOP'S 'CONTRACT' PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT writes about banking, health care 
and other national issues from The Times' Washington bureau. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why should Newt Gingrich have all the fun? Let's all play the budget game. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine yourself a fresh-faced, eager, Republican member of the House. Your 
party is in charge for the first time in 40 years, and you're going to fulfill 
the "Contract With America." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the campaign document that promises a tax credit of $500 for every 
child in middle-class families, creates special new individual retirement 
accounts, cuts the tax rate on capital gains in half, offers tax relief for 
small business, repeals last year's increase in taxes on Social Security 
recipients, and modifies the marriage penalty for two-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to the Treasury: about $148 billion over five years, according to the 
Republican caucus on the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on supply-side theory, the Republicans figure that the tax cuts 
eventually will generate so much new business activity that some of those 
foregone revenues will be recouped. But current budget rules don't recognize 
that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 So the question remains: How do we get there from here? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the challenge before you if you enter The Times' Budget-Buster 
Sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Below is a menu of possible spending cuts and revenue increases -- totaling, 
in all, more than $300 billion -- gathered from the Congressional Budget Office 
and the Republican budgeteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Your task: Pick any combination of these items adding up to $148 billion to 
pay for the Contract With America. Then, explain how to get the package through 
both houses of Congress and win President Clinton's signature. Remember, you 
want to please the skeptical masses who voted Republican -- but you don't want 
angry interest groups screaming for your head. 
</P>
<P>
 Send your entries to me in care of the Los Angeles Times Washington Bureau, 
1875 I St. NW, Suite 1100, Washington, DC 20006. First prize winner gets a 
genuine Washington souvenir T-shirt -- and a heroic tribute in this column 
that's sure to be read by the Republican leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 OK. Let's jump right into the budget pot. Defense and Space 
</P>
<P>
 Military spending is still the biggest chunk of federal outlays. The Cold War 
is over, but American military planners worry about such hot spots as Bosnia, 
Haiti and the Middle East. Still, we could: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancel the Titan IV missile, used by the Air Force to launch early warning 
satellites. Five-year savings: $4.4 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Retire two aircraft carriers early and get rid of some aircraft squadrons. 
$8.6 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancel the new F-22 fighter. With the Soviet Union out of the game, the F-15 
can dominate any other air force in combat. $12.3 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate all but one of the Army's light divisions. Desert Storm used only 
heavy divisions, those with tanks and armored vehicles. $13.9 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancel the C-17 transport aircraft. Why not buy commercial planes when we 
need to expand the air fleet? $15.7 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut the military through early retirements with reduced pensions at 15 years 
of service. $5 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancel the space station. Scientists are dubious of its benefits. $11.4 
billion Domestic Programs 
</P>
<P>
 Is it time for everyone getting federal dollars to make a sacrifice? 
</P>
<P>
 * Millions of workers in private industry won't get a raise next year. Let's 
skip the annual cost of living increase for federal employees and retirees, and 
Social Security and Medicare recipients. Savings over five years: a whopping 
$54.9 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce federal aid for mass transit to 50% of the cost of projects, from the 
upward of 80% Washington now pays. Local governments would decide if they 
really need those costly subway systems. $11.8 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Cancel federal grants to cities and counties for waste-water treatment 
plants. $13.4 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate federal grants to airports, which could raise funds with passenger 
taxes, concession fees and landing charges. $9.2 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Scrap community development block grants for housing, roads and economic 
development. $23.9 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Drop low-income energy assistance. $11.1 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Charge market rates for power from federal hydroelectric plants. $4.8 
billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Farmers believe in free markets. Let's free them by scrapping the 
"deficiency payments" they get when the price of corn, cotton, wheat and rice 
drop below targets. $11.1 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Stop subsidies for agricultural exports. $4.2 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Washington pays 50% to 83% of the costs of Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children, Medicaid and food stamps. Reduce the federal share to 45% for 14 
relatively wealthy states -- including California and New York. $36 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Sell the government's fleet of trucks, buses and cars, except for those 
operated by the Postal Service. Why should the Agriculture Department have 
34,000 vehicles and the Interior Department a fleet of 26,000? $9 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Get rid of the Amtrak railroad operating subsidy and federal financing of 
track improvements in the Northeast. $3.1 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Change the Social Security formula to reduce the average benefit payment by 
3% for future retirees. $6 billion New Revenues 
</P>
<P>
 Can we collect more money for the services that the government offers certain 
groups of citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 * Small private planes don't pay their full share for using the nation's air 
traffic control network. $7 billion in new revenue 
</P>
<P>
 * Charge interest on student loans during school years, while continuing to 
let students defer payments until graduation. $9.5 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Medicare beneficiaries pay a monthly fee for the portion of the program that 
covers doctor bills, but the current premium pays only 20% of the true costs. 
Boost it to 25%, raising the 1996 premium to $51.90 per month from the 
scheduled $43.30. $17.4 billion 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase Medicare recipients' co-payment for doctor visits and services to 
25% from the current 20%. $16.3 billion

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: EXCITEMENT EVAPORATES FOR CANADIAN INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds.; 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pain felt by American mutual-fund owners this year is shared by investors 
north of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasm for mutual funds had been growing by leaps and bounds in Canada, 
with total assets doubling in size since the end of 1992. The Investment Funds 
Institute of Canada now counts 800 member funds -- a larger number of products 
per capita than in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Canada's stock market soft and bond market bruised by rising interest 
rates, some of the excitement has evaporated. Many shareholders have been 
redeeming their investments of late, especially people who had purchased funds 
on a no-commission basis through large Canadian banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, net sales have been running modestly negative since spring. 
</P>
<P>
 This makes it tougher for the handful of American fund companies with 
marketing operations in Canada. Fidelity Investments, Templeton, Piper Jaffray 
and G.T. Global all do business up north -- the last two starting fairly 
recently. U.S. fund companies must offer separate fund products in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 More firms could be on the way, following an interpretation by Ontario 
regulators this year that foreign companies don't have to set up an office in 
Canada to do business there. 
</P>
<P>
 One factor arousing the interest of U.S. fund companies is the relatively 
immature state of the industry in Canada. Despite a bountiful number of 
products up north, mutual funds tend to be considerably smaller than here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the (fund) industry will grow more dramatically in Canada," says Joe 
Canavan, president of G.T. Global Canada, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based 
G.T. Capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. has about six times as many funds as Canada, but with roughly 20 
times the assets. "The Canadian market has about the same level of growth as 
the U.S. did in 1985," says Chethan Lakshman, product manager for Fidelity 
Investments Canada. America's population is nearly nine times as large. 
</P>
<P>
 A turning point for the mutual-fund industry up north came a couple of years 
back, when Canadian banks -- which wield greater clout in the investment arena 
than their U.S. counterparts -- started to sell their own lines of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legitimization of mutual funds didn't happen in Canada until the banks 
started selling their proprietary products," says Lakshman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, four Canadian banks rank among the 10 biggest fund marketers in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly because of their smaller size and higher management fees, Canadian 
funds tend to be more costly to own than their American counterparts. However, 
expense ratios on Canadian funds are likely to compress as competition 
intensifies, predicts Rudy Luukko, mutual funds editor for The Financial Times 
of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the United States, funds loaded with a sales charge have captured the 
lion's share of the Canadian market. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interesting twist, Fidelity's Canadian operation sells all of its funds 
through brokers with loads attached -- a major departure from its American 
marketing focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Since setting up shop in 1987, Fidelity has become the No. 6 player overall 
and largest American entrant in Canada with $6 billion in assets. The company 
has a dominant 25% stake of the market in French-speaking Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Fidelity's largest market share in any jurisdiction in the world," 
says Lakshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity prospectuses are printed in both English and French, and some 
marketing literature is available in Cantonese to reflect the large Chinese 
population in many cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian investors tend to be more conservative than their American 
counterparts, in the sense they are more willing to seek out and pay for 
professional help, observers say. But Canadian shareholders have a larger stake 
in equity products than American fund investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadians have an important incentive to invest in the domestic stock and bond 
markets through their Registered Retirement Savings Plans -- tax-sheltered 
vehicles that operate much like individual retirement accounts in the United 
States but with larger contributions allowed. Non-Canadian investments are 
limited to a maximum 20% stake in these accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Canadians also have a reason to invest in other countries considering that 
Canada weighs in at only about 3% of global stock-market values. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a reasonably diversified portfolio, it's a lot more important for 
Canadians to have global holdings than Americans," says Luukko. 
</P>
<P>
 Global and international funds have figured prominently among the new products 
rolled out in Canada in recent years. At Fidelity's Canadian unit, for 
instance, three-quarters of the assets under management are invested in the 
United States and other foreign markets. Templeton and G.T. Global also are 
known for their international expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian residents who spend their winters in places like California, Arizona 
and Florida have yet another reason to invest internationally: currency 
depreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a 1991 peak, the Canadian dollar has dropped from about 89 U.S. cents to 
72 cents. That has eroded living standards for "snowbirds" visiting warmer 
climes in the United States, says Terry Ritchie, a Scottsdale, Ariz., certified 
financial planner with expertise in cross-border tax and investment matters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Canada's economy has been strong this year -- helped by the weak 
currency -- the general mood is negative, says Ritchie, who grew up in Calgary 
and makes frequent trips north. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of clients are looking for ways to get their money out of Canada," he 
says. The currency's decline, higher tax rates, huge government deficits and 
the failure of a large life-insurance company are some of the factors behind 
such thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 To satisfy investors nervous about currency considerations, several companies 
have come up with an interesting solution: Canadian mutual funds denominated in 
either Canadian or U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. mutual funds can't be marketed in Canada, Canadians who spend time 
in this country might want to purchase shares of American portfolios, says 
Robert Keats of Keats, Connelly & Associates, a Phoenix firm specializing in 
cross-border financial issues.  
</P>
<P>
 Buying U.S. funds isn't necessarily easy, as Canadians should be willing to 
apply for a U.S. Social Security number and have an address here, says Keats. 
And even then, Canadians still might encounter paperwork and administrative 
hassles if dealing with U.S. brokerages or fund companies that aren't used to 
servicing seasonal visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Estate taxes pose another potential problem, says Keats, because under current 
law Canadians who own more than $60,000 in real estate and other American 
investments could face taxation in this country, compared to the standard 
$600,000 estate-tax exemption for Americans. However, a treaty amendment (not 
part of NAFTA) is likely to be enacted by both countries reasonably soon, which 
would largely solve this problem, Keats says.  
</P>
<P>
 These problems aside, Canadian snowbirds might still find it worthwhile to own 
some U.S. mutual funds, given the funds' lower expenses and denomination in 
American currency. "This can be a good way to generate U.S. income to finance a 
winter stay," says Keats. How Canadian Funds Invest 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50% of Canadian mutual fund assets are earmarked to foreign and 
domestic stocks, compared to 40% of holdings in the United States. Here's how 
Canadian mutual fund assets break down by investment category: 
</P>
<P>
 Can. stocks: 22.8% 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. stocks: 3.3% 
</P>
<P>
 Other foreign stocks: 21.1% 
</P>
<P>
 Can. balanced: 13.6% 
</P>
<P>
 Can. money market: 11.5% 
</P>
<P>
 Can. bonds: 11.0% 
</P>
<P>
 Can. mortgages: 10.8% 
</P>
<P>
 Other: 5.9

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: SAVINGS BONDS: SOMETIMES CONSERVATISM PAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dowager of the investment world -- the U.S. Savings Bond -- has become 
more attractive to long-term savers since the Treasury Department announced 
that the bond's variable rate soared 1.22 percentage points -- the 
second-biggest jump in history. 
</P>
<P>
 With yields approaching 6% and rising, it may be time to take a new look at 
these conservative investments. Indeed, because Savings Bond yields are 
adjusted every six months, the bonds offer unique opportunities in times of 
rising rates, assuming investors don't mind locking up their money for a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because investors who hold Savings Bonds for five years or more get the 
higher of either a guaranteed 4% return or a market-based rate. The 
market-based rate is 85% of the five-year Treasury note average, currently 
5.92%. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not just buy a five-year Treasury note? Because in times of rising 
interest rates, there's no upside on the notes. You get the contracted interest 
rate -- no more, no less. Assuming you hold the bond to maturity, you also get 
your principal back. But if interest rates continue to rise, you may miss 
opportunities to earn more in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, unless you buy directly from the Federal Reserve System, you pay 
brokerage commissions when trading Treasury bills, notes and bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Savings Bonds are sold without fees through banks, thrifts and some credit 
unions. Some large employers also sell the bonds through employee thrift plans. 
And for bonds purchased after 1982, the interest rate is adjusted every six 
months.  
</P>
<P>
 The result: Even though you're investing for a relatively long period, the 
interest rate is calculated to give you the same return as if you had purchased 
a six-month certificate of deposit and rolled the money into a new CD each six 
months for five years. In other words, if you hold the bond for five years or 
longer, you don't miss out on interest rate upswings. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years, you can cash in the bond or hang on to it for as long as 30 
years. After 30 years, it stops earning interest.  
</P>
<P>
 The catch?  
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the market-based rate calculation that can help you in times of 
rising rates can hurt you when rates are falling. 
</P>
<P>
 People who bought Savings Bonds in November, 1982, for example, were told that 
the market-based rate was 11.09%, which was true for the next six months. After 
that, however, interest rates began to fall fast, and the new market-based 
rates began to eat away at the total interest the bonds would pay. The end 
result: The actual interest rate on these 1982 bonds, if cashed in today, would 
amount to just 7.5% annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Savings Bonds are rotten investments for short-term savers or for anyone 
who needs regular income from investments. Unless you're facing a dire 
emergency, you're barred from cashing them in for at least six months. If you 
cash in a bond purchased after 1993 within five years, you get the pallid 4% 
guaranteed rate instead of the market-based rate. The market-based rate is only 
for those who hold their bonds five years or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Savings Bond continues to pay interest for 30 years from the date of 
purchase, regardless of the maturity date, says Peter Hollenbach of the 
Treasury Department's bureau of public debt. And because they're obligations of 
the U.S. Treasury, the bonds are secure and the interest earned on them is free 
from state and local taxes. You do have to pay federal tax on the earnings, but 
not until the bonds are cashed in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, these bonds are more complicated than they appear, so investors need to 
be cautious, says Daniel J. Pederson, president of Savings Bond Informer, a 
Detroit-based consulting firm, and author of a new book, "U.S. Savings Bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 While it's easy to buy and redeem the bonds, the way interest is calculated 
can be deceiving. For instance, on bonds purchased after 1993, interest accrues 
each month for the first five years, or 60 months. After that, it's paid just 
twice annually. If you cash in a bond the day before the interest is paid, you 
miss out on nearly six months of earnings. In dollars and cents, that means 
somebody holding a $1,000 bond at 6% would lose $30. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing on the face of the bonds to indicate the interest rate you're 
entitled to or when the bonds are guaranteed to mature. And because guaranteed 
interest rates have changed numerous times and market rates change often, 
neither question is easy to answer. You are charged with knowing the rules -- 
or learning them by asking a banker or the Treasury Department for a "Table of 
Redemption Values," otherwise known as a PD-3600. 
</P>
<P>
 To find out what a particular Savings Bond is worth, go to any bank that sells 
the bonds and ask to see the redemption tables. By looking at these, you should 
be able to determine the current value of each bond you hold. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't find a helpful local banker, you can get a table of redemption 
values directly from the Treasury. Just send a postcard with your name and 
address, requesting a PD-3600. This is a table that shows the value of $50 and 
$25 notes and bonds. (If you own $100 bonds, double the value of the 
appropriate $50 bond.)

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: GETTING BANK TO PAY CHECK CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: I recently lost my wallet, which contained a single blank, unsigned check. 
I reported the loss to my bank, which advised me to close the account and 
reopen a new one. The following day, the wallet was found with the check 
intact. I immediately notified the bank; no new account was opened. However, 
four checks which I had written before the incident were returned to the payees 
with the notation that they had been stolen. Now I am facing significant 
returned-check fees. Am I responsible for these charges? -- A.H.J . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Robin Leonard, an author and lawyer specializing in consumer credit issues, 
recommends that you immediately contact the bank's vice president for customer 
relations or consumer affairs and explain your story clearly and forcefully. 
The bank, Leonard says, should be persuaded that it acted improperly in 
handling your matter and should help you by reversing the returned-check fees. 
A representative of one of the state's largest banks concurs with Leonard's 
advice, noting that consumers are always well served to communicate directly 
with their financial institution when problems like this arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure to note that you informed the bank that just a single check was 
potentially lost, stressing (if this is true) that you provided the number of 
that missing check. Also remind the bank official that you reported the check 
found within 24 hours of the first report, thus eliminating the need to close 
the account and open a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 Your bank account was in a state of limbo for a matter of a single day. When 
did those returned checks get to the bank for payment? Within that 24-hour 
period? Or later? If they arrived after your account had been returned to 
normal status, the bank can be faulted for poor internal communications and 
should be willing to make amends. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, you should realize that banks try hard to protect their 
customers from check forgeries, which unfortunately are on the rise. Even a 
single stolen check in the hands of a determined thief can lead to dozens of 
forged copies that could fool all but a highly trained professional. Banks have 
to walk a fine line between protecting their customers from fraud and allowing 
them the easiest possible access to their accounts. When the normal routine is 
broken, as in your case with a misplaced check, the system is taxed to its 
limit and unfortunately can fail. You need to understand that you are in part 
responsible for your situation because you did misplace the check. Taking your 
share of the responsibility when you talk to bank officials would be 
appropriate. How to Restore Your Good Credit 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I filed for bankruptcy in October, 1985. It was finalized by court order in 
January, 1986. Since that time, I have had no credit cards because every time I 
apply for one, I am rejected. Now I am getting married. What can I do to clean 
up my credit history? -- W.E.G . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The period during which bankruptcies appear on a credit history usually 
expires on the 10th anniversary of the bankruptcy filing. Your credit history 
should be wiped clean in about 10 months. However, having a clean slate is not 
the same as having a good credit history. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential creditors want to see a history of steady credit repayment before 
they extend credit to a new customer. How can you show you can responsibly 
handle credit when no one will extend you any now? With what is known as a 
"secured credit card." Although these cards look and spend like other charge 
cards, holders are required to deposit an amount in a bank account at least 
equal to the amount of their card's credit limit. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about banks offering these cards, contact Bankcard 
Holders of America. This nonprofit organization also publishes a report 
detailing the interest rates and annual fees charged by many (but not all) 
credit card issuers in the United States. Each pamphlet costs $4 and is 
available by writing Bankcard Holders of America, 524 Branch Drive, Salem, VA 
24153. Nasdaq: By Any Other Name . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you give me the full name of Nasdaq? -- D.P.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A At one time, the initials NASDAQ stood for the National Assn. of Security 
Dealers' Automated Quotation system. However, now Nasdaq is simply the name of 
the nation's busiest stock exchange, which is owned and operated by the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 At its inception in 1971, NASDAQ offered a price quotation system for 
over-the-counter stocks by gathering information over a network of telephone 
lines from the multiple market makers who are expected to post competing prices 
for buying and selling shares of the stocks they handle. 
</P>
<P>
 The system has evolved into a full-fledged stock market. It now lists 5,600 
stock issues from about 4,800 public companies. But unlike the New York Stock 
Exchange, where a single "specialist" firm is the sole market maker for each 
stock listed, the Nasdaq still has multiple market makers for each listed 
stock, in the hope of generating competing prices. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in October the Justice Department opened an antitrust investigation 
into Nasdaq's operations, looking into allegations of price fixing and other 
illegal practices that might rig Nasdaq trading against small investors in 
favor of large, institutional traders. The investigation is still in a 
preliminary phase. The NASD has vigorously denied the existence of collusion in 
its operations. Last month, the market proposed new rules designed to give 
small investors a better chance to buy stock shares at more competitive prices.

NEW TIME WARNER PRESIDENT TAKING ON HIS BIGGEST JOB YET; PROFILE: AT 46, 
RICHARD PARSONS ALREADY HAS HAD CAREERS AS GOVERNMENT POLICY-MAKER, LAWYER AND 
BANK COMPANY CHAIRMAN. NOW HE'LL BE ONE OF THE NATION'S MOST PROMINENT BLACK 
EXECUTIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SKIP WOLLENBERG, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Parsons pokes his head out of a conference room and asks if he can 
have a few more minutes before a scheduled interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He's got a few loose ends to wrap up here at Dime Bancorp -- a proposed merger 
must still be closed -- before he can discuss his next career move. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearly two dozen years of work, Parsons has already led three lives -- as a 
government policy-maker, lawyer and bank company chairman. He starts a new one 
in February when he becomes second in command at Time Warner Inc., the huge 
media-entertainment combine whose businesses extend from publishing to music, 
movies and cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 As Time Warner's president, Parsons will also be one of the most prominent 
black executives in America. "I take it as an additional reason to keep my eye 
on the ball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and colleagues describe Parsons as a smart man who doesn't flaunt his 
intelligence but quickly gets to the essence of an issue. They say he has an 
easygoing manner and an instinct for motivating people to work in concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is someone who can see the big picture of any situation yet grasp the fine 
point of the details," said chairman R. William Murray of Philip Morris Cos. 
Inc. Parsons serves on the food and tobacco conglomerate's board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard will help you get where you are going," said his sister, Loretta 
Parsons Poole, an educator in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons, an imposing man at 6-foot-4 and about 250 pounds, said he never 
imagined two months ago he would be selected for the Time Warner presidency, 
although he had been on the company's board since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Levin had held all three top management titles at Time Warner since 
chairman and co-chief executive Steven Ross died two years ago. Levin decided 
only recently to ask Parsons about taking the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons, 46, was interested. Dime Bancorp was profitable after a three-year 
struggle with loan problems. It had agreed to merge with Anchor Savings in a 
deal to create the nation's fourth-largest savings bank. 
</P>
<P>
 And Time Warner was pushing into new technologies and alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Gerry and I talked about was for me to essentially partner up with him 
in the overall management and direction of Time Warner," Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Levin would "keep his hands on the business operations" of the various 
divisions, Parsons said he would focus on relations with Wall Street and 
"back-office stuff" like legal, financial and administrative issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment, announced Oct. 31, appears to have gone over well within the 
company and on Wall Street. They are happy Levin didn't pick a company 
employee, thereby appearing to favor one division over another. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons said the job is broad and diverse enough to be challenging. "This is 
the first time I've ever landed somewhere where I think I could be there the 
rest of my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Dean Parsons was born April 4, 1948, in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of 
Brooklyn and grew up in the nearby borough of Queens. He was the second of five 
children. His father was an electronics technician; his mother a homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Parsons' intelligence was apparent as he skipped two grades and was 
graduated from high school at age 16. Loretta Poole said their father 
encouraged them to think for themselves. One of the few acceptable reasons his 
children could give for leaving the dinner table early, for example, was to 
look up a word in the dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons went to college at the University of Hawaii, where he made the college 
basketball team and worked at a parking garage and a gas company to pay the 
bills. He met his future wife, Laura, there. But he left school six credits shy 
of a degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons called it "a fun-filled but academically disastrous" experience. 
</P>
<P>
 His failure to graduate proved atypical. He enrolled in 1968 at Albany Law 
School in New York -- which admitted him without a bachelor's degree -- and 
finished first in his class three years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a gift for making it look easy," said classmate Stephen Cleary, now an 
attorney in Albany. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons caught the eye of people in New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's 
Administration while working as a legislative intern during law school, and he 
was hired as an assistant counsel to the governor after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't take long to discover how bright and effective he was," said Harry 
Albright Jr., a Rockefeller aide who later recommended Parsons for the top job 
at Dime Bancorp. "He was the person people turned to when they wanted something 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons later moved to Washington to work for then-Vice President Rockefeller 
and for President Gerald R. Ford's domestic policy office. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977, Parsons went to work for the law firm Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler 
in New York, handling free speech, product liability and banking cases. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, Albright was head of Dime and recommended Parsons succeed 
him. The bank's board hired Parsons in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, the real estate market in the Northeast collapsed. As prices sank, 
so did the value of Dime's mortgage portfolio. So Parsons engineered a massive 
restructuring, unloading $1 billion in bad loans while cutting the work force 
to 2,000 from 3,500. The bank stayed afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 He kept employees informed, creating quarterly videotapes to discuss earnings 
and the restructuring progress. Parsons felt "people would work harder if they 
knew what was going on behind the numbers," said David Totaro, chief marketing 
officer for Dime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner has experienced internal turmoil of its own. The music division 
was recently caught up in top-level dissent. The parent company considered but 
then withdrew from talks about buying part of the NBC television network even 
as it moved toward launching its own network. The company has a huge debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say Levin's plans for state-of-the-art cable television service 
offering movies, shopping and other communications options are behind schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons said in the interview, "I don't have any misgivings about the 
direction of this company." But he added that the dynamics of the industry 
require constant re-examination of plans. "Something that was a terrific idea 
yesterday may lose some of its steam tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Parsons and his wife, a school psychologist, have three children ages 19, 20 
and 22. They have a loft in Manhattan and a home in Pocantico Hills north of 
New York City. He relaxes with jazz and vacations on Block Island off Rhode 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation persists that Parsons will eventually get into politics. But he 
said he wouldn't want to give up his privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he consider himself the heir apparent to the 55-year-old Levin? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think so. . . . Gerry wants to have some fun and leave his mark and I 
want to help him. That wasn't part of our discussions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earl Graves, publisher of Black Enterprise magazine, said he is sure Parsons 
will get a chance to lead a major company. "He is one of the outstanding 
businessmen in America. I've never heard anyone say anything bad about him."

TWO CITIES IN EAST COUNTY AMONG SAFEST IN THE NATION; CRIME: THOUSAND OAKS AND 
SIMI VALLEY ARE TOPPED ONLY BY AMHERST TOWN, N.Y., IN THE FBI'S SIX-MONTH 
SURVEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks ranked as the second safest large city in the United States and 
Simi Valley was third safest during the first half of 1994, according to 
figures released today by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the two Ventura County cities have battled for bragging rights as 
the safest city in the nation with a population of more than 100,000. But for 
the first six months of 1994 they were both bested by an old rival, Amherst 
Town, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 From January through June, that Buffalo suburb reported 12.54 major crimes per 
1,000 residents, while Thousand Oaks' rate was 13.5 and Simi Valley's 14.29. 
</P>
<P>
 During the full year of 1993, Simi Valley was the nation's safest large city, 
with Amherst Town second and Thousand Oaks third. Simi Valley's crime, however, 
edged upward during the first half of this year, while crimes dropped sharply 
in Amherst Town and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 A healthy mix of tough police work and crime-conscious residents has helped 
the two east Ventura County cities float near the top of the safe-city list for 
at least a decade, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Oxnard -- the only other local city with more than 100,000 
residents -- reported 29.76 crimes per 1,000 residents, a drop of 3.3% 
contrasted with the first six months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI tallies serious crime reported in more than 180 large U.S. cities, 
tracking murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, car theft and 
arson. 
</P>
<P>
 Two cities that have traditionally ranked among the safest, Livonia and 
Sterling Heights, Mich., did not file for the most recent six-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks recorded a dramatic 14.6% drop in the major crime rate in the 
first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's great news. I'm glad to hear it because we've been concentrating on 
keeping crime down in this city," Mayor Alex Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighborhood crime watch program, volunteer merchants' patrol and other 
citizen-run crime-fighting groups have kept Thousand Oaks safe, as has hard 
work by sheriff's deputies, Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all of it combined is beginning to pay off," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Cmdr. Kathy Kemp, who oversees police protection for Thousand Oaks, 
credited the city's safety record to good citizens, and to deputies who "are 
almost bulldogs in their efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Thousand Oaks' residents, Kemp said, "They're willing to get involved. 
They're willing to get into the (sheriff's) Citizen's Academy, our Volunteers 
in Policing program, Neighborhood Watch." 
</P>
<P>
 After a drive-by shooting last month wounded a Newbury Park woman, Kemp had 
expected about 30 neighborhood residents to show up at a meeting with police. 
About 225 showed up, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to know, 'What can we do? How can we get involved?' " Kemp said. 
"They don't just stand around saying, 'We want you guys to fix it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley kept a steady hand on its major crime rate, which edged upward by 
only half a percent in the first half of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a combination of a community that wants to be safe and a Police 
Department that's willing to work with them," Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people call the police when they suspect things. The police respond 
quickly, and they catch people doing things," he said. "We caught three guys in 
the act of rifling through a car the other day because someone called. Our hope 
is that that will deter enough criminals from coming to Simi Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willard R. Schlieter, in his first year on the job, credited Simi 
Valley's residents and officers -- as well as the mountain-rimmed geography of 
Simi Valley that leaves only six roads in and out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you can work on the minor kind of offenses that a lot of police 
departments don't even address -- the vandalism and petty theft which we look 
at and dig into (you can be effective)," Schlieter said. "They often are 
precursors to more serious crimes, and we're really able to hit it. 
</P>
<P>
 "By and large, we've got a really cooperative public that does call us when 
they see something, and that's very helpful," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said he hopes the crime rate is dropping in the second half of 1994, 
which could give Simi Valley a leg up on its next-door rival. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the January to June statistics, he noted: "It's only six months." 
</P>
<P>

WORDS OF HOPE AT LAKIN FUNERAL; MOURNING: THE COLLEGE CHANCELLOR IS REMEMBERED 
AS A SCHOLAR DEDICATED TO IMPROVING THE LIVES OF OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Friends and colleagues from around the state gathered in a small Hollywood 
Hills chapel Saturday for the funeral of Thomas G. Lakin, chancellor of the 
Ventura County Community College District, sharing with his family warm 
recollections of his commitment to life and knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Running shoes, a racquetball racket and flowers rested atop the coffin as a 
handful of speakers eulogized the longtime educator, who died one week ago 
after an all-night battle against necrotizing fasciitis, the so-called 
flesh-eating bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Lakin's widow and four daughters sat quietly, listening to messages of 
hope and support offered by friends and mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin, 50, who had served as chancellor of the three-campus district since 
1991, was remembered as a scholar dedicated to improving the lives of others 
through education. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent more than half his life in academia, motivating students and 
co-workers to strive for success and challenging young people to better 
themselves through knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of mourners crowded the chapel at Forest Lawn Hollywood Hills, 
spilling into the lobby and onto the lawn of the hillside mortuary, which 
overlooks the east San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin's two older daughters joined others in weaving personal anecdotes about 
the late chancellor into fond remembrances that brought tears to the eyes of 
many of those gathered. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mourners spoke of the great influence Lakin had on their lives, while 
others celebrated the generosity and sense of humor the chancellor so often 
displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that all of you gathered here this morning will take that love and 
hold it in a special place," said Brenda Lakin-Clapp, sister of the veteran 
educator. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas L. Stevens Jr., president of Los Angeles Trade Technical College, said 
he first encountered Lakin two decades ago during a seminar at Southwest 
College. He remembered the late chancellor as an inquisitive professional bent 
on making a contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "He raised every question under the sun during the question-and-answer 
session" at the seminar, Stevens told the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became clear over time that Tom would have a bright and productive 
career," said Stevens, who credited Lakin with doubling enrollment at Southwest 
College in his first two years as president. He said the educator was as 
comfortable discussing economic theory as he was pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brought a can-do attitude that became contagious among his staff," Stevens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesa Lakin, 28, the oldest of the chancellor's daughters, recalled a lesson 
taught her by her father after she stayed out all night once in the weeks 
before leaving for college, worrying her grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 As punishment, she said, Lakin drove his daughter to school nearly two weeks 
early, then left her without her car for her entire freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I learned that I was wrong," she said Saturday. "You have to be 
responsible and you have to be considerate. That lesson and a lot of others 
like it are what made Dad great." 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Lakin, the chancellor's 25-year-old daughter, read excerpts from letters 
sent by her father while she was at college in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Please do not inform me of any effort that isn't exemplary,' " she quoted 
her father as writing. In another note, Lakin wrote to his daughter that he had 
not heard from her older sister for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'She knows how to pop up when funds run out,' " the father wrote in jest to 
Lori about her sister. "I expect to hear from her any day now." 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter said Lakin often sent her recordings of his favorite artists, 
home-taped cassettes labeled "Expanding Lori's musical appreciation beyond the 
Top 20." 
</P>
<P>
 The chancellor, a long-distance runner who also collected hats, instilled a 
strong sense of dedication in those he worked with, said Gabriel McCurtis, 
principal at Pacific High School in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always said when you develop a daily discipline, you will develop 
success," McCurtis remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvis Lee said he was perhaps Lakin's closest friend. He described a 
backpacking trip the two took to Yosemite several years ago, when they 
encountered a black bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, all the friendship was off," Lee said, recalling how the two 
hikers had run in fear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But minutes later, Lakin stopped running and confronted the bear, eventually 
enticing it to wander away. "Tom walked up to me and said 'Are you all right?' 
" Lee said. "I said 'Yes, but you're a fool.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom was that kind of person -- a caring person, a friend," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two actors recruited by Lakin to star in videotape productions aimed at 
attracting students to the struggling Southwest College recounted their first 
meeting with the then-president. 
</P>
<P>
 William Allen Young and Howard Ransom told the mourners how nervous they were 
to meet the successful president, and how they first mistook Lakin for a 
janitor because he was dusting books and wiping away smudges from the shelves 
when they entered his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked around, waiting to see the king," Young said. "He put down his 
feather duster. Then we noticed, looking at the picture behind him, he looked 
just like the president." 
</P>
<P>
 Ransom said Lakin greeted them with an urban colloquialism -- "Hey, homes" -- 
and invited them to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was all things in one -- the janitor, the college president, and he was 
from the 'hood," Ransom said. " 'Don't quit' he would say. 'Don't ever quit. 
Run, walk -- crawl if you have to -- until you cross the finish line.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Another memorial service is scheduled for 10 a.m. Monday on the lawn just 
south of the college district headquarters at 71 Day Road in Ventura.

RECORD NUMBERS HOPE TO RECEIVE U. S. CITIZENSHIP; IMMIGRATION: SURGE IN 
APPLICATIONS FROM LEGAL RESIDENTS IS SAID TO BE DRIVEN IN LARGE PART BY 
ANTI-IMMIGRANT SENTIMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legal immigrants in Ventura County are signing up to become U.S. citizens in 
record numbers, driven in large part by the current anti-immigrant mood 
sweeping the state. 
</P>
<P>
 This year alone, more than 700 permanent residents have applied for 
citizenship through El Concilio del Condado de Ventura, an Oxnard-based 
advocacy group. That is nearly twice the number that applied in the previous 
five years combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are like Jose Balan, who told his classmates at a citizenship class last 
week that he wants to become an American because of Proposition 187. The Oxnard 
resident said it was frustrating to watch voters overwhelmingly approve the 
measure without being able to cast a ballot against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be able to vote in the next election," said Balan, 37, who after 
five years of legal residency became eligible last week for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Two nights a week, he and about 20 other Mexican immigrants pile into a class 
at El Concilio to learn what it will take to pursue their American dream. The 
Concilio also offers regular workshops to help people prepare their citizenship 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people like me," Balan said. "I think you are going to see 
more and more people becoming citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 There are reasons besides Proposition 187 for the increased interest in 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Some longtime immigrants are choosing to become citizens rather than contend 
with a new Immigration and Naturalization Service campaign to replace residency 
cards issued before 1978 with new, tamper-resistant cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents, known as green cards because of their original color, are proof 
of permanent resident status. The replacement campaign affects 1.5 million 
cardholders nationwide, many of whom are choosing to apply for citizenship 
rather than hassle with the renewal process. 
</P>
<P>
 Other immigrants are pursuing citizenship because they want to speed up the 
process of legalizing family members stuck on INS waiting lists, awaiting the 
issuance of resident cards. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, immigrant-rights advocates say Proposition 187 is the 
driving force behind the current interest in citizenship. The measure seeks to 
deny schooling, non-emergency health care and other public benefits to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Although those in the classes are legal residents, many are signing up for 
citizenship to have some say in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the unintended effects of Proposition 187," said Karl Lawson, an 
immigrant-rights activist in Oxnard. "As a result, a whole lot of people are 
going to become legalized a whole lot quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Frank, who headed the Ventura County campaign in support of the measure, 
said he is glad to see those who qualify for citizenship take advantage of its 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he believes any boost in citizenship applications as a result of 
Proposition 187 will be short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a momentary effect," Frank said. "Give it three months and it will be 
over with." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, advocates say they believe the largest wave of citizenship 
applicants is yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, farm laborers such as Balan who were granted legal status five 
years ago under the Special Agricultural Workers program became eligible for 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 To apply for citizenship, immigrants must have five years of permanent 
residency, be 18 years or older and have a basic knowledge of U.S. history and 
government. They must also have conversational English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 16,000 agricultural workers in Ventura County were legalized under 
the agricultural workers program. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating the increased demand, the Oxnard High Adult Education School, 
together with El Concilio, will add eight citizenship classes next month to its 
curriculum. The adult school currently offers one citizenship class. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are actually seeing an incredible jump," said Greg Simons, coordinator of 
El Concilio's immigration program. "Many legal immigrants are feeling victims 
of this wave of anti-immigrant backlash." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the uncertainty surrounding the passage of Proposition 187, many 
immigrants say they are seeking citizenship to accelerate the process of 
gaining legal status for their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrant advocates estimate that about half of the 16,000 agricultural 
workers legalized five years ago have spouses who have applications pending for 
legal residency. Caught in the INS bureaucracy, those applicants could wait 
three to 15 years to gain legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the family members of permanent residents who become citizens, it 
could take just a few months.  
</P>
<P>
 That is why Oxnard resident Ciria Moreno is applying for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno, 47, is among the agricultural workers who gained permanent resident 
status five years ago and who became eligible to apply for citizenship 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of her five children are illegal immigrants, stuck on waiting lists to 
become legal residents. By becoming a citizen, Moreno will dramatically speed 
up the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will help me and will help my children," said Moreno, who like Balan is 
enrolled in one of El Concilio's citizenship classes. "Without legal papers, 
you cannot do anything in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Vera, 36, said he applied for citizenship as soon as he could, eager 
to clear the way for his wife and five children to immigrate from Guanajuato, 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is my goal," he said. "I've been in this country by myself for many 
years. I have established my life here, and now it's time for them to join me." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, no one has taught more immigrants about citizenship than 
Bill Morgan. For 32 years, the 76-year-old schoolteacher has helped thousands 
of people pass the citizenship exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan teaches one class a week for the Oxnard adult school. He said the 
number of immigrants taking citizenship classes has remained consistently high 
for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most people, particularly after they get married or reach 30, the chances 
of them going back home are pretty small," Morgan said. "The fact is they kind 
of get settled in the States, and even though it's far from perfect, it's 
pretty darned good." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said he sees the debate over immigration, illegal or otherwise, as 
having little to do with the students who come through his class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never met an immigrant who was anything but great," he said. "These 
people are the best Americans we have."

CITY FEARS FALLOUT OF COURT RULING FAVORING BUILDER; THOUSAND OAKS: IT COULD 
ELIMINATE A SERIES OF ROADBLOCKS THAT DEVELOPERS ROUTINELY FACE WHEN PURSUING 
PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As pro-growth advocates celebrate, Thousand Oaks officials have begun 
assessing the damage caused by a stinging state court ruling issued last week 
that chastised the city for the "cavalier manner" in which the council has 
denied development projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling exposes the city to a multimillion-dollar lawsuit from disgruntled 
builder Nedjatollah Cohan. And, legal analysts say, it could eliminate a series 
of roadblocks that developers routinely face when pursuing projects in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the crowning blow to the city," said Neal Scribner, a Thousand Oaks 
architect and vocal proponent of development who chairs the property rights 
subcommittee of the Mayor's Business Round Table. "It's a decision we've been 
waiting to hear for years." 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd District Court of Appeal ruling, published Monday, reversed the city's 
denial of Cohan's plan to build houses and a strip mall on 47-acres of Newbury 
Park grassland. 
</P>
<P>
 The opinion, a harshly worded condemnation of the council, said the city 
trampled Cohan's constitutional rights during the important steps leading up to 
the 4-1 vote against the housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a city where careful planning and controlled development have been the 
mainstays of public policy, officials may be forced to rethink methods they 
have long used to prevent builders from blanketing pristine land with houses 
and strip malls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a great deal of concern about this decision and about the long-term 
impacts of this," Thousand Oaks City Atty. Mark Sellers said. "This decision 
opens up a whole can of worms in terms of its potential to limit the rights we 
expect the council to have." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling lists several procedural errors that the city made as it pondered 
the Cohan project. The judges, however, focused primarily on the council's 
decision to appeal a Planning Commission ruling to itself. 
</P>
<P>
 While it has been common practice in Thousand Oaks for the council to appeal 
rulings to itself, the panel of three judges said it diminished the developer's 
chance for a fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "By appealing the decision to itself, the council evidenced at least the 
appearance of a conflict of interest," the ruling stated. "The council, in its 
zeal, made sure the decision did not stand unchallenged." 
</P>
<P>
 If that analysis withstands an appeal, Sellers said, it would take away the 
council's ability to challenge Planning Commission rulings and could 
potentially force the city to change its procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 From his pro-growth viewpoint, Scribner said he hoped the changes will help 
eliminate political pressures from council decisions on development. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this ruling should be saying to the council is, if someone has followed 
the rules, they can't just turn a project down because it's unpopular," 
Scribner said. "They need to follow the rules too." 
</P>
<P>
 By limiting appeals, the ruling could leave the Planning Commission holding 
more power over development issues. And unlike the council, which the judges' 
criticized for submitting "to the roar of the crowd," the Planning Commission 
was specifically told to avoid basing a decision on political grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But taking the decision-making power out of the council's hands would be a 
mistake, Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council needs to have oversight over the commission," she said. "To 
remove that would be taking away one of our basic rights as elected officials." 
</P>
<P>
 If too much power is given to the commission, several city leaders said, the 
council may consider eliminating the Planning Commission entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could very well be an offshoot of this," Planning Commission Chairman 
Irving Wasserman said. "They may decide to get rid of the commission, or rework 
it so that the commission has no power at all." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they hope a successful appeal would keep them from having 
to change the existing process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're all going to bank on the (California) Supreme Court to hear 
this case and to overturn this ruling," Zeanah said. "And I think when we do 
begin fighting, every city in California is going to get behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Sellers said he has already received numerous calls from city 
attorneys around the state inquiring about the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they all see the potential for this to be a dangerous precedent," 
Sellers said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pismo Beach, for instance, news of the ruling forced the City Council to 
back down from a plan that would have permitted the council to appeal Planning 
Commission rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became very concerned when we heard about the ruling," Pismo Beach City 
Atty. Kathleen Weinheimer said. "We saw the appeals process as a way to add 
checks and balances between the council and the Planning Commission. This 
ruling sends us back to the drawing board." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She said she expected most cities would like to see Thousand Oaks appeal the 
decision. Otherwise, the decision could remain on the books and be used as 
precedent in future cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Sellers said, that decision will be in the hands of the new 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 The city can either challenge the ruling or try to reach a settlement with the 
Cohans, Sellers said. If the city settles, it could help avoid the potential 
for another lawsuit by the Cohans, this time for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear now that the city shot from the hip and broke the rules," said 
Cohan's son, Albert Cohen. "And the long delay we suffered because of it has 
cost us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers said suits such as the action the Cohans may decide to file typically 
ask for millions of dollars in lost revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damages can be quite tremendous," Sellers said. "If we lost, the money would 
have to come from our reserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Scribner said that should be a sobering message to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should send a message to the city that developers who try their hardest to 
work with the city should not be shot down just because it's politically 
expedient," he said.

 William Harrison, 72, a retired chemist who worked on the atomic bomb during 
World War II, knelt in the dirt Saturday, tossing aside hunks of sod. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Bob Torst, 34, made the wooden handle of his shovel creak as he 
plunged it into the grass. Torst was paroled last month after serving 16 months 
in prison on drugs and weapons charges. The two men were breaking ground on the 
West Ventura Community Garden, a new city project designed to teach gardening 
skills and build community pride. By the end of the morning at West Park, about 
20 volunteers had cleared nine garden plots of 10-by-20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-by-10-foot plots will be available free of charge to any person or group 
who signs up, garden coordinator Beth Scott said. She said residents can plant 
whatever they want and then harvest the fruits of their labors. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said she hoped gang members, seniors, the Assn. of Retarded Citizens and 
elementary school students would work patches of the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers Saturday were a mix of activists from the Ventura Avenue 
neighborhood and residents of a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program for 
ex-convicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is see the image of our neighborhood improve," said Beth 
Potts-Mee, huffing and puffing as she stabbed the ground with a shovel she had 
brought from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Potts-Mee said she was also taking the opportunity to train her 6-year-old 
daughter Jessica in "community involvement" and "earthworm conservation." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Jessica was picking out worms and returning them to the garden patch 
before carrying away the chunks of sod unloosed by her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Torst, his tattooed biceps bulging as he hacked away at the hard ground, said 
the work was a way for him and his house mates in the program to pay back 
society for his crimes. "It's good for us and good for the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardening is a delayed-gratification activity. Scott said gardeners will plant 
seeds in the spring and harvest the first crops in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, there was just dirt and dug-up grass. Fruits or vegetables were 
nowhere to be found, until, when the work was winding down, Harrison brought 
out a seed catalogue and began showing other volunteers a glossy color photo of 
what was captioned "The World's Largest Pumpkin." 
</P>
<P>
 "We could grow that here," he said. IRA E. STOLL

CAR IS RECOVERED FROM OCEAN NEAR MUGU ROCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A search-and-rescue team recovered a car from the ocean near Mugu Rock early 
Saturday after a witness reported seeing the speeding vehicle plunge off a 
cliff, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's rescue divers summoned to search the waters were 
unable to find any bodies, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness, driving by the area at about 1 a.m., said the 1988 Ford Mustang 
was heading south on Pacific Coast Highway at speeds of 80 to 100 m.p.h., the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 After launching off the cliff, the car flew about 250 feet and sank in 75 feet 
of water, the CHP said. 
</P>
<P>
 The divers called off their search after several hours, upon determining the 
strong ocean current would have moved a body southward from the immediate 
vicinity, a CHP spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to wait for somebody to report seeing a body," the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident may have been a suicide attempt, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car is registered to a Ventura County resident, the CHP said. But 
investigators said the car owner no longer resides at the registered address. 
No other information on the driver or possible passengers was recovered from 
the car, the CHP said.12/04/94

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; METROLINK ON-TIME PERFORMANCE SLIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a marked improvement in on-time performance, Metrolink train service 
slipped slightly in October, with 22% of the trains from Los Angeles to Ventura 
County arriving late. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink service to Ventura County has been plagued by delays, due in large 
part to aging tracks and a dispatching system that favors freight trains over 
commuter service, a Metrolink spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Commission Friday agreed to continue pressing for better 
on-time performance from the train service. 
</P>
<P>
 Late trains do not appear to be affecting ridership, which remained steady at 
about 1,500 passengers a day each way during October. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the commission is conducting a survey to determine where riders 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 500 survey postcards placed on windshields in Metrolink parking lots in 
Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo and Oxnard, 173 have been returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, 38% are from Simi Valley, 15% apiece from Moorpark and Thousand 
Oaks, 13% from Camarillo, 10% from Oxnard, 5% from Ventura, 1% from Fillmore 
and 1% from Ojai. SARA CATANIA

WWII EXHIBIT OFF TO FLYING START; MUSEUM: OPENING OF DISPLAY AT REAGAN 
PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY DRAWS ABOUT 2,600 AND BEGINS WITH VINTAGE AIRCRAFT SHOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As museum exhibit openings go, Saturday's kickoff of the "World War II: 
Personal Accounts" display at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library near Simi 
Valley was a smashing success. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,600 people came to watch an impressive World War II-era aircraft show, 
enjoy live 1940s swing music and take a first glance at the exhibit, which 
commemorates the 50th anniversary of U.S. involvement in the second world war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very pleased to see all of this support from the public," said Richard 
Norton Smith, director of the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Throngs began to descend on the library early in the day and by about 1:30 
p.m. both parking lots were filled and the entrance gates were shut to 
motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Library personnel directed latecomers to park along winding Presidential 
Drive, which entailed a lengthy uphill walk to the library for those seeking 
prime vantage points for viewing the aerial display. 
</P>
<P>
 When the call to commence the proceedings at 2 p.m. rang out over a 
loudspeaker, the crowd looked up to the hazy, cloudy sky, where a smallish 
plane circled high above. 
</P>
<P>
 On command, two jumpers from the Pacific Coast Pelican Parachute Team leaped 
from the craft at 6,000 feet and began a 15-second free fall. 
</P>
<P>
 To oohs and ahs from the crowd, the duo clasped together for a moment, tumbled 
and whipped around, then broke apart during their spiraling descent. 
</P>
<P>
 With the American flag unfurled in midair and red smoke trailing from one 
jumper, the parachutists made a pinpoint landing on the library entrance lawn 
and were welcomed by loud ovations. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon it got much louder. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots from the Camarillo-based Southern California Wing of the Confederate 
Air Force zoomed overhead in their vintage WWII-era aircraft. The larger, more 
cumbersome craft flew by in a straight line while smaller, more agile planes 
drew cheers from the crowd as they performed aerobatic twists and turns, 
leaving smoky trails in their wake. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are some of the rarest (aircraft) you will ever see flying in the sky," 
Confederate Air Force historian Ron Fleishman announced to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen craft in all took part in the air show, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * The B-25 Mitchell bomber. One just like it delivered the first strike 
against the Japanese mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 * The amphibious PBY -- with its fat, elongated body placed below a large wing 
-- rescued downed airmen in the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 * A reconditioned Heinkel HE-111, the first World War II-era bomber used by 
the German Air Force, and the only one flying in the world today. 
</P>
<P>
 Don McMillan, 74, knew that a TBM Avenger was about to cruise by before it 
even appeared over the Simi Valley Hills. Its cackling engine was a dead 
giveaway for McMillan, who piloted the torpedo bomber in the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to be up there with them," he said, looking skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 45-minute show, many headed indoors to view the exhibit, which 
continues seven days a week, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., through Feb. 28.

PLENTY OF ST. NICKS AT REVAMPED YULE PARADE; OXNARD: THE GALA EVENT HAD BEEN 
FOR CHILDREN ONLY, BUT ADULTS JOIN IN THIS YEAR. COMPETITION IS DELIBERATELY 
ABSENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 There was Santa Claus riding a bicycle. There he was again -- this time in 
miniature, a toddler disguised as the jolly fat man in the red suit. And there 
he was sitting regally on a float fitted with a make-believe sleigh and fake 
reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was Santa decked out in a huge black sombrero, dancing down B 
Street in Oxnard to the strains of Mexican music. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, there was no lack of Santas at Oxnard's annual Christmas Parade on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa goes to Mexico, too," said the dancing Santa, 16-year-old Steve 
Villarruel, who also sported a black, white, blue and yellow serape. "When 
Santa is in Mexico, he wears a sombrero and he doesn't miss a fiesta." 
</P>
<P>
 Bundled in jackets and under blankets, nearly 2,000 spectators gathered under 
cloudy skies along a five-block stretch of the city's downtown to officially 
open the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, the parade was billed as a children's event and 
limited to participants under 12, said organizer Ruth Bernstein. This year, 
however, adults could join in.  
</P>
<P>
 An annual Christmas parade was a tradition in Oxnard for years, but the event 
died out several years ago for lack of interest, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, three years ago, the city started the Children's Christmas Parade. This 
year, organizers tried to incorporate some of the elements of the parades of 
years gone by, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to revive an old tradition in Oxnard," she said. "We want to 
create a Christmas spirit in the community, and we want to bring people to 
downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 children and adults took part in the old-fashioned procession, 
which included members of the Boys & Girls Club, teen-agers from La Colonia 
Community Recreation Center, the Oxnard High School Band and Boy Scout troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first-time adult participants was Tom Buttler, 67. He and other 
members of the Oxnard Shriners Club displayed their collection of miniature 
cars, decorated with stuffed bears, miniature Christmas trees and tinsel.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez rode in a 1929 Ford that was followed by several antique 
cars carrying local beauty queens, including Miss Oxnard, Miss Teen Oxnard and 
Miss Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators cheered when a group of children and teen-agers from Ramirez Tae 
Ryong Kwon Do -- a school for Korean martial arts -- smashed wooden boards with 
their feet while flying through the air in acrobatic jumps. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my favorite," said Sarah LaMar, 5, as she watched the group. "I want 
to kick like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Sarah's mother, Mary Raygoza, 30, the climax was when the last of the 
four Santas glided by in a huge red sleigh with flying reindeer. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the wide range of things, this is just a little parade, but it means the 
world to me," said Raygoza, who was born in Oxnard. "I know that the sleigh is 
the same that I used to see when I was a kid and watched the parade with my 
parents."  
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone who participated in the parade was pleased with its outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, participants were awarded trophies based on creativity and 
performance. This year, however, there were no trophies. Instead, everyone -- 
including spectators -- entered a drawing in which the grand prize was a trip 
for four to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm truly disappointed," said Fernando Navarro, whose two children marched as 
Mr. and Mrs. Santa on Saturday and in last year's parade. "Last year we got a 
trophy which we keep with a lot of pride. . . . It will always remind us of the 
parade and all the effort that we as a family have put on preparing for this." 
</P>
<P>
 But parade organizers said they wanted to give everyone a chance to win 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to take any trace of competition away," Bernstein said. "We want to 
create an atmosphere of Christmas celebrations only."

ATTACKS UNWARRANTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been an employee of The Worm Concern since April, 1994, and have lived 
in Simi Valley since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 During this time I have never seen a rat (either dead or alive) at The Worm 
Concern and have not heard of any seen by other employees. 
</P>
<P>
 As for dust, since I started at The Worm Concern, they have instituted a fine 
misting watering system around the screen to control dust, and they have 
purchased a water truck to keep dust down around the property. I also 
understand that they have requested permission from the county to put a pad in 
for grinding and screening. This would also help control dust. 
</P>
<P>
 The odor complaints are very exaggerated and blown way out of proportion by 
the press. In fact, many of our customers remark how surprised they are to read 
in the papers about odors and some actually find the "earthy" smells pleasing. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an ongoing program at The Worm Concern to combat flies, and The Worm 
Concern is regularly monitored by the Moorpark Mosquito Abatement District for 
flies with favorable results. 
</P>
<P>
 As I observe the county strongly monitoring and coming down very hard on The 
Worm Concern (when it is performing a valuable service), I have also observed 
the neighbors getting away with similar violations. I also wonder why The Worm 
Concern is being so strongly attacked in the paper by people who have never 
been there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Worm Concern conducts free tours every Wednesday at 2 p.m., which are 
usually attended by Scouts, schools, environmentalists, home and professional 
recyclers, visitors from out of the area and many others. Call 520-1150 for an 
appointment.

LOBBYISTS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Nov. 26, a letter from Gary Wollard, Camarillo, asked, "Why Lobbyists?" 
</P>
<P>
 While I appreciate the compliment he paid to me for representation of Ventura 
County concerning the naval bases at Point Mugu and Port Hueneme, I feel I must 
reply to some of his statements. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the county is not spending taxpayers' money to hire lobbyists. All of 
the money comes from funds contributed to BRAC 95 (the Base Realignment and 
Closing Commission) Task Force, composed of business, agriculture, industry, 
retired military, labor, government, etc.; i.e., all of the interests in 
Ventura County concerned about the very real threat that one or both of them 
might be closed. I am a member of the Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobbyists, real experts on the arcane processes of BRAC, and very 
knowledgeable about Ventura County, are technically on the county payroll for 
two reasons: (1) administrative purposes, and (2) the most important, to show 
solid community support. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to keep the bases off the closure list, or, worst case, to get them 
removed from a list, it is essential to prove solid community support that we 
believe the bases to be uniquely essential to our national defense, and that 
closure would be extremely and uniquely damaging to our economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other communities are working and lobbying, spending far more money to support 
their -- in some cases -- competing bases (e.g., Eglin Air Force Base in 
Florida). 
</P>
<P>
 Elton Gallegly is, and has been, working hard. On the other side of the aisle, 
so is Sen. Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 But they need help, mainly, as I say, to show solid community support. 
</P>
<P>
 I, for one, think that we just cannot afford to leave any stones unturned. 
</P>
<P>
 We welcome all the help we can get both morally and financially from Mr. 
Wollard and all the citizens of Ventura County.

 I am sick and tired of seeing all the complaints and demonstrations of illegal 
aliens who (supposedly) can't get services or care.The truth is that people who 
are citizens of this country, who work 16 hours a day and still can't make it, 
are the ones who don't "qualify" for government assistance. Meanwhile, the 
illegal residents receive food, housing, shelter and education absolutely free, 
not to mention medical care. Why don't your articles tell the other side of the 
story?

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / VINCE KOWALICK: FORLANO, POWELL FIND DIFFERENT ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Forlano wanted to play and he did. Marvin Powell wants to play but says 
he will not. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano, a senior tackle at Notre Dame High, and Powell, a senior fullback for 
Birmingham, came facemask-to-facemask this weekend with an agonizing dilemma 
among athletes: what to do when confronted with a serious head or neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
 For Forlano, the vision of suiting up again this season served as powerful 
motivation for his recovery from a life-threatening illness in October. 
Miraculously, seven weeks after undergoing emergency brain surgery because of a 
severe bacterial sinus infection, Forlano returned to the playing field Friday 
night in Notre Dame's 27-14 victory over Serra in a Southern Section Division 
III semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm part of the team right now," Forlano said as the final 
seconds ticked away. "I never thought I was going to play football again. But I 
worked for three years in this program. I was gonna be here." 
</P>
<P>
 For Powell, the choice was clear: His season is over. But Powell has no 
regrets after suffering a sprained neck Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell was rushed to a hospital after being tackled in Birmingham's 27-20 
victory over Wilson in the City Section 3-A Division semifinals. He was taken 
by ambulance to County-USC Medical Center, where he was listed in serious 
condition late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a CAT-scan and X-rays Friday night, Powell was released. Doctors 
told Powell he probably would be able to play against Bell in the final but he 
says he won't. He is scheduled to be re-examined Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it looked dramatic with the ambulance and all that, but it was all 
precautionary," Powell said. "The guy put an oxygen mask on me in the ambulance 
and I said, 'This isn't necessary.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano remembers nothing of a 10-day period spent hospitalized in a 
drug-induced coma. Fluid oozed steadily from his brain through a pair of 
quarter-inch holes drilled into his skull. Additional tubes protruded from his 
mouth, arms and shoulder. His vision was blurred to the point of 
near-blindness, and he was unable to move his right arm or leg or even speak 
for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors were perplexed by Forlano's illness. His parents, forced to wear 
surgical masks when visiting their son, were terrified. 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, Forlano was a starting right tackle for the Knights. Now, six 
weeks into the season, it looked like he might never play football again -- not 
that that was of utmost importance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew God would take care of Peter," Alice Forlano said of her son. "But 
there were a lot of prayers, a lot of great friends and a lot of good doctors." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, there were a few good blocks being thrown, courtesy of Forlano. 
And a good bit of grime on his gold and white jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, after undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging test, Forlano 
received doctor's clearance to suit up and he spent the week practicing in full 
pads. 
</P>
<P>
 But should he have? From brain surgery to pass-blocking in a matter of weeks? 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought a lot about that, but we left the decision up to him," Alice 
Forlano said. "The surgeon told me he didn't have his skull crushed or anything 
and that he's a very strong kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano participated only in two goal-line series -- a total of four plays -- 
helping pave the way on a pair of touchdown runs by quarterback Ryan Bowne. But 
he plans to be in uniform again Friday night when Notre Dame (12-1) plays for 
its first section title in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano may be back in the loop, but he's not out of the woods. He's still 
about 30 pounds lighter than his roster weight of 215 and his speech is still 
halting as he struggles to put thoughts into words. He meets regularly with a 
speech therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 But his memory is improving. And Forlano, who on Tuesday was featured during a 
local television sportscast, won't likely forget events of the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking, somebody up there is probably looking out for me and making 
sure I was gonna make it," he said. "But I knew it would take a lot of effort 
on my part if I ever wanted to play again." 
</P>
<P>
 It is nothing short of amazing that Forlano suited up at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in October, he came down with a sinus headache that grew worse over 
days. A physician prescribed antibiotics, but his condition worsened. 
</P>
<P>
 One evening, Alice Forlano watched with disbelief when her son was unable to 
grasp a glass of water as he spoke on the telephone with a teammate. Upon 
hanging up, Forlano could not remember with whom he had been speaking. He eyes 
were glazed. 
</P>
<P>
 He was rushed to a hospital, where he began having seizures before a doctor 
ever came near him with a stethoscope. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Forlano having an allergic reaction to prescription drugs? Was he having a 
stroke? Was he suffering from encephalitis? 
</P>
<P>
 Days passed and Forlano's condition worsened before doctors made a diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "One doctor told us he had seen, in his whole career, maybe, three people with 
(an illness) like this," Alice Forlano said. "The other ones said they had 
never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Forlano was hospitalized for 20 days. He responded to treatment quickly -- 
partly, he said, because doctors refused to rule out his return to the team 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 That was all Forlano needed to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell bent the ear of his father, Marvin, a former offensive tackle with the 
New York Jets and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday morning, the two had decided taking chances would be foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, who also plays linebacker, has scheduled recruiting trips to Cal, USC, 
Northwestern and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and my dad talked about it and we decided what's important is that my team 
won and I'll be able to play next year," Powell said. "It will hurt a little to 
miss the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I know my boys are going to go out and get the job done. I'm not going to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chick Epstein will respect Powell's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he says no and his father says no, I go along with them 100%," Epstein 
said. "I wouldn't want to risk further injury. I'd feel terrible."

HOT PROPERTY: PHANTOM FINDS A NEW HAUNT 
</P>

<P>
 Actor ROBERT GUILLAUME, who won two Emmy Awards playing the sitcom 
butler-turned-bureaucrat "Benson" and replaced Michael Crawford as star of the 
Los Angeles production of "Phantom of the Opera," and his wife, Donna, have 
leased a home off of Mulholland Drive for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple rented the home, at $7,000 a month, while their Sherman Oaks 
residence is being repaired for earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillaume, who turned 67 last Wednesday, appeared in early November on the HBO 
fantasy anthology "Cosmic Slop," and he co-starred with Dennis Weaver and Pat 
Morita in the CBS pilot "Greyhounds," which aired in June. He is the voice of 
Rafiki, the shaman-like baboon in Disney's "The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 Guillaume also narrates an animation series for HBO, to premiere in early 
1995, based on classic fairy tales with an ethnically diverse cast. Guillaume 
started a publishing venture in 1992 called the Confetti Kids, which publishes 
fairy tales with a multicultural approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The venture, which has released six learn-to-read books with Guillaume 
providing narration on audiocassettes, was prompted by the actor's search for 
reading material for his own small daughter, Rachel Jeanette. 
</P>
<P>
 The house he leased has five bedrooms in slightly more than 6,700 square feet. 
Built in 1988, it has city and canyon views. It also has a sauna, pool and spa. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Barton of Nourmand & Associates, Beverly Hills, had the listing, and 
Michael Glanfield of Jon Douglas Co., Sherman Oaks, represented the Guillaumes. 
</P>
<P>
 CHEVY CHASE has put a five-acre-plus site in Pacific Palisades on the market 
at $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emmy-winning actor/writer and his wife, Jayni, had planned to build a 
residence there. "But now they're getting ready to relocate to New York," a 
source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase, who gained fame on TV's "Saturday Night Live" before starring in such 
films as "Foul Play" (1978) and "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation" (1989), 
played Norman Robberson in the comedy film "Cops and Robbersons," released 
earlier this year. He produced, wrote and hosted his own talk show on TV last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palisades parcel, which comes with plans for a 17,000-square-foot house on 
the 75,000-square-foot buildable pad, has a tennis court, fencing, 
200-foot-long driveway, and mountain and canyon views. "He spent $1.2 million 
on site improvements," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, which is in the guard-gated Pacific Palisades Highlands, was 
bought by the actor in 1990. It is listed with Joyce Spector of Douglas 
Properties, Pacific Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 BRUCE OPPENHEIM, dubbed a "chiropractor to the stars" by People magazine, and 
his wife, actress JENILEE HARRISON, have put their Encino home on the market at 
$795,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want a larger house and are looking in the Beverly Hills Post Office 
area or vicinity to accommodate their plans for a growing family," said Nevin 
Harrison, who co-listed the home with Mark Odell, both of Geary Family Real 
Estate in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Oppenheim, who has a practice in Toluca Lake, was married to actress Cybill 
Shepherd, and they have 7-year-old twins. Harrison, who appeared as Jamie in 
"Dallas" and Cindy in "Three's Company," was in the 1991 film "Prime Target," 
with Tony Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 Their Encino home has four bedrooms with a maid's quarters in about 3,200 
square feet, behind gates. It also has a waterfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills house owned by a young Russian banker with a Rolls-Royce 
dealership in Moscow has come on the market at $17.5 million, with Raymond 
Bekeris of John Bruce Nelson & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-bedroom, 37,000-square-foot house was off of the market for six months, 
after being listed last January at $30 million. The banker bought the home in a 
court-ordered sale last fall for $11.5 million. Built in 1988, the house was 
originally priced at $32.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 An afternoon party celebrating the new listing drew a surprisingly large crowd 
of more than 1,000 realtors, many of whom got something other than the 
champagne and canapes. Realtors who left their cars just outside of the estate 
were presented with parking tickets, from the Beverly Hills police. 
</P>
<P>
 A Glendale home owned during the 1940s by actress BETTE DAVIS has been sold to 
singer/songwriter Liana Reid Coulter, co-owner of the new Hollywood restaurant 
Modada, and her husband, Benedict Coulter, a motion picture ad executive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coulters bought the walled, brick Tudor-style home from the estate of Dr. 
Alden Miller, a prominent local doctor. Davis owned the home for six years 
before selling it to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1934, the four-bedroom, 5,000-square-foot residence, with gardener's 
and chauffeur's quarters, had been listed at $1.2 million two years ago. It 
sold for about $712,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Johnson represented the buyers; Sandy Zillarreal and Beverly Fortner 
represented the sellers. All of the realtors are with MacGregor Realty in 
Glendale.

 CASA, SWEET CASA ; LATINO HOME BUYERS ARE THE FASTEST-GROWING GROUP IN THE LOS 
ANGELES COUNTY REAL ESTATE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Theresa Arreguin, a newlywed schoolteacher from El Sereno, considers 
homeownership to be insurance against the hassles of renting, which she saw her 
parents endure in the years since they immigrated from Mexico to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Garcia, 28, a married Glendale father of two young boys and two stepsons, 
says homeownership -- a goal he set for himself as a child -- has laid the 
foundation for economic security for his young family. 
</P>
<P>
 Emilio Lopez of Highland Park says he also realized the significance of owning 
a home when he was just a small child, newly immigrated to Los Angeles from 
Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to this country required that his family exchange their landowner 
status for that of immigrant renters. Today, however, both he and his parents 
own their own homes here. "It's unbelievable," said Lopez, who is 31. "It's 
like a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's a dream coming true these days for more and more Latinos, now the 
fastest-growing group of home buyers in the Los Angeles County real estate 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Arreguin, Garcia and Lopez, and for many other Latino home buyers, 
owning a home is much more than just having a place to call their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "When your parents come here, you see the struggles, the difficulties, the 
barriers with the language and it takes you a long time to get out of that 
stage," said Arreguin, 29, who as a young child immigrated with her parents 
from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, I knew I had to get into a home as soon as I could because that's the 
only way out, that's the only way to have something for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia agreed: "You buy a home to have something secure in the future for 
yourself and for your children." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles County those sentiments, along with favorable economic 
conditions and changing demographics, have helped fuel a buying binge among 
Latinos that has made them the most prevalent home buyers in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos account for nine of the 10 most common surnames of new home buyers so 
far this year, according to La Jolla-based Dataquick Information Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The name Garcia was No. 1 on the list. Gonzalez and Rodriguez followed at No. 
2 and No. 3, respectively. (See accompanying chart.) 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, in 1989, the name Lee was the most common, with Kim and Smith 
in second and third places, respectively. Back then, Garcia placed 10th and was 
the only Latino name on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a survey of common Latino surnames, the number of Latino buyers in 
Los Angeles County has climbed nearly 40% since 1989, according to Dataquick. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase is due in large part to the sheer number of Latinos in the 
region, said Fernando Guerra, a political scientist and director of Chicano 
Studies at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Demographics show a tremendous surge in Latino immigrants (to Los Angeles)," 
Guerra said. "About 40% of L.A.'s population is Latino, so they're going to 
make up a larger part of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 Latino immigration coupled with a decline in domestic migration of Anglos to 
California has left a larger share of the home-buying pie to Latinos, said 
Dowell Myers, a demographer and associate professor of urban and regional 
planning at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "When domestic migration returns to California, we'll see the Garcia name drop 
back -- not to No. 10, but to 5 or 6," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Latinos will retain many of the gains they made during this recession and 
over the next decade or two. They will become a permanent factor in the housing 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond demographics, other issues also have boosted home sales among Latinos, 
observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash in Southland real estate prices played an obvious role in enabling 
Latinos to enter the local housing market in larger numbers. Most Latino 
purchasers were first-time buyers of homes in the mid-$100,000 range, which the 
soft market kept in plentiful supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the recession-fueled paralysis that's afflicted many potential home 
buyers appears to have bypassed Latinos, who seem less apprehensive about 
California's economic malaise, those in the real estate industry say. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're usually not dissuaded by economic indicators whether (home) prices 
are falling or going up," Jaime Shimabukuro, a mortgage consultant with 
Covina-based Occidental Mortgage, said of Latinos buyers, who make up about 90% 
of all his clients. "Pretty much, once they can afford it, they go in there and 
buy." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are recession-proof," said Federico Triebel, branch manager of Pacific 
West Bankcorp, a mortgage company in Burbank. "There is a resiliency among 
Latino buyers and most of it is cultural. They get together and help each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they buy a property, they're not thinking that in the next month or next 
six months that they might lose their job or be displaced. . . . In the event 
they have a problem, they (often) move in another member of the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos also appear more willing to join with family and friends initially to 
make a home purchase possible, observers say. That factor combined with an 
increased willingness by lenders to make such multiple-party loans, has opened 
up more buying opportunities among Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you'll have two couples who buy a three- or four-bedroom home," 
said Maria Camerena, a realtor for Century 21 Arroyo Seco in Los Angeles, who 
made nine of her 14 sales this year to Latinos. "Usually the intention is to 
stay together for a couple years until the other couple can buy them out." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Noriega plans on temporarily sharing ownership of her two-bedroom, 
one-bath Montecito Heights home she bought with a friend, and now roommate, for 
$130,000 last May. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been wanting to buy a house for the past three years, but I couldn't do 
it on my own," said the 34-year-old payroll company employee. "This was just a 
wonderful opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Noriega, who hopes to buy out her friend in a year, said her parents' 
experience with homeownership was etched into her consciousness at an early 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, she said, homeownership was a "ticket out" of many of the 
difficulties they faced as Mexican immigrants. "I saw that it would help me 
tremendously to be a property owner," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emilio Lopez agreed. The Highland Park resident bought his first home in 
April. Lopez' parents helped him qualify to buy the $105,000 two-bedroom, 
one-bath home with a back-yard Jacuzzi. His new lifestyle is markedly different 
from his early childhood. Back then, his parents were renters who could afford 
little. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were living in apartments that were really bad," said Lopez, an 
administrative assistant for the Los Angeles County Department of Health 
Services. "All these years here, deep down inside I felt alienated. . . . I 
felt that we weren't being treated with the respect we had gotten before (in 
Guatemala) and it was very important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was a teen-ager, Lopez persuaded his family to sell property 
they owned in Guatemala so that they could buy their own house in Los Angeles, 
which they did. Lopez said his family is now convinced that homeownership is 
essential to a better standard of living. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have dirt that you can grab and feel that it's your land. It's a very 
wholesome thing that's tied to the whole philosophy of the Hispanic," Lopez 
said of homeownership. "It reaffirms all your beliefs in yourself and your 
self-esteem. You have that much more right to demand your rights, and people 
treat you with respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Theresa Arreguin and her husband, Gregorio, 30, recently helped Arreguin's 
mother buy her first home by co-signing the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 She helped her mother buy the two-bedroom, one-bath home in El Sereno just a 
year after Arreguin and her new husband bought their first home two blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was living with her until I got married," said Arreguin. "And when I got 
married, I knew I had to get something for her. I saw my parents go through the 
struggles with (renting). And not having your own home when you're 50 or 60, 
it's scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Garcia said that buying his house in Glendale for $140,000 gave him a 
sense of accomplishment he hasn't before experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents never owned any property," said Garcia, a computer technician. 
"But when you buy your own house -- your own private land -- you can do 
whatever you wish. It gives you a sense of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 The quest for stability and the hope that a house will appreciate in value to 
provide economic security are foremost among many new Latino home buyers, 
Camerena, the Century 21 realtor, said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel (homeownership) is the best security, even though homes are going 
down in price," Camerena said. "They feel if they hang in there five or 10 
years, the equity will be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Armida Hernandez, 31, and Oscar Hernandez, 35, of Los Angeles said they had 
their 5-year-old son in mind when they recently purchased a second home in 
Montecito Heights, two doors away from Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to provide some kind of future for our son so that maybe when he 
goes to college he'll have something he can sell to cover his expenses," Armida 
Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single penny we have has gone into buying these homes, but my family 
and Oscar's family have always believed you've got to provide for your children 
and a house is a good way to provide." 
</P>
<P>
 Another key reason for the surge in Latino home buyers in the 1990s was more 
flexible lending standards brought about by the recession and by a changed 
political climate. Many Latinos, as well as other minority and low-income 
buyers, in the past often found it extremely difficult to get a home loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When houses are moving quickly (lenders) tend to be stricter on their lending 
policies," Shimabukuro said. "Now (in a much weaker market) they're willing to 
be more creative and more relaxed." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, a Clinton Administration directive to beef up the 1977 Community 
Reinvestment Act (CRA), the nation's major anti-discrimination law in lending, 
has opened new home-buying opportunities to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 And the strict loan reporting standards required by the Home Mortgage 
Disclosure Act (HMDA), enacted by Congress in 1975 and expanded in 1989, has 
focused more attention on fair-lending practices. 
</P>
<P>
 HMDA requires lending institutions -- including many independent mortgage 
lenders -- to disclose the characteristics of loan applicants and recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 HMDA reports, which are available to the public, assist enforced compliance 
with anti-bias statutes by helping to identify discriminatory lending patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 The push to increase minority lending has also gotten help from the country's 
two major providers of mortgage funds, who play a large role in shaping the 
policies of local lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal National Mortgage Assn. (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan 
Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac), both quasi-governmental agencies, buy home loans 
on the secondary market and package them as Wall Street securities. This 
financial clout gives them lots of influence over local banks, S&Ls and 
mortgage bankers and brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Through these local lenders, Fannie Mae offers its Community Homebuyer program 
and Freddie Mac its Welcome Home loan program aimed specifically at putting 
home ownership within reach of low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 And with this backing from Fannie and Freddie, many more lenders are actively 
soliciting minority applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 This new eagerness among lenders to make minority home loans has proven 
important to Latino home buyers, many of whom don't earn and spend in the same 
way as other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 A large number of Latinos, for instance, save cash "under the mattress," or 
outside of traditional bank accounts, lenders say. Often times, they have 
little or no credit history. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of false perceptions about low- to moderate-income people," 
said Mario Antoci, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of 
Irvine-based American Savings Bank, one of the largest lenders to minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception is that they're always delinquent (with payments), that there 
would be a high foreclosure rate. Well, it doesn't work out that way," he said. 
"Turns out that perhaps the lower the status, from an economic standpoint, the 
more important the home is to you. The more you'll do to protect that home." 
</P>
<P>
 Antoci said American's foreclosure rates in low- to moderate-income 
neighborhoods are "substantially" below that of more affluent areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Ancira, director of the Home Loan Counseling Center, which serves 
predominantly Latino Lincoln Heights and South-Central Los Angeles, said that 
with the proper preparation, clients with no credit, those with credit 
blemishes and even those who deal all in cash can usually get a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lenders are so lenient that they're accepting a lot of those (applicants) 
that they didn't before," she said. "But (clients) do have to be very frank and 
open with their loan agent or broker." 
</P>
<P>
 Those with bad credit usually need to write letters of explanation and, if 
necessary, pay whomever they owe money to, she said. For those who deal only in 
cash, banks are beginning to accept grocery store receipts and paid utility 
bills in lieu of conventional paycheck stubs, bank records and credit 
histories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've learned to deal with the realities of the cultures we're trying to do 
business with," Antoci said. "We won't make a loan to somebody if there's not 
at least one W-2 in the group, but we will accept a portion coming from cash 
sources." 
</P>
<P>
 As lending institutions begin to institutionalize this new criteria, it makes 
the future housing market more accessible to Latinos as well, said Fernando 
Guerra, of Loyola Marymount University. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Guerra said, the increase in Latino home buyers will prove to be a 
"positive force" for all of the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 "As renters, it's hard for the Latino community to create residential 
stability," he said. "When you have residential stability, you have people 
engaged in the community. In terms of politics, you have high voter 
registration and turnout. You have people who are less tolerant of criminal or 
anti-social behavior in a neighborhood where they own the property." 
</P>
<P>
 Emilio Lopez, of Highland Park, said he is still ecstatic about his new home 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Privacy is very important to us," he said of Latinos. "We enjoy having a 
house with trees, land. It's more important to those who come from the native 
lands. When you go through the hustle and bustle of L.A., (a home of your own) 
is a place to recycle your energy and build your inner peace."

<P>
 When Marvin Lowrey retired recently, everyone asked him where he planned to 
move. "I am staying just where I am," he quickly replied. 
</P>
<P>
 For 48 years, home for Lowrey has been a 1,600-square-foot, two-bedroom house 
-- for which he paid $5,000 -- in the northern section of Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, the former Brinks Armored Car account executive can no longer hop on the 
Red Car for the easy 35-cent ride into downtown Los Angeles or walk down the 
block to buy Thanksgiving dinner from the neighborhood turkey farm. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lowrey, 69, likes the fact that his well-built home has weathered the 
years and that Rosemead is close to family members and activities he enjoys. So 
why follow the lead of friends who have moved east to the desert or to other 
retirement locales? "Rosemead has everything I need," Lowrey said. "I can't see 
any reason to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 An increasingly diverse mix of residents -- the population of 52,000 is 49% 
Latino, 33% Asian and 15% Caucasian -- call this San Gabriel Valley bedroom 
community home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5.5-square-mile city, located 10 miles east of downtown Los Angeles is 
bounded by the railroad tracks along Grand Avenue on the north, the 60 freeway 
on the south, the Eaton Wash on the east and New Avenue on the west. Both the 
San Bernardino Freeway (10) and the Pomona Freeway cut through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtor Harry Lim agrees with Lowrey that Rosemead's convenience appeals to 
residents. Lim's client base is predominantly Asian immigrants, no surprise 
considering the tremendous influx of Asians (the community has grown 371% since 
the 1980 Census) who have recently settled in Rosemead, primarily on its 
northern side. 
</P>
<P>
 These newcomers, priced out of nearby Monterey Park where many of their 
relatives and friends who came earlier bought, want an affordable home close to 
a solid public-transportation system. They find both in Rosemead, where buses 
along Garvey Avenue and into downtown Los Angeles bring workplaces and shopping 
centers within reach of lower-end homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety percent of the homes on the market in Rosemead are single family, most 
built in the 1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the northern section of Rosemead (the 10 freeway serves as the unofficial 
divider), the area that realtors say many buyers consider more desirable 
because of longtime residents who take good care of their properties, typical 
prices are $150,000 for a one-bedroom, one-bath starter home; $250,000 for a 
three-bedroom, 1,500 square-foot house and $350,000 for a top-of-the-line, 
four-bedroom, 2 1/2-bath home. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices in the southern section start at $140,000 and peak at $300,000. 
Residents there, many of whom are Latino, say home prices would escalate if 
there were less mixed-use zoning (manufacturing plants close to houses) and 
more code enforcement on home remodeling, both of which contribute to more 
jumbled neighborhoods than in the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Rosemead home buyers appreciate the area's well-regarded school systems, 
said Isabel Sanchez of El Camino Real Estate. "They feel very comfortable with 
the way school is taught here, more so than in some surrounding communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Elida Martinez, who in June, 1994, purchased a four-bedroom, two-bath home in 
south Rosemead for $210,000, is one such buyer. The 32-year-old mother of three 
wanted to live in the south section of Rosemead so her children could attend 
the Garvey School District. (There are two elementary school districts covering 
the city -- Garvey in the southwest and Rosemead in the northeast; high 
schoolers attend either Alhambra or El Monte campuses.) Martinez's brothers and 
sisters send their children to Garvey schools and have spoken highly of the 
education the students were receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children are monitored well here and the teachers are concerned about 
them," Martinez said. "Every child is encouraged to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching a multicultural classroom of children, many of whom don't speak 
English, can be a daunting task, acknowledged Garvey Supt. Anita Suazo. One way 
she meets the challenge is by embracing her students' diversity: 
Administrators, teachers and bilingual counselors are encouraged to teach, 
rather than just tolerate, cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have just as many Asian parents come to Cinco de Mayo celebrations as 
Hispanic ones," Suazo said. "I think that by trying to understand why people 
behave differently, we have helped both our students and their parents." 
</P>
<P>
 As much as Suazo and other community leaders have tried to bring Rosemead's 
large Latino and Asian populations together, some residents believe the groups 
still keep too much to themselves, failing to extend a warm welcome to each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemead, with its ethnic diversity, would seem to be ripe for hate crimes and 
racial strife, but that hasn't been the case, according to Capt. Bob Mirabella, 
who works out of the Temple City sheriff's station to oversee law enforcement 
in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Mirabella sees "a real desire for neighbors to get to know each 
other." He believes the city's predominantly older population and balanced 
ethnic breakdown keep such offenses rare. Mirabella points with pride to the 
250 residents who turned out for the first citywide Neighborhood Watch barbecue 
this past summer. 
</P>
<P>
 And school officials, police officers and community groups have started to 
meet together under the YES (Youth Effectiveness System) program to identify 
and give guidance to at-risk youths in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 Such citywide cohesiveness, along with pumped-up community-policing efforts 
such as bike patrols, walking beats and socializing between residents and 
officers, will help promote a safer Rosemead, Mirabella said. Indeed, the 
captain has seen a 7% decrease in crime in Rosemead from 1992 to 1993, with the 
most common offenses falling in the petty-theft category. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Diaz has stayed in Rosemead because she relishes that quiet 
atmosphere. Diaz, 36, director of USC's Neighborhood Resource Center, grew up 
in the city. She's temporarily renting an apartment on Hellman Avenue just 
south of the 10 freeway and will inherit her grandmother's house down the block 
within a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Diaz admits that the area's "lack of flash" can sometimes be a drawback as 
well as a bonus. "If you like a small-town community, Rosemead is for you," she 
said. "For the older population who like a slower pace it's great, but for 
younger people it can be limiting." 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz would like to see a greater range of restaurants serving ethnic fare such 
as Indian or Italian food, a large indoor shopping mall and a movie theater in 
Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemead's business community could use beefing up, agrees Joe Vasquez, who 
has lived on the city's north side since 1979, when he paid $76,000 for a home 
on Marybeth Avenue. Vasquez, a 46-year-old technician for Pacific Bell in 
Alhambra, who also serves as a Rosemead city councilman, would like to see more 
job creation in Rosemead and businesses that thrive, instead of just survive. 
</P>
<P>
 But he does see some benefit to Rosemead's modest growth: "Surrounding 
communities such as Monterey Park and San Gabriel are very dense with 
buildings. Rosemead has kept that in check. I wouldn't want to increase the 
density of parking here or lose open space for kids to play in." 
</P>
<P>
 While keeping a close eye on development, the city of Rosemead provides a 
conducive atmosphere for both business and homeowners, maintains Frank Tripepi, 
city manager for 20 years. He stresses that Rosemead, which was founded in 1867 
and incorporated in 1959, is a very financially stable city, with no 
outstanding general-obligation bonds and no city property or utility users' 
tax. The streets are well-maintained ("they seem to be repaving them every two 
years," marvels Martinez), as are sewers and other components of the city's 
infrastructure, he says. The city has also planted flowers along boulevard 
medians in an effort to spruce up the southern neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that means good news for potential home buyers considering Rosemead. 
"You won't get hit with special assessments here," Tripepi said.

GARDENING Q & A: ORGANIC ALTERNATIVES TO COMMERCIAL SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK E. CHRISTENSEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I hate to use chemical sprays in my garden, because I fear they may 
kill birds or other good creatures or damage the environment. Can you at least 
mention organic alternatives? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: I resort to sprays in my garden only when it is absolutely necessary, 
and that amounts to about once or twice a year. At times I've tried various 
concoctions recommended by organic gardening enthusiasts, but I must admit my 
success rate is rather low with them. 
</P>
<P>
 However, here is a recipe sent in by Jane Haines of Hacienda Heights, which 
she says a gardening friend gave to her -- and she reports that it really 
works, particularly on caterpillars and aphids. 
</P>
<P>
 In a one-quart spray bottle combine water, one teaspoon of liquid dish soap 
and one teaspoon of vegetable oil; shake to mix well. Spray each worm 
individually; they are dead by the next day. A light misting of the entire 
plant "does in" the aphids. And Jane happily says that this year she was 
rewarded with lady bugs -- the first she's seen in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like a good alternative to me, and I'll probably even try it myself 
the next time aphids or caterpillars invade my garden. Thanks, Jane, for 
sharing your success with us. Snake-Proofing Yard in Mountain Area 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Our home in the Santa Monica mountains is surrounded by denuded land. Being 
elderly we no longer have pets, but all kinds of wildlife now keep us company 
-- including snakes. We only kill the rattlesnakes, but we just killed the 
fourth one on our patio. One huge one got away a few weeks ago. There must be a 
nest of them near here. How do we get rid of them? 
</P>
<P>
 A: This is a bit out of my realm of expertise, but you can order booklet 
number 2996, "California Rattlesnakes," from ANR Publications, University of 
California, 6701 San Pablo Avenue, Oakland, Calif. 94608-1239. The cost is 
$1.50, and a check should be made out to "UC Regents." This booklet describes 
species and their habitats; how to snake-proof buildings and yards; plus first 
aid for snakebites. 
</P>
<P>
 Note to all gardeners: From this same address you can order the "UC Farm and 
Garden Publications Catalog" at no charge. This lists a number of very useful 
garden-related books and booklets available at nominal cost through the 
California Cooperative Extension Service. Is the Fruit From a 'Tree Tomato' 
Edible? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you call a "tree tomato" (its scientific and local name, please)? 
I've seen it advertised, and a friend of ours has one. It's one of the most 
attractive plants I've ever seen. It's laden with deep red fruits; are they 
edible? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Tree tomatoes are commonly called by that name; their scientific name is 
Cyphomandra botacea. Fast-growing shrubs, they are evergreen or partially 
evergreen, if protected from frost. Their leaves are large and attractive. The 
red fruits are about the size and shape of a large egg, and they ripen in 
winter. Yes, they are edible, with an acid, slightly tomato-like flavor. The 
raw fruits have a "different" sort of taste, but they are good when stewed with 
a little sugar, and there are other recipes for their use. Seeds may be planted 
from March through May. The plants require sun or part shade, average water and 
protection from aphids. Rose Video on Pruning 
</P>
<P>
 Readers: I've had so many requests for information on rose care over the years 
that I decided to make a new 30-minute video called "The Care and Pruning of 
Your Roses," which demonstrates simple, yet successful techniques for the easy 
growing of beautiful in your home garden. 
</P>
<P>
 To order for yourself, or as a gift, please send a check for $18.99 per video 
(which covers the prices of the video, plus shipping, handling and sales tax) 
to Jack Christensen-Video, P.O. Box 1231-B, Ontario, Calif. 91762. Please 
specify name and address of any gift recipients. Allow three to four weeks for 
delivery. Available for the holidays and in plenty of time for January pruning.

HOMEWISE: RADIANT HEATER LOOKS LIKE A WALL HANGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: We're thinking of buying a heater that hangs on the wall, has a 
fabric cover and looks like a painting. We want to use it to add a little extra 
heat to the baby's room. Is it an appropriate choice? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Yes, it will likely work well for your intended purpose. It will allow 
you to keep the baby's room warmer without adding more heat to the entire 
house. It has no fan so it will operate quietly and won't contribute to the 
circulation of dust. 
</P>
<P>
 This heater produces a form of heat called radiant heat. It works like the sun 
does, heating objects in its path rather than air. Like the sun, its rays feel 
warm to you even if the surrounding air is cool. It works like this because the 
heater's surface is kept much warmer than the rest of the room's surfaces 
(though not too hot to touch), so it constantly radiates heat waves to them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to place radiant heaters in a location where they are free and 
clear of any obstructions such as furniture or drapes that would reduce the 
transfer of heat. In the baby's room it might be best to hang the heater on a 
wall near one side of the baby's crib so no objects obstruct the heater's view 
of the crib. Not too close. As a test, sit quietly right next to the crib with 
the heat on, stay there awhile to learn how it feels to you. Try hanging a 
blanket on the side of the crib that is opposite the heater. Then, the radiant 
heat will warm both this blanket and the crib mattress, making a cozy nest. 
</P>
<P>
 These heaters are available in different sizes. They are rated by the number 
of watts they deliver, typically 300-500 watts per panel. The dealers should be 
able to help you decide what size(s) will work for you. 
</P>
<P>
 You can choose several ways to control your heater's operation. You can simply 
plug it into an outlet, control it with a manual switch, an automatic timer, or 
a thermostat. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure to shop around for the best buy. Compare price, control mechanism, 
warranty conditions, quality and durability, size, and aesthetics. For safety's 
sake, consider only units that are UL approved, and carefully read 
manufacturer's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other types of radiant heaters that might be suitable for this 
application too. Oil-filled and fan-option units come to mind as having similar 
advantages (quiet, no dust circulation).

CUT YOUR UTILITY BILLS: WATER-SAVER KITS GIVE RETURN ON INVESTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES DULLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I have seen $10 do-it-yourself water-saver kits for old toilets that 
claim to cut water bills by $100 per year. Do they flush OK, are they easy to 
install and do they save that much water? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Since toilets account for about 40% of your water bills, installing a 
simple water-saver kit can save tens of thousands of gallons per year. For a 
typical family, an annual savings of $100 is reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several basic designs of do-it-yourself toilet water saver kits that 
provide effective flushes. They range in price from $4 to $25. It takes about 
15 minutes to install even the most complicated kit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dual-flush kits are most effective. These provide a low water volume flush for 
liquid wastes and a full volume flush for solids. Ninety percent of flushes are 
for liquids only and do not require the full toilet tank volume. 
</P>
<P>
 With one dual flush kit, push the flush handle down for a water saving low 
volume flush. For a full tank volume flush for solids, lift up the handle. The 
handle does not have to be held continuously as the toilet flushes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other designs have two handles. Push a long handle down for a full volume 
flush. For a water saving flush, hold down a short handle while it flushes. 
These are effective, but less convenient than the above design. 
</P>
<P>
 Inexpensive rapid-closing flapper kits (about $10) are simple to install and 
effective. A flapper is the flexible seal that fits over the large drain hole 
inside the tank. It often attaches to the handle with a chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The best rapid-closing flapper kits are adjustable because the amount of water 
needed for an effective flush varies among toilet designs. When you first 
install a new flapper, it takes several flushes to fine tune it. 
</P>
<P>
 One design has a simple adjustable knob in the flapper with various-size drain 
holes. Each size hole allows water to fill the flapper at different rates. This 
controls how fast the flapper closes and the amount of water savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Other types of inexpensive devices snap on or slip over the overflow tube in 
the tank. Some designs have a float that moves down the tube and forces the 
flapper to close earlier. Another inexpensive design (about $4) clips on the 
tube to limit how far the flapper opens. Both designs are adjustable. 
</P>
<P>
 Inexpensive water dam kits are better than just putting a brick in the tank. 
Bricks slowly disintegrate in the water and granules can get under the flapper 
seal. This may cause a continuous leak. Good dams are made of springy sheet 
metal or plastic with foam or rubber seals around the edge.

Royalgreen Drive, Cincinnati, Ohio 45244. How to Replace Sliding Screen Door 
Rollers 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I stretch plastic over my sliding patio screen door in the winter. The 
rollers are worn out and the door doesn't fit the track well. Can I repair it 
myself so it makes a better seal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Putting clear plastic film over your screen door helps reduce air leaks 
from the wind. It also creates a dead air space, which reduces heat loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The rollers are easy to replace yourself. You can purchase new rollers for 
about $5 a pair at your hardware store. Remove the screen door from the track. 
Unscrew each roller adjustment screw so the roller assembly hangs down. Replace 
the rollers and readjust the screws.

TWO STEPS BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a collegiate user of the original Whole Earth Catalog in the 1970s I read 
with keen interest the article on Stewart Brand ("Always Two Steps Ahead," by 
Katherine Fulton, Oct. 30). 
</P>
<P>
 I noted that Fulton had a prodigious task in trying to explicate a personality 
that is characterized by constant internal motion.I began to wonder whether 
Brand's excitement with his brain's ability to boggle itself hadn't begun to 
obscure the goals of his "lazy officer," who uses his inventiveness to 
accomplish a task. 
</P>
<P>
 When I read that Brand described his 17-year-old son, Noah, as a "wonderful 
leftover from a romance," that convinced me that his brain had indeed lost 
contact with his heart. It is that contact that this 70-hour-a-week "lazy 
officer" must rekindle if he expects to be remembered for anything.

BAD CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is both sad and incredible that in this "modern" age we are so alienated 
from our humanity that the viewpoint expressed in P. Alexander Jesseson's 
article is a rarity ("Connecting," Oct. 30). We are never going to end the 
condition of war, whether against other nations or in our cities and homes, 
until we end the abuse, alienation and demoralization of our children.Billions 
are spent on defense, prisons and the war on drugs, but only the ability to 
feel and empathize will end the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time I learned to walk I was being molested by my father, an icon of 
the American dream: the son of European immigrant parents, an Ivy 
League-educated attorney and judge. He was a charming, handsome, violent 
alcoholic who ran our family, when he was around, like a South American 
dictator. Perhaps it was a primary school teacher who saved me from the mental 
illness my sister eventually suffered. She took me into the hall and asked me 
if there was "something wrong at home." It was the one time in three decades 
that anyone saw beyond my facade. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the gangbangers, I turned the violence against myself and suffered the 
ravages of what I call the "hero/martyr complex," with its cycles of compulsive 
over-achieving and burnout. Now, after five years of dealing with the trauma of 
the memories, I open the newspaper to find, instead of support for what 
happened to me, stories about false memory syndrome.

MISSING THE JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I started reading Jonathan Gold's "Frank Appraisals" (On the Town, Oct. 30) 
I soon realized that he was talking about Julio's Bucket. I first went to this 
renowned Eagle Rock dive about seven years ago, and though it is far from where 
I live and work, I go there when I can. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold missed the point of Julio's politically incorrect humor. Julio plays on 
his customers' prejudices until he draws them out to face their own racism. 
Almost every time I have visited the diner, Julio has made it a point to bait 
unsuspecting racists, drawing them along with his anti-immigrant diatribes and 
ending with his Hitler statement. The last time I heard it, I almost gagged on 
my burger, but when I looked at Julio in shock, he winked at me. I am of mixed 
racial heritage, and he was letting me in on the joke. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure he insulted Gold's lesbian friend, just as he insults me and every 
other minority who walks through his doors. He expects you to insult him back. 
I think that Julio believes that people like Hitler get ahead when people stop 
being proud of what they are and start trying to blend in. He wants people to 
stand up for themselves. 
</P>

<P>
 My wife and I attended Occidental College, virtually across the street from 
the Bucket, and we always make a point of going there to have lunch when we are 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 We go there to enjoy the garlic-laden cheeseburgers and the bacon-wrapped 
shrimp. Gold's "Frank" is a gourmet chef from the Basque country and one of the 
best lunches he ever made for us was breasts of chicken sauteed in cognac. But 
we also go because of his outrageous political ejaculations. Most of us 
certainly don't agree with what he says, but we understand that his outbursts 
are mostly for shock value.

FOOD FOR THOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a blessing for Karen Stabiner that she can approach dining out as "an 
adventure" ("Whining and Dining," Oct. 30), that she can trust the chef to make 
her taste buds happy and not leave her with an after-meal hangover. For many 
business travelers like myself, eating out is anything but an 
adventure.Finally, after years of bloating, belching and indigestion from 
overindulging in fine eating establishments, I have learned to eat to nourish 
my body and not abuse it. 
</P>
<P>
 I was beginning to think that restaurateurs had awakened to the fact that many 
life-threatening diseases result from overindulging our bodies. I was appalled 
to read the quote from the chef who considers meeting the needs of his 
customers "prostitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Why must we battle to choose what we want to eat when we dine out? Aren't 
restaurants in the food service business? 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Edwards 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Stabiner got it all wrong. I'm not a food fascist just because I refuse to 
submit myself to the whims of culinary autocrats. Her suggestion to people who 
want to follow a healthy diet ("(they) could do us all a favor and either stay 
home or bring their own food") is preposterous and anachronistic in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, tight times for chefs have brought about a most welcome change in 
restaurants: customized dining. A modern chef's expertise can be measured not 
only by his creativity, but by an ability to satisfy diverse individual tastes.

ON THE TOWN: THEY WENT THATAWAY; AROUND L.A., MOVIE CREWS CAN BE TOUGH ACTS TO 
FOLLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Patt Morrison 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By all means, let the tourists chase themselves dizzy around L.A.'s flossier 
parts, following Coolidge Administration-era maps to the stars' homes as if 
they were on some posthumous scavenger hunt: "I can't get over it -- I'm 
standing in front of Theda Bara's house !" 
</P>
<P>
 Keep selling them those maps. Keep herding them toward Universal Studios. Just 
keep them away from the real business of making movies. 
</P>
<P>
 For it doesn't happen in Beverly Hills (at least not without a fight, I 
suspect). It happens down by the railroad tracks and among the lofts and 
warehouses. It happens late at night and early in the morning, in the old 
financial district, at City Hall and, once, in front of my house. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no maps to these places; there are only signs. On street corners, on 
telephone poles, caught among the paper clutter of garage-sale notices and Lost 
cat -- reward! posters. The signs are nailed up or stapled up, an obscure, 
cryptic word or two, often scribbled in black marker on fluorescent cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black Dog" . . . "Sand" . . . "After the Game." And then the slash of an 
arrow. Follow the arrow far enough, and you'll find someone filming 
commercials, movies, TV shows, music videos, student films. The city's "shoot 
sheet" averages more than 50 locations a day. Look for them far from tourist 
sites, their signs encoded in words that tip off crew and cast without 
announcing "Hey, we're making a movie here!"  
</P>
<P>
 An acquaintance who used to do such things for a living tells me that movie 
crews often take a word from the film title or production company name "but 
also try to make it look like directions to a party" to throw people off the 
scent. For years, my friend says, Sylvester Stallone's crews used "Muscle" on 
their signs. "Sly" would have been a giveaway, "Todd and Marsha's wedding" too 
broad a temptation for someone cruising for a good time to wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 An erstwhile location manager who became a director has sometimes thought 
about "what people think when they see these signs, whether they wonder what 
they are." (In the Midwest, maybe; here, the best defense is an eyes-front lack 
of curiosity.) 
</P>
<P>
 If, after all this, you still want to go location-trolling, keep in mind that 
these are movie shoots, not premieres. The most you're likely to see is zip, as 
in zip, shoot the scene, zip, back to the trailer, zip -- gone. In between are 
tedious episodes of technicians setting up lights and cameras, eating frequent 
meals and doing work that looks like an outdoor shop class. Chess matches have 
brought crowds to their feet more readily. 
</P>
<P>
 The feature film made at the elementary school across from my house in the 
'80s (I won't mention the name, but "Mars" may help you) was stupefyingly 
boring to watch, both in the making and on the small screen. Oddly enough, what 
the director was seeing through his camera showed up simultaneously on my TV 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was only after I was allowed back in my own house. For perhaps a 
half-hour, I sat in neutral in my car, the needle rising on my thermostat and 
two weeks' worth of groceries puddling in the back of the car as Officer 
Protect-And-Serve told me I couldn't pull into my own driveway lest I ruin the 
scene.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why movies are so often shot among the warehouses and so early or 
late: Residents don't take kindly to the attitude that "We're filming here" 
ranks in importance with "We're curing polio here." Jonas Salk never blocked my 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 The best location-shoot sign I ever saw was a green-and-white Goofy face 
framed inside an arrow pointing right, the elaborate leftover from some Disney 
shoot. Friends and I retrieved it from a post and affixed it to an office desk 
lamp, where it pointed at an editor who didn't notice until tour groups began 
snickering. 
</P>
<P>
 At least they weren't taking pictures.

CHECKING IN; HOW CAN A HOTEL RESTAURANT COMPETE WITH ITS FANCY NEIGHBORS? GOOD 
QUESTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The difficult task of any local hotel restaurant is convincing its guests -- 
and the public at large -- to ignore L.A.'s many other good places to eat. In 
Togo or Finland, perhaps, it wouldn't take much persuading, but in Los Angeles, 
the menu has to be fairly compelling to fill the restaurant every night. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-star Beverly Prescott Hotel seemed to overcome that obstacle when it 
hired Hans Rockenwagner, the creator of Rockenwagner and Fama, as consulting 
chef. But somehow, the hotel's restaurant, Rox, never quite took off, and a 
little more than a year later, the owners are making an abrupt about-face. 
They've hired Sylvie Laly Darr, a young French sommelier and former manager of 
Zuni Cafe in San Francisco, to revamp the restaurant. And they changed the name 
from Rox to Sylvie. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Zuni continues to be one of my favorite San Francisco restaurants, I was 
curious to see what changes Darr would make. Sylvie is only half-filled when I 
meet a friend for dinner there one night. She is early, I am a little late, so 
I join her for a glass of Veuve Clicquot at the bar, where rattan and batik 
prints, Oriental carpets and potted palms transform the room into an outpost of 
some tropical clime. Deep in conversation, we feel very relaxed, reluctant to 
move over to the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 As we are seated, the waiter hands us a single sheet of buttercup yellow with 
the day's date at the top, the name Sylvie spelled out in Mediterranean blue at 
the bottom. Words like feta , salt cod , pesto and aio li are the first clues 
that the menu has gone Mediterranean. Several dishes sound gutsy -- a good 
sign. Hotel menus are generally more timid. 
</P>
<P>
 We start with a bowl of l'ai go-sau , a light, fragrant Provencal fish soup, 
then order crispy quail set on a hillock of tiny green lentils shot with 
pungent balsamic vinegar and the golf-ball-sized salt cod fritters with 
anchovy- chipotle sauce. The last two are good ideas, but the results are heavy 
and greasy. 
</P>
<P>
 We're seated near the small open kitchen where chef Thomas Moloney (who worked 
under Rockenwagner) and the cooks are working furiously, heads bent over the 
food. Manager Darr is right there, inspecting each plate as it comes up on the 
counter, wiping away any splashed sauce, sometimes delivering the plates to the 
table. If she wants to remake the restaurant, this is the way to do it, by 
paying attention not only to the concept but also to the details of its 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
 We fare better with main courses. The roasted half chicken splashed with wine 
vinegar, strewn with mixed beans and served with sauteed swiss chard is 
comforting if a bit boring. A wedge of salmon is perfectly cooked, translucent 
at the center, delicious played against a soft pillow of cider-braised cabbage. 
The roasted pumpkin coulis seems to be there purely for visual contrast; the 
pureed pumpkin does nothing for the delicate salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon chowder is thin and pallid, but a bowl of steamed mussels in 
herb-flecked broth is simple and delicious. I love the idea of stuffed squid, 
but the stuffing and the strong tomato-oregano sauce taste murky: a terrible 
dish. Creamy wild mushroom risotto is rich but well executed, and rack of lamb 
in a thyme-scented red wine sauce is quite decent, but grilled rib eye is as 
gristly and fatty a piece of meat as I've ever been served in a restaurant.  
</P>
<P>
 The wine list is where Darr shines. Among the whites, my picks include the '93 
Honig barrel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc ($22), Josmeyer's 1992 steely and floral 
Alsatian Gewurtztraminer ($30) and the lovely peach-scented 1990 
Chateauneuf-du-Pape blanc from one of the Rhone's historic estates, Chateau La 
Nerthe ($44). The list is surprisingly short on Cotes du Rhones or even 
Chianti, both of which would go well with this food. But if you have a penchant 
for lusty red wines of the Rhone, consider the 1988 Cote Rotie from Gilles 
Barges ($48) or the 1988 Chateauneuf-du-Pape from Domaine de Beaucastel ($58). 
</P>
<P>
 The dessert chef, fortunately, offers more than the usual tiramisu and cre me 
bru l e e. There's a flaky strudel filled with apples and raisins, a pear 
stuffed with mascarpone and poached in raspberry liqueur, and a deep, dark 
triple-layer chocolate cake that takes no hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 Would I come back on my own money? Not quite yet. Flavors need to be more 
focused and vibrant, less tentative, execution more consistent. I do think 
that, with Darr on the case, the restaurant has a good chance of becoming an 
interesting lunch or dinner spot. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it's going to attract more than hotel guests, it has to aim higher than 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvie, the Beverly Prescott Hotel, 1224 S. Beverwil Drive (at Pico 
Boulevard), Los Angeles; (310) 772-2999. Valet and lot parking. Smoking at the 
bar, in the side room or at tables on the patio. Dinner for two, food only, 
$52-$86. Corkage $10.

4 SCHOOL DISTRICTS BORROWED CASH TO INVEST IN FUND; CRISIS: ORANGE COUNTY 
TREASURER GAVE A SPECIAL GUARANTEE AGAINST RISK FOR THOSE AGENCIES, BUT NOT THE 
OTHER GOVERNMENT CONCERNS WHO INVESTED IN THE TROUBLED POOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lured by the promise of raising badly needed revenue and a special guarantee 
against risk, four Orange County school districts last year took the 
extraordinary step of borrowing a total of $200 million for the sole purpose of 
reaping profit from the county's controversial investment fund, officials said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Provided with written and oral promises in 1993 that the county's huge 
investment fund would be used to safeguard every penny of their principal, the 
four agencies hoped to earn about $1 million a year each from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But with last week's stunning announcement of a $1.5-billion decline in the 
value of the county's now-$18.5-billion investment fund, the prospects remain 
uncertain for the venture undertaken by three districts -- Newport-Mesa 
Unified, Irvine Unified and North Orange County Community College District -- 
and the Orange County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 If the return from the county's investments drops too far, the districts could 
have trouble paying back the interest on their loans, which in some cases are 
equivalent to half their annual budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 And if other investors pull out of the county investment pool, some school 
officials are worried that Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron will not be 
able to follow through on his guarantee to protect the borrowed $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless Bob Citron has a personal checking account to buy back (millions) 
worth of bonds, I don't think he had authority to provide the guarantee," said 
Chriss Street, investment banker who has been following the school districts' 
venture since its inception and helped organize an unsuccessful political 
challenge to Citron this fall. "Did the supervisors grant him some special 
authority to give those guarantees?" 
</P>
<P>
 Citron declined to answer reporters' questions Saturday. Assistant Treasurer 
Matthew Raabe could not be reached for comment on the school district 
investments late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But in interviews after the initial deal was made in 1993, both Citron and 
Raabe said the unprecedented arrangement was a no-lose situation for the school 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible for them to lose," Raabe said then. "It was structured in 
such a way so they could never lose a dime. All they can do is make money on 
this deal. . . . I don't think you could get a more secure financing than this, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe said the same in a letter to each district explaining the particulars of 
the deal: "There is no risk related to the . . . principal amount." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's 31 school districts have a total of $550 million in borrowed 
funds invested with Citron's office, according to John L. Nelson, assistant 
superintendent of business services at the county Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the borrowed money, about $350 million, is revenue districts routinely 
use every year to cover operating expenses while awaiting tax receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 But as state funds for education dwindled, four local education agencies in 
1993 took the highly unusual step of borrowing large sums specifically to add 
to Citron's investment pool, hoping to reap profits to pay for teachers and 
equipment. Citron's office gave officials of all four districts a written 
guarantee they would not lose any of their initial investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other investors in the county pool, the districts can withdraw their 
funds only each June. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most secure (part) of the whole issue," Nelson said Saturday. 
"The regular pool, we're all aware, there's no guarantee to it." 
</P>
<P>
 "As of now, I still feel comfortable (that the districts' investment is 
secure)," he added, "but I don't have all the answers yet. And I don't think I 
will for a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the initial deal was struck in June, 1993, officials in all four 
school districts said they became involved with the innovative investments in 
an effort to offset continued cuts in state funding for education. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials were aware that their involvement in the securities was risky 
and unorthodox by their usual standards but many said they felt reassured by 
Citron's guarantee. With their principal investment secure, the districts could 
lose money only if the return on their investments fell below the interest they 
owed on their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've cut our budget and cut our budget in this district. We've had to do 
without a lot of things," Gilbert Moreno, vice chancellor of the North Orange 
County Community College District, said at the time. "I'm searching for 
innovative, creative ways to enhance our revenues, and, yes, some of those mean 
you have to accept an acceptable risk." 
</P>
<P>
 The college district borrowed about $56 million; Irvine Unified about $54.5 
million; Newport-Mesa nearly $47 million, and the Orange County Department of 
Education, $42 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose was, in the beginning, to increase operating funds for 
educational purposes during a very tight time," Nelson said Saturday. "In any 
kind of budget situation, you look for ways to reduce expenditures or increase 
income." 
</P>
<P>
 The investments were made simply "to increase our operating funds," Nelson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom Burnham, an Irvine Unified trustee who voted against the investment 
project, said Saturday that betting on interest rates for school budgets is 
"ridiculous" public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel like it was worth the risk," Burnham said. "I was uncomfortable 
with the risk and benefits analysis. The pay-back seemed a little tight in my 
view." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, he said, "you can see how seductive it can be when school 
districts are so strapped for money." 
</P>
<P>
 With an investment strategy of borrowing money to buy securities, then using 
the securities as collateral for a second round of borrowing and buying, the 
districts earned about $1 million in interest during the first year of the 
investment, Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on news that the overall county fund has lost $1.5 billion in value, 
Nelson said he expects that this year's results are "going to be less than last 
year." Newport-Mesa Unified Supt. Mac Bernd said he expects his district's 
investment to earn about $400,000 less than projected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to get as great a return, but it's not a question of us 
losing money. We don't have it in line to even be spent," he said. "There are 
some doomsayers who have a lot grimmer picture, but I think we're OK, unless 
there's something I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McArthur, a member of the Irvine Unified school board until this month, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a sound investment. The principal was never at risk," he said 
Saturday. "We may not make as much money as we thought we would make. . . . It 
is probably not something we are going to do any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked in 1993 why the treasurer's office would offer a guarantee of some 
investors' money but not others, Raabe said at the time it would be impossible 
to arrange such a deal for every school district, city and other government 
agency. The special deal was possible only because the $200 million was a small 
fraction of the overall pool, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to tell people you're making money for somebody else but you 
can't do it for them. But that's what we had to do," Raabe said then.

TWO INVESTORS CONSIDER JUMPING OUT OF O.C. POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 As top Orange County administrators convened in secret Saturday to assess the 
fallout of the county's multibillion-dollar investment fund, two investors 
indicated they may pull out of the massive securities pool whose $1.5-billion 
drop in value caused a financial furor last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The private session included the county's administrative officer and embattled 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, whose high-risk investment strategy 
has come under nationwide scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's key financial players are charting a new course for the 
crippled fund that includes the investments of 185 cities, school districts and 
other governmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as a county management team tried to minimize the damage, the elected 
leaders of two government investors -- the city of Newport Beach and the Irvine 
Ranch Water District -- warned Saturday that they might withdraw from the 
investment pool because they are unhappy with Citron and his handling of the 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like they are holding a gun to our head," said Newport Beach Mayor John 
W. Hedges, whose city has $15 million invested. "We are being held hostage by 
the bigger players. They are holding hands and willing to go down with the 
ship, but we aren't." 
</P>
<P>
 County financial officers fear that any withdrawal from the pool might ignite 
a run on the $18.5-billion investment fund. No investor can take any money back 
now, beyond normal withdrawals, without waiting 30 days and suffering a 20% 
loss because the portfolio's market value has fallen by that rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedges said Saturday he would like the city to pull its money out of the 
investment fund and is particularly upset that those in the pool will get only 
80% of their money if they get out now. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city doesn't want to lose one-fifth of its investment, he said, 
"If we could get all our money out, we would take it out now." 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District said he was so frustrated with 
his inability to get answers about the fund from Citron in October that he 
ordered $100 million withdrawn last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Peer Swan said his board has served written notice to the county that it will 
withdraw its remaining $300 million if it cannot be part of a proposed advisory 
board sought to oversee the county's future financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the amount of money he was dealing with and the precarious situation he 
was in, I wasn't satisfied he was dealing with this in a serious enough 
manner," Swan said of Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials were mum about Saturday's meeting, refusing to disclose any 
details for fear of public exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, an elected official who has been county treasurer for 24 years, said 
Saturday he was ordered by the county not to discuss the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But other news developments surfaced Saturday: 
</P>
<P>
 * County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said he would be willing to 
create a review committee of the pool's top 11 investors, who together have 
more than $2.5 billion in the fund. The top four investors are seeking to form 
a smaller group that would have oversight of the county's financial future. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county has hired an Irvine public relations firm, Gladstone 
International, to deal with the crush of media calls that have mounted since 
county officials disclosed last week that its $20-billion securities portfolio 
had taken a $1.5-billion hit in the past 11 months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Members of the county's assembled "management team" -- which includes 
Citron, Schneider, Assistant Treasurer Matthew Raabe, Auditor-Controller Steve 
E. Lewis, County Counsel Terry C. Andrus and Finance Director Eileen T. Walsh 
-- have been assigned specific roles to help the county through its financial 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron still is in control of the investments while Raabe has been designated 
the team spokesman. Raabe and Lewis are meeting next week with Capital Market 
Risk Advisors, the county's newly hired Wall Street financial consultant, and 
with the two major rating agencies, Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're trying to field media calls and return calls from 
participants in our investment pool," Raabe said. "Our plan right now is to 
meet next week with our financial consultants and rating agencies and review 
potential strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 The county team is very concerned about the perception over the massive "paper 
losses" in the county's portfolio and fears investors might want to withdraw 
from the fund, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is cash flow," Lewis said. "The key to this thing is for people not 
to panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe said Saturday that the county had $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion in cash 
reserves as of August, but now is holding about $350 million in liquid assets. 
Raabe said the reserves dwindled as the county made so-called "collateral 
calls" because the value of the securities used to borrow money declined as 
interest rates shot up. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Citron's investment strategy was the use of derivatives -- investment 
contracts whose values are based on the performance of an underlying security, 
interest rate or market index. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron invested heavily in "structured securities," highly volatile 
instruments whose value is pegged to interest rates and makes them susceptible 
to fluctuations in the market. As interest rates rose this year, their value 
decreased. Raabe said Citron stopped investing in structured securities this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Swan is pushing for a review committee of the pool's four top investors -- his 
own district, the Orange County Transportation Authority, the Orange County 
Sanitation Districts and the Transportation Corridor Agencies -- to help 
oversee the recommendations of the county's financial adviser. County officials 
favor a board composed of the 11 largest investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a high-stakes game," Swan said. "The people with the largest amount 
of money should have the largest amount of the say." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Hedges blasted Citron's risky investment strategy, contending that the 
pool's plummeting values were not disclosed to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "His office misrepresented to us the risk and volatility of the fund," he 
said. "It's like he never read the Wall Street Journal. The financial press was 
predicting that rates would rise." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach's city attorney is looking into the legality of the county 
withholding the funds, Hedges said, adding that county officials told him in 
May that the city could take out its funds at any time with no penalty. City 
Atty. Robert Burnham said Saturday he had not fully reviewed the issues related 
to the withdrawal. The City Council is expected to review the matter this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Costa Mesa, which had an estimated $14 million in the county pool 
in June, has drastically reduced its holdings in recent months as the 
portfolio's returns began dropping, said Mary Hornbuckle, a Costa Mesa 
councilwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Since early November, the city has reduced its county investments from $5 
million to about $2.6 million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us it had more to do with getting better rates than concern about the 
security of the pool," Hornbuckle said. "Our treasurer always tries to get the 
best rates, and we use those interest funds to pay for police, fire and city 
improvements." 
</P>
<P>
 Hornbuckle said the city, which is a voluntary participant in the pool, put 
some of its money in the state-run investment pool, Local Agency Investment 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have any problem getting it out in November, but we couldn't get it 
now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assistant county treasurer said Saturday that the hindsight of the past 
few days was expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone who really understands the market and this particular 
portfolio would have figured in February that interest rates would have risen 
at unprecedented levels," Raabe said. "I absolutely do not think we've done 
anything wrong."

FBI STUDY ADDS CREDENCE TO O.C. CRIME CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Only days after a poll showing that two-thirds of Orange County residents 
still ranked crime as their No. 1 worry, newly released federal crime 
statistics show they have reason to be concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 While the rate of property crimes like burglary and auto theft declined 4.6% 
in Orange County from 1992 to 1993, violent crimes -- murder, rape, robbery and 
assault -- dropped a mere 1.1%. And murders during that time period jumped 13%, 
equal to 7.8 killings per 100,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 But other statistics measuring crime in the first six months of 1994 show that 
the number of Orange County murders has continued to rise, jumping another 9.5% 
in the county's eight largest cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime overall increased nearly 4% in Orange County during the same 
six-month period, while the rest of the country saw a 4% decrease in murders, 
rapes, robberies and assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing violent crime rate locally mirrors the mounting anxiety among 
Orange County residents who responded to the 1994 Orange County Annual Survey 
released last week. UC Irvine Prof. Mark Baldassare conducted the poll Aug. 
19-29 for the university's School of Social Ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those polled, 44% said they were afraid of becoming crime victims and 66% 
said they favored tougher gun control legislation. Crime was rated as local 
residents' greatest concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen violent, violent crime come to places where it usually doesn't 
happen: hate crimes at the beach, a boy killed with a paint roller, drive-by 
shootings in Irvine, drive-by shootings in Mission Viejo," said Garden Grove 
Police Chief Stanley L. Knee. "Crime, reported by the media, has spread to 
parts of the county that thought it was safe. . . . It has an unsettling 
effect." 
</P>
<P>
 According to new FBI statistics, the county's three safest cities are Laguna 
Niguel, Yorba Linda and Laguna Hills. None of the cities had a murder in 1993 
and together the cities had 16 rapes -- one less than the city of La Habra by 
itself. The number of assaults in Laguna Hills dropped 50% from 130 to 65. 
</P>
<P>
 The three cities with the highest crime rates are Costa Mesa, Stanton and 
Laguna Beach. Laguna Beach had nearly five times as many assaults as the more 
residential Laguna Hills, which has more than double its population. 
</P>
<P>
 The serious crime rate for Anaheim could not be calculated, because of a 
change in way that the city's police reported aggravated assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 There was good news for the nation in the FBI's latest statistical tally of 
homicides, rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries and thefts. 
Nationwide, overall crime dropped 3% in the first six months of 1994, which 
comes on top of a 2% decline in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the number of nonviolent property crimes continued to drop 
in 1993, with burglaries down nearly 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cities showed declines in crime nearly double or triple the county 
average. Among the top crime-busters: Orange, where overall crime dropped 
12.9%, and Fullerton, where crime dipped 8.7%. But while the violent crimes 
increased in Orange, Fullerton saw its number of violent crimes drop 7.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just seeing the fruits of what we've been doing for a couple of years," 
Fullerton Capt. Ken Head said. "Our gang detail is maturing and it's starting 
to pay off." 
</P>
<P>
 Head said it took two of the department's crime-fighting programs -- its gang 
detail and Operation Cleanup, which targets three of the city's crime hot spots 
-- several years to establish themselves in the community and begin showing 
significant results. 
</P>
<P>
 But Head said some crime statistics in Fullerton have remained relatively 
static, simply because the crooks couldn't plunder more than they already were. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been hit hard with auto thefts, but I don't know if they could steal 
any more cars in the city," Head said. "There's only so many criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, a city of nearly the same population as Fullerton, had 3,336 fewer 
crimes, but a smaller drop in crime. Cited as one of the safest cities in the 
nation last year, Irvine again had a low crime rate, with crime declining 8.2%. 
Most of the drop was fueled by a 19% dive in the number of burglaries from 
1,226 in 1992 to 990 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But law enforcement officials countywide cautioned that the statistics don't 
always paint a clear picture of a city's crime troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could have a rash of 20 residential burglaries in one neighborhood in a 
month's time and that can throw off your whole year's statistics," said Orange 
County Sheriff's Lt. Kim Markuson, chief of police services for Mission Viejo. 
"That's where these statistics are deceiving." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo, which contracts with the Sheriff's Department for police 
services, showed an astonishing 21.4% rise in crime from 1992 to 1993, all of 
it in property thefts. Auto thefts alone jumped 30.2%. Meanwhile, the number of 
violent crimes has remained nearly the same -- and less than local cities of 
comparable size. There were 13 rapes, 32 robberies and 142 assaults in the city 
in 1993, compared to 25 rapes, 42 robberies and 205 assaults in Newport Beach, 
which has 8,000 fewer residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're fortunate in Mission Viejo that we don't have a lot of violent crime," 
Markuson said. "Our problems are of the property crime type, but I don't see 
them to be overwhelming. It seems cyclical. Sometimes they're up, sometimes 
they're down." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach also saw a big jump in crime, up 7.1% over 1992, with 10.5% 
more assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very concerned about rapes and assaults going up," said Mayor Linda 
Moulton Patterson, who leaves office Monday. "There are more handguns out there 
and frankly we don't have enough police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said Huntington Beach has one of the lowest ratios of police 
officers to residents, about 1.2 per thousand residents. She compared the ratio 
in Huntington Beach to that of Newport Beach, another coastal city with lots of 
tourist traffic, but one that has nearly double the ratio of police to 
residents. But she said the city is doing battle with the statistics, recently 
approving the hiring of eight more police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Huntington Beach is still a very safe city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Chief Knee saw violent crime in his city decrease 6.0% from 1992 
to 1993, but he said reports of violent crime will most likely increase next 
year -- and he's happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Knee said beefed-up community policing efforts have encouraged people to 
report violent crimes at a greater rate than in the past. This year his 
department already has seen a 25% increase in the reporting of assaults such as 
domestic violence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the purposes of crime statistics, it's a Catch-22, Knee said. His 
officers encourage reporting, so there are more violent crimes reported in 
Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 * CITY-BY-CITY ANALYSIS: Crime in O.C. from 1992 to '93 falls by 5,524 
incidents. B3 Crime Statistics Show Mixed Results 
</P>
<P>
 While Orange County property crimes declined almost 5% in 1993, and violent 
crimes were down about 1%, murder increased 13%. The overall decline from 1992 
to 1993 is the second consecutive year in which crime fell in the county, and 
the fourth consecutive year in which the rate per 100,000 residents has 
dropped. Crimes in the FBI index include murder, non-negligent manslaughter, 
rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, grand theft (larceny) and motor 
vehicle theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime in Decline 
</P>
<P>
 After peaking in 1991, the number of serious crimes reported to Orange County 
police has continued to fall. Over the past five years, the rate of serious or 
felony crimes has steadily fallen: 
</P>
<P>
 Total Crimes 1993: 135,212 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crime rate per 100,000 residents 1993: 5,386.5 
</P>
<P>
 Rate Comparison 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel had the lowest crime rate per 100,000 residents during 1993. 
Examining cities by rate rather than absolute number of crimes removes size as 
a factor in analysis, allowing comparison on an even basis. Here is how the 
cities compare, from the lowest rate to the highest 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Anaheim's rate is not available

DESPITE GAINS, LATINO VOTERS STILL LACK CLOUT; ELECTION: MYRIAD REASONS ACCOUNT 
FOR POOR TURNOUT. 'THIS IS MORE THAN A WAKE-UP CALL,' ONE POLITICIAN SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thomas Garcia of East Los Angeles saw no point in voting on Election Day, even 
though he bitterly opposed Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this country more than 40 years, and I've never seen Mexicans 
win a battle," said Garcia, 53, who was born in Mexico but became a U.S. 
citizen as a teen-ager. "You don't get what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Aida Cruz, 42, of Downey said that despite concerns that the initiative -- 
which denies most health, education and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants 
-- would hurt children, she could not find time to register to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's sad," she said. "Including myself, we're not doing enough." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hector Garcia, 35, who grew up in Los Angeles and now lives in Chino, made 
sure he cast a ballot regardless of his criticisms of the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's that point that the one vote makes a difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite strong feelings in the Latino community over Proposition 187, and the 
community's rapidly growing numbers, Latinos accounted for only about 8% of the 
state's voters in the Nov. 8 election, the Los Angeles Times exit poll shows. 
Latinos make up 27% of the state population but account for 14% of eligible 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody just ought to say that Latinos didn't vote," said state Sen. Art 
Torres (D-Los Angeles), who gave up his seat in a losing bid to become state 
insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sleeping giant was in a coma on Nov. 8," Torres said. "Maybe we need to 
institute a code blue to get it moving. Because this is more than just a 
wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
 There are myriad reasons for low voting levels. Latino leaders have long cited 
statistics that nearly two-thirds of California Latinos are non-citizens or not 
old enough to vote. "That's a grim reality of Latino politics in this state," 
said Harry Pachon, president of the Tomas Rivera Center, a Latino research 
institution affiliated with the Claremont Colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty and lower levels of education also have an adverse impact -- as they 
do on voting levels in general. Another longstanding barrier to increased 
Latino political clout has been the reluctance of Mexican immigrants to become 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos do not stand alone in their struggle for electoral power. Political 
empowerment of ethnic and racial minorities in this country has taken 
generations in many cases. And Latinos lack some of the systems that aided 
other groups: the grass-roots activism of African American churches or the 
benefit of old-style political machines that greeted European immigrants at the 
docks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Proposition 187 -- attacked by its opponents as anti-Latino -- was 
expected to rouse Latinos like no issue since the Chicano power movement of the 
late 1960s, drawing big numbers not just into the streets but to the polls. 
Yet, the Latino share of the vote did not increase from the two prior 
elections, according to the exit poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone went out and tried to mobilize the Latino electorate 
except very late in the campaign, and maybe even past the deadline dates for 
registering people to vote," said Luis R. Fraga, director of Stanford 
University's Center for Chicano Research. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, where Latinos make up about 37% of the population, they 
accounted for only about 9% of the voters, according to the exit poll. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Latino share of the vote has remained static since at least 1990, 
Latinos have gained important positions in business and politics. That is 
partly due to coalition-building, court rulings that produced affirmative 
action, and the federal Voting Rights Act, which requires Latino-majority 
districts to be drawn based on all residents, not just citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been so much talk about the electoral breakthrough of Latinos," 
said Steven Erie, a UC San Diego political scientist who has written 
extensively about ethnic politics. "Where they have been less successful is 
grass-roots, bottom-up empowerment, such as citizenship, registration and 
voting." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Latino activists say that Latinos did, in fact, turn out in higher 
numbers in this election. But, they assert, so did non-Latinos -- especially 
non-Latino whites -- canceling out any gain in Latino voting clout. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the potential impact of a unified voter turnout was apparent. 
Latinos played a pivotal role in the close U.S. Senate race won by Dianne 
Feinstein. According to The Times' exit poll, Latinos voted 67% to 22% for 
Democrat Feinstein over Republican Michael Huffington, who, like Gov. Pete 
Wilson, embraced Proposition 187. Latinos were the only ethnic group to 
increase their support of Feinstein from her last bid in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latinos were out voting," said state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles). 
"But non-Latino voters also came out to vote in higher numbers than usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter Research Institute, said 
his organization is still assessing turnout. But he believes based on a 
sampling of 40 Latino precincts throughout the state that 45% to 52% of 
registered Latino voters cast ballots -- "a dramatic improvement" from the 39% 
turnout in 1990. He also contends that Latinos accounted for 10.2% to 11.4% of 
the total vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to 1990, there are 300,000 more Latino registered voters," said 
Gonzalez, who is also president of the Southwest Voter Registration Education 
Project, which spent $100,000 this year on registration and get-out-the-vote 
efforts in nine California counties. "We reached 1,750,000 this year. We were 
1,450,000 in 1990." 
</P>
<P>
 And some were encouraged by the turnout and stepped-up efforts to encourage 
Latino residents to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might not look like that much but it's more," said Father Pedro 
Villarroya, director of the Office of Hispanic Ministry for the Archdiocese of 
Los Angeles. "We wish we had the resources to concentrate on more people." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen whether a disillusioned Latino community buys the notion 
that things are getting better, given the Election Day results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear to me that there's a lot of work to be done in the Latino 
community," said Cruz Reynoso, a former state Supreme Court justice who now 
teaches law at UCLA. The explanations that actual participation has increased 
do not "answer the question of why there was not a disproportionately higher 
number of Latinos voting because this was obviously a stronger issue for 
Latinos than it was for many others." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing the proportion of the vote is key to political empowerment, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way Latinos increase their clout is for their share of the electorate to 
rise," said John Brennan, director of the Times Poll. "When that happens, 
people like Pete Wilson are going to get nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 The exit poll showed considerable support for Proposition 187 among most 
voting groups -- with Latinos being an exception, opposing it 77% to 23%. Its 
strongest backers were whites, about two-thirds of whom said they voted for the 
measure. Latino activists and political scholars agree that even if more 
Latinos went to the polls, it would not have overcome that level of support for 
the proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 But the larger issues remain. And some working-class Latinos blamed leaders of 
the community, saying the push against Proposition 187 was misguided and 
confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Rodriguez, 44, a security guard at Paragraff Clothing Co. in 
South-Central Los Angeles, said some of his elderly Latino neighbors voted in 
favor of Proposition 187 because they feared their Social Security benefits 
would be used to cover services for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'We've worked all our lives. How are we going to survive if they take away 
our Social Security?' " Rodriguez, a legal resident from Mexico who lives near 
the clothing store, recalled his neighbors saying in Spanish. "That was their 
fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said the issue was too controversial for some of his other 
acquaintances, who decided not to take one side or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought it was better to stay in the middle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivonne Crescioni, 36, of Whittier said she voted, but that many of her friends 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't believe in the system. They can't relate to the candidates, even 
the Latino candidates," Crescioni said. "Many of these Latinos were also buying 
into the white argument about illegal immigrants taking all the jobs and 
services. It's really sad that they believed that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Garcia, who manages an auto parts store on South Vermont Avenue, said 
about 80% of his customers are Latino but it did not seem as though many of 
them were wrapped up in any "movement" involving Proposition 187 leading up to 
Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was talking about it," he said. "The message never got home the way it 
should have. I just don't think the community got behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said there are plenty of polling places in Latino neighborhoods, but 
too few residents are convinced by politicians that there is good reason to 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The politicians are "not true leaders. They're not out in the communities," he 
said. "I think people don't think that their one vote would make a difference. 
We talk about voting for four months but for (the time in between elections) 
nobody talks about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But County Supervisor Gloria Molina said leaders consciously chose not to 
target the Latino community exclusively. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campaign was being directed at the California voter . . . to the Reseda 
housewife, to the Fullerton elderly couple," she said. "There was no doubt that 
the end result and the implications and probably some of the hatred was 
directed at the Latino community. But the Latino community in and of itself 
never could have changed the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, political analysts say the anti-Proposition 187 campaign simply may 
have caught fire too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opposition began to reach critical mass after the close of registration," 
said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, senior associate at the Center for Politics and 
Economics at the Claremont Graduate School. "Many Latinos became motivated but 
too late to have that motivation translated into voting in this election." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles) said the anti-Proposition 187 campaign was 
crippled by Wilson's TV ads that hammered the pro-Proposition 187 message home 
over and over. "We didn't have the money at the end to combat the governor and 
his commercials. Who would have known that the governor would have so attached 
himself to 187 on television? That really hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Latino activists offered mixed opinions on the get-out-the-vote effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Party officials and Latino leaders said that an intense effort was 
conducted, including calling voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberto Lovato, executive director of the Central American Resource 
Center, said that commitments made by the Democratic Party to get out the 
Latino vote never materialized, at least not in his neighborhood. "In 
Pico-Union there was nothing," Lovato said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that among Latino leaders, efforts to get out the vote ranged from 
"those who did a lot . . . to those that did nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 "They know who they are," he said, declining to give names. "And their 
consciences know what the results are. They have to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when Latinos reached the polls, they did not automatically vote against 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Alvarez, 28, of Alhambra voted for the initiative despite the objections 
of his close friend, Arturo Escandon, 25, of El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez, who was born in Los Angeles after his parents moved to the United 
States from Peru, said too many illegal immigrants take advantage of public 
services. Escandon, born in Mexico, is a legal resident without voting rights 
who hopes to become a citizen in time for the next presidential election. 
"Everything is done with false identifications," Alvarez said. "I pay taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Escandon, a political science major at UCLA, said the initiative and proposals 
like the one that would institute a national identification card would 
inevitably result in the harassment of Latinos and other people of color. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should (a Latino child) go through it if a little white kid doesn't," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The major barrier to boosting the Latino share of the total vote comes long 
before Election Day or voter registration deadlines: Latino scholar Pachon 
estimates that there are at least 2 million Latinos in California who are legal 
immigrants eligible for citizenship but have not applied. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Cain, associate director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC 
Berkeley, said the citizenship rate among Mexican immigrants is comparable to 
that for Canadian immigrants. But, he said, "Nobody is indignant about the 
Canadians who are taking up our seats at Kings games and are equally reluctant 
about becoming Americans. That's where the racist component enters in." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, officials have explained that Mexican citizens are wary of 
renouncing their homeland, often clinging to an illusion: a dream of going 
back, even after their lives take root and children are born in the United 
States. But others see low sign-up rates as a product of a confusing, costly 
and often intimidating citizenship application process. 
</P>
<P>
 The reluctance among many to apply for citizenship also stems in part from 
apprehensions based on both fact and fiction. Some fear a loss of land 
ownership and other rights back home if they acquire U.S. passports -- and, 
indeed, Mexico, South Korea and other nations limit the ownership rights of 
non-citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, many Latinos remain undecided about citizenship despite difficult 
lives that they expect only to worsen under Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Duilio Franco, 39, of Norwalk, said he fled the war in Nicaragua several years 
ago with his family thinking life in the United States would be much better. 
But life, even as a legal resident, has been a struggle because jobs are 
difficult to find, Franco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco, whose three teen-agers attend local schools, said he believes the 
biggest reason for the approval of Proposition 187 was racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country is made of immigrants. The only ones who are pure are the Native 
Americans," he said in Spanish. "The only thing you can do is go back to your 
country and die rather than die here like a dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Latino activists say they believe Proposition 187 will spur 
greater Latino political participation, including boosting citizenship efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think 187 has demonstrated to Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Central Americans, 
Mexicans and other Latinos that we've got to vote because they're willing to go 
this far with our community and try to get away with it," Lovato said. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff is a distant one for many. Immigrants must live in the country five 
years before applying for citizenship and the application process takes about a 
year, sometimes longer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not always that way. Early on, political machines integrated immigrants 
into the political system at a pace unimaginable in contemporary terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the Irish came in, the ward boss was on their doorstep, 'Welcome to 
America, we're gonna get you a job, here's some food, you need some coal, call 
me,' " Jeffe said. "There was an immediate identification, not so much with 
government but with politics. . . . That's why the first wave of immigrants 
became active quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 However, it took time for other immigrants -- such as the Italians and Jews -- 
to gain political power. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time the Jews and Italians came around, the Irish machines had pretty 
much controlled power in the Northeast" (from the 1840s to 1870s), said 
historian Erie. "The other groups had to fight their way in. This is the 
politics of ethnic succession. Frequently a group has to rely on a self-help 
strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts believe that Latinos will become a larger share of the electorate -- 
in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino activists are aggressively promoting citizenship, and immigration 
authorities report receiving 1,000 applications a month in Los Angeles, double 
the usual number. "As the population goes above the age of 18, you're going to 
see in the next five to 10 years a real increase in the number of Latino 
voters," Erie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Justice Reynoso said he would like to see the voter registration period 
-- which now closes 30 days before the election -- extended right up to 
Election Day. He also favors the motor-voter registration law, which requires 
the state by Jan. 1 to begin providing voter registration material to driver's 
license applicants. But Wilson has ordered his Administration not to implement 
the law unless Congress forwards the money to pay for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wake-up call was loud and clear," Pachon said. "The giant isn't so much 
sleeping. It's a teen-ager that's growing into adulthood. . . . People expect a 
magic transformation of a powerless community into a full-fledged powerful 
community, and it doesn't happen that way." Latino Voting 
</P>
<P>
 Latinos, who make up about 27% of the state's population, accounted for about 
8% of the voters in the Nov. 8 election, despite strong feelings in the 
community over Proposition 187, the Los Angeles Times exit poll found. Here is 
how Latinos compare to other ethnic groups in California. 05,32,07,07,08,07

NEWS ANALYSIS; SOUTH RISES AGAIN AS REGION TAKES OVER GOP LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leadership lineup for the new Republican Congress dramatically underscores 
the shift in the party's geographic and philosophic center of gravity toward 
the South. 
</P>
<P>
 The election Friday of Mississippi Sen. Trent Lott to the No. 2 leadership 
position in the Senate cements the influence of an emerging Southern axis that 
includes incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, incoming House 
Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, and Texas Sen. Phil Gramm. 
</P>
<P>
 These new GOP leaders will elevate to the national level the ideologically 
conservative and politically confrontational style that has taken the GOP to 
majority status in the South. That's likely to produce some conflict with 
Republican leaders from other regions -- like incoming Senate Majority Leader 
Bob Dole or incoming Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Mark O. Hatfield 
of Oregon -- who are more moderate in their approach, either ideologically or 
tactically. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rise of the Southern Republicans primarily guarantees a much more 
brass-knuckled approach toward the partisan struggle with the Democrats -- a 
difference symbolized by the transition between the impetuous Gingrich and 
courtly outgoing House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to have a difference in style," said Whit Ayres, an 
Atlanta-based Republican pollster. "With the Southern Republicans you get a 
more aggressive, assertive conservatism. This is a conservatism that has been 
built on confronting Democrats and liberals, not accommodating them." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as the Southern Republicans move into leadership roles, many say the 
biggest question is whether the polarizing tactics they used to secure a 
beachhead in unfriendly local territory will prove too divisive for the 
national stage. Throughout Clinton's term, it has been Southern Republicans 
like Gingrich and Armey who have delivered the most pointed barbs at the 
President -- sometimes in language that left them nursing wounds as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge for Republicans will be turning that aggressiveness into a 
positive governing force," Ayres said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new Congress, the South will enjoy strength comparable to its influence 
in the heyday of Southern Democratic leaders such as Sam Rayburn, Lyndon B. 
Johnson and Richard B. Russell. Though Midwesterner Dole will serve as majority 
leader, Southerners hold each of the next three ranking positions. On Friday, 
Lott narrowly defeated Sen. Alan K. Simpson (R-Wyo.), who was backed by Dole, 
for the position of Republican whip; Sens. Thad Cochran of Mississippi and Don 
Nickles of Oklahoma were reelected to head the Senate Republican Conference and 
Policy Committee respectively. Southerners Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and 
Jesse Helms of North Carolina will chair the powerful Armed Services and 
Foreign Relations committees. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, the tilt to the South is even more pronounced. With Gingrich and 
Armey already guaranteed the top two positions, two aggressively conservative 
Southerners -- Reps. Tom DeLay of Texas and Bill McCollum of Florida -- are 
vying with Pennsylvania Rep. Robert S. Walker for the No. 3 post of House whip; 
House Republicans will pick their choice in a vote Monday morning. Gingrich has 
tapped two other Southerners for critical posts: Louisiana's Bob Livingston as 
chair of the Appropriations Committee and Bill Archer of Texas as chairman of 
the Ways and Means panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The ascendance of the Southern Republicans within the GOP leadership structure 
appears even more stark when set against the growing frustration of Southern 
Democrats. Calling for Democrats to chart a more centrist course, Reps. Charlie 
Rose of North Carolina and Charles W. Stenholm of Texas bid for the party's top 
two House leadership positions last week. But they were crushed by the 
candidates favored by House liberals, Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who 
was chosen as minority leader, and David E. Bonior of Michigan, who was elected 
minority whip. 
</P>
<P>
 These contrasting fortunes symbolize the historic shift of the South from the 
foundation of Democratic political strength in the century after the Civil War 
to the core of the modern Republican coalition in the years since the civil 
rights revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the change since the last time the Republicans controlled both houses 
of Congress: the 1953-54 session. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, in the House of Representatives, just four of the 221 GOP 
members came from the Deep South; another five came from the border states of 
Oklahoma, Kentucky and Tennessee. (By contrast, the seven largest Northeastern 
and Midwestern states sent 110 Republican representatives to that Congress.) In 
the Senate, just one of the 48 Republican senators came from the South -- John 
Sherman Cooper of Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 1960s the white backlash against the passage of the Civil Rights 
Act and the Voting Rights Act ended the Democratic dominance of the South. The 
first cracks came in presidential elections with Barry Goldwater and Richard 
Nixon. During the past 30 years, the GOP has slowly but steadily translated 
that realignment down the ballot, finally achieving a massive breakthrough in 
November, when white Southern antipathy toward President Clinton propelled the 
GOP to gains of 19 House and three Senate seats across the 11 states of the 
Confederacy plus Oklahoma and Kentucky. Fully two-thirds of Southern whites 
voted Republican in the midterm election, exit polls found. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with 73 representatives, Southern Republicans outnumber Southern 
Democrats in the House and constitute the largest geographic block of 
Republicans. In the Senate, the post-election switch to the GOP of formerly 
Democratic Sen. Richard C. Shelby of Alabama raised the number of Southern 
Republicans to 16 -- nearly one-third of the GOP total. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the South is likely to become further entrenched as the GOP's 
political and congressional anchor. Several Southern Democratic representatives 
only narrowly escaped this fall, and many observers believe that the Republican 
march across the region may gain more ground in 1996. "We are on the verge of 
even greater gains," Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Southern Republican Party developed largely in opposition to the 
civil rights movement, Gingrich, Gramm and the rest of the 50-something and 
younger generation of Republicans now moving into leadership positions almost 
entirely avoid the overtly race-conscious politics of the older GOP generation 
symbolized by Helms. 
</P>
<P>
 To the extent the new Southern Republicans reflect racial divisions, it is in 
the manner of conservatives from other regions: partly in their hard-line 
positioning on racially tinged "wedge" issues such as crime and welfare, but 
even more importantly in their hostility toward taxes and government spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "They represent the current generation of winners in American life," said 
Emory University political scientist Merle Black. 
</P>
<P>
 From that perspective, the Southern Republicans by and large bring to policy 
debates an intuitive hostility toward virtually all forms of government 
activity, except defense spending and some middle-class entitlements. 
</P>
<P>
 The aggressive anti-government agenda of Gramm, Gingrich and Armey may provoke 
clashes with throwback GOP moderates from other regions who are more cautious 
about slashing spending and dismantling the social safety net, including 
Hatfield; his Oregon colleague Bob Packwood, who will chair the Senate Finance 
Committee; Kansas Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum, and perhaps Dole himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But these regional differences are less pronounced among younger Republicans, 
who both in approach and ideology model themselves more on Gingrich and Gramm 
than Dole, noted one House GOP leadership aide. Indeed, the emerging generation 
of Republican leaders from the South are shaped as much by suburban values as 
by Southern ones. That fact makes them less distinctively Southern in style 
than such Democratic predecessors as Lyndon Johnson, but keeps them in tune 
with young Republicans moving into Congress from overwhelmingly white suburban 
districts in Ohio, Michigan and California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a different flavor from the leadership of a Democratic South because 
they represented the rural South," McCollum said. "I represent the conservative 
views of Middle America."

ELIZABETH GLASER, ACTIVIST FOR AIDS TREATMENT, DIES AT 47; ADVOCATE: SPEECH 
TELLING OF DISEASE HUSHED DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. SHE CO-FOUNDED PEDIATRIC AIDS 
FOUNDATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Elizabeth Glaser, whose agonizing story of how she and her two children became 
infected with the AIDS virus brought a tearful silence to the floor of the 1992 
Democratic presidential convention, died Saturday. She was 47. 
</P>
<P>
 She died at her Santa Monica home of the complications of AIDS, said Carol 
Pearlman, an associate at the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, which Mrs. Glaser 
helped found. 
</P>
<P>
 Since she disclosed her tragedy to The Times five years ago, the wife of 
actor-director Paul Michael Glaser (of "Starsky and Hutch" fame) and 
upper-middle-class suburban mother had become an unlikely but highly visible 
lobbyist in the international battle against the disease that eventually 
claimed her. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Glaser told The Times that her family's nightmare had begun in 1981, when 
she was nine months pregnant with Ariel, her first child. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been hemorrhaging and was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los 
Angeles, where she received seven pints of blood. The baby was delivered 
successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later, Mrs. Glaser read a newspaper article telling of the dangers of 
acquiring AIDS through blood transfusions. She consulted her doctor, who told 
her the chances of contracting the disease through a transfusion were highly 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time scientific awareness of AIDS was in its infancy and her physician 
apparently believed that the risk was minimal. She was not tested. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1985 Ariel became seriously ill. Tests showed her red blood count low, 
but even then doctors assured the family that she would recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Ariel did not respond to treatment and the girl and her family were finally 
tested for the human immunodeficiency virus. Mrs. Glaser tested positive, and 
it was determined that she had passed the virus to Ariel through her milk. She 
also had transmitted the virus to her second child, Jake. Her husband was the 
only family member who remained uninfected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been dealt the worst hand of cards any family could have gotten," Mrs. 
Glaser told The Times in the interview she agreed to only because the family 
had become aware that their story was to be published in the tabloid press. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about throwing up my hands and giving up. But we decided to play 
that hand offensively." 
</P>
<P>
 After her daughter's death, Mrs. Glaser -- knowing that her privacy was at 
risk -- went to Washington and cornered legislators seeking help to fight the 
AIDS battle and raise the public's consciousness about who was at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 She had set up meetings with then-President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy 
Reagan, Barbara Bush, Kitty Dukakis and Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. 
</P>
<P>
 She concluded that Washington was not doing enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Glaser turned to newfound friends in Congress, and because of the efforts 
by her and others, the budget for fighting pediatric AIDS was raised from $3.3 
million to $8.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 She also co-founded the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with Susan DeLaurentis and 
Susan Zeegen and helped raise millions of dollars for care and treatment of 
young AIDS patients. In eight months she acquired $2.2 million to finance 40 
research grants. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 she and her husband were featured on "60 Minutes" and she was featured 
in a cover story in People magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1992, after countless personal appearances and pleas for assistance, 
she was asked to share the Democratic platform in New York with a gay man who 
also was a Bill Clinton aide -- Bob Hattoy. He too had the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 They followed Jimmy Carter and Jesse Jackson to the podium and after the 
soaring political rhetoric of those two national leaders, an uneasy quiet began 
to settle over the delegates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly four years ago," Mrs. Glaser told them, "my daughter died. She did 
not survive the Reagan Administration. I am here because my son and I may not 
survive another four years of leaders who say they care -- but do nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The silence -- captured on national television -- continued as both of them 
spoke. Normally boisterous politicos wiped their eyes and fought off sobs so 
they might hear each word. 
</P>
<P>
 "She taught me to love," Mrs. Glaser said of her little girl, "when all I 
wanted to do was hate; she taught me to help others when all I wanted to do was 
help myself." 
</P>
<P>
 After the devastating stories had spilled over the cavernous hall, the 
Democrats -- who prided themselves on supporting gay rights and increased 
funding for the AIDS struggle -- broke into a sustained ovation that bystanders 
said was usually reserved for presidential acceptance speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Glaser, born Elizabeth Meyer in New York City, held a degree in 
psychology from the University of Wisconsin and a master's degree in early 
childhood education from Boston University. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been a Head Start teacher in Denver and taught at the Center for Early 
Education in Los Angeles before being named director of programs and exhibits 
at the Children's Museum in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She met the man who was to become her second husband in 1980 when he was one 
of the best-known TV actors in the country. They married the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both remained dedicated to each other throughout their years-long travail. In 
1989, he said: "We have grown up a helluva lot. It was either grow up or 
perish." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lesser men would have walked," she said very simply of him. "He didn't (even) 
flinch." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, in one of her final public appearances, Mrs. Glaser returned to 
New York for a Pediatric AIDS Foundation benefit. The weak and emaciated woman 
received a presidential citation from First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, President Clinton spoke with the Glaser family and issued a 
statement from the White House in which he called her "an inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 "Elizabeth confronted the challenge of AIDS . . . at a time when our 
government and our country were too indifferent to this illness and the people 
who had it. . . . We need more like her. We must honor her memory by finishing 
the work to which she gave everything she had." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Mrs. Glaser made her tragic drama public, she also made a 
decision to break the news to her preschool-age son and to her 91-year-old 
grandmother before the balance of the family learned about it from other 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, she and her husband stood before 200 parents at their son's 
preschool to tell them that a boy their children played with each day had 
tested HIV-positive (although Jake, now 10, shows no evidence of AIDS.) 
</P>
<P>
 The stunned silence that followed was at first interpreted by the Glasers as 
another in a sequence of rejections. But then, in what the grieving parents 
remembered as one of the most satisfying moments in their often frustrating 
fight, one of the other parents raised his hand and asked: 
</P>
<P>
 "When can your son come and play?" 
</P>
<P>
 Services will be private with a memorial service pending.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG LAW FAILS AS ANTIDOTE TO BLACK MARKET; FRAUD: LUCRATIVE 
RESALE SCHEMES THRIVE AS THE MAJOR PLAYERS ESCAPE PROSECUTION. CONSUMERS FOOT 
THE BILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Rubin was directing a highly lucrative, illegal enterprise out of his 
Las Vegas office in 1988 when then-President Ronald Reagan signed a new law 
intended to bring a halt to Rubin's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rubin did not panic. "I am assuring you that this doesn't affect 
anything," he told an associate, referring to the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, even though Rubin has served a brief prison term on mail and 
wire fraud charges, it is clear that his assessment was essentially correct. 
Law enforcement officials say he remains a driving force behind what they 
characterize as a thriving, nationwide "black market" in prescription drugs 
whose total annual revenue sometimes has been estimated at $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 By his own admission, Rubin has made a career of acting as the middleman in an 
operation in which small wholesalers fraudulently purchase pharmaceuticals from 
manufacturers at big discounts intended only for hospitals and nursing homes, 
and then resell them at huge profits to other wholesalers who supply retail 
drugstores. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there are many variations on the scheme, it often works like this: In 
the late 1980s, according to court documents, Rubin persuaded several small 
nursing home pharmacies in the Kansas City area to order large quantities of 
drugs on his behalf on a regular basis at cut-rate prices that were legally 
unavailable to him or any other wholesaler. To obtain the lower prices, the 
pharmacies had to pledge they would not resell the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The pharmacies then reneged on the pledge and sold the drugs to Rubin at a 25% 
markup. Rubin, who had now obtained the drugs illegally, passed them along to a 
major drug wholesaler at an additional 30% to 40% markup. 
</P>
<P>
 According to state and federal investigators, Rubin's brand of business 
activity is flourishing despite the enactment of the 1988 Prescription Drug 
Marketing Act written by Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), which was hailed at 
the time as the antidote to black market prescription drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, none of the major players known to be reaping big profits in the 
prescription drug black market has ever been prosecuted under the new law. In 
fact, the Food and Drug Administration has yet to complete final regulations to 
implement it. This week in Mississippi, federal prosecutors will go into court 
to try their first case under the law against a defendant accused of black 
market activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Every user of prescription drugs has a stake in the government's failure to 
control black market activity. It is the consumer -- not the pharmaceutical 
industry -- that ultimately pays the price. The illegal profits of the black 
market are built into the price of filling every single prescription. 
</P>
<P>
 "The losers are grandpa and grandma who are going to the corner drugstore to 
get their prescriptions filled," said Keith McDonald, chief investigator for 
the Nevada Pharmacy Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, experts say the safety of prescription drugs is being compromised 
when pharmaceutical products -- both regular medications and controlled 
substances -- pass through the hands of black marketeers who disguise the 
origin of the drugs in an effort to escape the scrutiny of state and federal 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no guarantee that wholesalers operating outside the law have properly 
stored sensitive drugs and no way of tracking these black market drugs in the 
event of a manufacturer's recall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It brings into question the viability of the whole health care record-keeping 
system," said Jim Dahl, the FDA's special agent in charge of investigations. 
"When you have wholesalers buying product without regard to pedigree, it also 
gives rise to counterfeiting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's health care reform plan, sent to Congress earlier 
this year, contained a provision that would have eliminated the prescription 
drug black market by altering the pricing of wholesale pharmaceuticals. But the 
proposal died with the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are many law-abiding wholesalers operating in the drug 
industry. Yet even some legitimate, full-line drug wholesalers are said to be 
guilty of complicity in the black market by purchasing prescription drugs from 
known black marketeers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two California firms, McKesson Corp. in San Francisco and Bergen Brunswig 
Corp. of Orange, the nation's largest drug wholesalers, have been named by the 
government as participants -- but never charged -- in several criminal cases 
involving black marketeering of prescription drugs over the past decade. 
Executives of both firms deny any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, some major pharmaceutical manufacturers, who are being defrauded by 
the black market practitioners, do little to discourage the activity because 
the illegal sales add to their bottom lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In their zeal to increase market share, some drug company salesmen have been 
known to overlook signs of black market activity -- such as a buyer claiming to 
supply drugs to nursing homes who orders large quantities of acne cream, 
menopause medicine or other drugs not intended for use by the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharmaceutical industry analysts contend that drug companies inadvertently 
invited criminals into their business by creating a multitiered pricing policy 
frequently assailed by critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The pricing system works this way: While pharmaceutical companies offer deep 
discounts on drugs purchased by hospitals, nursing homes and other 
institutions, they give no price breaks to wholesalers who supply retail 
pharmacies. The theory behind institutional discounts is that they encourage 
product loyalty among physicians and patients. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the regular wholesale price can be many times the price paid by 
institutions. For example, Ciba-Geigy Corp. sells transderm-nitro patches for 
heart attack patients for $8.40 to institutional pharmacies, like those 
operating in nursing homes, and $39.89 to the retail druggist -- a difference 
of 375%. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the price disparity is so wide, the system offers big profits to 
middlemen who have devised schemes that enable them to buy the drugs at low 
prices and divert them into the regular retail market. 
</P>
<P>
 In industry parlance, this activity is known as "drug diversion" and the 
people who do it are called "diverters." 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity for attractive profits is obvious to anyone with the barest 
grasp of the pharmaceutical industry and the basic rules of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn about this in Economics 101," said Los Angeles lawyer David Katz, 
who represents longtime drug diverter Wilbur Swift. "If you decided to sell 
milk to girls at 60% of the price charged to boys, what would happen? You'd 
have girls standing in line buying boys milk." 
</P>
<P>
 Most drug diverters began as legitimate wholesalers, retailers or pharmacists 
and gradually moved into the black market trade in order to boost profits or 
save themselves from failing in a business where the profit margins are very 
narrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, however, the promise of big profits has attracted some elements 
of organized crime to drug wholesaling. In 1992, Kansas City underworld boss 
Anthony (Tony Ripe) Civilla was convicted along with Rubin for wire fraud in 
connection with such a scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holding up a bank doesn't make sense when you can get into this business," 
said Nevada's McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 To law enforcement officials on the West Coast, the names of Martin Rubin, 
Robert Fenton, Wilbur Swift, and Robert and Ben Lax are synonymous with black 
market prescription drugs. They say they are typical of the people involved in 
this business, many of whom operate in Southern California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Until they quarreled in 1989, Rubin and Swift were partners in a prescription 
drug operation with business addresses in Van Nuys and Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair went into business with financial help from the Lax brothers, whom 
Rubin identified in court as experienced diverters. Rubin and Swift also worked 
closely with Fenton in Nevada. In court documents, Rubin described Fenton as "a 
friend of mine and associate that has been in the business a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 When their business was at its peak, according to court records, Rubin and 
Swift each earned about $200,000 a year by acting as middlemen between the 
small diverters -- the institutional pharmacies -- and big wholesalers such as 
McKesson. They estimated their yearly profits at 30% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before enactment of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, the two were 
well aware that their business was predicated on fraud. Yet whenever they 
approached potential suppliers, they insisted that they were doing nothing 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 According to trial testimony, Rubin and Swift sometimes tried to skirt the 
legal issue by advising potential suppliers not to agree to a so-called "own 
use" clause in their contracts with manufacturers. (In such a clause, a buyer, 
usually an institutional pharmacy, certifies that the drugs are for its own use 
and not for resale.) 
</P>
<P>
 But they knew their suppliers would be forced to agree to an own-use contract 
in order to buy cut-rate drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 When Swift testified at Rubin's trial in Kansas City, he was asked by the 
prosecutor: "When you told them to avoid signing own-use clauses, was that 
essentially to cover yourself?" He replied: "Basically, yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these people that I dealt with knew it was illegal," Rubin added. 
"They had the own-use clause. They knew." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Prescription Drug Marketing Act was enacted, Rubin and Swift still 
refused to acknowledge they were violating the law. Rubin admitted on the 
witness stand that he dismissed the measure as unimportant, and soon found what 
he considered to be loopholes in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy I. Kristol, an attorney whose client was interested in purchasing a 
company in Rubin's network, said in court documents that he was told by lawyers 
representing the firm that diversion was only "a technical violation" of the 
law that would never be prosecuted as long as it was not flagrant. 
</P>
<P>
 But law enforcement officials came after them nonetheless: Rubin and Swift 
were convicted for wire fraud in Arizona in 1989, and Rubin was again found 
guilty in 1991 in a similar case in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Rubin nor Swift would agree to an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Since their conviction, Swift says he has retired from the business and Rubin 
contends he restricts his activity to acting as an adviser to other 
wholesalers, according to their attorneys. Nevertheless, their legacy lives on. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift sold his company, Drug World, to a Chicago lawyer who later purchased a 
wholesale operation in Las Vegas that state authorities say was previously 
involved in diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Rubin sold his business to people who have been frequently 
identified by law enforcement officials as diverters. According to internal 
federal investigation documents obtained by The Times, this company in 1993 was 
still serving as a supplier of diverted pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Fenton, according to reliable law enforcement sources, he continues to 
do business in Nevada, Washington state and Oregon under intense scrutiny from 
FDA investigators. The Lax brothers are said to have retired from the business. 
None of the three has been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 McKesson, Bergen Brunswig and other major drug wholesalers acknowledge that 
they sometimes purchase cut-rate drugs from smaller businesses, some of whom 
may have been linked in the past to black market activity. In industry 
parlance, this is known as "second-source buying," "alternative-source buying" 
or "investment buying." 
</P>
<P>
 But the major wholesalers contend they never knowingly purchase any drugs 
obtained illegally. Milan A. Sawdei, Bergen Brunswig's chief legal officer, 
noted that his company very carefully screens alternative-source suppliers and 
requires them to sign a contract swearing that none of the drugs they are 
supplying to the firm were obtained by fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bergen has a policy that we only acquire first-quality goods that are legal," 
Sawdei said in an interview. "It's a serious process. Somebody doesn't just 
call and say: 'I want to be a Bergen supplier.' We have turned down many 
people. In fact, we just terminated a supplier because his paperwork was not in 
order." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sawdei acknowledged that he cannot say for certain that none of Bergen 
Brunswig's merchandise was ever obtained illegally. "I strain to say never," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts say black market goods are a substantial part of the 
secondary-source market, simply because it is seldom possible to resell drugs 
purchased at low-rate prices without defrauding the manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Gordon, Rubin's attorney, explained that diverted drugs are often 
funneled through a number of wholesale companies -- in some cases, interlocking 
companies with the same ownership -- in order to "clean up the pedigree." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergen Brunswig was named as recipient of diverted drugs by several defendants 
who pleaded guilty as the result of a two-year FBI investigation of drug 
wholesaling centered in Atlanta in the mid-1980s. According to a plea agreement 
filed in federal court in December, 1985, Roger Allen Johnson, a defendant, 
purchased diverted drugs while employed as a buyer for the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Sawdei emphasized, "Bergen Brunswig has never been named as a 
target or source of any investigation" dealing with black market drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, although both Rubin and Swift have testified that they regularly 
sold diverted drugs to McKesson, Tom Walsh, vice president and general manager 
of McKesson Trading Co., the wholesaler's second-source buying arm, said his 
company has since implemented reforms to prevent buying from diverters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel comfortable that the people we're buying from are not the caliber of 
Rubin or Swift," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh said most of McKesson's non-manufacturing suppliers specialize in buying 
drugs in advance of a manufacturer's price increase -- not from institutional 
pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
 McKesson, with $11 billion in annual revenue, buys only about $300,000 a year 
from secondary sources, according to Walsh. But because the wholesaler operates 
on a slim profit margin, he acknowledged that buying drugs below the standard 
manufacturers' price is "very important to the bottom line." Wholesalers say 
the pharmaceutical manufacturers seldom question these activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Since enactment of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, only a few drug 
companies -- such as Wyeth-Erst, Schering-Plough and Lederle Laboratories -- 
have adopted aggressive programs to detect violators of the own-use clause. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharmaceutical company executives say it is difficult to enforce the own-use 
clause in court because, as one official put it, "we make lousy victims." 
Jurors are unsympathetic to the drug companies, which are often faulted by 
consumers for high prices and big profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's first serious effort to prosecute anyone for drug diversion 
under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act will begin playing out Monday, when 
Jerry W. Holden, a former protege of Swift's, goes on trial in U.S. District 
Court in Mississippi on charges that his tiny institutional pharmacy was 
illegally diverting drugs to a wholesaler on Long Island, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA's failure to enforce the law against diverters before now has been 
disappointing to Dingell, who in 1988 portrayed enactment of the legislation as 
a breakthrough. "Drug diversion is rampant because the Prescription Drug 
Marketing Act is not being enforced," Dingell said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the day the law was enacted by Reagan, it was clear that the government's 
top policy-makers had little interest in enforcing it. Reagan himself said when 
he signed the bill that he had "grave doubts" about it and added: "The 
magnitude of the public health problem created by diverted drugs is still not 
clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was there any sense of urgency at the FDA. Charma Konner, director of the 
FDA's division of drug quality evaluation, said she cannot explain why her 
agency still has not finalized regulations that were issued on a preliminary 
basis in 1990 to implement the Prescription Drug Marketing Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these things do take a while," Konner said. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, the FDA's enforcement of the law has focused almost entirely on 
preventing the sale and adulteration of drug samples. Not until March, 1992, 
did the FDA create an office of criminal investigation to look into such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are said to shy away from drug-diversion cases because they are 
complex and the penalties are often light. As McDonald put it: "The juice isn't 
worth the squeeze." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, defense attorneys representing diverters argue that the law is 
flawed. Thomas Spina, Holden's attorney, will challenge the government's case 
on grounds that while the law specifically outlaws drug diversion by what it 
calls "health care entities," Holden's business was not a "health care entity" 
because it never provided any direct patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you bought it from a health care entity, it's not illegal," insisted 
David L. Miller, vice president of JAM Distributors, a small wholesaler in 
Orange that dabbles in the secondary drug market. The Prescription Drug 
Marketing Act "does not prohibit this type of conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials said many nursing home pharmacies escape the 
definition of a "health care entity" by transferring the low-priced drugs to 
separate corporations before reselling them. If Holden is convicted, however, 
these officials said it will put them in a stronger legal posture to go after 
black market activity in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA's Dahl insists that his agency is on the verge of bringing several big 
drug-diversion cases. "We're going to make an impact on the illegitimate 
industry," Dahl said. "Even a few prosecutions will have an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 While stepped-up FDA enforcement might chase some diverters out of the 
marketplace, as Dahl believes, most experts agree that an easier way to shut 
down the black market would be to abolish the multitiered pricing system. 
</P>
<P>
 If manufacturers sold drugs at one price, according to Kenneth Sain, chief 
investigator for California's State Board of Pharmacy, "they could be selling 
it for more and the public would be getting it for less." 
</P>
<P>
 When President Clinton unveiled his ill-fated health care reform bill earlier 
this year, his proposal to eliminate multitiered pricing sent shock waves 
through an industry that has long defended the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin learned of the President's plan while he was incarcerated in the federal 
prison at Lompoc. He promptly sat down and wrote a letter to Clinton offering 
to serve as an adviser to the Administration on the drug pricing issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin was disappointed that the President did not respond.

COLUMN ONE; ATHLETE'S QUEST FOR LOST GOLD; AFTER TAKING A BANNED DRUG, DAVID 
KILEY IS FIGHTING TO GET THE GOLD MEDALS BACK FOR HIS TEAMMATES. HIS CAMPAIGN 
COMES AT A TIME WHEN DISABLED SPORTS IS BOASTING AN AIR OF PROFESSIONALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Kiley awoke in pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Stabbing, gripping, tormenting pain. 
</P>
<P>
 What Kiley did next changed his life as the world's greatest wheelchair 
basketball player. He took a red, spiral-shaped painkiller and hoped that the 
burning in his legs would stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he regrets taking anything that morning, 50 hours before the United 
States won the gold medal at the 1992 Paralympic Games in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 He regrets it because shortly after the U.S. victory, Kiley tested positive 
for a banned drug. He was accused of cheating and the Americans were stripped 
of their medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven teammates who worked so hard for that golden moment had it taken away 
because of David Kiley's pain. 
</P>
<P>
 And that has hurt most of all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, Kiley, a former Orange County basketball star living 
in San Dimas, has waged a one-man crusade to get the medals back for his 
teammates -- an effort that has entangled him in the multilayered bureaucracy 
of the disabled sports world and placed him at the middle of the controversy 
over whether disabled athletes should be subjected to the same drug-testing 
rules that govern their able-bodied peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley's campaign has come to a head at a time when disabled sports has 
outgrown its back-yard recreation mentality to boast an air of professionalism 
with sponsorship, financial backing and fan interest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the multimillion-dollar game of international sport, the disabled are 
seeking their share of the fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Disabled athletes and officials have long sought more respect and recognition, 
saying they are in most ways equal to the able-bodied. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to prove their point, officials began limited drug testing at the 
1988 Paralympics, a quadrennial event that showcases six categories of disabled 
athletes in competitions from wheelchair basketball to track and field. 
</P>
<P>
 They adopted the International Olympic Committee's list of banned substances, 
an array of drugs from anabolic steroids to over-the-counter nasal sprays. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, they were confronted with the two sides of drug testing: catching 
those who take performance-enhancing drugs such as anabolic steroids and 
amphetamines but penalizing unsuspecting athletes who take cold preparations, 
asthma medications and mild painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
 The able-bodied athletic world has wrestled with this issue since drug testing 
was introduced at the 1976 Olympics in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 For disabled athletes such as Kiley, the issue has added complications because 
their physical conditions might require medications that the able-bodied could 
function without. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still handicapped. We need our own set of drug rules," said Anardo 
Valdez, Kiley's teammate on the 1992 U.S. Paralympic basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most poignant symbols of the battle are the gold medals -- being 
held by the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation in Sheffield, 
England, until the dispute is settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the American players had refused to turn over their medals because 
they were so angry -- at first with Kiley and their coach, then at the system. 
They had done nothing wrong, so why were they being punished? they asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after international officials threatened to bar members of the team from 
the 1996 Paralympics in Atlanta were the gold medals returned. 
</P>
<P>
 All except one. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdez, a former Marine from New York who played for two decades, refused.

 "I don't think that medal should leave America," Valdez said. "We won it." 
</P>
<P>
 He was banned for life by the U.S. Wheelchair Basketball Assn. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When drug testing was started in 1988, it was modeled after the International 
Olympic Committee's program. Significantly, the disabled leaders left no avenue 
to appeal decisions -- an accepted procedure in other international sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in March, 1993, Kiley and the U.S. disabled sports team were granted a 
hearing before the now defunct International Coordination Committee of World 
Sports Organizations for the Disabled, the group that ran the Barcelona Games. 
The ICC upheld the decision to disqualify the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 That ended the saga until the wheelchair basketball community got a copy of 
the minutes from the ICC's meeting. They learned that ICC officials voted to 
uphold the decision before the U.S. delegation was heard. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Kiley took the drug did not matter to them, said Bob Steadward of 
Edmonton, Canada, president of the International Paralympic Committee that has 
replaced the defunct ICC. As an ICC official, Steadward introduced the proposal 
to uphold the U.S. disqualification before the hearing and has emerged as a 
hard-liner in Kiley's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was tested. It was positive. It was on the banned list," Steadward said. 
"Every athlete could come up with all sorts of reasons (for using the drug)." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, others did. Another disabled athlete caught at Barcelona was Leon 
Labuschagne, a discus thrower from South Africa. Labuschagne was allowed to 
keep his gold medal because he tested positive for a banned substance that was 
taken over a long period to treat hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, Kiley, 41, believes his reasons for taking the painkiller 
deserved consideration when meting out punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some athletes, he never contested the drug test's results: "I should 
have known what I was taking. There is no excuse for it, and I won't make any," 
he said at his office at Casa Colina Rehabilitation Center in Pomona, where he 
is director of wheelchair sports. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the punishment was handed down -- a two-year suspension for Kiley and 
disqualification for his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ben Johnson (Canadian sprinter) got a two-year suspension for steroids, and 
this little trace of (a painkiller) cost the team a gold medal," Kiley said. 
"There was no intent whatsoever for anything other than to take my person out 
of pain. It served no purpose in that gold medal game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that my teammates lost their gold medals is totally unacceptable," 
he said, adding that he is prepared to give up his medal for the sake of the 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that he is finally making headway. The IPC executive committee 
agreed last month to appear before the Court of Arbitration for Sport in 
Lausanne, Switzerland. The court, created by the International Olympic 
Committee, is expected to hear the case early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Olympic Committee, perhaps the world's most influential 
amateur sports organization, persuaded the IPC to agree to arbitration after 
IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch was petitioned by the U.S. Olympic 
Committee on Kiley's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 For disabled athletics to gain a foothold in the established sporting world, 
they need IOC support -- and money. That gave Samaranch leverage to force the 
IPC to resolve Kiley's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, resistance lingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really surprised (the Americans) made a decision to continue to pursue a 
situation that had already been duly adjudicated," Steadward said. "We've 
forgotten about it and gone on to more important matters." 
</P>
<P>
 If they thought Kiley would simply forget about it, they did not know him. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has Kiley been an outstanding basketball player and skier, he has 
scaled Guadalupe Peak, Texas' highest mountain at 8,751 feet. At times, he 
crawled across rocks while dragging a wheelchair and gear by a rope clenched in 
his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought the same determination to the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned from Barcelona, his sponsors were not sure whether to promote 
him as a gold medal winner or ignore him as a cheater. A wheelchair 
manufacturer sponsor left him off its poster of American gold medalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just killed me," Kiley said. "The first year and a half I'd come to 
tears a few times a week. It could be a conversation, it could be a thought, 
something I was reading." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first three months after the drug test, Kiley spent most of his day 
trying to find a way to get his case heard. He spent so much time on it he 
ignored his job and his wife, Sandy, and their children, Justin, 14, and 
Danielle, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made things much more tense in our household," Kiley said. "I was consumed 
by it." 
</P>
<P>
 An ill-tempered competitor likened to tennis great John McEnroe, Kiley often 
incensed officials by not mincing words. More than a year ago, he called 
officials "a bunch of able-bodied demigods who don't have a closeness to the 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley amassed thick files of paperwork on his case that he has sent to all of 
his '92 teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year Kiley plans to run for commissioner of the U.S. National Wheelchair 
Basketball Assn. against Stan Labanowich, the commissioner who suspended him 
but who also is trying to help win an appeal. Kiley realized that the only way 
to change the system was to become involved in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley said if he loses the arbitration, and the election, he will try to 
compete in his sixth Paralympics at Atlanta. He was a member of two gold medal 
winning wheelchair basketball teams before 1992 and also won medals in skiing 
competitions in the Winter Paralympics. He had planned to retire after 
Barcelona, but the loss of the medal has fueled his competitive drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't go away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley, a sandy-haired man with a baritone voice, is a 14-time All-American who 
became one of the greatest symbols of the disabled leading active lives. 
</P>
<P>
 A basketball star at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, Kiley damaged his 
spinal cord in 1973 when riding down the snow on an inner tube that slammed, 
back-first, into a tree in the San Bernardino Mountains. The accident left him 
partially paralyzed from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his endeavors, Kiley suffered excruciating pain in his back and 
legs because his spinal cord is only partially severed. He often took mild 
painkillers to deaden the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 In Barcelona, the pain was so bad one day that Kiley's coach, Harry Vines, 
gave him a Darvocet, a prescription painkiller containing the banned narcotic 
Darvon. Kiley did not take the medication immediately because he had a game the 
next day. Painkillers can slow the reflexes and affect play. 
</P>
<P>
 But two days before the United States played its gold-medal game against the 
Netherlands, Kiley awoke at 2:30 a.m. with the intense pain in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 He took the pill, as he had done hundreds of times before. Although 
pharmacologists say Darvon is not performance-enhancing and its analgesic 
effect lasts only six hours, a trace amount was found in Kiley's system about 
50 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing his worst game of the Paralympics, Kiley scored five points as the 
United States defeated the Netherlands for the gold medal, 39-36. Afterward, 
Kiley was selected for testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 3,600 athletes at the '92 Paralympics, 225 were required to provide 
urine samples for drug tests. Only the gold medal winners were tested, said 
Phil Craven, president of the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation. 
Kiley said the athletes had little information about the selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley said he thought banned drugs meant anabolic steroids or other 
performance-enhancing substances. It did not occur to him, he said, that other 
families of drugs such as painkillers also were banned. 
</P>
<P>
 American athletes were sent literature, given lectures and shown a film about 
drug testing, U.S. officials said. But the film was shown on the team charter 
to Barcelona. The wheelchair basketball team was not on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even Craven, IWBF president, understood the drug-testing regulations in 
Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rules were so scant," said Craven, who has become a strong critic of the 
current drug program. 
</P>
<P>
 After what happened to Kiley, Craven adopted the drug-testing policies of the 
international governing body for basketball. The program has a standard appeals 
process and sanctioning policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug testing has brought a sophistication to disabled sports. But the 
competitions really began as a method of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paralympics have been held since 1960, usually around the time of the 
Summer and Winter Games, though not always in the same city or country. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1988, the event was held a month after the Summer Olympics in Seoul, 
South Korea, ushering a new era of disabled athletics. The disabled used many 
of the facilities built for the Seoul Games, and for the first time felt like 
part of the international sports community. Limited drug testing was introduced 
although Kiley, who helped the United States win a gold medal, said he did not 
know of any basketball players who were tested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barcelona Games were held on an even larger scale four years later and the 
Atlanta Paralympics is expected to be the biggest yet, with about 4,000 
athletes representing 100 countries in 16 sports. The IPC has a $50-million 
budget to produce the games in conjunction with Atlanta Committee to Organize 
the Games, the local organizing committee for the '96 Summer Olympics. For the 
first time the marketing of a Paralympics will be coordinated with the 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paralympics, which is different from the participation-oriented Special 
Olympics, bring together competitors from six international organizations, 
including those representing blind players and the wheelchair-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Paralympics grew it became evident that disabled athletes needed some 
drug regulations of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just because we're disabled athletes doesn't make us morally pure," said 
David Efferson of Castro Valley, Calif., a member of the '92 U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hoped that by implementing drug testing in Barcelona they could 
deter use of banned substances. When Kiley tested positive, they had caught one 
of the Games' superstars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to make a strong statement but they set their feet on the wrong 
example," said Paul DePace, chairman of the National Wheelchair Athletic Assn., 
the governing body for U.S. wheelchair sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, wheelchair basketball officials felt handcuffed by Kiley's situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Labanowich, who has called for revisions of the IPC's drug testing program, 
said Kiley's actions forced the group to suspend him shortly after he tested 
positive. When Kiley was asked before the test whether he ingested any 
substances, he failed to mention the Darvocet. 
</P>
<P>
 "That put us in a real bind in trying to defend David," Labanowich said. "We 
couldn't close our eyes to the wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kiley said he was asked if he had taken anything within 48 hours of the Sunday 
final. Counting days, not hours, he figured taking a pill on Friday night was 
outside the time frame. (He actually took it early Saturday.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking, 'This is a hassle, I want to get back to the guys and 
celebrate,' " Kiley said. "So, I wasn't as clear with the question as I should 
have been." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Kiley made mistakes, so did the drug testers, according to some in the 
wheelchair basketball community. 
</P>
<P>
 They claim that the drug testing program violated Kiley's confidentiality by 
openly discussing his result, and did not allow him to witness the analysis of 
his test, standard protocol in other international sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The community has supported Kiley's efforts to have a fair appeal after 
becoming aware of the discrepancies. The Netherlands, Germany and France, the 
teams that finished second through fourth in Barcelona, last summer urged the 
IPC to give the United States due process. They want a resolution so the 
medals, now held in a safe-deposit box in the Sheffield bank, finally can be 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials are concerned that any standards short of those imposed by the 
International Olympic Committee would create a credibility problem for disabled 
athletes striving to be recognized as equals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't fall into that naive trap," Steadward said. "Years ago, people with 
disabilities used to be on all sorts of drugs for all sorts of reasons. We 
found as our sport grew more from a rehabilitation mentality to a sporting 
environment . . . there was less need to take a lot of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Kiley and his supporters want a list of banned drugs that differs from 
the roster used by the able-bodied, they want the same standards of punishment 
and protocol. 
</P>
<P>
 During last summer's World Cup soccer championships in the United States, 
Kiley watched with interest as the sport's most famous player, Diego Maradona, 
was withdrawn by Argentina after testing positive for stimulants. Argentina was 
allowed to continue playing, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona, who was once suspended for using cocaine, received a 15-month ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "My own country gave me a two-year suspension and gave my coach a four-year 
suspension," Kiley said. "You can't just take any guilt and hand down a 
punishment of the highest level of which there is no precedent in able-bodied 
or disabled (sport)." 
</P>
<P>
 That punishment has caused Kiley 2 1/2 years of pain, but until the medals are 
returned it will not end. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heaviest price is the nightmare of it all," Kiley said. 
</P>
<P>

SERBS BREAK VOW, WON'T FREE CAPTIVES; BALKANS: RESUMPTION OF SOME NATO PATROL 
FLIGHTS BRINGS RENEWED THREAT FROM BOSNIAN REBEL LEADER. PLANS TO WITHDRAW 
PEACEKEEPERS ARE 'QUITE ADVANCED,' U.N. CHIEF SAYS.

<P>
 In a display of contempt for the international peacekeeping force in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbian nationalists on Saturday reneged on a public 
promise to release 400 U.N. troops held hostage as insurance against NATO air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb rebel leader Radovan Karadzic made the vow to the U.N. special 
envoy to the Balkans, Yasushi Akashi, on Friday. But Saturday his rebels 
refused even to free one U.N. military observer suffering a heart condition and 
in need of urgent medical treatment unless the U.N. mission substituted another 
captive in his place, U.N. spokesman Paul Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. headquarters here rejected the proposed hostage swap as "totally 
unacceptable," Risley said. "We are hoping to impress on the Bosnian Serbs the 
seriousness with which we take the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The empty promise of freedom for detained peacekeepers came on the heels of 
Friday's jarring provocation of the U.N. Protection Force -- the rocketing of a 
Sarajevo building while Akashi and the U.N. commander for Bosnia were inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic also reiterated a subtle warning that his gunmen might shoot down 
NATO warplanes after the alliance resumed a few "trial balloon" flights 
Saturday to symbolically monitor the "no-fly" zone proclaimed two years ago but 
violated daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization had ceased air patrols six days earlier 
at U.N. insistence that a "cooling-off period" be observed to lure the rebels 
back to negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. military spokesman told reporters in Sarajevo that the Bosnian Serbs 
had been advised that the patrols should not be interpreted as hostile action. 
The spokesman said that "Karadzic responded by laying out his position that 
there was no reason for overflights and insisting on the Serbs' right of 
self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if U.N. officials have concluded that the rebels are trying to drive 
them out, Risley replied: "Certainly." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear the Bosnian Serbs are testing the resolve of the international 
community on (the U.N. Protection Force)," he said, adding that pressures are 
mounting daily for a U.N. pullout. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali conceded in Geneva that 
contingency plans for a withdrawal are "quite advanced," the strongest 
indication to date that the mission's directors might be leaning toward 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision to bring an end to the now-fruitless mission that began in Croatia 
three years ago would require a vote of the U.N. Security Council; debate over 
such an action would probably take weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But mission officials warned that a piecemeal pullout is the more likely 
scenario for scuttling the mission, with individual troop-contributing 
countries evacuating on short notice and perhaps bringing a chaotic, deadly and 
humiliating end to the world's failed attempt at neutral intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24,000 U.N. troops in Bosnia -- more than half of the peacekeeping force 
deployed across the roiling Balkans -- come from 23 countries, the vast 
majority of them U.S. allies in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 "Britain, France, Canada and Spain have all indicated in recent days, if not 
weeks, their desire to withdraw if conditions continue to deteriorate," Risley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 France has already reduced its presence in Bosnia with the pullout in 
September of its battalion in the Bihac pocket. The area is now the focus of a 
fierce Serbian rebel offensive despite the presence of 1,200 U.N. troops from 
Bangladesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs and their Croatian Serb allies continued attacking the 
U.N.-designated "safe haven" of Bihac city and edged close to capture of the 
town of Velika Kladusa to the north, Risley reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian Serb troops from the occupied Krajina region and armed supporters of 
a deposed Bosnian Muslim warlord, Fikret Abdic, moved deep into the territory 
defended by the Bosnian army's outgunned 5th Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-led government troops were pushed close to surrender, raising fears 
that the incursion was aimed at making Abdic a Serbian quisling ruler over the 
region. Observers said the international community might find reinstating 
Abdic, a Muslim, a face-saving alternative to an outright takeover by the 
Karadzic forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Violations of U.N. resolutions throughout Bosnia persisted despite Akashi's 
assurances to Karadzic during a weekend trip to the rebel stronghold of Pale 
that the mission would refrain from using NATO air power, U.N. sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO patrolling of the "no-fly" zone over Bosnia had been called off for the 
past week in an effort to appease the rebels, U.N. and alliance officials 
disclosed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason in the world right now to suspend NATO action. NATO has to 
be thinking that its reputation is on the line," one U.N. official here said. 
"I would hate to think a bunch of thugs in Pale had succeeded in standing down 
the strongest military alliance that has ever existed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs' threats against NATO warplanes after the overflights resumed 
Saturday raised serious doubts about the United Nations' ability to operate 
humanitarian airlifts into Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital that is under siege by 
the Serbian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was no word that a Serbian blockade of U.N. aid convoys to besieged 
Muslim enclaves in eastern Bosnia had been lifted, as Bosnian Serb leaders had 
promised Akashi on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The international community is currently trying to settle the Bosnian conflict 
diplomatically, with a watered-down proposal for ethnic division that the 
Bosnian Serbs have already rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-nation Contact Group, as it is known, decided during its meeting in 
Brussels on Friday to resurrect the plan for splitting Bosnian territory in 
half between the internationally recognized government and the Karadzic 
faction. The Serbian rebels currently occupy more than 70% of Bosnian land. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic has insisted on more territory and a larger share of major utilities 
and industrial resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no carrots and no sticks. It's yesterday's failure," said one U.N. 
official, baffled by the Contact Group's resubmission of the rejected plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign ministers of Britain and France -- partners in the Contact Group 
with the United States, Russia and Germany -- planned to visit Belgrade today 
for talks with the reputed mastermind of the Balkan conflict, Serbian President 
Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
 It remained unclear to U.N. and diplomatic sources what inducements British 
Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd and his French counterpart, Alain Juppe, could 
deliver, especially through Milosevic, who has ostensibly split with the 
Karadzic faction he armed and instigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has been pushing for a lifting of U.N. economic sanctions imposed on 
Belgrade for fomenting the Bosnia war as encouragement to Milosevic to use his 
influence with the Bosnian Serb rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 That strategy was defeated by the Western allies, however, and Russia's veto 
of a routine sanctions resolution in the Security Council on Friday was 
unlikely to enhance its chances of rewarding Milosevic for token compliance or 
foster unity within the divided Contact Group.

BHOPAL MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF GAS DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One decade after this city awoke in horror to its "night that never saw a 
morning," its people on Saturday put their rage, grief and indignation on 
display, but also their discord, indifference and weary resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 To mark the 10th anniversary of the Bhopal gas disaster, the worst industrial 
tragedy in history, one victims group proclaimed a "day of national shame." 
</P>
<P>
 After tense negotiations with police, some of its members were allowed to push 
past officers armed with bamboo staves and enter the grounds of the now idle 
Union Carbide plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the main gate, men and women from the Bhopal Gas Affected Women's 
Industrial Organization put up a mock graveyard, swinging picks into the loamy 
soil and erecting oblong stones etched with names of some of the more than 
7,000 people who Indian officials say have died over the last decade from 
exposure to the gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a protest, not a memorial, that after 10 years the multinationals are 
still here," Abdul Jabbar, the group's organizer, said as his colleagues worked 
in the ebbing light of dusk. "The problem is both Union Carbide and the union 
of India (the Indian state). They are both responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters left the plant grounds chanting "Death to Union Carbide! Death 
to the Indian government!" as thousands on the road outside cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Bhopal residents who have observed many anniversaries of the gas 
disaster, Saturday's events were filled with signs that apathy and resignation 
have grown with the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivalries among victims groups are still so strong that no common protest 
could be mounted. The march to the Union Carbide plant organized by the Bhopal 
Gas Affected Women's group was the best attended of many events, but it drew 
3,000 participants in a city of more than 1 million. And that number included 
1,000 tribes people from the remote forests of the central Indian state of 
Madhya Pradesh, a section of the population that was unaffected by the Union 
Carbide discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the dusty, twisting roads of Bhopal's old city, the predominantly 
Muslim quarter that was especially hard hit by the leak of 40 tons of toxic 
methyl isocyanate, or MIC, on Dec. 2-3, 1984, the mood was somber. 
</P>
<P>
 Most merchants pulled down their steel shutters as a sign of mourning and 
solidarity. The government of Madhya Pradesh closed its offices for the day, 
and schools shut their doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 10 years, our sorrow has increased, not decreased, because people are 
still suffering," said Tanwant Singh Keer, state minister in charge of relief 
for gas victims. "We have tried our best to wipe away the tears of the people. 
But still much remains to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Keer spoke at a morning interfaith prayer meeting where priests from the 
Hindu, Muslim, Sikh and Christian religions intoned prayers for the city's 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're remembering a night that never saw a morning," state Gov. Mohammed 
Shafi Qureshi, the chief guest at the interfaith ceremony, told the hundreds 
who crowded into a hall to bow their heads. "New industries must take a lesson 
from Bhopal and take care that the tragedy is not repeated." 
</P>
<P>
 However, environmentalists and victims groups complain that the lessons of 
their city's frightful ordeal have not been absorbed and that India is still 
without a law like the U.S. Community Right to Know Act, which requires private 
companies to inform the public about toxic emissions into the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the environmentalists say, that U.S. law came about as a direct 
result of the Bhopal disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American government is pressuring the Third World countries so when 
multinationals commit a crime, they don't have to pay for the responsibility," 
said Sadhna Karnik, leader of the Poisonous Gas Episode Struggle Front. She 
accused the U.S. government of callous indifference to the devastation wrought 
here by the Indian affiliate of an American company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the 10th anniversary of Bhopal, and there hasn't been even a statement 
or a concrete scheme for helping the victims," she said. "They haven't even 
sent us (former Union Carbide Corp. Chairman Warren) Anderson. He is the one 
man responsible and the one who should pay." 
</P>
<P>
 An arrest warrant was issued by a Bhopal judge in March, 1992, for Anderson, 
who had been charged with culpable homicide five years earlier along with top 
officials of Union Carbide's Indian affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 But activists suspect that the Indian government is doing nothing to extradite 
the now retired CEO, and that fuels their conviction that mighty forces, 
including India's leaders and one of the United States' biggest corporations, 
are arrayed against them at a time when India wants more, and not less, foreign 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want punishment for this genocide," Jabbar said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday afternoon, scores of Communists hostile to foreign capital paraded 
through Bhopal's streets, waving red flags. On the road outside the pesticide 
plant's perimeter wall, children pelted a 12-foot-high, straw-stuffed effigy of 
"demon" Union Carbide with rocks. It was set on fire, and youths lustily beat 
the smoldering remains with poles. 
</P>
<P>
 At a nearby crossroad, members of a porters union held an interfaith "die-in." 
Draped in a red shroud, a Hindu member of the union lay inert on logs placed in 
a pattern imitating a funeral pyre. Beside him, five Muslims, whose custom 
mandates burial of the dead, lay covered with earth, with their eyes closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 5,000 unionized peasant workers in the city, 300 to 400 perished from 
the gas, and the health of survivors is impaired, said Pyare Mian, president of 
the Bhopal United Porters Union. He is demanding better medical care and 
adequate compensation, and he believes that the government is shedding 
crocodile tears about helping the suffering. Of about 600,000 personal injury 
claims, only a fifth have been processed, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister 
Digvijay Singh said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twenty of my colleagues and myself will sit on hunger strike, and we won't 
withdraw until people are paid compensation," Mian vowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian officials said the highly toxic MIC gas, which killed 2,500 people in 
the first two weeks, continues to claim lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "People still get sick and die," said Dr. Ajay Khare of the Bhopal-based 
Science Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 State-supplied hospital care supposedly provided to gas victims is so slow and 
inadequate that many people spend up to four days before they can see a doctor, 
Khare said. In disgust, he said, many go to private practitioners -- men and 
women who are expensive and who are often quacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In fresh black graffiti daubed on walls throughout the city, the Bhopal Gas 
Affected Women's group demanded that the minimum compensation for gas victims 
be doubled to 50,000 rupees, or $810. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists say most claimants are being pressured to settle for the minimum 
amount and that the total awarded to people is only a fraction of the interest 
earned by the $470 million in compensation agreed to by Union Carbide in a 1989 
out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 In many respects, Saturday's demonstrations seemed out of sync with 
fast-changing reality. On countless occasions, people chanted "Union Carbide 
out of India!" They were apparently unaware that the chemical and plastics 
giant, based in Danbury, Conn., sold off its controlling share in its Indian 
affiliate this fall.

HIGH-PRESSURE HIGH; ACADEMIC SUCCESS IS KEY TO POPULARITY AT FIERCELY 
COMPETITIVE, MULTIETHNIC SCHOOL 
</P>

 Sunny Hills High is a public school with a zero percent dropout rate and no 
graffiti on the walls, a place where students brag about pulling all-nighters 
and compete in honors classes for the highest A-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson Browne went there. So did major league baseball catcher Gary Carter. 
Its reputation stretches across the Pacific Ocean, luring Korean immigrants in 
search of the best in American education, and to the elite Eastern colleges 
where graduates flock. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately the suburban campus has been overshadowed by a string of grisly 
headlines: A would-be valedictorian of the Class of 1993 was convicted in the 
brutal slaying of an honor student. A 1990 grad was accused this month of 
murdering his parents and brother. The 1988 Teacher of the Year was charged 
with killing her lesbian lover, and another longtime teacher pleaded guilty to 
molesting students. 
</P>
<P>
 The former postal worker who terrorized Orange County with a 1993 shooting 
rampage is a Sunny Hills alum too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our school's awesome," said junior Susu Irie, laughing as he stood in the 
school courtyard one afternoon. "We have everything from murderers to geniuses 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that's diversity," chimed in senior Jason Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunny Hills -- where scores of students sit with books open, pencils poised 
and calculators buzzing during lunch -- the peer pressure is not to take drugs 
or join gangs. It's to earn straight A's, rack up extracurriculars, and break 
1350 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test in the never-ending struggle to get into 
the best colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-quarters of the graduates go straight to four-year universities. Of 399 
seniors last year, 54 finished with a grade-point average above 4.0 for the 
year; there were six valedictorians because that's how many students finished 
four years with nothing but A's. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, popularity is based on looks and stuff. Here, it's how much 
you're involved and your academics," said sophomore Brian Kim. "When everybody 
is overachieving and going for it, it kind of brings other people along. It's 
like a race. If everyone's going fast, you go fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Esther Yoon added: "If I could sum up Sunny Hills in one word, it's 
hyper-competitive. " 
</P>
<P>
 But students, parents and faculty say the competition is positive, pushing the 
young people to their fullest potential. Fueling the emphasis on academics is 
the growing number of Asian families devoted to top-notch education that seek 
out the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1959, Sunny Hills was for decades a predominantly white school 
nestled in a neighborhood of upper-middle-class, college-educated 
professionals. But now many of the homes, which range in price from $300,000 to 
$1 million, are being bought by Asian families attracted by the high school's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Koo Oh, a Fullerton dentist who heads the Korean American Assn. of Orange 
County, said many Koreans consider Sunny Hills the best high school in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Some families even remain in Asia but send their children to live in Fullerton 
and attend Sunny Hills. Others from throughout Southern California borrow 
addresses from people who live in the school's attendance area to make their 
children eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the student body was 71.8% Anglo and 17.9% Asian. Now it is 48.4% 
Asian and 39.4% white. Four years ago, there were no "limited English 
proficiency" students -- now there are 163. The shift will probably continue: 
Asians are 45% of the Class of 1995, 51% of the Class of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a mini-United Nations up here," said Assistant Principal Diane 
Hockersmith. "But when you get that many different ethnicities in a place, it 
takes a little to keep everybody happy and calmed down." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students said that they have individual friends of varied races, but that 
cliques form along ethnic lines. At morning break, lunch and after school, 
Koreans dominate the center of the quad, whites mingle on the fringes of the 
leafy courtyard and Latinos -- about 8% of the student body -- gather elsewhere 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Koreans and Anglos park in different rows in the student lots. There is a 
Korean Family Support Group separate from the white-dominated Parent Teacher 
Student Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In a school newspaper column last year, editor Jhoanna Infante complained that 
even at International Day, an event lauded for promoting cultural awareness, 
booths were segregated by race. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Asians don't like the whites because they're all sports, and the whites 
don't like the Asians because they're all academics and money," said senior 
Brian Ashton, who has a reputation on campus for mixing easily among Asian and 
white cliques. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are divisions among Koreans, who make up 27% of the students and 
57% of the Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 Assimilated Korean Americans tease "FOBs" -- students who are "fresh off the 
boat" -- and disdain the "gangsters" -- Koreans who wear baggy pants, carry 
beepers, and boast about their connections to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within Koreans, there's discrimination too," said sophomore Stephen Sohn, who 
was born in the United States a few years after his parents came here from 
Korea. "If you don't know your language, they make fun of you. Some people 
speak Korean to each other when they don't want other people to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 The changing demographics have coincided with Sunny Hills' growing reputation 
for achievement. Long known within Orange County as an academic powerhouse, the 
school now stacks up among the best in the state and nation, according to test 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's senior class includes a student who earned a perfect score on the 
American College Achievement Test -- the first in the school's history. Last 
year, there was a perfect SAT score -- also a Sunny Hills first. 
</P>
<P>
 And there currently are 27 National Merit Scholarship semifinalists on campus, 
the most ever and third-highest in California, behind only the elite private 
Harvard-Westlake School in Los Angeles and Peninsula High School in Palos 
Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students and staff acknowledged that skyrocketing standards of parents 
drive the achievement culture at Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in high school, my parents didn't even know what theSAT was," said 
English teacher Kimberley Stein, the school newspaper adviser. "There are 
Korean parents here who don't even speak English but know the cutoff (SAT score 
needed) to get into Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
 Sohn said his parents expect perfection. "Anything below an A is failure. I 
hate that, so I try to avoid that by getting the best grades I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty and administrators attribute much of the achievement to the school's 
International Baccalaureate program, a rigorous set of advanced classes that 
provide a global, interdisciplinary education. More than a quarter of Sunny 
Hills students take IB classes, and there are 55 candidates this year for a 
special IB diploma, ranking the school's IB program third in the United States 
(out of 150 schools). 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 students each year from outside the Fullerton district apply to 
attend Sunny Hills, most attracted by the IB program. 
</P>
<P>
 The level below honors, "college prep," is viewed as average on campus, though 
the curriculum is more advanced than that of many other public high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Students involved in IB often are overloaded with extracurricular activities. 
School counselors said their biggest struggle during registration each semester 
is talking campus leaders out of taking too many honors classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular students on campus also are the ones with the overstuffed 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since you go to Sunny Hills, you have to get good grades, you have to be 
involved," sophomore Brianne Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy McGuire, a senior, recounted a friend saying, "Oh, I'd thought you were 
smart," upon learning that McGuire had 13 Bs over six semesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Each summer, history teacher Patrick Lampman takes 30 youngsters on a tour of 
Ivy League and other East Coast schools. Many students take expensive classes 
or have private tutors to prepare them for the SATs, and some hire outside 
college consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 It works. Last year, eight were accepted to Ivy League schools, eight more to 
Stanford. Seventy-eight got into UC Irvine, 65 into UCLA and 48 into UC 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the much-acclaimed IB program, Sunny Hills is the only high 
school in California to offer five levels of Korean. It also takes an 
innovative approach with its limited-English-speaking students, hurrying them 
into college preparatory classes rather than giving them lower-level academics. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, Sunny Hills is one of only nine high schools in Orange County with an 
agriculture program, where students raise chickens, turkeys, pigs, sheep and 
steers on a seven-acre farm and study agribusiness, floriculture and veterinary 
science. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at all levels said they have more time for instruction because 
discipline is a virtual non-issue at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its increasing success, the past few years have been rough for the 
school, with the rash of criminal incidents connected to the campus causing 
alarm. Long derided as "Snobby Hills" because of its affluent student body, the 
school has recently earned a second taunting nickname from cross-town rivals: 
"Scummy Thrills." 
</P>
<P>
 At least two students have attempted suicide this fall, overdosing on pills, 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wonder whether the competitive atmosphere compounded other problems in 
leading to the string of arrests in recent years, but many students, staff and 
parents insist that the problems are pure coincidence and unrelated to the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no connection between the school and these crazy incidents," said 
George Giokaris, Sunny Hills principal from 1989 to 1993. "There would have 
been no way to have ever predicted that these kinds of things would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, senior Sommer Jensen said she is embarrassed to tell people where she 
goes to school because they think it's "Murder Inc." 
</P>
<P>
 "People in my class are just waiting for something bad to happen this year," 
senior Grace Fujimoto said quietly. "Because in the Class of 1995, something 
bad has happened every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the grisly headlines began in January, 1993, with the arrest of five 
students in the slaying of a student from Foothill High in the Tustin area, 
there has been a complete administrative turnover at the school, bringing 
Loring Davies into the principal's chair. 
</P>
<P>
 A balding, bearded man who looks older than his 34 years, Davies keeps his 
office door open and spends hours each day roaming the campus, walkie-talkie in 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students here have an incredible amount of self-confidence," Davies said. 
"To take these students (who) are already bright and have excelled beyond their 
years and help them continue to grow can be very difficult. . . . Some people 
say, 'Gosh, you're putting too much pressure on students.' I don't know that 
you can have it both ways all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Massy Tadjedin, president of the student body, is in class from 6:45 a.m. to 
3:30 p.m. every day. She volunteers at the Red Cross, works at Laura Ashley on 
Sunday afternoons, and was on the homecoming court. She got 1450 on her SAT and 
applied early to Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when I was questioning whether I was enjoying my youth," she 
reflected. "That's a huge fear I have. Am I going to look back on this and say 
I didn't have any fun in high school?"

ON CALIFORNIA: THE HOUSE THAT WOULD NOT BE SOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This sad little tale from the Southern California real estate crash begins, 
not with the bust, but with the boom. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the mid-1980s, and anybody who owned a house was flying high. No social 
gathering was complete without a smug accounting by all present of the bundles 
they could make simply by selling their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The market then was overloaded with frantic buyers, and the game belonged to 
the quick and the pre-approved. Bidding wars were common. Insider trading was 
essential. The surest way to land a house was to strike before the listing was 
ever posted. 
</P>
<P>
 Into this happy, crazy market leaped the principals of this parable. The year 
was 1986. Don and Leslie Potts, both employed in the entertainment industry, a 
young couple with a small daughter, wanted a house with a big yard and a Beaver 
Cleaver feel. They were told about a three-bedroom custom home on Firmament 
Avenue, in the once quite fashionable Chisolm Estates development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard that the owner was thinking about selling," Don recalled the other 
night, sitting in the family room. "We came out and looked at it. We took, oh, 
about 10 minutes to decide. It had everything we wanted. Nine-foot ceilings. 
Hardwood floors. There already were five interested buyers, and so we bid more 
than the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we got the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, and now the house has got them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At first, all was bliss and contractor work. The Potts sunk about $60,000 into 
their new home, which they had purchased in the low twos. Floors were restored, 
the roof replaced, the rooms painted, the driveway repaved. The house was made 
fine, the market stayed hot, and no doubt the proud owners -- old friends from 
my Fresno days -- could hold up their end when polite conversation came, 
inevitably, to the topic of pending real estate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years, though, they decided to move. In the rush to buy, they had 
not researched the neighborhood schools. Such oversights were common in that 
frenzied time. A flush of the toilet, a quick peek into the basement, that was 
about it for precautionary evaluations. Now, with their daughter grown to 
school age, and with a baby brother in the house, they discovered that the 
neighborhood public schools were dismal. Also, Los Angeles was wearing a bit 
thin, for all the standard reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 They dreamed the common new dreams -- of Telluride, Colo., and Bend, Ore., and 
a new life doing whatever transplanted Californians do when they head east for 
the Old West. They put their house on the market for $385,000. It sold fast and 
at near full price -- with neither buyer nor seller aware that the market at 
that moment had hit its high-water mark and was about to head down, down, down. 
</P>
<P>
 They packed their belongings and counted down the escrow calendar. Five days 
before the transaction would have been complete, it fell apart. The buyer of 
their buyer's house had pulled out, because the buyers of that house had lost 
their buyer, and so on down the line. Unconcerned, my friends waited for 
another buyer. Five years later, they are waiting still. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The house that won't sell has become a neighborhood landmark. "If the 
neighbors don't see the 'For Sale' sign up," Don said, "they'll stop by and 
ask, 'Hey, is something the matter?' " The Potts held an open house not long 
ago; no one came. Their listing was included on the weekly Realtor caravan; one 
agent showed up. They recount by rote the calamities that have occurred while 
the house has been up for sale -- recession, defense industry closures, riot, a 
flood, fires, earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Each disaster brought a drop in price -- and also in buyer interest. Their 
current price is around $240,000, but they make clear that is negotiable. At 
this point, why be coy? They have churned through a succession of agents: 
"Let's see, there was Larry, and then Jack, and then back to Larry. . . . " The 
Potts have been told they are competing against foreclosure sales, and as long 
as that's the case, they can forget about Telluride. 
</P>
<P>
 By now they have made a sort of peace with their predicament. "It must be 
fate," said Leslie. "We aren't supposed to move." They do enjoy living in the 
house itself, which, after all, is what a house is for. And they do like their 
work and appreciate the city's charms. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, what seems to bother them most is not that they live where they 
live. Rather, it is the idea of entrapment, the sense of not being free to move 
on whenever they want. They have become prisoners of a house, and a city, and a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But hey, at least most days the weather's nice.

TROUBLED SKIES FOR A HIGH-FLYING AIRCRAFT; SCIENCE: SETBACKS PLAGUE PROGRAM TO 
SEND UNPILOTED PLANES TO THE EDGE OF THE STRATOSPHERE, BUT RESEARCHERS REMAIN 
HOPEFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soaring almost seven miles above the Mojave Desert recently, a pilotless NASA 
research plane resembling a glider struggled against hurricane-force winds. 
</P>
<P>
 As it headed home through the heaving sky, the $1.5-million craft began to 
twist and turn violently. Ground handlers tried to regain control by radio, but 
the plane broke up in midair, its pieces drifting to Earth by parachute. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was the latest setback for the Perseus program, NASA's 
path-breaking but controversial effort to use inexpensive robot aircraft to 
study erosion of the Earth's vital ozone layer and other global climate 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists hope that high-flying, remote-controlled drones like the one that 
was destroyed can open the door to closer scrutiny of ozone and other gases in 
the stratosphere, that great slab of frigid air 10 to 30 miles above the 
surface that remains a little-understood scientific frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 In the near term, NASA wants to use Perseus to measure the impact on ozone of 
exhaust gases from the proposed high-speed civil transport, an updated version 
of the supersonic transport project, or SST, that was canceled by Congress in 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
 But since Perseus test flights began at this sprawling desert air base a year 
ago, the $6-million program to develop the planes has been repeatedly delayed 
by mechanical and weather troubles. Although they were expected to fly to the 
low end of the stratosphere -- about 15 miles up -- Perseus planes have yet to 
reach 10 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying if I told you I'm satisfied. I'm certainly dissatisfied we 
haven't made more rapid progress," said John S. Langford, president of Aurora 
Flight Services Corp., a small, 5-year-old Virginia firm that built the Perseus 
craft that crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, some scientists worry that Aurora and NASA have unrealistic 
expectations of the Perseus project, and question whether the lightweight craft 
can loft adequate scientific instruments to the necessary heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that it is underfunded," said Adrian Tuck, a respected ozone 
researcher for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "The cheap, 
garage-electronics approach is not going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Perseus' design borrows from the headline-making Daedalus aircraft, a 70-pound 
contraption that flew 72 miles from Crete to Santorini in 1988, powered solely 
by the legs of a Greek bicycle racer. The project was supervised by Langford, 
an MIT graduate who later enlisted several other Daedalus veterans to start 
Aurora in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists hope Perseus drones will succeed the much larger, piloted aircraft 
such as converted U-2 spy planes and other onetime military craft that now are 
the workhorses of stratospheric research. 
</P>
<P>
 Such planes cost far more to build and operate, and carry risks to human 
pilots that are nonexistent with unmanned drones. Nor can piloted planes fly as 
high. Although the U-2 has a ceiling of 65,000 feet, Perseus is intended to 
soar up to 98,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 With wings stretching 59 feet from tip to tip, Perseus craft are driven by an 
80 horsepower gasoline engine. To keep the power plant running in the 
stratosphere's thin air, the craft carries a tank of liquid oxygen. It can 
accommodate up to 165 pounds of instruments, taking air samples through it 
nose. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA wants to put Perseus to work immediately studying the effect on 
stratospheric ozone levels of the high-speed civil transport. 
</P>
<P>
 Aircraft manufacturers believe there is a big market for the plane, which is 
intended to whisk large numbers of passengers between major cities three times 
as fast as conventional airliners. But the craft will spew exhaust gases 
including nitrogen oxides, which destroy ozone. 
</P>
<P>
 The SST was canceled by Congress amid concerns over nitrogen oxides, and 
aerospace firms are now trying to develop engines that burn most of those 
gases. NASA has been directed to assess such efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers had hoped to use Perseus in stratospheric studies this fall, but 
the craft was delayed by a series of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 As a cost-cutting measure, Perseus has no brakes, so it lands on Rogers Dry 
Lake, a vast natural runway at Edwards, about 100 miles north of Downtown Los 
Angeles. A number of flights had to be canceled last winter after rains soaked 
the lake bed. High crosswinds also hampered testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Perseus craft have suffered a number of mechanical problems as well. On one 
flight, a relief valve froze in the open position, causing the craft to dump 
liquid oxygen as it ascended. Another flight was aborted after a faulty sensor 
warned of a nonexistent fuel leak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a young, innovative company which is trying to solve some very difficult 
problems," said Steve Wegener, NASA's physical science manager for Perseus, 
referring to Aurora, the plane's maker. "They're having problems they didn't 
anticipate." 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal sense is that they were a bit naive about what it takes to 
test-fly airplanes. They originally thought they could get 10 flights in 30 
days. And they got nine flights off in four months." 
</P>
<P>
 Langford, Aurora's president, said part of the problem is that NASA has 
Perseus on a short budget leash, and engineers can't test the craft and its 
components in wind tunnels and other ground facilities. That increases the risk 
of problems on the flight line or in the sky, he said. 
</P>

 Two copies of Perseus were being test-flown at Edwards. But after one drone 
came apart Nov. 22, NASA grounded the other pending a report by an 
investigation team headed by former astronaut Vance Brand, assistant chief of 
flight operations at NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center, located at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Baer-Riedhart, a NASA-Dryden official who oversees the Perseus program, 
said the craft was headed for a landing when "some type of dynamic instability" 
caused its wing to separate from the fuselage. She said Brand's group was 
analyzing a long-range video of the incident to determine its cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Baer-Riedhart brushed aside any suggestion that NASA may cancel Perseus over 
the breakup and other problems, although she said it may be modified to correct 
any engineering problems that may be found by Brand's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the guidelines we're under as far as keeping costs fairly low, 
and the weather, and the type of technology that we're trying to do, we're 
fairly happy with the way we've been going," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists also remain supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Anderson, a Harvard professor of atmospheric chemistry who helped develop 
the aircraft, said that although researchers have good data on the lower 
regions of the stratosphere, the upper portion remains a mystery. Since piloted 
craft cannot fly that high, Perseus is crucial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a profoundly important missing piece of information that only Perseus 
can fill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other scientists are skeptical, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuck, of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said although he 
supports the concept of Perseus, he does not think the aircraft can carry 
enough scientific payload. 
</P>
<P>
 Exploring the upper atmosphere is difficult and expensive, he said, and NASA 
should recognize that and spend more money developing a craft better suited for 
high-altitude research. 
</P>
<P>
 His concerns were echoed by Bill Burne, a professor of meteorology at 
Pennsylvania State University. Burne said a Perseus aircraft was scheduled to 
begin flying scientific instruments out of Darwin, Australia or the South 
Pacific island of Kwajalein last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plane was not ready and the tests were postponed, he said. Now 
researchers are weighing the use of balloons for such flights, a 
less-than-perfect substitution because a balloon's flight path cannot be 
controlled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big step down," said Burne. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson said researchers have had great success in miniaturizing 
instruments in recent years, and carrying capacity is not a barrier to Perseus 
or its planned successor, Perseus B, designed to carry more than twice the 
payload. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that some researchers are uncomfortable with Perseus because they are 
used to piloted aircraft, which are more expensive and supported by larger 
bureaucracies. By contrast, Perseus was specifically designed as a shoestring 
operation, and that could threaten the careers of those associated with more 
traditional programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Perseus, Anderson said, "changes the context of how you do research. The 
minute you do that, you run into huge resistance."

UPSTART PARTY IN TAIWAN MAKES GAINS; ASIA: ELECTIONS SHAKE TRADITIONAL POWER 
STRUCTURE. BUT RESULTS DON'T APPEAR TO POSE DIRECT CHALLENGE TO CHINA. 
</P>

<P>
 Taking advantage of a split in traditional support for the ruling Nationalist 
Party, Taiwan's populist Democratic Progressive Party scored its biggest 
victory ever Saturday, capturing the mayoralty of Taipei, the country's richest 
and most important city. 
</P>
<P>
 But the party, which favors independence for Taiwan, failed to win the most 
coveted position up for grabs, the provincial governorship of the island. That 
post, won handily by Nationalist Party incumbent James Soong, has been viewed 
widely here as a test-run for the island nation's first presidential elections, 
set for 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nationalists also captured the other big race of the day, the mayoralty of 
the southern industrial port Kaohsiung, Taiwan's second-largest city. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Nationalist hold on power was badly shaken in Taipei, where 
incumbent Mayor Huang Ta-chou finished third behind the winner, Democratic 
Progressive candidate Chen Shui-bian, and New Party candidate Jaw Shao-kang. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the strongest showing yet for the upstart New Party, formed by former 
Nationalist Party legislators disillusioned with Taiwanese President Lee 
Teng-hui. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaw, a 44-year-old mechanical engineer, set the tone for the election by 
directly attacking Lee, who is also chairman of the Nationalist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 In speeches and rallies, Jaw accused Lee of abandoning the traditional 
Nationalist dream of reunification with the Chinese mainland and secretly 
supporting the pro-independence agenda of the Democratic Progressive Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaw warned that the pro-independence movement threatened to provoke an 
invasion from China, which officially still considers Taiwan a province under 
mainland control. 
</P>
<P>
 By winning in Taipei, the Democratic Progressive Party consolidated its hold 
on the capital city and surrounding suburbs. Last November, the party won 
control of Taipei County. Together, county and city account for one-quarter of 
Taiwan's 21 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's election marked a milestone in Taiwan's transformation from virtual 
dictatorship to multi-party democracy. Never before had Taiwan's voters chosen 
a governor, and elections for mayor in Taipei have not been held since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen, the Taipei mayor-elect, a 43-year-old attorney who finished first in his 
class at Taiwan University Law School, campaigned on promises that he would 
clean up city government and attack cost overruns in Taipei's much-delayed, 
much-criticized $17-billion mass transit system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nationalists' main cause for rejoicing was Soong's victory over Democratic 
Progressive Party challenger Chen Ting-nan in the provincial governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Soong, 52, a former spokesman for the Nationalist 
government, came under regular attack because of his background as a 
mainland-born Mandarin-speaker unable to debate his opponent in the native 
Taiwan dialect. His public appearances were regularly interrupted by opposition 
chants of "Taiwanese vote for Taiwanese." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 85% of the island's population is ethnic Taiwanese, descendants of 
refugees from the mainland's Fujian province 350 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least in Saturday's election, the much-feared "mainlander versus 
Taiwanese" issue failed to materialize as Mandarin-speaking, mainland-born 
candidates -- Soong and Kaohsiung Mayor Wu Den-yih -- won two of the three main 
positions up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional acceptance speech, Soong praised the "justice" and "tolerance" 
of the Taiwanese people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you. Thank you very much indeed," he said, using the Taiwanese dialect 
to emphasize his gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
 The election results will be closely monitored on the Chinese mainland, where 
the Communist leadership makes no secret of its wariness of the 
pro-independence movement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the center of Taipei on Saturday night, tens of thousands of supporters 
filled the streets and ignited firecrackers to celebrate the victory of Chen 
Shui-bian. In the final tally, Chen gathered 610,000 votes, compared to 420,000 
for New Party candidate Jaw and 360,000 for Nationalist Party incumbent Huang. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the celebrants, Wang Jin-wei, 40, an herbal medicine physician, waved a 
Democratic Progressive Party pennant and expressed his satisfaction: "This is a 
big boost for the Taiwanese people. It has been more than 30 years since we 
have been able to elect our mayor."

BOMB BLASTS AT KURDISH PAPER KILL 1, HURT 22

<TEXT>
<P>
 Three coordinated explosions ripped through separate offices of Turkey's 
leading pro-Kurdish daily early Saturday, killing one person and injuring at 
least 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest blast occurred at Ozgur Ulke's main offices in Istanbul's Kumkapi 
district, gutting the four-story building and leaving it a smoldering mess of 
twisted metal and collapsed concrete.All the casualties occurred there. 
</P>
<P>
 Other explosions destroyed the paper's Ankara office and damaged a separate 
Istanbul bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said two of the injured were firefighters who struggled for hours to 
put out the fires from the explosion, which sent bricks and metal flying and 
blew out windows in nearby buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ozgur Ulke journalists blamed the government, saying it was out to silence 
them because of their coverage of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) insurgency 
in the southeast. More than 13,000 people have died in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of Ozgur Ulke (Free Country) employees have been jailed for supporting 
the Kurdish rebels, and 10 reporters have been killed. Human rights groups 
accuse the security forces of involvement in their murders; the government 
denies the accusations.

U.S. BOARDS IRAQI VESSELS IN GULF; BAGHDAD PROTESTS

 The U.S. Navy said Saturday that it boarded five vessels suspected of breaking 
U.N. sanctions on Iraq and handcuffed "uncooperative crewmen" aboard one, an 
Iraqi tanker. 
</P>
<P>
 The tanker boarding provoked angry charges of brutality from Baghdad, which 
said U.S. Marines, guns blazing, boarded two Iraqi vessels and beat up crew 
members while interrogating them on the nature of their cargo and the number of 
crew members on board. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Navy spokesman said three tugs intercepted Wednesday as they sailed 
south from Iraq were carrying 23,000 tons of gasoline and were diverted to 
unidentified ports for investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other vessels, including the Iraqi tanker, were boarded Thursday in the 
same area of the Persian Gulf, about 15 miles off Iraq's coast, the spokesman 
said. Both were allowed to continue after the tanker was found to be carrying 
only water. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council imposed a trade embargo on Iraq in August, 1990, 
after President Saddam Hussein's forces invaded neighboring Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
 Iraq said Saturday that Americans shot at the Iraqi crewmen during Thursday's 
boardings. The Americans forced the two ships to sail south for inspections, 
detained the crew for 21 hours and beat some crew members, said the official 
Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy spokesman denied that there was any gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 When a helicopter team boarded the ship, one of the tanker's 16-member crew 
"attacked by hand the first member of our team to board the tanker," he said, 
stressing that the incident occurred in international waters. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a Marine hit the crew member with his rifle butt in the chest and 
placed flexible cuffs on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "No shots were fired . . . minimum force necessary was used," said the 
spokesman, adding that the crewman was not injured and was later seen by a U.S. 
medical team. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuffs were placed on three other uncooperative crew members "to keep them in 
line," he added.

 Two Muslim militants were sentenced to hang for an attack in September that 
killed two German tourists and two Egyptians in the Red Sea resort of 
Hurghada.A military court sentenced another 14 men, five of whom are on the 
run, to prison terms ranging from five to 15 years. The court was told that one 
of the two German tourists, who was wounded in the Sept. 27 rifle attack on a 
crowded marketplace, died after being flown back to Germany. That death brought 
to eight the number of foreigners killed by militant violence in Egypt.

ARAFAT, PALESTINIANS FACE A WINTER OF DISCONTENT; MIDEAST: REFUGEES FEEL 
ABANDONED. DISCORD IS RISING EVEN IN GROUP FOUNDED BY PLO LEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the grip of the region's first winter storm, the Balata refugee camp was so 
cold Friday that Hussam Khader's breath was visible as he sat in his living 
room, explaining why he and other Palestinian refugees no longer trust PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat's commitment to their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Khader's relatively spacious house, the camp he was born in has not 
changed at all since the Palestine Liberation Organization signed its peace 
accord with Israel 14 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Balata is still dirty, crowded and filled with unemployed men with no job 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 And lately, the camp has been rife with rumors that even the U.N. Relief and 
Works Agency, which provides schooling, medical care and some food for 
Palestinian refugees, intends to shut down its services as a result of the 
peace accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very anxious and fearful, because they know that any solution 
under the current agreement with the Israelis is going to keep them refugees," 
Khader said. "Speaking from the refugee point of view, we have absolutely no 
trust in the Palestinian Authority as it is set up now." 
</P>
<P>
 Khader, 33, is a spokesman for the Committee in Defense of Refugees -- the 
latest opposition movement to challenge the policies of Arafat, who serves as 
PLO chairman and head of the Palestinian self-governing authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee formed four months ago with representatives from five of the 
West Bank's 18 refugee camps. Its ostensible goal was to fight any decline in 
the U.N. agency's services in the West Bank, where one-fourth of the population 
are registered refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real target, Khader and other committee members freely admitted, is 
Arafat and the policies he is pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes this movement important is that it is led by activists of Fatah, a 
group that Arafat founded and which is based in the refugee camps that for 
years were his strongholds. That the movement exists at all is evidence of how 
Arafat's political base is eroding as his self-rule government struggles to 
implement the peace accords. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Israel is focused on the threat that the Islamic opposition 
poses to Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Palestinians believe that a potentially greater political threat to 
the beleaguered chairman comes from within Fatah -- from activists whose anger 
with the Palestinian Authority and disillusionment with the peace process could 
precipitate a split within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the Palestine National Council, the highest Palestinian 
legislative body, Khader also is chairman of the General Union of Palestinian 
Students. He noted with irony that he also holds a position in the very 
Palestinian Authority he criticizes -- he is working in the Ministry of Youth 
and Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 All his adult life, Khader said, he believed in Fatah as the instrument of 
Palestinian liberation. As an activist in one of the most militant camps, he 
served time in prison for resisting the Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in prison, I preached Fatah's teachings with blind faith," he 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Israel deported Khader as a leader of the intifada, the Palestinian 
uprising against Israeli occupation that erupted in the territories in 1987. He 
traveled to PLO headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, where, he said, "I saw our 
leaders face to face. I learned hard lessons about these men. It's not just 
that they do not practice democracy. They have no understanding of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oslo peace accord produced one direct benefit for Khader: It let him move 
back to his home in Balata in April with his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Israel handed over most of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of 
Jericho to the Palestinians in May, Khader and other activists found themselves 
pushed aside by the Tunis-based, aging PLO bureaucrats that Arafat chose to 
staff the new self-governing authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven months of Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip has left Khader and 
other Fatah activists in the West Bank and Gaza disillusioned and angry. 
</P>
<P>
 Their disgust deepened as international donors failed to deliver promised 
funding, as Israel pressured Arafat to crack down on the Islamic opposition and 
other opposition groups, as Arafat's security forces grew. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, they have worried about Arafat's style of governing. 
</P>
<P>
 Their fears were partially realized last month, when the Palestinian police 
opened fire on members of Hamas, the largest Islamic opposition movement, 
during a Gaza riot, killing at least 12 people and wounding at least 129. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a member of the Palestine National Council, I voted for a Palestinian 
independent state," Khader said. "I also voted to go to Madrid, when peace 
talks began between Israel and the Arabs. But after seeing the reality on the 
ground of this peace agreement, I'm fearful. Arafat has appointed people to his 
government who have no ties to the revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Khader's movement was born in the same camps that spawned the intifada. Its 
members are the same angry young men who squared off against troops in the 
streets that cold winter of 1987, when, Palestinians believe, they made 
Israelis pay a price for their occupation for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Khader said, he and his friends fear that their lives may never change, 
that the refugees will become the forgotten Palestinians. In desperation, they 
are taking political aim at Arafat and his Gaza-based government. 
</P>
<P>
 Their primary accusation is that, by agreeing to leave the refugee issue for 
final-status talks with Israel that are not due to start until 1996, the 
Palestinian Authority is abandoning the refugees. They scoff at the notion that 
Israel will ever agree to let refugees return to homes they lost in 1948, when 
Israel was born, or in the 1967 Mideast War. 
</P>
<P>
 Khader said he dreams of one day forging a united front of refugees from camps 
in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and the occupied territories -- a front that will 
press both the United Nations and the Palestinian Authority to ensure that 
refugees win either the right to return home or compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 His committee's first step has been to start publicly pressing the U.N. agency 
to restore services, which the committee alleges began to be cut back after the 
peace accord was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. agency gives medical, educational and social services to about 2.5 
million refugees in the occupied territories, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. Khader 
and other committee members insist that its services to refugees have been 
declining since the PLO signed the Oslo accord. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brian Mitchell, the U.N. agency's acting director in the West Bank, 
dismissed the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all hooey," he said in an interview, adding that his agency "will 
continue to provide its services as long as the refugee problem remains 
unresolved." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a budget crisis, Mitchell said, that has prevented it from expanding 
its services for two years and forced it to freeze hiring staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But it continues to spend $330 million annually on refugees and will do so for 
the foreseeable future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the agency's budget has been augmented, in one sense, by the peace 
accord: Donor states have funded a $90-million program that is supposed to go 
to development projects in the West Bank and Gaza.

CUBA CRISIS GROWS AS CASTRO TRIES TO CRACK DOWN ON GROWING DISSENT; CARIBBEAN: 
SOME ANALYSTS FEAR TENSION COULD ERUPT IN VIOLENCE. SECRET OPPOSITION CELLS 
REPORTED THROUGHOUT COUNTRY.

 Facing intensified popular discontent bordering on resistance, and caught 
between conflicting demands by hard-liners and reformers, Fidel Castro is 
falling deeper into a crisis likely to leave Cuba either more repressive than 
ever or in the agony of civil violence, foreign experts and Cuban sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The country appears placid at the moment, with superficial signs of a slightly 
improved life style resulting from more electricity and gasoline and a stronger 
peso. But interviews with diplomats, military experts and dozens of Cuban 
sources in Havana and the countryside indicate a society barely under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "One can never predict Cuba," said a European diplomat from a country 
generally friendly to Castro, "but I think one can say with assurance that 
there will be dramatic changes here within two years. . . . If I have to 
predict, I would say that Castro will be able to keep his system only by 
increasing repression. If he doesn't crack down I don't see how he can keep 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all the experts and observers say the problem, as it has been since 
Cuba entered crisis with the collapse of its patron Soviet Union in 1989, will 
be economic. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro continues to permit some reformist tinkering, including a minor 
expansion of Cuba's tiny self-employed sector and creation of semi-private food 
and small goods markets. But almost every foreign economist here agrees it is a 
half-hearted patch that won't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Industrial capacity is about 20%," said an economist with an international 
organization. "Real productivity doesn't really exist. Even tourism is so 
inefficiently run that its profits are about 70% short of what they ought to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, others said, is the predicted failure of the next sugar crop, "which 
could drop to close to 3 million (metric tons), and that would be a crushing, 
even disastrous thing," a European diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its best days, the sugar harvest was 8 million metric tons, even 10 million 
metric tons. But a combination of poor planning and horrid weather has left 
Cuba with less than half that. The last crop dropped to 4.3 million metric 
tons, severely restricting the country's ability to obtain foreign currency. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all this continues and Castro continues blocking meaningful economic 
reform, the public won't stand by, and neither will Castro," the European 
diplomat said. "If there is another round of riots like last summer, you will 
see a far tougher reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 To many dissidents, the added repression is already under way. Anti-Castro 
human rights groups report heavy harassment, including arbitrary arrests, 
constant surveillance and economic punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who join us or attend our meetings are losing their jobs," said a 
woman who leads a semi-clandestine dissident group. "When I tried to attend a 
meeting I was invited to by the Canadian Embassy, I was detained and kept in 
jail for a day. Even my friends and a nephew who are dissidents are being 
punished just because they know me or are related." 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights officers in several embassies support the assessment of increased 
repression, with one diplomat saying at least 44 dissidents were arrested in 
October, with some held for up to three weeks without charge or hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, according to another diplomat, is the economic punishment. "It is 
difficult to live here in the best of times," he said. "Now, if you are 
suspected of opposition, you will lose what little support you had, your job, 
your house. If you turn to family or friends, then they'll be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a quiet repression," the diplomat said, "but it's harsh and getting more 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 A diplomat from another country with relatively good relations here agreed 
that Castro is cracking down hard but said an even heavier government hand 
isn't likely to stop the crisis and may even backfire. If Castro "doesn't 
tighten the screws and doesn't really reform (the economy), what we saw last 
summer will be a frolic compared to the popular anger that is bound to occur," 
the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to sometimes violent protests and demonstrations that began 
in April, were repeated throughout the summer and climaxed with more than 
30,000 Cubans setting out for the United States in every imaginable sea-going 
conveyance. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro let them go then, even encouraging the departures in an effort to 
embarrass the United States and force negotiations on ending a three-decade 
economic embargo. Most experts now expect him to crack down on any renewed 
public dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," said the same diplomat, "if he really moves toward totalitarian 
control, he's likely to set off an earthquake of discontent that could end in 
violent opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 A former Communist Party leader in Santiago, the country's second largest city 
and traditionally a focus of Castro support, observed: "I never thought I would 
see it and I never thought I wanted to see it, but Fidel is losing Cuba." 
</P>
<P>
 This man, recently removed as a local party first secretary by the army, asked 
not to be named. But he said the discontent in his region is barely kept below 
the surface and is leading to the creation of dissident groups, including 
secret opposition cells. 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter who spent two days with members of such groups was taken to 
meetings in both cities and in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the meetings occurred in a mountain village between Camaguey and 
Santiago. No weapons were evident and the six dissidents said they had no plans 
for an armed revolt, at least not in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want right now is simply to create organizations," said the former 
Communist. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are following Fidel's pattern," he said, explaining that the dissidents 
were building a popular following through creation of small, semi-secret cells. 
"As the people become more and more discontented, they know we will be here 
with a framework of opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 He would not say how many people belonged to his group or how many cells 
existed. "We don't even have a name right now," he said. "We're just people who 
think the revolution has been betrayed and Castro has failed." 
</P>
<P>
 The leader, a man in his early 40s who did all the talking, nearly yelled when 
he denied being linked to older, Havana-based dissident groups, particularly 
those in contact with American diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, those people are either fronts for the Americans or they have been 
infiltrated by Castro's security," he said. "Understand, we are not against the 
revolution and we don't want American capitalism. But we are tired of no food, 
no work and we will not accept any more government terror." 
</P>
<P>
 It is almost impossible to judge the strength of the groups, if they are true 
organizations or whether they present any threat to Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 But interviews with private Cuban citizens, as well as the assessments of 
several diplomats and experts, point to a serious increase in public 
frustration and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cojimar, a beachside neighborhood near Havana of shabby, fallen-down 
workers' houses and the site of several earlier violent protests, idle men and 
boys sit on door steps, grumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing here," said Jacobo Alonso, an out-of-work electrician who is 
living on the money he charged to help build rafts for people who set out for 
the United States from Cojimar. 
</P>
<P>
 With several of his friends nodding in agreement and mumbling about getting 
even, Alonso said "there will be a next time when the police won't be able to 
stop us. We used to believe Fidel that the (American) blockade was the problem 
and that he would repair things and that socialism would cure all, but that's a 
lie." 
</P>
<P>
 A greater sign of deepening public disillusion, according to some experts, has 
been the deterioration of the neighborhood defense committees established early 
on by Castro. These groups served multiple functions, ranging from outright 
spying on the neighborhood to dispensing ration books to ensuring streets were 
swept and yards were kept free of pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've all but collapsed," said a diplomat who lives next door to the 
chairman of his neighborhood committee. "There are even pigs in her yard. 
Nobody shows up to sweep the streets, and people are just staying away." 
</P>
<P>
 More important in the deflating of the defense groups than dirty streets is 
their loss of authority and importance in the daily struggle for a decent life. 
"The committees are the grass roots of Castroism," said a foreign businessman 
who has lived in Havana for two years. "You couldn't get a (food) ration or 
keep a job if the committee thought you were unreliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, if you belonged and were active, you got privileges," he 
recalled. "That people are no longer afraid or that they find the committees 
ineffective in making life easier means the failure of one of Castro's major 
elements of control." 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of a government that once backed Castro said he thinks that 
all of these developments are combining for disaster: "Castro may survive for 
another year or two or even three, but I don't see how he can do it without 
either real reform or heavy pressure on the people. . . . In the past when he 
went after his opponents, the masses supported him. But now he will have lost 
that support. I think you are looking at disaster."

AMERICAS HAVE CHANGED A LOT SINCE '67 SUMMIT; DIPLOMACY: DREAM OF FREE TRADE IS 
MORE REALISTIC FOR UPCOMING MEETING OF LEADERS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When presidents and prime ministers of the Western Hemisphere meet in Miami 
beginning Friday, tying up traffic and provoking a media feeding frenzy, the 
commotion will be reminiscent of 1967 in Punta del Este, where the last 
full-scale hemispheric summit was held. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three-day meeting in Miami, with President Clinton as host, won't be 
quite like the one in Punta del Este. For one thing, Clinton is no Lyndon B. 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 In Punta del Este, a luxury beach resort on the South Atlantic, President 
Johnson was the lone star of a Texas-scale extravaganza that only an LBJ could 
rustle up. He brought planeloads of equipment and supplies, even his own bed. 
He charmed and amused his colleagues with his folksy ways, handing out watches 
with his logo and bronze busts of himself as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Heriberto Chavez, a taxi driver, remembers that the big Texan moved around 
little Punta del Este in a convoy of oversized American cars, all Chryslers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that, whenever he arrived, his bodyguards got out running," said 
Chavez, 66. "There were three cars, the President's and two for the 
bodyguards." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday afternoon, Chavez was driving his taxi on a street that 
curves around million-dollar summer houses, which he called chalets. He stopped 
at a three-story white mansion with varnished wood shutters, barely visible 
through grassy hillocks and thick hedges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the chalet. This was Johnson's," Chavez said. "There were helicopters 
here. I don't know if there were two or three." 
</P>
<P>
 The house has a little sign with a French name, "Beaulieu," but the owner in 
1967 was said to be of German origin. The White House rented the place for a 
large sum, and Johnson had some of its rooms repainted yellow. Then, gossip got 
around that Johnson's landlord had Nazi connections in his background. "That 
proved a little embarrassing for us," said James Cheek, a protocol officer at 
the 1967 summit and now U.S. ambassador to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, Punta del Este was quieter, smaller, with few of the high-rise 
apartment buildings that today give it a big-time skyline, a la Miami Beach. 
"Communications were primitive," Cheek said in his Buenos Aires office. "We had 
to go over and wire the town." 
</P>
<P>
 Latin America and the Caribbean have also changed since 1967. The region's 
population is nearly twice as big, about 470 million. Its imports have 
burgeoned from $10 billion to $150 billion a year, and it is communicating 
through satellites, computers and fiber optics. 
</P>
<P>
 Another difference between then and now is that many Latin American leaders at 
Punta del Este were dictators, including Gen. Juan Carlos Ongania of Argentina, 
Gen. Artur da Costa e Silva of Brazil and Gen. Alfredo Stroessner of Paraguay. 
In Miami, the leaders will all be elected civilians -- including Eduardo Frei 
Jr. of Chile, whose father participated in the Punta del Este summit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, the Cold War was raging, Cuban leader Fidel Castro was sponsoring 
Communist guerrilla movements in Latin America, and the United States was 
increasingly enmeshed in Southeast Asia. "It was a different world, a different 
summit," Cheek said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there will be notable similarities. Castro was excluded from the 1967 
summit, for example, and Clinton has again left him off the invitation list for 
Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 And an important item on the 1967 agenda, economic integration, will again be 
the centerpiece of discussion in Miami. As they did then in Punta del Este, 
Latin American leaders will again speak enthusiastically about common market 
plans while urging the United States to open its doors wider to their exports. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, LBJ may not have listened to their every word, but he wanted texts of 
everything that was said. Cheek was on the staff that tried to get the texts. 
But many presidents spoke extemporaneously, so American typists had to rapidly 
transcribe tapes. It wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnson demanded instant documents with the speeches of these people," Cheek 
said. "Some of these Latin presidents rambled on and on. And of course Johnson 
didn't take no for an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cheek, LBJ got along well with the presidents at Punta del Este, 
with the exception of Ecuador's Otto Arosemena. In his summit speech, Arosemena 
"started beating up on the United States," criticizing Washington for 
"shortchanging" Latin America on aid, Cheek said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnson just sat there with a scowl on his face," then left his seat, Cheek 
recalled. "He walks over and starts chatting with Frei in the middle of 
Arosemena's speech . . . a really insulting thing to do, but that was Johnson's 
style." 
</P>
<P>
 His style also included jovial backslapping, flattery and personalized gifts. 
Cheek said his gifts to most of the presidents at Punta del Este were Bulova 
Accutron watches with the LBJ logo on them. To lesser officials, he gave out 
the statuettes of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the foreign ministers got busts of LBJ," Cheek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson wanted Latin America's friendship, and he promised to increase aid to 
the region in keeping with plans of the Alliance for Progress, a development 
program started by President John F. Kennedy. "We were going to save these 
nations from communism and the Cuban threat," Cheek said. But the promise of 
more aid was never kept. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, the 1967 summit was unproductive, Cheek said. "Nothing ever 
happened. I can't remember anything that came out of it. . . . I can remember 
stacks of documents that came out of the meeting. We finally just threw them 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 On the key topic of free trade and economic integration, Johnson supported 
plans for a Latin American common market that was to be in operation by 1985. 
"We were on an integration kick then, and it was kind of being viewed almost 
like a panacea," Cheek said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ambler Moss, a U.S. diplomat who attended the 1967 summit, said economic 
integration for Latin America was an unrealistic utopia then. Most of the 
region's countries were protecting national industries with high tariff 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had growing xenophobia and nationalism and even nationalization of 
foreign investments," Moss said by telephone from the University of Miami. He 
is director of the university's North-South Center, which promotes closer 
intra-American relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite LBJ's overtures in the 1967 summit, he was in no position to give 
priority to Latin American relations, Moss observed. "The United States was 
about to become hopelessly bogged down in Vietnam and forget all about Latin 
America for years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, conditions are dramatically different. "The hemisphere is well poised 
this time" for integration, Moss said. Latin American economies are opening up 
to imports and foreign investment, while the United States now sees the region 
as an increasingly important market for U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Subregional economic integration is advancing rapidly. The North American Free 
Trade Agreement has begun lowering trade barriers among the United States, 
Canada and Mexico. Even further along is MERCOSUR, a free-trade area joining 
Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 34 governments to be represented at the Miami summit have been 
unable to reach an agreement on deadlines for economic integration, the leaders 
"will all make a commitment anyway to go ahead and create a Western Hemisphere 
free-trade area," Moss said. And this time, he emphasized, the lofty summit 
goal is realistic.

39 HURT AS PHILADELPHIA TAXI PLOWS INTO CLUB 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A taxi crashed through the glass facade of a crowded nightclub early Saturday, 
slid across the dance floor and struck the bar, injuring 39 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Some patrons were pinned to the floor when the taxi came to a stop in the 
private after-hours club during its grand opening. Others tipped the cab over 
to free those trapped underneath. Most of those hurt suffered scrapes and 
bruises; a few had fractures, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cab driver was one of eight people admitted to city hospitals. He has not 
been charged, but the accident is being investigated, police said.

4 DIE AS NIGHTCLUB BRAWL SPAWNS PANICKED CRUSH ON NARROW STAIRWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Party laughs and reggae gave way to screams of terror as hundreds of youths 
trying to escape a bottle-and chair-throwing brawl squeezed into a nightclub's 
narrow stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Three young men and a 13-year-old girl were crushed to death early Saturday 
and about two dozen people were taken to the hospital with sprains and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden this commotion started, everyone got anxious, they were 
tripping down the stairs and landing on top of each other in layers," said 
19-year-old Aldwin Vega. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities found people stacked four or five on top of each other. Most of 
the victims were treated at a hospital and released. Four teen-age girls 
remained hospitalized in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega made it outside, then helped pull people off the pile at the bottom of 
the stairs where a single door opens on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was stuck under there for about half an hour. I couldn't breathe, and 
people were screaming for help," said Estevan Sullivan, 16. People stepped on 
his head as they scrambled to get out, leaving him badly bruised. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the dead as Sherrita Burch, 13; Peter Perla, 18; Jose 
Goncalvez, 17, and Julio Almodovar, 21. All the victims were from Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
 The party-goers who were crushed tried to escape through the front stairwell, 
the way they had entered the second-story club. Some youths used a back 
stairwell; a third exit off a separate room went unused. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Mark Kurdyla said no charges were filed immediately, but police 
were investigating the fighting, possible overcrowding and underage drinking. 
He said there were no reports of weapons used in the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hundred or more people jammed the El Balcon club, which had been rented 
for a private party Friday night. The club owner told police the legal capacity 
of the room was 225. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz Vargas, manager of Bouncing Babies Productions, which organized the 
dance, said about 200 invitations were distributed, mostly at Elizabeth High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Some witnesses told police the trouble began when one young man kissed a girl 
on the dance floor, and another man became jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas said his bouncers tried to take the fight outside, but a crowd followed 
them down the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things got out of hand outside," Vargas said. "As it got worse outside we 
started pushing the crowd back inside the hall." 
</P>
<P>
 But more fighting broke out inside, and people on a balcony began throwing 
things down at the crowd, causing panic, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas said his 10 security people and 10 other staffers were unable to get 
control.

D'AMATO TO PRESS REOPENING OF WHITEWATER INVESTIGATION; POLITICS: THE LIKELY 
CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE SAYS A SPECIAL PANEL WILL PROBE ISSUES 
CONCERNING CLINTON'S FAILED REAL ESTATE VENTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Signaling his intention to move aggressively in reopening the Senate's 
Whitewater investigation, the prospective chairman of the Senate Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee said Saturday he plans to hold hearings on 
the issue as soon as late January or early February. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.), who as chairman of the banking panel would 
be the Senate's chief Whitewater investigator, said he is inclined to create a 
special subcommittee -- which he would chair -- to handle the Whitewater probe. 
By doing so, he said, senators who are not members of the banking panel also 
could participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater affair has been a nagging embarrassment for President Clinton 
since early in his term and is likely to become even more so now that 
Republicans have assumed control of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 In an early indication of the high priority D'Amato places on Whitewater, he 
and six other Republicans on the banking panel wrote to Whitewater prosecutor 
Kenneth W. Starr last week asking him to investigate whether senior White House 
aides George Stephanopoulos and Harold M. Ickes lied during Whitewater-related 
testimony before Congress last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 While he has yet to receive a response from Starr, D'Amato said testimony 
given during depositions and at Senate hearings raise questions about the 
"truthfulness" of the two men. D'Amato, speaking on CNN's "Evans & Novak" 
program, said his first priority will be to hold hearings on the handling of 
Whitewater-related documents that were removed from White House Deputy Counsel 
Vincent Foster's office after he committed suicide in July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were allegations that some may have been destroyed or shredded or sent 
to various places and were under control of the White House personnel and maybe 
even (First Lady Hillary Rodham) Clinton," D'Amato said. "We have not finished 
and completed that task, and that is what we're going to start with." 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging that he would need Starr's approval before undertaking such a 
probe, D'Amato said he intends to meet with the prosecutor on the subject soon. 
Starr's predecessor in the Whitewater case, special counsel Robert B. Fiske 
Jr., had asked Congress to refrain from holding hearings on that issue and 
other Whitewater matters under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 While the House is seen as the likely body to take the lead on many 
conservative priorities in the new Congress -- such as welfare reform, tax cuts 
and a presidential line-item veto -- D'Amato is expected to move more swiftly 
than his counterpart, moderate Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), who is expected to head 
the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater Development Corp. was a failed Ozarks real estate project 
jointly owned by James B. McDougal and then-Arkansas Gov. Clinton and his wife. 
The central focus of the Whitewater inquiry is whether either Clinton or his 
campaign were improperly enriched by money from the now-defunct Madison 
Guaranty Savings & Loan, which McDougal also owned. The inquiry spread to 
questions of propriety in the Clinton Administration's subsequent handling of 
the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Starr's office is expected to make two Whitewater-related 
announcements early this week in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 One is likely to be the official confirmation of a plea bargain with former 
Associate Atty. General Webster L. Hubbell, a close friend and golfing partner 
of the President and a former law partner of Hillary Clinton. Late last week, 
sources said Hubbell had agreed to plead guilty to two felony charges of tax 
evasion and mail fraud arising from the investigation, making him the first 
major political figure to be snared in the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato said Saturday that he suspected that Hubbell had been involved in 
obstructing the inquiry while he was at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator said if Hubbell has agreed to cooperate with the investigation in 
the plea agreement, it "doesn't bode well for the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 While expressing his determination to be thorough, D'Amato stressed that his 
committee would not be a renegade outfit. "We're going to look to cooperate 
with the special counsel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He declared that he would not pursue a re-examination of the circumstances 
surrounding Foster's death, as some Republicans had requested. D'Amato said he 
does plan, however, to bring Paula Casey, a former campaign worker whom Clinton 
hired as a U.S. attorney in Little Rock, before his Senate panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) recently charged that Casey was appointed 
specifically to derail the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think her conduct was bizarre at the least," D'Amato said of Casey, who has 
resigned her post. 
</P>
<P>
 In other matters, D'Amato said he also would push for early passage of a cut 
in the capital gains tax and would support Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's policy of increasing interest rates to control the growth of the 
economy and inflation -- a policy that has come under attack by Democrats on 
the committee.

CLINTON SEEKS FLEXIBILITY IN FEDERAL PERSONNEL SYSTEM; LABOR: ADMINISTRATION'S 
PROPOSAL WOULD GIVE MANAGEMENT MORE OPTIONS IN DISCIPLINING EMPLOYEES AND 
TRANSFERRING WORKERS INTO NEW JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration wants to give government agencies the right to dock 
a worker's pay for poor performance and extend the probationary period for new 
hires, according to a draft plan to increase flexibility in federal personnel 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals are part of a legislative package the Administration is 
developing and plans to send to Congress early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is designed to revamp the way the government hires, classifies jobs, 
structures pay and awards bonuses. The draft would also make it easier to 
transfer workers into new jobs, a goal that would help agencies faced with 
downsizing and budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's personnel system -- covering more than 2 million workers 
worldwide -- has been widely criticized as obsolete, inflexible and too 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The system also is increasingly perceived as rewarding longevity rather than 
performance, with a bias toward hiring people at low or modest pay, promoting 
them more or less automatically for years and rewarding them near retirement 
with higher pay and a pension regularly adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan attempts to address some of these issues. Almost all of the 
proposed changes reflect recommendations made by Vice President Al Gore last 
year in his National Performance Review report on "reinventing government." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most striking sections in the draft plan deals with what some 
personnel specialists call "deadwood." 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan would create a streamlined procedure to reduce the time 
involved in disciplining an employee. The draft would also let agencies reduce 
workers' pay, giving agencies a disciplinary option other than a mere reprimand 
or the more severe and protracted step of reducing a person's grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one section of the plan -- dealing with labor-management 
relations -- appears headed for controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor-management section would expand the number of workplace issues 
subject to bargaining and require binding arbitration in areas where management 
currently exercises control when union negotiations reach an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Management groups have criticized the proposals, and Republicans, who take 
control of Congress next year, traditionally have been wary of such ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last year, Administration officials and federal employee union 
leaders held extensive discussions on labor law issues. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton issued an executive order instructing agencies to put more 
workplace issues on the table in labor-management "partnership councils." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican victory in last month's elections, however, appears to have 
disrupted the Administration's legislative strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the election, all the parties have put at least this portion of the 
discussions on hold, pending discussions with the new Republican leaders," said 
Elaine C. Kamarck, Gore's senior policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean there won't be some scope of bargaining in our eventual 
proposal. . . .," she said.

ATHLETE DECIDES LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Sikora's wheelchair basketball career ended after 18 years because the 
medications he needs for hypertension and high blood pressure are banned by the 
worldwide governing body for disabled athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 His situation underscores the problems sports officials face when trying to 
police the use of performance-enhancing drugs among the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the innocent become victims. 
</P>
<P>
 During a U.S. tryout in spring, Sikora, of Sarrer, Pa., was tested by team 
officials. He was found to be using the diuretic Lozal and beta-blocker 
Inderal, drugs he has taken for more than 20 years to control medical 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Beta-blockers could enhance performances in shooting and archery because the 
drugs slow the heart rate and help steady the nervous system. A diuretic might 
be used in weightlifting, wrestling or other sports with weight classifications 
because the drugs help decrease weight quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the drugs have no benefit for wheelchair basketball players; beta-blockers 
would most likely hurt performance because those who take it often become 
sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sikora was told the drugs were on the International Wheelchair 
Basketball Federation's banned substance list. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'You're kidding me!' " Sikora recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation started testing in 1993, in reaction to the controversy ignited 
by American star David Kiley's positive drug test during the 1992 Paralympics, 
the quadrennial event that brings together disabled athletes from 16 sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Sikora, 40, did not give up his medicine when it became a banned substance. 
Still, he was allowed to play in a world championship qualifying tournament in 
Brazil last spring because medical authorities granted an exception. But he was 
warned not to use the drugs during further competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sikora tried alternate medications that would have enabled him to play at 
July's world championships in Edmonton, Canada, but they caused an adverse 
reaction. Sikora returned to his regular medications and left the U.S. national 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not going to sacrifice my family and work life for a few 
moments of glory on a basketball court," Sikora said. 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant basketball coach at a suburban Pittsburgh high school, Sikora 
will not try to make the '96 U.S. Paralympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to place my life on the line," he said.

LOS ANGELES CRIME DIPS 13%, U.S. 3%, IN FIRST HALF OF '94, FBI SAYS; LAW 
ENFORCEMENT: L.A. OFFICIALS ATTRIBUTE DECREASE TO ACTIVE NEIGHBORHOOD 
CRIME-PREVENTION EFFORTS, FOCUS ON HIGH-CRIME AREAS, A TRUCE AMONG SOME GANGS. 
</P>

<P>
 Serious crime was 13% lower in Los Angeles in the first six months of 1994 
than it was during the same period last year, while the nation as a whole 
experienced a much smaller 3% decrease, the FBI reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the decline in Los Angeles outpace that of the rest of the 
nation, it was notably greater than the average 6% drop recorded for cities of 
more than 1 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The semiannual decline nationally followed annual decreases of 2% in 1993 and 
3% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials offered no explanation for the trend nationally or locally, 
and they cautioned against too much optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any decline in reported crime is welcome, but the level of crime is still 
unacceptably high and it must be substantially reduced," said a statement 
accompanying the FBI report. 
</P>
<P>
 That serious crime was down in Los Angeles during the first half of 1994 may 
be a further indication that the city's annual homicide mark could drop below 
1,000 for the first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, 378 homicides were reported during the first six months of 1994, 
compared to 532 during the same period last year, according to FBI figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in Los Angeles have attributed the decrease to more active 
neighborhood crime-prevention efforts, greater police focus on high-crime 
areas, a truce among some African American street gangs and a Mexican Mafia 
edict against drive-by shootings, which has cooled tensions among Latino gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Los Angeles authorities have speculated that the drop may in part be the 
result of unusual events in the region, such as the Northridge earthquake in 
January and the World Cup soccer competition last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging the possible contribution of all of those factors, Lt. 
John Dunkin, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department, echoed the 
sentiment of federal officials, saying: "The crime rate is still unacceptably 
high. For example, we'll have 900 or so homicides this year. Certainly we can't 
relax." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald M. Caplan, a former federal law enforcement official who is dean of the 
McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, also offered a note of caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Data collection is not so refined that one can safely predict a trend in this 
area," Caplan said. "Besides, the figures don't tell everything in view of 
frightening new crimes like carjackings and gang shootings that affect so many 
of our neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Demographics may explain some of the modest decline, Caplan and others 
suggested. They pointed to the shrinking numbers of Americans in the 18-to-26 
age group, which accounts for most violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jan Chaiken, an authority on crime figures at the U.S. Justice Department, 
remarked that "people also are working more to protect themselves, which is why 
we have seen a decline in burglaries and car thefts." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI divides serious crimes into two categories: crimes of violence, such 
as murder and rape, and crimes against property, such as burglary and arson. 
Among the violent crimes measured for the first six months of this year, murder 
decreased 2%, forcible rape, 6%; robbery, 4%, and aggravated assault, 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the property crime category, burglary was down 6%, and larceny and motor 
vehicle theft each declined 2%. Arson showed no change. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI also released its 1993 annual publication, "Crime in the United 
States." The final figures showed an estimated 14.1 million serious offenses 
were reported in 1993 to law enforcement agencies across the nation, or 5,483 
crimes for every 100,000 inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggravated assaults accounted for 59% of the violent crimes reported last 
year. Robberies comprised 34%; forcible rapes, 5%, and murders, 1%. Firearms 
were the weapon of choice in 32% of all murders, robberies and aggravated 
assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI said the proportion of violent crimes committed with firearms has 
increased in recent years. In 1989, firearms were used in 27% of all violent 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2.8 million arrests were made in 1993 for all serious offenses, 
with some arrests representing multiple crimes. Of all those arrested last year 
for crimes other than traffic offenses, 45% were under the age of 25, and 81% 
of all arrestees were males. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the Southland in the first six months of 1994, Pasadena recorded 
the biggest drop in its overall crime rate -- almost 20%. The rate dropped even 
though Pasadena recorded the same number of homicides -- nine -- for the first 
six months of this year compared to the same period last year, according to a 
Times computer analysis of the FBI figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Other communities recording significant reductions in their overall crime 
rates were Inglewood -- despite an increase in homicides from 23 to 26 -- 
Thousand Oaks and Garden Grove. Pomona also recorded a significant reduction in 
its crime rate, notwithstanding 24 homicides for the first six months of 1994, 
up from 16 for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks recorded the lowest crime rate for the six-month period among 
big cities in the region -- 1,333 per 100,000 people for the first six months 
of this year, The Times' analysis showed. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Richard Simon in Los Angeles contributed to this story. 
</P>
<P>
 14.1 million serious offenses were reported in the United States in 1993. 
Aggravated assaults: 59% Robberies: 34% Forcible rapes: 5% Murders: 1% Other: 
1% Firearms were used in 32% of all serious crimes.

FUMES CAUSE EMERGENCY LANDING AT AIRPORT

 A Southwest Airlines plane made an emergency landing Saturday morning at 
Burbank Airport after the pilot reported mysterious fumes that forced several 
passengers to be treated for eye and throat irritation, an airline spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 54 passengers aboard Flight 1067, which originated in Oakland and 
was bound for Burbank, noticed the fumes toward the rear of the cabin about 
10:50 a.m. while the aircraft was 30 miles north of its destination. The pilot 
radioed to request clearance for an emergency landing. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 737-300 carrier landed safely, airport paramedics treated an 
undisclosed number of passengers with oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground officials speculated that a passenger might have been carrying a Mace 
or other aerosol-spray container that discharged.

TOUGH ROW TO HOE; PROMISING FIELD LEAVES PARTNERS WITH BUMPER CROP OF TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When his truck jounces along the rough road past Conejo Ranch, farmer Jim 
Roberts sees a tidy green field of baby vegetables -- the same kind of wispy, 
hopeful bloom that cloaked the field one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the Ventura County field looks just as it did last fall, Roberts 
views it differently. Where he once saw rich dirt and ripe potential, he now 
sees pain, frustration and anger. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been that kind of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they planted the first seeds during Thanksgiving week of 1993, Roberts 
and partners Craig Underwood and Minos Athanassiadis have had to deal with an 
astounding pileup of troubles on their 60-acre field just outside Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 They have skirmished with neighbors irate about a giant, stinking compost heap 
on a corner of their property. They have battled biologists who declared 
one-third of their field a federally protected wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 They have watched part of a fantastic corn crop wither in the field when they 
could not unload the ears at decent prices. And they have struggled to find 
markets in a ruthless industry dominated by a few agribusiness giants. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is on top of the standard farming foes of fickle weather, faltering 
markets and ferocious pests. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, they cooed and clucked over Conejo Ranch as though it were a 
newborn; this year, they anguish and fret over the field as though it were a 
juvenile delinquent. A thieving delinquent at that: The field lost $50,000 in 
its first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The crush of woes, Roberts mused, "changes the way you look at the land." 
</P>
<P>
 In the year's worst blow, the Environmental Protection Agency recently 
determined that the farmers destroyed 23 acres of valuable wetland when they 
clear-cut, drained and leveled Conejo Ranch to prepare it for planting. 
</P>
<P>
 To atone, the partners must either restore the field to its natural state or 
enhance a torn-up wetland elsewhere in the county. They will probably negotiate 
a deal with the EPA over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
 The tab could swing from less than $100,000 to more than $2 million, depending 
on the project, according to wetland consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet all three partners fiercely believe they will survive. They figure they 
will do just fine if they keep doing what they have been doing. And that 
includes farming Conejo Ranch, carrying it along from season to season, 
struggling through the bad times and waiting for the good. 
</P>
<P>
 As Roberts explained, "That's farming." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Conejo Ranch is the only property they own, the partners rent 22 other 
fields in Ventura County, so they have backup sources of cash. They now grow 
100 different vegetables, from purple radishes to yellow potatoes to black-eyed 
beans, so they can keep revenue flowing even if a few crops fail. They also 
have stoic, steady personalities on their side, helping them endure. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys all have such stellar characters," said Rex Laird, executive 
director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. Praising the partners' buoyancy 
through turbulence, he added: "Can you imagine if this happened to someone who 
was just mediocre?" 
</P>
<P>
 What happens, of course, is that many farmers fail -- mediocre or not. Fewer 
Farms 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent U.S. census disclosed that the number of farms in the United 
States has dropped below 2 million for the first time since the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, about 2 million acres of agricultural land vanish each year, the 
rich soil banished under the concrete crust of development. Ventura County 
alone lost about 900 acres a year between 1984 and 1990, according to state 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Underwood Ranches partners first tilled Conejo Ranch just one year 
ago, they have watched the wood-and-steel skeletons of two factory outlet malls 
and a mega-plex movie theater sprout on the prime farmland of the Oxnard Plain. 
And developers have proposed building everything from affordable homes to an 
exotic-animal zoo in the agricultural greenbelts that stretch between local 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of people who are making a living from farming is decreasing," 
said Eric Vink of the American Farmland Trust, a national conservation group. 
</P>
<P>
 In launching Conejo Ranch, the partners were aware of the gamble. They were 
aware, and they were proud: proud of saving a parcel from development, proud of 
coaxing an abandoned lot back into food production. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 60-acre field, tucked between scrub-spotted hills and a plant-lined 
creek, had lain vacant for a decade before the partners bought it in the spring 
of 1993. During that long fallow spell, the land had sprouted billowing willows 
and scrubby underbrush. The tangled vegetation had beckoned quail, coyote, even 
a family of mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing the weedy lot as an eyesore, the farmers eagerly ripped out the 
helter-skelter growth and laid down neat furrows, an elaborate drainage system, 
shiny irrigation pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 "To us," Underwood said, "it seemed like we were doing a really good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials, however, took a different view. 
</P>
<P>
 After a six-month probe that wrapped up in late October, biologists from the 
Environmental Protection Agency determined that the farmers had destroyed a 
unique riparian ecosystem that linked the Santa Monica Mountains and Conejo 
Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "It provided very, very diverse habitat -- food and shelter for all sorts of 
animals and birds," EPA biologist Aaron Setran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the ranchers did not know they were tampering with a wetland when they 
sent in their tractors, Setran said, the EPA will not press criminal charges. 
But the government could still extract a crushing toll by demanding that the 
farmers replace the "values" of the destroyed habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agriculture is subjected to lots of risks . . . but it's legislative and 
regulatory action that can put you out of business the fastest," said Laird, of 
the county Farm Bureau. "All the natural disasters we face pale before what 
state and federal regulators can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Long before they tally a final tab, the farmers already consider the EPA's 
verdict oppressive. Just as much as the expense, they resent the implication. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself an environmentalist," Roberts said. "That's why I do what I 
do -- to be outside, with nature. This just doesn't sit right." 
</P>
<P>
 Even local Sierra Club leader Cassandra Auerbach, a stern environmentalist, 
praised the partners for "trying to be responsible." While she mourns the 
destruction of 23 acres of wetland, Auerbach also pities the partners. "It's 
very sad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmers reject such pity. 
</P>
<P>
 They bristle at the concerned calls from friends and relatives. They squirm 
when neighbors troop into their produce stand and gather up bushels of veggies, 
buying way more than they could eat as a none-too-subtle form of charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want anyone feeling sorry for us," Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certain we'll get over this," Athanassiadis added. Profits, Losses 
</P>
<P>
 Getting over it means first bringing Conejo Ranch back into the black. 
</P>
<P>
 The field's inaugural crop of mixed gourmet greens, harvested last winter, 
sold crisply and racked up a $50,000 profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The next crop, however, flopped. Conejo Ranch's summer corn peaked at the 
wrong time -- when the market was sagging. Customers slid out of their verbal 
commitments to buy the corn, and sales tumbled. The crop lost $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the corn crisis hit, the EPA cranked up its wetland investigation. 
Then, neighbors raised a stink about the huge compost heap rotting away on 
Conejo Ranch's southeastern corner. 
</P>
<P>
 As one last torment, the Mediterranean fruit fly invaded Ventura County, 
landing in a Camarillo orchard just miles from Conejo Ranch. For a while, the 
farmers feared the Medfly infestation would trigger a boycott of Ventura County 
produce. Ultimately, the threat fizzled. But the waiting made for a tense few 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunched around a Formica table in their office kitchen one recent afternoon, 
the three partners each sought to come up with an adjective to describe this 
most chaotic year. 
</P>
<P>
 Athanassiadis called it "challenging." Tipping back his chair and grinning, 
Roberts offered up "tiring." Finally, Underwood selected "enlightening" -- only 
a slight trace of irony in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were doing an exceptional thing on Conejo Ranch," Underwood 
explained. "Nothing, it seemed, could have gone better. Then we had the EPA 
come down on us, compounded by the compost heap, the Medfly thing. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you're not rewarded for doing things right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the EPA, the farmers did not do things right. 
</P>
<P>
 Before buying Conejo Ranch, they should have consulted with environmental 
experts, who might have warned them that the moist field, with its clusters of 
cattails and rushes, could fall under federal jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bart Doyle, a Los Angeles wetland attorney, explained: "In California, you 
should always assume some part of your land is regulated, no matter what you 
want to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Ranch partners, however, did not assume they would need federal 
permission to start a farm. And the developers who sold them the parcel did not 
disclose any constraints on the 60-acre field, Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really didn't know it was a wetland," EPA biologist Setran agreed. 
"They're good guys caught in a bad place. But we have to look after the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Setran launched his investigation into Conejo Ranch last winter, after reading 
about the farm's swampy origins in The Times. By studying soil samples and 
examining aerial photos of the field before and after the partners purchased 
it, Setran determined that the farming operation had destroyed 23 acres of 
wetland, a violation of the federal Clean Water Act.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the law would have allowed the farmers to do anything they wanted 
to on Conejo Ranch if they had first drained the water and let the field dry 
up, according to several environmental attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law prohibits only the "discharge" of material into a wetland. That 
covers any redistribution of soil in a wetland -- from digging a ditch to 
churning up earth with a bulldozer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law does not ban other activities that would clearly devastate a 
wetland: chopping down plants by hand, burning vegetation, pumping out water. 
Even plowing is considered acceptable. As long as no soil is shifted, 
landowners can legally destroy a wetland -- and then, once the parcel is dry, 
build or farm with impunity, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, to this day you can do all sorts of things in wetlands," San 
Francisco attorney David Ivester said. Challenge Considered 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Ranch farmers could still challenge the EPA's decision. They are 
tempted. Yet the thought of going up against a federal agency scares them. 
</P>
<P>
 Underwood expects to spend up to $10,000 on preliminary consulting studies 
just to lay out his options -- and he knows an appeal would cost much, much 
more. "(EPA officials) make it abundantly clear that they have unlimited 
resources," he said in frustration. "They're saying, basically, 'We can 
outspend you until you give in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his resources, EPA biologist Setran does hope to avoid a court brawl. 
So, in a low-key call from his San Francisco office this fall, he urged the 
partners to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, the EPA requires offenders to restore two acres of wetland for 
every one destroyed. The agency also may tack on another penalty for "temporal 
loss" -- the number of years the wetland habitat was displaced. And the 
government usually insists that violators monitor any just restored wetland for 
at least five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this case, Setran said, the farmers could "make a big dent in their 
mitigation requirement" by simply planting willows and native shrubs along the 
border of Conejo Ranch. By creating a wetland corridor along the field's 
southern strip, the partners could open up a path for animals seeking to cross 
into Conejo Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 A cheap fix, the corridor would restore the destroyed habitat's most valuable 
feature without cutting into Conejo Ranch's farming operation. "We could do it 
in a way that would barely affect any acreage at all," Setran promised. 
</P>
<P>
 The hitch, however, is that the partners would be left with a federally 
protected wetland on their property for years to come. And for now, they have 
had more than enough of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 To boot the government off their ranch entirely, the partners would have to 
come up with an off-site wetland repair project that would satisfy the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 They could pull the voracious, bamboolike arundo plants from local arroyos, 
for example, and replace them with native willows. They could pump water into a 
onetime pond drained by some previous scofflaw. Or, they could freshen up the 
gentle lagoon at Ormond Beach, home to snowy plovers, brown pelicans and other 
rare birds. 
</P>
<P>
 An acceptable mitigation project "could take as little as turning on a tap" 
and filling a dried-up pond, wetland consultant Glenn Lukos of Laguna Hills 
said. At the other extreme, a massive job, complete with grading and 
excavating, could cost $40,000 to $60,000 an acre, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's open-ended instructions leave the farmers free to scout the cheapest 
way to pay their dues. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever option they choose, they will never be able to compensate Southern 
California for the loss of the Conejo Ranch wetland, scientists said -- unless 
they tear up their crops, plant native species and let the field go wild for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a mosaic to that wetland . . . and you'll never, ever replace 
that," Setran said. "It was unique unto itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich and fertile, the Conejo Ranch habitat was also relatively new when the 
farmers moved in. Before the weeds took root in the early 1980s, the field had 
been worked as farmland for more than a century, trodden by cattle and tilled 
by man. 
</P>
<P>
 In planting Conejo Ranch, the partners fancied they were reinvigorating the 
land by reviving its agricultural roots. That respect for farming tradition, 
however, clashed with the environmentalists' respect for nature, which had 
reclaimed the land with flair in just a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is," environmental consultant LeeAnne Hagmaire said, "whether 
food and fiber have more value than a recently created wetland." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagmaire votes for baby carrots and Italian arugula above two-striped garter 
snakes and southwestern pond turtles. So does Conejo Ranch's planting foreman, 
Natividad Zavala. 
</P>
<P>
 "By working here, we're producing food for this world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As his crew of harvesters crouched under a stormy November sky to pick 
carrots, Zavala added: "Look how many mouths you feed with this field. We have 
to do this to live. Of course, I don't want the animals to die. But I don't 
want myself to die, either." 
</P>
<P>
 To environmentalists, however, such arguments are too facile. Wetlands, they 
note, do much more than shelter animals. They also purify water, filtering 
man-made contaminants through thick underbrush. And they absorb heavy rainfall, 
thereby saving downstream homes from flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of wetlands are so important on so many different levels," said 
Carrie Phillips, a biologist for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. "When 
you're talking about a region that's lost over 90% of its wetlands, 
ecologically speaking, everything counts." 
</P>
<P>
 While they don't believe their field counts as a protected wetland, the 
Underwood Ranches partners are eager to resolve their dispute with the EPA 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although pacifying the EPA could cost a bundle, Underwood insists: "We will 
not allow that piece of property to threaten the rest of our farming 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 To stay solvent, the partners must make regular payments on their $420,000 
bank loan, taken out to purchase Conejo Ranch in the spring of 1993. They 
cannot sell the land to raise cash, not with a wetland designation dooming 
future development. 
</P>
<P>
 So that leaves farming.  
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the field is nourishing its third crop of the year: baby carrots, 
with a sprinkling of red, gold and candy beets tossed in as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the carrots will be sheared of their fluffy tops and stacked in 
plastic bags bearing Underwood Ranches' "Sweet Petite" label. About one-third 
will be sold to markets and restaurants in loose bunches, specks of dirt 
serving as proof of freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 To breed shapely, smooth-skinned carrots, the partners experiment with dozens 
of different seeds each year. Of the 70 varieties tested last season, only one 
is still up for consideration -- and before it wins approval, it must survive 
further trials. Not only must the carrot look good, but it must also whisk 
through the processing machine speedily, without snagging in the gears. 
</P>
<P>
 "This product line is very demanding," Roberts said. "Nothing is ever right 
100% -- we just try to keep improving what's there." 
</P>
<P>
 Counting on brisk holiday sales, the partners are hoping their carrot crop 
will swing Conejo Ranch back into the money, after the $100,000 loss from 
summer corn wiped out the $50,000 profit from last winter's greens. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the season, Underwood was confident the crop would prove a winner: 
"The carrots look excellent," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 But since then, the crop has run into a few snags. An early cold snap slowed 
carrot growth and delayed the second round of harvesting. The feared, 
armor-clad pests known as nematodes invaded, burrowing into plant roots and 
deforming a patch of baby carrots. Roberts is also warily watching for the 
dangerous phythium fungus, which blotches the carrots with black spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Underwood feels comfortable forecasting a decent return for his company 
at year's end. The 22 rented fields bailed out Conejo Ranch's loss on the corn 
crop. And the financial fallout from the EPA probe will wait until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a reasonable year," Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But not a knock-down-the-doors-and-go-to-Las Vegas year," Roberts broke in. 
</P>
<P>
 For enduring 12 months of seemingly endless disasters, the three partners will 
each earn about $70,000. Not a fortune, certainly. But at least they will not 
have to sacrifice their paychecks to keep the farm running this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As Roberts concluded: "There will be a Christmas."  
</P>
<P>
 "A Christmas," Underwood amended, "but no bonus." CONEJO RANCH: THE YEAR IN 
REVIEW 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to sum up the year in three adjectives, the Conejo Ranch partners 
selected "challenging," "tiring" and "enlightening." They could have added 
frustrating, trying and tense as well. But despite some demoralizing setbacks, 
all three expressed confidence in Conejo Ranch and in their business. "We're 
used to the ups and downs of farming," Craig Underwood said. Fall 1993 
</P>
<P>
 After clearing Conejo Ranch and preparing the rich soil, the partners plant 
gourmet greens -- Japanese mizuna, Chinese tatsoi and Italian arugula. They 
also toss in some radishes, bok choy and turnips. Sprinkling up to 2 million 
seeds in a single acre, they plant the field in strips. By seeding a new patch 
every week, they ensure a continual harvest throughout the winter. Winter 1993 
</P>
<P>
 The greens are harvested, washed and tossed into Underwood Ranches' bagged 
gourmet salad. Meanwhile, the partners seek new produce buyers. Most of their 
vegetables are rushed each evening to the Los Angeles Produce Market. From 
there, the produce travels through several warehouses before reaching markets 
and restaurants worldwide. Spring 1994 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Ranch receives its second crop of the year -- sweet, bi-colored corn. 
The farmers also create a huge compost heap using shredded paper and organic 
waste from packinghouses. Meanwhile, the Environmental Protection Agency 
launches an investigation into whether the partners destroyed a wetland while 
preparing for planting. Winter 1994 
</P>
<P>
 The partners are not yet sure what they will plant this winter. Their decision 
will depend on the weather, the market, and the success of harvests gleaned 
from the 22 rented fields they farm elsewhere in Ventura County. Before they 
plant seeds of any type, they must plow the ground thoroughly to bury all 
traces of the potent herbicide they used this fall to protect the carrot crop 
from weeds. Fall 1994 
</P>
<P>
 Corn sales pick up, and the farmers sell out all of their late-season harvest. 
But, EPA biologists conclude that the partners destroyed 23 acres of wetlands 
at Conejo Ranch. The EPA orders the farmers to restore part of the field to its 
natural state or to enhance an existing wetland elsewhere in the county. 
Meanwhile, the farmers plant a third crop: baby carrots. Summer 1994 
</P>
<P>
 The partners suffer a series of setbacks. Neighbors complain that the compost 
heap stinks and demand its removal. The EPA intensifies the investigation into 
possible wetlands destruction. And the corn crop loses money. Unable to find 
markets for their bountiful crop, the farmers must leave several acres of corn 
unpicked.

THE FRAGILE SEX; BY ALL ACCOUNTS BOYS ARE IN TROUBLE. THEY'RE CLOGGING THE

 With straight brown hair, blue eyes and a broad smile, Ryan Arnold had always 
been able to clunk into a room wearing huge sneakers and a floppy T-shirt and 
charm almost anyone. But last year when he turned 12, his temperament shifted. 
His grades plummeted, he started smoking and he took long bike trips along the 
railroad tracks, past the old factories and warehouses in Martinez, a small 
town near Walnut Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Arnold, who had chosen to rear him alone, was shocked. "He had always 
been my little buddy; so good," she recalls. "I had a 20-year plan in mind for 
how his life would go and this kind of behavior wasn't in the blueprint. I was 
scared of him."  
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for Ryan's teachers to suggest that he might be 
emotionally disturbed. His grandfather offered to pay for anything that might 
straighten the boy out: doctors, medicine, even a psychiatric group home. "We 
knew there was something seriously wrong with him," says Arnold. "I wanted an 
explanation, a diagnosis, and I became passionate about finding one." 
</P>
<P>
 A psychologist found to have mild emotional and learning difficulties. He 
became one of an increasing number of American boys -- more than 1.7 million in 
all -- who have been declared emotionally disturbed or educationally disabled. 
This is a particularly male problem, and just one aspect of a crisis that 
frightens parents and anyone else who deals with boys. Emotionally disturbed 
boys outnumber girls nearly 4 to 1. For learning disabilities, the ratio is 
more than 2 to 1. Boys clog the court system, fill juvenile detention centers 
and threaten public safety. Juvenile arrests for violent crimes -- which almost 
always involve males -- increased by 50% between 1987 and 1991. The murder rate 
for teens -- victims are almost all male -- is up 104% from 20 years ago, and 
last year, nearly 7,000 boys between ages 15 and 24 were killed. The American 
boy has become so frightening that many states are moving to lower the age when 
criminal defendants can be tried as adults.  
</P>
<P>
 Experts across the nation are struggling to explain what is happening. In a 
spate of new books, they offer competing explanations -- from absent fathers to 
the evils of technology -- to account for the troubled state of American boys. 
Altogether, the research suggests that today's boys -- deeply distressed and 
tragically misunderstood -- may be victims of their own biology and society's 
confusion about masculinity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a complex issue because there are several things going on that are 
all true," says Dr. Judith Rapoport, chief of the child psychiatry branch at 
the National Institute of Mental Health. Rapoport uses magnetic resonance 
imaging to map the brains of developing children and hunt for neurological 
factors that make boys different from girls. The MRIs can show brain damage, 
differences in the size of parts of the brain and even differences in the 
neurological connections called synapses. Based on what is known, Rapoport 
says, "it's clear that boys' brains may be more vulnerable, and they do get 
these (psychiatric) diseases more often." 
</P>
<P>
 Biology's influence may be significant, but Rapoport also suspects there's a 
strong social component to the troubled-boy phenomenon. Sometimes a boy like 
Ryan Arnold isn't sick. Sometimes he is just going through a difficult 
adolescence at a time when society looks askance at all male aggression. "We 
have to ask if society is more intolerant about males and more ready to label 
them as medical cases," says Rapoport. It is possible, she adds, that 
aggression and other masculine traits -- including many that were once admired 
-- have been so "pathologized" that today Tom Sawyer would be labeled as 
disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Our changing attitude toward boys can be seen in the way young males are 
portrayed in the media and discussed in everyday conversation. Bad men and boys 
are increasingly the staples of television talk shows. And, of course, the news 
is full of male rapists and murderers. Boys are portrayed as the drug pushers 
in public service announcements. They are the danger lurking on city streets. 
Even the simple phrase "boys will be boys" carries a more ominous meaning now 
since it's the title of a recent book about male violence. All this evidence 
suggests that, to some degree, society believes that boys are, by definition, 
bad. In some cases, when the experts send boys to treatment and special 
education, they may be acting out of fear and anti-boy prejudice.  
</P>
<P>
 "Males are now regarded as 'The Problem' and people look at boys as if their 
masculinity is something to be cured, or overcome," says David Blankenhorn, 
author of "Fatherless America," which will be published next year by Basic 
Books, and president of the private Institute for American Values of New York, 
which conducts research and analysis of family issues. He argues that many boys 
are being victimized by adult standards that are heavily freighted with 
feminist politics. "This is especially true in schools," he adds. "Schools are 
institutions run by women in which women and girls are seen as disadvantaged 
and boys are seen as a toxic problem. In school, the goal of getting girls to 
achieve is wonderful. The goal for boys is making them behave." 
</P>
<P>
 While some boys are no doubt misunderstood, it is clear that a great number 
are truly troubled. One measure of this distress is that juvenile suicide, 
always more common among boys, peaked in 1977, and the rate is still more than 
three times the rate it was in 1960. Boys are the subject of broad research by 
social scientists looking at the ways that parents, schools and other 
institutions may be failing them. In the meantime, hard science has begun to 
focus on the difference in male and female brains. Once a neglected area, the 
comparative study of the brain has been energized by new technology and a cadre 
of scientists willing to say that sex differences are real. Some researchers 
are so impressed by what they are learning that they suggest it may be 
biologically impossible for many boys to meet the modern standard of behavior. 
In such cases, they say, boys may be penalized simply for being boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Research scientist Laura Allen begins her study of the brain in autopsy labs 
at hospitals throughout Southern California. A UCLA neuroanatomist, she 
collects brain tissue samples from cadavers and returns to her lab to continue 
her studies on gender differences. During the past decade, Allen has 
contributed substantially to a growing body of knowledge about brain function. 
"It used to be accepted that men and women process information the same way. We 
now know that is not true," she says. "The entire brain is different at a very 
subtle level, at least." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, Allen's research confirmed that a critical part of the brain 
responsible for passing information from one hemisphere to the other -- the 
corpus callosum -- is larger in females. Two other parts of the brain that 
perform a similar function, she discovered, are also larger in women. Other 
researchers have shown that boys' brains mature more slowly, especially the 
frontal lobes, which handle many social and cognitive functions. Scientists 
generally agree that high levels of the male hormone testosterone, which are 
necessary to transform a fetus into a boy, are causing this difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen's colleague, neuroendocrinologist Roger Gorski, has pioneered research 
showing how hormones affect mammalian brains, especially the parts that control 
sexual activity. Gorski has used hormone injections to induce female rats to 
behave like rutting males, and to make males behave like receptive females in 
heat. In normal rats, natural levels of male and female hormones create 
substantial structural differences in the part of the brain that controls 
sexual behavior. "Since sex and aggression are very, very close," notes Gorski, 
"these differences may have an impact beyond sex."  
</P>
<P>
 The effect of biology on intellectual functioning has been widely noted. 
Several studies have shown that scores on certain tests of mental abilities go 
up and down depending on the levels of hormones in a subject's body. Likewise, 
little girls with elevated testosterone levels are more likely to choose the 
toys that boys prefer: sports cars, trucks and Lincoln Logs. But the 
differences extend beyond hormones to the actual functioning of the brain. 
Scientists have discovered, for example, that women use more of their brain in 
the task of spelling than men.  
</P>
<P>
 The research, and her own experience with her son and daughter, have convinced 
Allen that biology is perhaps the central factor in the problems of boys. "I 
have a little boy in kindergarten," she says. "My son is a good little boy, but 
he cannot be expected to be just like a well-behaved little girl. Boys need 
parents to be a lot more understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen is not alone in her assessment. Laboratories across the country are 
uncovering neurological clues to boys' behavior problems. These discoveries 
suggest that some boys are not to blame if they cannot meet our rising 
expectations of civility. "We actually know quite a bit about the brain and 
these behavioral disturbances," says neuropsychologist Ruben Gur, who leads a 
brain study team at the University of Pennsylvania. "Anyone in science who 
doesn't know this must be sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, psychologists and educators have long known that girls excel at 
communication and social skills. Boys have been observed to be more aggressive 
and physical. Girls tend to be more cooperative and reflective. Many parents 
would likely agree with these generalities. Now there's emerging evidence that 
the stereotypical behavior is caused by differences in the brain, differences 
that Gur and others have documented with magnetic resonance imaging. 
</P>
<P>
 The MRI pictures and post-mortem studies show some intriguing variations. 
Females seem to have more gray matter, the active brain cells that perform 
thinking. The rate of blood flow in the female brain is faster, adds Gur, and 
the electrical activity in women's brains also seems to be faster. Also, males 
tend to activate both sides of their brain for a given type of problem, he 
says, while females tend to be "lateralized" thinkers, restricting activity to 
one side or the other. "Stated simply," says Gur, "women run hotter and are 
more revved-up." He theorizes that this extra activity makes it easier for 
women to score high on tests of communication and social skills. Women, for 
example, are much better at identifying the emotions a person shows in a 
photograph. Men, with their ability to concentrate activity in one side of the 
brain, dominate fields such as mathematics, which require this kind of 
thinking. "It's all in the way we are wired," Gur says.  
</P>
<P>
 Different wiring may also explain why boys are far more likely to have 
learning and behavior problems. It turns out that baby boys are more vulnerable 
to minor brain damage -- during birth or because of later injury -- than girls. 
Scientists guess that this is because higher levels of testosterone make the 
male brain less resilient. Testosterone may also delay the development of 
certain spheres of the brain critical to social skills and communication. If 
these areas are injured, boys are less able to heal or adapt.  
</P>
<P>
 It may be these tiny injuries that cause the most common brain disorder found 
in boys -- Attention Deficit Disorder, which can manifest itself in the form of 
failure at school, aggression and even criminal behavior. "A child like this 
becomes frustrated, associates learning with failure and becomes aggressive," 
Gur says. "They are not simply bad boys. It's not that easy. They might have 
ADD and act out in frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 The diagnosis of ADD (formerly called hyperactivity) involves as much art as 
science. Doctors and therapists tend to look for a variety of behavior 
problems, among them fidgeting, distraction, impulsiveness and excessive 
talking. All can get a boy into a lot of trouble at school. But they don't 
necessarily mean that he is emotionally disturbed or a social deviant. In fact, 
the act of labeling a child disturbed or disabled may do more harm than good.  
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are identified as problems in most schools often by the second 
grade," notes psychiatrist John Ratey, who is also a Harvard assistant 
professor of psychiatry. "This happens quickly because schools today emphasize 
cooperative learning and social skills. But these kids can't do it. They are 
identified as a problem and then everybody treats them differently. Teachers 
aren't the same with the kids who aren't so nice. Parents with children in 
these schools try to avoid having their kids placed in the same classroom." 
Often, these seemingly unruly children are reprimanded, counseled and punished. 
Their trouble may be linked to a male tendency toward ADD and other brain-based 
problems. If it is ADD, the stimulant Ritalin may be enough to quiet a boy down 
and keep him on track in school. Teachers and school administrators are often 
the first to recommend Ritalin, and some districts have even gone to court to 
argue that a child be given the medicine by his parents. Sometimes children are 
treated with talking therapy, other stimulants, or anti-depressive drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few years, as scientific findings about brain development and 
gender have reached a wider audience, more and more children are being treated, 
notes Ratey. He ought to know. As author of "Driven to Distraction," a widely 
praised new book on attention deficit, Ratey has helped put ADD in the 
vernacular. "ADD has become the diagnosis of the decade," he says. "It's the 
Prozac of the '90s; everybody's interested in it." Ratey and other specialists 
report a growing number of children and adults coming to them for treatment -- 
drugs and/or psychotherapy -- and finding relief after years of struggling with 
problems apparently caused by undiagnosed ADD. Though Ritalin is not without 
side effects (those include loss of appetite, sleep disturbances and reports of 
slowed growth rates when used for long periods), it's been widely embraced by 
parents and counselors. One measure of its popularity: the U.S. drug industry's 
production of Ritalin has risen 300% since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ratey suspects that many cases of ADD are still undiagnosed and many boys 
misunderstood. "ADD is not the only cause of boys' problems," he adds, "but 
it's a very important factor, and once it's diagnosed and treated, the change 
can be dramatic." 
</P>
<P>
 The diagnosis of a mild attention deficit for Ryan Arnold was not severe 
enough to merit drug therapy. Instead, he was counseled for one hour each week, 
and his mother established a more ordered routine at home. A few months later, 
Ryan's school performance improved. But he remains aggressive, unpredictable 
and fidgety. 
</P>
<P>
 In Martinez, on a Sunday afternoon when he would rather be outside with his 
friends, Ryan is more than a little impatient when his mother invites him to 
sit and chat. He arrives in the room pushing his trail bike and dressed in 
baggy blue striped shorts and a huge gray T-shirt. He leans the bike against a 
wall and looks out the window at the street before sitting down and squirming 
in his chair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me, sir. I don't mean to be rude. But is this going to take long?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan struggles through a few minutes of conversation. In one breath he angrily 
criticizes a therapist he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate Don," he says. His mother cuts him off with an urgently whispered 
"Ryan!" 
</P>
<P>
 A moment later, Ryan offers to massage his mother's sore neck. He recalls 
enjoying school until fourth grade, when he began to feel bored and restless. 
"Right now baseball is my life. My teachers say they don't understand me. I 
don't know why they are baffled. I'm just trying to be myself. Can I go now?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Ryan again looks anxiously out the window, his mother dismisses him so 
that he can join a friend waiting on the sidewalk. After he's gone, Patricia 
Arnold says she does not believe that ADD is the real cause of her son's 
troubles. One of Ryan's therapists, Don Elium, has suggested that the boy 
suffers from a lack of firm guidance and male role models. Boys need to be 
around men who can show them how to contain and control their naturally 
aggressive impulses, says Elium. This makes sense to Arnold, who first learned 
about this theory in Elium's book, "Raising a Son." Elium, a marriage, child 
and family counselor, teaches psychology at John F. Kennedy University in 
Orinda, near Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Elium would say it's not only difficult but also dangerous for a boy to be 
raised outside the company of men. However, with single-mother households 
increasing and divorce splitting half of all marriages, legions of boys are 
coming of age today without a constant male role model. At the same time, 
boyish behavior that was once considered normal -- aggression, defiance, 
mischievousness, risk-taking -- is gradually being redefined as pathological. 
If boys are in trouble, says Elium, it's because too many men have abandoned 
their sons, and adults in general are failing to help boys meet a social 
standard that requires them to be more cooperative.  
</P>
<P>
 "Many women, feminists especially, are afraid that masculinity will run wild 
and become life-threatening," adds Jeanne Elium, Elium's wife and co-author of 
"Raising a Son." "Many mothers are afraid of the aggressiveness in boys. Our 
son began staring me down when he was about 3 years old. I thought, 'Oh, my 
God, what do I do now?' I didn't understand him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eliums believe that many mothers and teachers don't understand the natural 
assertiveness in boys. However, they are often responsible for teaching them to 
be more sensitive and considerate. This is necessary, so that boys can be 
successful, but this civilizing process must be done with great care. Too 
often, they say, boys are made to feel inferior or even disturbed. This notion 
that males are bad is reinforced by a stream of feminist thought that argues 
that women are natural peacemakers while male aggression -- in the form of 
patriarchy -- is the main source of war, pollution, poverty, virtually every 
kind of suffering in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good feminism helps boys with feelings and relationships, but harsh views 
about boys being awful creatures and jokes about testosterone poisoning hurt 
rather than help," argues Priscilla Vail, a New York educator and author of 
books on child development. "Bad feminism has eroded our willingness to respect 
differences in males and females. Boys do need something different than girls. 
And if we start diagnosing every boy who throws a rock through the window, 
we're in trouble."  
</P>
<P>
 "Boys take apart things, they crash around a room, they seem more out of 
control," says Don Elium. The Eliums prize the energy of boys who may seem 
overly rambunctious. They describe that energy as a natural, exciting and 
potentially creative force. The problem is, "boys are often made to feel 
ashamed that they can't act more like girls, ashamed of being boys," says Don 
Elium. "But if you try to kill these impulses rather than mold them, you create 
boys that are either murderous or suicidal." 
</P>
<P>
 He suggests that boys be given more outlets for their impulses. In school this 
might mean longer recesses, to let boys burn off steam. Teachers must also 
understand the difficulties boys have with such tasks as reading, sitting still 
and working cooperatively. Some teachers do try to accommodate boys, for 
instance, by touching them often to calm them down, or letting a hyperactive 
boy stand in the back of a classroom when he can no longer sit still. At home, 
Elium hopes that fathers will play a stronger role in their sons' lives, 
showing them that male assertiveness doesn't have to devolve into brutish 
behavior. Single mothers can also help their sons with this task. But the key, 
according to the Eliums, is found in male role models. 
</P>
<P>
 The vision of a world in which boys have access to the time and attention of 
male role models is appealing, yet, say some critics, it's fraught with 
real-world complexities that make it practically impossible to realize. "There 
are not a lot of wonderful men out there," says New York family therapist Olga 
Silverstein, "and the fact is, a lot of women have to raise sons alone. They 
have no choice. To say they must have men to help is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Silverstein helped bring feminist concepts to the family therapy movement in 
the '70s, and according to the theories she puts forward in her book "The 
Courage to Raise Good Men," with the disappearance of men from their lives, 
boys need more attention from their mothers. "Mothers have abandoned their sons 
because they think they can't raise them well, or they will turn them into 
sissies if they maintain a close relationship. But if mothers pull away, then 
who is the boy left with? No one. He raises himself, and we are seeing the 
results." 
</P>
<P>
 Boys get into trouble mainly because they don't know how to relate to other 
people, argues Silverstein. Mothers who want to create strong and 
self-sufficient sons fail to become attached to them in an emotional 
relationship that teaches them empathy for other human beings. Without empathy, 
says Silverstein, "we wind up with boys who are shooting each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Silverstein's book describes how parents, especially mothers, have trained 
their sons to be highly competitive and self-absorbed. These mothers, eager to 
prevent their sons from becoming "Mama's boys," push them away at an early age. 
"Why would we be surprised, then, that boys turn out to be more violent and 
that men have abandoned the family? We train them to do that, and it works." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of leaving a boy alone, or handing him off to a macho-man father 
figure, Silverstein advises mothers to bond with their sons and maintain a 
respectful but close relationship into adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Kubasek and her son Chris discovered the value of this kind of 
relationship last year. At the time, 14-year-old Chris was sliding into truancy 
and gang activity in the months that followed his father's death from cancer. 
His grades fell, he got into fights at school and he was caught with a knife. 
He also began hanging around with suburban gangbangers in Martinez.  
</P>
<P>
 "My mom and I would fight twice a day. Everything she did drove me nuts," 
recalls Chris, a blond-haired boy who is so tall that an easy chair barely 
contains his arms and legs. "I wasn't exactly nice to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 After her husband died, she and Chris had "talked a lot about his father," 
Kubasek says. "He took me from one room of the house to another, stopping to 
talk about him in each room." But in her grief, she had thrown herself into 
work and the pursuit of a college degree, abandoning her relationship with her 
son. Trying to renew it, she read books about mothers and sons and brought 
Chris to a therapist. They started to talk and she realized how sad her son had 
been. 
</P>
<P>
 As Chris began to see that his mother was serious about trying to restore 
their relationship, he gradually calmed down. Over time, and with the 
intervention of his mother and counselors, he left his gang friends. Now he's 
thriving again at school. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris says his mother's openness was all-important in his decision to restore 
his life. "When she showed me how much she really cared," he says, "it really 
made a difference."  
</P>
<P>
 A close mother-son relationship will produce a man who understands others, 
controls his aggressive impulses and communicates successfully, says 
Silverstein. This kind of boy will be as different in his outlook on life as 
today's girls are different from their grandmothers. "We have broken the gender 
barrier when it comes to girls and careers. They feel comfortable at work and 
at home. Now we have to let boys back into the family emotionally. That's what 
they need. To say that they can't be helped because of their nature is a great 
rationalization. I refuse to accept it, because if you do, there is no hope for 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The help of at least one parent is vital when all of society is conspiring to 
turn boys into brutes, adds Angela Phillips, who fears that men are in danger 
of becoming the "rogue elephants" of the human race, admitted to family life 
for the purpose of mating only. Phillips, who specializes in writing about 
children and family relationships, agrees with Silverstein when it comes to 
boys who have been emotionally abandoned and have no secure attachment to their 
families. But she goes one step further. "Lessons in violence, indifference and 
separation are provided every day for every male child," Phillips argues in 
"The Trouble With Boys." "Learning them is part of learning to survive as a 
boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a boy who is not deemed sufficiently aggressive, who likes beautiful, 
soft or cuddly toys, may be considered effeminate and referred for counseling 
by his parents. In contrast, the femininity of a female child is rarely 
questioned. "A girl can dress up as a fairy princess or wears sneakers and 
jeans and no one will worry about her femininity."  
</P>
<P>
 It should be no wonder that boys are troubled when their natural aggression 
runs up against modern standards of behavior. Surviving as a boy may get more 
difficult as the post-industrial world becomes more complex and brawn becomes a 
devalued asset. Where once a man who had trouble communicating could make a 
good wage in a steel mill, writes Phillips, he is now frustrated because the 
steel mills are closed and he has no aptitude for high-tech work. Some boys 
look at these men and, rightly or wrongly, conclude that the world no longer 
holds a place for them. Phillips argues that poor males who lack communication 
skills naturally seek an identity in the culture of street violence, where 
strength is still valued.  
</P>
<P>
 The sense of failure "is reinforced by the level of information they need to 
process and the high stress levels in modern life," observes Charlotte Tomaino, 
who runs a group practice in New York called Neuropsychological Services of 
Westchester. Tomaino, who has treated hundreds of patients with brain-related 
disorders, says society's rules about acceptable behavior and the skills 
required to succeed are changing too fast for some boys to keep up.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like survival of the fittest, only the fittest will be the people who 
have good impulse control, can orchestrate events, organize things and focus 
their attention," says Tomaino. All these skills appear to be located in the 
frontal lobe of the brain, which develops much more slowly in boys, according 
to some researchers. This could mean that boys are being judged by a standard 
that is harder and harder for them to reach, she says. "Twenty years ago, no 
one had to do many of the things we must now do with technology and 
communication," she says. "Our institutions are more complex and difficult. I'm 
concerned that we're going to have many more of these boys in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The partisans in the struggle to understand boys can each point to children 
who have been helped by one approach or another. Psychotherapists can offer up 
patients who improve with a variety of interventions, from better fathering to 
behavior modification therapy. At the same time, neuroscientists note that many 
boys with ADD improve when their brains are dosed with chemicals, though 
they've not yet found chemical solutions for the wide range of disorders facing 
children and young men. 
</P>
<P>
 While they may disagree about the cause and treatment, none of the various 
schools of research would argue with the notion that boys are in a kind of 
crisis, and that their emotional and educational disabilities burden families 
and communities. Many of those who research and treat boys' problems are 
beginning to see the appeal of an approach that takes into consideration both 
the nature of the boy child and the way we nurture them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even an ardent "hard" scientist, such as Laura Allen, acknowledges that the 
way a boy is raised can overcome certain genetic tendencies. "In a study at 
Berkeley they followed boys who were given lots of attention in the first 18 
months and those who were not," she notes. Years later, the boys who were given 
more affection scored higher on IQ tests. These findings seem to refute those 
who look at IQ and other measures of cognition and declare that biology is 
destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boys seem to benefit from more one-on-one attention," says Allen. "I think 
the affection may change the sex hormone level in the brain, which then affects 
brain development." On the other hand, boys also seem to be more damaged by 
problems within a family, especially divorce, at least in the short run. Allen 
even wonders if boys may be more vulnerable to the loss of parental attention 
inherent with day care. "I worry about day care because infants need a lot of 
cuddling to develop and I'm not sure you can get that kind of nurturing by 
paying for it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the scientific advances, the complexity of human behavior makes the 
diagnosis of and treatment of emotional problems difficult. "You can't just 
treat all these kids with Ritalin and then, because they slow down, declare 
that that was the problem all along," says Paul McHugh, chairman of the 
psychiatry department at Johns Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore. "Ritalin 
will slow almost any kid down. And a lot of kids who supposedly have 
neurologically based ADD can't sit still in school but they can watch TV for 
two hours. That tells me that we're too impressed by our biological discoveries 
and using them to explain things without taking into account other factors."  
</P>
<P>
 McHugh insists that how boys are treated has a much greater effect on their 
behavior than brain structure. "Boys have a genetic influence to be aggressive. 
But if you raise them a certain way, that will assert itself as leadership or 
entrepreneurial skill. If he is raised in another environment that is not as 
nurturing, he may become violent. That is why broken families have more of 
these problems. It's harder for them to provide the right environment." 
</P>
<P>
 A parent who is aware of a boy's special needs can help him from an early age. 
Steve Brooks, a single father of a boy named Brandon, recognized that his son 
needed help when he seemed unable to conform to the rules of the preschool he 
attended in the San Francisco Bay Area. "I got constant phone calls from school 
saying he was unruly and he couldn't concentrate." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon was dramatically different from his sister, Tarren, who had 
experienced little trouble adjusting to school and excelled at working 
cooperatively. "Tarren was eager to please and knew how to do it," recalls 
Brooks. "Brandon didn't have a clue." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he wasn't found to have ADD, Brandon exhibited many of the traits and 
behaviors typical of boys who are. He dismantled anything that came apart, 
including his own toys. He spoke out of turn, fought with other children and 
raced around. "He sometimes would have rages and literally throw things 
around," Brooks says. "It was hard for anyone, teachers included, to have 
enough patience to deal with him." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, at the suggestion of his school principal, Brandon 
received special education classes. He got extra attention from his father. 
Both have helped him learn how to focus on specific tasks, such as schoolwork, 
and taught him how to interact with other children. Now 7, Brandon seems to be 
thriving. But he is still a bundle of aggressive energy. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Sunday morning he scampered in and out of his home half a dozen 
times in 15 minutes. Dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, he was a blur of 
activity, just like the Tasmanian devil on his shirt. "We're building a house 
out there," he said to his dad, his voice filled with excitement. "You should 
see it." The house, made of cardboard, was one of the many projects Brandon 
would tackle that weekend. None would exhaust his energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People expect a level of behavior from kids that is more civilized, more 
gentle," says Brooks. "I'm trying to give Brandon outlets for his energy while 
teaching him what's expected." He takes his son on long hikes and extended 
camping trips. He'll do almost anything to help his son learn the modern 
survival skills of self-control. Along the way, says Brooks, he has come to 
admire the depth of his son's energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say I appreciate him, and I appreciate male power more in general," 
he concludes. "But Brandon has to live in the modern world, and he was running 
the risk of being stigmatized by his behavior. I had to save him from a lot of 
problems in the future."

 We've all seen the beautiful pictures of Japanese homes with their minimalist 
rooms of uncluttered elegance: tatami mats, shoji screens, perhaps a patinated 
tonsu chest, and the tokonoma (alcove of honor) with its hanging scroll, 
burning incense, a flower. Not a thing is out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 But have you ever wondered how ordinary folk live? The cocktail attendants and 
department store employees, painters and construction workers, artists and 
designers? Thirty-eight-year-old photographer and architectural writer Kyoichi 
Tsuzuki shot more than 100 Tokyo apartments of working men and women to create 
his tongue-in-cheek peek into their lives. The book, "Tokyo Style," recently 
distributed in the United States through RAM Publications U.S.A., offers images 
that are the antithesis of the restrained traditional Japanese interior we've 
come to expect, and are a lot more lively. Says Tsuzuki, "In the traditional 
Japanese house, everything was put away. In these Tokyo apartments, everything 
is out. You see people's lives displayed." 
</P>
<P>
 While many Japanese dream of having more space, most cannot afford to. A 
1400-square-foot house in the Tokyo area costs $1.3 million, while the average 
salaried worker makes $37,000 a year. Instead, the Japanese have refined the 
art of living in small places. Tsuzuki dubs it "cockpit living" and extols its 
benefits. "You have everything at your fingertips -- your food, CD, TV, 
computer -- without leaving your bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Younger people especially, who have seen their parents slave to pay for more 
living space, would rather spend money on things they enjoy than on high rent, 
Tsuzuki says. And if your apartment, which averages 680 square feet in Tokyo, 
doesn't have such amenities as a toilet, kitchen or bath, a little improvising 
can take care of that. Neighborhood public baths, restaurants and coffeehouses 
furnish food and bathing, right outside your door. "It's the opposite of L.A., 
where you have to drive everywhere," Tsuzuki says. And while the places may not 
always look neat, "they reflect an energy of living," Tsuzuki adds. Perhaps 
this is what turn-of-the-century Japanese philosopher Ikki Kita meant when he 
proclaimed his vision of the essence of Japanese aesthetics: "Beauty is to be 
found in disarray." Barbara Thornburg

 My memories of Wyn Cooper are few, but good. 
</P>
<P>
 For one summer in my 20s, we were both part of a loose social circle, people 
with whom I spent time generally avoiding work. We frequented a bar called the 
Villager in North Bennington, Vermont, and Wyn was always a million laughs, his 
own loud, higher in pitch than most, and infectious. One night Wyn told us he 
had discovered a quarry. The next day everyone was diving off the 40-foot sheer 
stone walls. Except me. I froze at the edge. I looked down at the clear 
blue-green water -- an impossibly long drop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Promise me I'm not going to die, Wyn," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going to die," he said, then leaped, howling, into the abyss. 
</P>
<P>
 Name five living poets. Think fast. Some of you will blurt out Maya Angelou, 
what with her inauguration address and best-selling book. That's an easy one. 
But who else? Four more. Living poets, remember. Rock stars don't count. 
Neither does Bob Dylan. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's try something else. Name five supermodels. Name five television actors. 
Name five professional athletes. Piece of cake. Now try poets again. Nothing? 
Nada? A blank? Is poetry that outdated and obsolete?  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. But there is one poem that has become part of the national 
consciousness in a way that could change our collective lack of interest in 
American poetry. You hear it every day. You might even be able to quote a few 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sing a few lines, more likely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the campus of Vermont's Bennington College there's a building called 
Tishman, a modern wood-and-steel box built into a gentle, sloping hill. Inside, 
there are rows of tiered benches that are not particularly comfortable to sit 
on for more than five or 10 minutes at a time. At the base of the seats is a 
podium with a microphone. Each sweltering summer, a series of readings takes 
place here under the auspices of the Bennington Writing Workshops. In 1985, 
when I was a student with considerably more idealism than I have now and a 
seemingly unending interest in other writers, I sat on those benches for hours 
and listened to poets, essayists and novelists read from their work. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't Justine Bateman reading a short story in which the main character 
is a cigarette. One night John Updike read a short story. Then another. Then 
another. Almost two hours on the bench and I couldn't feel anything in my legs 
during the reception held afterward. Another night William Styron read. Joyce 
Carol Oates read something about boxing on a particularly hot July evening. 
Tishman Hall has no air-conditioning and Vermont is, I am convinced, the 
birthplace of all mosquitoes. But I was in college trying to become a writer, 
and I'd put up with anything, even convince myself that it was fun to be there, 
on those hard benches, in the humid and stale room, slapping my neck every so 
often to kill a bug. 
</P>
<P>
 One summer a few years back, I found myself in Bennington again, killing time 
and trying to work on a novel at the workshop. I attended few readings that 
summer except those of my friends, people who faced the same kind of life I had 
chosen -- solitary, day after day facing nothing but blank pages and some 
self-imposed obligation to fill them. Most of the time, to tell you the truth, 
I wasn't particularly interested in hearing them. I would have much preferred a 
Xerox copy, to read at my leisure, lying in bed. But I figured that if these 
people were spending so much time alone in front of their typewriters or 
computers, maybe they'd like to be acknowledged in some way, if only by me 
sitting on those impossibly hard benches in Tishman for an hour, the bugs and 
humidity driving me out of my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 This is when I met Wyn Cooper. Then a 33-year-old graduate student and poet, 
he was teaching poetry in a high school summer program, something he's done for 
years. Assembled at Wyn's reading were all of the students from his class and a 
handful of his friends. He wasn't William Styron, after all. Wyn stood at the 
podium, as always in jeans and a T-shirt, looking like neither a poet nor a 
professor. I don't remember much about the poems he read. What I do remember is 
sitting next to a writer friend, Michael Drinkard, who looked at me and rolled 
his eyes when Wyn told the audience that he was going to read a poem called 
"Fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" I whispered to Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's reading 'Fun,' " Mike said, slapping at a bug on his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "So?" 
</P>
<P>
 "So he always reads 'Fun.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And Wyn looked down at his book and began to read. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is now fall of this year and I'm driving down Santa Monica Boulevard, back 
from a two-month trip to England. It's good to be in America, and I turn on the 
radio. There's a song I've heard a couple of times since I got back, and 
they're playing it again, and it is so familiar. "All I want to do is have some 
fun. . . ." It takes me a while, but I make the connection. I call up Michael 
Drinkard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this Wyn's poem I'm hearing?" I ask Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 It is. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one he read that summer?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his favorite one," Mike says. "He reads it every summer." 
</P>
<P>
 I honestly thought I'd never hear "Fun" again. And now I'm certain that I 
won't stop hearing it for a long time to come. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, two writers, Bill Ripley and my old friend Wyn Cooper, sat 
drinking late into the night. Bill wanted to continue, but Wyn reminded him 
that they were both scheduled to teach classes in a few hours, and they had 
better call it an evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want to do," Bill said, "is have a little fun before I die." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyn wrote down the line. He used it as the first line in a poem he wrote the 
next day, a 300-word poem that took all of two hours to compose. Two hours is 
short by his standards, as some of his poems take up to two years to get just 
right. Shortly thereafter, he published a collection of his poetry, including 
"Fun," in a slim volume titled "The Country of Here Below," through Ahsahta 
Press at Boise State University. He went on with his life, pursuing and 
abandoning his Ph.D. work at the University of Utah, then moving to a life of 
teaching at places like Southern Vermont College, Bennington College and 
Marlborough College, also in Vermont. He continued to write, publishing poems 
in small literary journals -- The Antioch Review, Harvard Magazine, Agni, 
Quarterly West. "Fun" was not included in any of these publications. Wyn Cooper 
was, like most other American poets, largely unknown to the rest of us and 
content to stay that way.  
</P>
<P>
 Poets are not usually prone to public lives. Most of the fiction writers I 
know live in a world of agents and giant publishing houses and contracts for 
movie rights. They live in New York or Los Angeles. They're doing serious work, 
don't get me wrong, but there's always the chance that one of us will hit some 
button with the public, maybe even become famous. We're in the game, and 
someone's bound to score. Some of us have. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wyn? Wyn Cooper? He was a poet. Poets, by their very definition, are apart 
from all that. Poets don't play the game. They aren't even aware that the game 
is taking place.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In late January of last year, Wyn gets a phone call from Judy Stakee at 
Warner/Chappell Music, a division of Time Warner. They have a singer who wants 
to record one of Wyn's poems. He was thrilled. "I was so amazed that somebody 
had even read my book," Wyn tells me over the phone. "I've never seen my book 
in a bookstore except for bookstores in towns where I lived or colleges where I 
taught." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Country of Here Below" had a first printing of 500 copies and, at that 
point, not all of them had sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we'll pay you, of course," Stakee told Wyn. "We'll pay you very well for 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 "The most I ever got paid for a poem before this was $100," Wyn tells me. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not inconceivable that "Fun," all told, will bring Wyn somewhere in the 
neighborhood of $150,000; $75,000 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyn's not doing so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I literally was so happy that I probably would have just given it to them for 
free," Wyn says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good thing that he didn't, I say. And Wyn agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The year before, Bill Bottrell, a record producer, had stopped by Cliff's, a 
used-book shop in Pasadena, and picked up a bunch of poetry books, including 
one of the 500 copies of "The Country of Here Below." He brought it to a sort 
of informal weekly meeting he attended, called the Tuesday Night Music Club. 
One of the members, a singer/songwriter named Sheryl Crow, had written a song 
titled "I Still Love You." She liked the music but was unhappy with the lyrics. 
Bottrell showed her Wyn's poem, and bam -- like that -- American poetry took 
one giant step into the mainstream. Crow changed some of the words in "Fun," 
added a refrain and came up with "All I Wanna Do," which sailed to the top of 
the Billboard charts, where it remained in the No. 1 position for weeks. While 
Crow, a former music teacher from Missouri, had enjoyed some success with 
"Tuesday Night Music Club," her first album, the release of "All I Wanna Do" as 
a single quickly vaulted the album toward the double platinum (2 million) mark 
in sales. The song has been featured on "Beverly Hills 90210" and "Melrose 
Place," and was the background music for a "20/20" piece on Ronald Goldman, 
ill-fated friend of Nicole Brown Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm thinking of hitting Wyn up for some cash, but he keeps talking on the 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to see Sheryl play in Boston, and the first thing she said to me was, 
'Did you bring any poems?' " Here Wyn's laugh comes back from the past. "Of 
course I had a huge envelope-full in my back pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 I spoke with a friend of mine, Andy Factor, director of A&R at Virgin Records, 
just to check something that had been nagging me since I found out about all 
this. Is it possible that Wyn Cooper, writing and literature professor at 
Marlborough College, might, through some inexplicable series of events, win a 
Grammy Award? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," Andy told me. "That song has a real shot of being nominated for best 
song this year. Extremely popular. And the songwriters get the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's just the Grammys. There are the awards from BMI and ASCAP, the 
Billboard Music Awards, the American Music Awards. There's a ton of these 
things given out." 
</P>
<P>
 When people speak the name Whitney Houston, it is invariably preceded by the 
term Grammy winner. Grammy winner Wyn Cooper? This, I'm thinking, is getting 
out of hand.  
</P>
<P>
 Wyn's been interviewed by a dozen or more magazines and newspapers, and he was 
going to be the ABC News Person of the Week but was bumped. He's also taken his 
place in the endless stream of pop culture that appears in People magazine.  
</P>
<P>
 "The photo shoot was kind of long," Wyn says. "Four hours. They had me doing 
all kinds of weird things. They like to have you interacting with your spouse 
or your pet, and I don't have either. They ended up taking pictures of me and a 
dead mouse I found in my cabin." 
</P>
<P>
 I honestly was at a loss for words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept wondering why all these people wanted to interview me. The thing that 
I find interesting about all this -- " 
</P>
<P>
 I interrupt him. "Besides the royalty checks?" 
</P>
<P>
 The laugh again. "Besides those. It's interesting because the thing that 
springs immediately to mind is the clash of high culture and low culture. The 
esteemed world of serious literary poetry meeting the crass corporate world of 
pop music. And the funny thing is that it's mirrored in the publications that 
have done pieces on me. On one end of the scale, there's the Chronicle of 
Higher Education and National Public Radio, and on the other, there's me 
holding up a dead mouse in People." 
</P>
<P>
 I tell him something I remember from high school, a day when my English 
teacher asked his students about their favorite modern poets. Names came 
popping up, but it was soon apparent that none of us were very familiar with 
any of them. What about Bob Dylan? the teacher asked. Aren't songwriters poets? 
</P>
<P>
 I ask Wyn the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had this problem over the years in teaching poetry, both poetry 
workshops and poetry-as-literature classes, with students who think Jim 
Morrison is the greatest poet who ever lived. Or that Bob Dylan is, or Leonard 
Cohen. And on paper, those songs don't really work as poems." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't there something to be said for those artists' having made poetry 
accessible? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, yes. The popular music that I like the most is the music that has very 
intelligent words as lyrics. I mean, if you go back far enough, poetry started 
as song. It's kind of nice that it could come back to that, in more serious 
ways. And that's something that I'm really trying to promote. Now that I've had 
this incredible good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask about other poems of his and if he likes the idea of more of this 
exposure. He's been approached by another singer, popular Israeli recording 
artist David Broza, who's now recording in the United States. Bill Bottrell and 
Sheryl Crow are interested in working with him again. "Of course I'd like it to 
happen to more of my poems. I'd like for it to happen to other people's poems, 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Believing that there's a downside to everything, I ask what that could be for 
Wyn. His answer: stress. Is he serious? It's hard to feel bad for the guy. Is 
this awful stress mitigated in any way by the fact that he'll receive many 
times his teaching salary from this one poem? Wyn's too busy laughing to 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about Bill Ripley? What are his thoughts on all this? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very upset because he claims that I should give him one-fortieth of my 
profits because the poem is 40 lines long and he wrote the first line. He said, 
'You know, Wyn, all you had to do was sit down and take my brilliant line and 
write some stupid little poem in two hours, and now you're making all the 
money. I had to pay with my liver.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then Wyn assures me that they're still good friends. Ripley gets some flack 
nowadays because the song is, more or less, about a couple of losers. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you're not losers," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no. The poem isn't really about him. Or me. They're different people. 
They're people you can sort of see as. . . well. . . objective correlatives. 
Symbols of people like us, or what we could have been, or what we would have 
become if we continued to drink and do nothing with our lives. And, 
fortunately, that didn't happen. Bill stopped drinking, and he published a 
novel and I published this book, and everything's going along fine." FUN 
</P>
<P>
 "All I want is to have a little fun Before I die," says the man next to me Out 
of nowhere, apropos of nothing. He says His names's William but I'm sure he's 
Bill Or Billy, Mac or Buddy; he's plain ugly to me, And I wonder if he's ever 
had fun in his life. We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday In a bar that 
faces a giant carwash. The good people of the world are washing their cars On 
their lunch hours, hosing and scrubbing As best they can in skirts and suits. 
They drive their shiny Datsuns and Buicks Back to the phone company, the record 
store, The genetic engineering lab, but not a single one Appears to be having 
fun like Billy and me. I like a good beer buzz early in the day, And Billy 
likes to peel the labels From his bottles of Bud and shred them on the bar. 
Then he lights every match in an oversized pack, Letting each one burn down to 
his thick fingers Before blowing and cursing them out. A happy couple enters 
the bar, dangerously close To one another, like this is a motel, But they clean 
up their act when we give them A Look. One quick beer and they're out, Down the 
road and in the next state For all I care, smiling like idiots. We cover sports 
and politics and once, When Billy burns his thumb and lets out a yelp, The 
bartender looks up from his want-ads. Otherwise the bar is ours, and the day 
and the night And the car wash too, the matches and the Buds And the clean and 
dirty cars, the sun and moon And every motel on this highway. It's ours, you 
hear? And we've got plans, so relax and let us in -- All we want is to have a 
little fun.

CUBA'S MAGIC NUMBERS; LIFE HAS NEVER BEEN WORSE ON CASTRO'S ISLAND. SOME COPE

<P>
 The rocking chair is worn and dilapidated, like the rest of Cuba. Manuel sits 
in the shade of his porch on the outskirts of Havana, overlooking a 
neighborhood of modest homes baking in the August sun. Idly waving away the 
summer's plague of flies, he rocks and waits for a sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing stirs on the cracked and potholed street stretching in front of his 
house. At the corner, a line of people waits endlessly for a bus. Another 
Soviet-made truck roars past, enveloping the queue in a cloud of gritty smoke. 
Across the street, a vacant lot has been turned into a tiny park adorned with a 
pair of benches. A rail-thin drunk staggers into the park and passes out on a 
bench, his arm flung across his grizzled face to block out the blinding sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see anything," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drunk," says Manuel. "Forty-nine." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cuba, everything can be reduced to numbers. To Manuel's practiced eye, the 
landscape is filled with symbols -- sun, flies, line, truck, park and drunk -- 
each of which has a numeric equivalent. If he can interpret the scene 
correctly, one of those symbols might represent that night's winning number in 
la bolita , Cuba's illegal lottery. Every evening, millions of Cubans put their 
pesos down with a local lottery bank and cross their fingers: Tonight may be 
the night! 
</P>
<P>
 From his porch, Manuel spots Julio, his clothes billowing like sails about his 
gauntness. Julio hoves to and settles his bones into a chair. Julio is a 
listero , the man who takes the bets, the lowest-level employee in a bolito 
organization. Manuel tells him about the revelation of the drunk. Julio nods; 
it is a sign. Manuel hands him 10 pesos (25 cents) to put on 49, the number 
assigned to drunk, and 89, the number of the lottery itself, which we have been 
discussing all afternoon. From the folds of his shirt, Julio withdraws a sheet 
of paper, marks down the numbers and gives Manuel a receipt. If the police see 
this simple transaction, it will mean a fine and three to nine months in jail 
for Manuel and as much as four years in jail for Julio.  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 August, 1994, was Cuba's fourth anniversary under the revolutionary 
government's Special Period in Peacetime, the austerity program intended to 
defend socialism after the disappearance of Soviet aid in the late '80s. That 
month also saw the most violent protests against the revolution in more than 30 
years. Rioters smashed the windows of Havana stores and hotels, and tens of 
thousands of unhappy Cubans fled on rafts toward the United States. Since then, 
the tensions have abated but not the underlying problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For most Cubans, life has never been worse. Despite revolutionary rhetoric, 
the socialist safety net has collapsed. The new reality: You need money to 
survive. The only reliable sources of food, clothing and medicine are 
government-run dollar stores. The official exchange is one peso to one dollar, 
but ever-changing black market rates are approximately 40 pesos to one dollar. 
The average Cuban salary is less than $10 a month, and without dollars you 
cannot survive. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, many Cubans have decided to opt out of the revolutionary system, 
to stay home para resolver , "to resolve" life's necessities. Some lucky ones 
have relatives able to circumvent U.S. restrictions on sending dollars to Cuba. 
Others survive by stealing from the state or by dealing on the black market. 
For the rest, tiene que inventar : "You have to improvise." It is never enough. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Many Cubans see only one way para resolver : by playing la bolita , an illegal 
lottery game with deep roots in Cuban culture. La bolita is one of the original 
sins in revolutionary Cuba. To the revolution, gambling is anathema, associated 
with the reviled dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista. Before 1959, on any Havana 
street you could bet on cockfighting, cards, dice, jai-alai, horse racing and 
slot machines, and the fancy tourist hotels housed casinos run by American 
gangster Meyer Lansky and his mob. For Fidel Castro's revolutionaries, Cuba's 
social evils -- drugs and prostitution -- seemed to spring from games of 
chance. Millions in rake-offs supported Batista and corrupted the political 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Batista fled Cuba on Jan. 1, 1959, and within days the new government had 
outlawed all gambling games. When Castro announced in 1961 that the revolution 
was a Marxist-Leninist movement, gambling suddenly became not just another 
crime but a "capitalist ulcer." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, gambling persists. It is a Cuban tradition. The Spanish conquistadors 
broke the monotony between battles by gambling on cards and dice. Games of 
chance were illegal in colonial Cuba, but in 1812 the Spanish crown, drained by 
European wars, decided to establish an official lottery. Soon every man, woman 
and child was buying tickets and dreaming of lottery numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Around 1876, a Chinese shop owner in Havana cashed in on lottery mania by 
introducing Cubans to the mysteries of the 36 numbers game, known as chee fah 
in Cantonese and chiff in Cuba. Every number between 1 and 36 has an attendant 
symbol. The owner would draw the number and its symbol on a sheet of paper, 
roll it up and hang it in front of his store. Anyone who could guess the number 
would win a small jackpot. As a lure, he handed out little verses called 
charadas , which were riddles whose answer was the symbol. At a certain hour, 
no more bets were taken, the paper was unrolled and the winner was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The only complaint of the public was that they suspected the games were 
rigged; it was too easy to switch the numbers. The bankers responded by 
hitching their game to the national lottery; the possible numbers expanded from 
36 to 100. Chiff was renamed la bolita , after the "little ball" drawn in the 
official lottery. Despite the relentless crackdowns since 1959, la bolita has 
managed to survive and even thrive. In the poor neighborhoods far from the 
orbits of official Cuba, it is the residents' passion, their only hope. Every 
evening, the hottest question in Cuba is, " Que salio ?" (What came out?) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On the porch, Julio notices me looking at a string of green and yellow beads 
hanging around his wrist. He tells me it is a sign of devotion to Orula, the 
deity of divination. Julio is a creyente , a believer in Cuban Santaria, the 
religion of Africa's Yoruba people transposed to a New World Catholic setting. 
When the Yoruba slaves came to Cuba in the 19th Century, they hid their African 
deities under the disguises of Catholic saints. One of the cornerstones of the 
Santaria faith is Ifa, the art of foretelling the future. The system of 
divination is based on chance, on throwing shells or nuts and seeing in their 
falls the caminos or roads that will help the followers fulfill their 
destinies. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask Julio whether Santaria can be used to find the winning numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no," he responds. No creyente would use Ifa for something as mundane 
as foretelling the numbers. However, the methods of divination used in la 
bolita may have their roots in Santeria. The signs of the future are 
everywhere; the trick is having the right spiritual attitude to interpret them. 
For many, this state is a kind of religious vision, when you see behind the 
surface of things to the invisible paths of power running the world.  
</P>
<P>
 Julio uses Santeria to enhance that vision: "Luck comes from my head (the seat 
of his deity). I use my head to look for images that can tell me the numbers. 
Some people, when they have problems in life, they sit down to work out the 
numbers, but at that moment they lose them. The problem is, their head isn't 
fresh. Santeria helps me rogar mi cabeza ("to pray to my head"), so the 
inspiration comes more easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogar la cabeza is performed in initiation ceremonies when the mind must be 
purified to prepare it for the seating of the deity. It is also performed if 
the creyente is worried or distracted. 
</P>
<P>
 Julio washes his head in coconut water; the result is clear vision, with all 
the obstacles erased. After one such rite, Julio dreamed of a bicycle (52) and 
found a bill in his pocket with "96" written on it. His vision was clear; those 
were the signs. He won 8,500 pesos.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The streets of Old Havana smell of raw sewage in the heat. Skinny dogs slink 
down the sidewalks, sniffing through scattered piles of garbage. Dirty water 
drips from balconies; shouts echo off slowly collapsing walls. Jobless youths 
in tattered shirts idle on the corners, eyes watching for the police while they 
furtively trade in cigarettes, bootleg rum and a plate of ham sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge, a friend of Manuel, leads me into a decrepit building, its courtyard 
rebounding with the shouts of running children. We climb to Antonio's one-room 
apartment, where the heat hangs in a bluish, cigarette-fueled haze. On a chair 
by the door, a dark-skinned doll is enshrined, with peso notes pinned to its 
clothes and cigars and a glass of water at its feet. This is Eleggua, the 
opener of roads, the trickster god of Santeria. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio sits at his table, chain-smoking. The sweat beads on his brow; there 
is no fan to move the stifling air. On the wall hangs an olive-green cap; a 
sheet of paper covered with numbers lies on the table in front of him. Antonio 
is an officer in the "glorious and ever-faithful" Revolutionary Armed Forces -- 
and a listero . I am shocked; Jorge shrugs and smiles. In one of the ironies of 
the Special Period, even guardians of the revolutionary flame tiene que 
inventar . 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be a listero in order to live," Antonio says defensively. "It's the 
only job I can make money at without robbing someone. As a soldier, I make six 
pesos (15 cents) a day. A pack of cigarettes costs 10 pesos, and I smoke two 
packs a day. Look at me, look at this apartment. I don't even have a fan or a 
refrigerator." 
</P>
<P>
 He yells for one of his children to bring him a glass of water. An old woman 
enters the apartment and pulls out some crumpled pesos. She is playing 29 
because it is her birthday and 12, holy woman, her favorite number. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba has no official lotteries because there are no random events in a 
socialist society. The winning numbers must come from abroad. Every weekday 
evening at 10, Cubans tune their Soviet shortwave radios to the frequency of 
Ecos de Torbe, a station broadcasting from Venezuela. A delirious baritone 
announces the first-, second- and third-place winning tickets in the provincial 
lottery. The last two digits of the five-digit Venezuelan tickets become the 
winners of the Cuban bolita .  
</P>
<P>
 The old woman bets 29 and 12, fijo and corrido , the two most common ways of 
playing la bolita . Fijo is a gamble that 29 or 12 will appear as the last two 
digits of the first place winning ticket, with a 75-to-1 payout. Corrido is 
similar to a show bet at the track; the old woman is betting that the numbers 
will appear in any of the three places on odds of 20 to 1. If she were more 
daring, she would also play parl or candado , betting that she can guess two or 
three of the winners for 800-1 and 2,400-1 odds, respectively. Although the 
largest pot rarely amounts to more than $300, this sum makes the difference 
between a few basic comforts and the grinding shortages of the Special Period.  
</P>
<P>
 Antonio marks the old woman's numbers and the amount of her bets on the list. 
The maximum bet on any one number is about 30 pesos (75 cents), ensuring that a 
run of big wins does not break the bank. The bank has also decreed a few 
limitados , popular numbers on which it will not take bets, such as recent 
winners and holy days. Antonio has an interest in the success of his regulars, 
because he receives a percentage of their winnings. To ensure repeat business, 
he cultivates a reputation as an honest listero who brings his clients un mano 
fresco , "a fresh hand" -- good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At 8 that evening, Antonio closes his list -- no more bets -- and waits for 
his collector, the next rung up in the numbers organization, called the banco , 
or bank. Bancos are as secretive as any Leninist revolutionary party. Above 
Antonio are as many as a dozen collectors, a chief collector and the banquero , 
banker, but Antonio only knows his contact. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief collector takes the lists from his corps of collectors and oversees 
the operation; the banquero provides the capital to cover any losses. Every 
evening, the chief collector brings the lists to la mesa , the table where he 
and his accountants check the lists for winners and divide the money. Often 
only the head collector knows the banquero's identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio claims that he sighted his banquero only once. "I had to visit my 
collector because of a problem with a list. He had a visitor, a man in a 
general's uniform, and told me to wait outside. Afterward, I asked him, 'Who 
was that guy?' 'That was the banquero ,' he said." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio slams the table. "Generals and functionaries -- those are the only 
sons-of-bitches that have enough money to be bankers!" 
</P>
<P>
 He yells at his children: Where is his water? 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many bancos there are in Havana. Antonio claims there are 
more than 100 in Old Havana alone. Assuming an average of 1,000 players 
serviced by each banco , that stretches the bounds of credibility. 
Nevertheless, outside of the Vedado and Miramar neighborhoods, home to many of 
the revolutionary elite, everybody I meet knows how to play, and they know the 
identity of the local listero. La bolita is ubiquitous. 
</P>
<P>
 Between customers, Antonio pulls out of a hiding place one of his most 
treasured possessions: a computer printout of the cabala , an esoteric guide to 
the lottery numbers and their symbols. If the police found this book, it would 
mean an automatic jail term. "Look, even the scientists are playing la bolita 
," he says. (In Cuba, only scientists and a few government offices are likely 
to have computers.)  
</P>
<P>
 The cabala is a guide to finding the winning numbers in your dreams and in the 
events of daily life. Its core is the charada , a list of symbols for every 
number from 1 to 100. The original, the Charada China, is the most widely used, 
but if it does not have the symbol you are looking for, you can try the Charada 
Matancera, Hindu, Americana, Cubana or Oriental. 
</P>
<P>
 New York, banana, pigeon, sea voyage, dream, roller skates, telegram, midnight 
and Havana's Capitol are all designated by the number 87 in the cabala. Antonio 
is fortunate to have a preprinted cabala ; most Cubans laboriously copy theirs 
by hand.  
</P>
<P>
 As we leave him, he is still yelling for water. Later, Jorge tells me why 
Antonio has no fan or refrigerator, why he is so angry. He has gambled big and 
lost. Instead of giving his list to the bank, he told the collector that the 
police had been around, so he had not taken any bets. He kept the list and the 
money, hoping to make a nice profit after paying off his players. But luck 
turned against him: His players won big, and he had to sell the fan and 
refrigerator to cover their winnings. Now he is planning to keep the list 
again, gambling that he can earn enough to buy back his appliances. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In his 1955 Buick, Manuel's friend Carlito and I cruise along one of the ring 
roads linking Havana's suburbs. We are going to see a man everybody says is a 
banker. Dirt streets lead to poor neighborhoods of wooden shacks and little 
children running naked in the yard. Along one of these streets rises a neat, 
two-story, brick-and-concrete house. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls are freshly painted, curtains hang in the windows and a TV antenna 
ascends to the sky. Its owners are Pepe and Nilda, a chubby couple in their 
late 40s. A full-size refrigerator looms in the kitchen, and each floor has an 
enormous Russian television set. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors call it "the house that la bolita built." 
</P>
<P>
 " La bolita is the easiest way to make enough money to raise a family," says 
Pepe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you a banker?" I ask him. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, I'm just a player. I've just been luckier than others." 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest win came from a near accident. He was crossing the street when a 
bicyclist whizzed by, nearly knocking him down and running over his feet. His 
shoes were ruined, so he had to buy a new pair. That night he played 31, 96 and 
52 -- old shoes, new shoes and bicycle -- and won 5,500 pesos ($137.50) 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety-five percent of their neighbors play la bolita , according to Pepe and 
Nilda, even the children. The other 5% are either the rare Cubans who do not 
like to gamble or those condemned to lives with no luck. The local policemen do 
not play; they send their wives to do it for them. The neighborhood still has 
its Committee for the Defense of the Revolution to protect them from 
"subversive elements," but five years of the Special Period have dissolved the 
authority of the trompetas ("trumpets"), the CDR militants who once were a 
constant bullying presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here the rule is stick up for your neighbor," says Nilda. "The trompetas have 
a hard time, because they don't follow the rule. If they try to stop us from 
playing la bolita , we will make life very difficult for them. La bolita is the 
only thing that gives us hope for tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this bravado, they take me up to the second floor, so prying eyes 
cannot see that they have a foreigner in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepe and Nilda are viciosas -- addicts. They live to divine the winning 
numbers. They will even swallow their disdain for the revolution if they can 
find tonight's winners in its designs. They can play Castro, for example. He is 
No. 1 -- but not just because he is el maximo lider . Since his rebel days in 
the Sierra Maestra, he has been el caballo , the horse, and in the charada , el 
caballo is also No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
 "We can also play against the revolution," says Nilda. "If Fidel appears on 
TV, we might play 83, tragedy, the number of the Special Period, because that's 
what he's done to Cuba."  
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone is playing 38 and 65, money and food. Seven is the Virgin of 
Regla (who is also the sea goddess Yemaya of Santeria) and mierda , played when 
a diarrhea epidemic runs through the neighborhood. Ninety-three, revolution, 
has come out a lot this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepe and Nilda offer us lunch: steaming plates of rice and beans, boiled sweet 
potatoes and fried plantains. Nilda brings in a platter of grilled pork chops 
with curves of rib still attached. Following Cuban etiquette, the couple retire 
so the guests can eat in peace. Cubans eat in silence because as children they 
are told that it is bad manners to talk at meals. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, between bites, Carlito whispers, "'Only a banker could afford 
this meal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Julio leaves, Manuel and I borrow a pair of bicycles to pedal a few 
miles out to Raul and Gaby's house. Beyond Manuel's neighborhood, Havana's 
outskirts grade imperceptibly into rural Cuba. The houses become poorer and the 
vegetation lusher, with vivid green banana and fruit trees rising between the 
dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 By the side of a communal refuse pile, Raul and Gaby live in a wooden shack. A 
pig grunts in a pen along one wall, and chickens run in the yard next to a 
small garden. Behind the door, a small cabinet holds two metal caldrons filled 
with miniature iron tools, identifying the owners as devotees of Ogun, the 
Santeria iron deity. Although their clothes are frayed, they have a little meat 
to their bones, and their eyes are bright. Raul and Gaby are surviving. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple apologize for only having coffee to offer their guests. In these 
hard times, one of Cubans' great embarrassments is that they have had to 
curtail their normally effusive hospitality. Raul's and Gaby's jobs ended two 
years ago; since then they have turned to la bolita to earn a living. He is a 
collector, and she works as an accountant at la mesa , the table where the 
bank's nightly business is transacted. They are also hopelessly addicted 
players who spend every waking moment in a quest for the winning number. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8 p.m., when the lists are closed, Raul climbs on his bicycle and begins 
his work collecting. He has less than an hour to visit his listeros , collect 
their lists and count the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The lists are folded into little squares, which he stuffs into a cigarette 
pack for the dangerous journey along the blacked-out streets to la mesa. Two 
types of enemies prey on bolita collectors: robbers, who know collectors often 
carry thousands of pesos, and the police. The police often set up checkpoints 
for random searches of identity papers at night. If they find a scrap of paper 
scrawled with a few numbers in your pocket, you are automatically a player. The 
penalties range from a few months in jail for a player to eight years and the 
confiscation of all his possessions for a banquero.  
</P>
<P>
 Like a mafia family, the banco protects its own by paying the fines and taking 
care of the prisoner's family while he or she is in jail. If Raul is stopped, 
he immediately throws the cigarette pack into the bushes and, if questioned, 
denies its ownership. If they do not notice it, he retrieves it later and 
continues to la mesa. For his risks, Raul receives a flat fee of around 500 
pesos a month as well as a percentage of the profits if business is good. 
</P>
<P>
 By 9, the lists must arrive at la mesa , where Gaby and the other workers 
check for errors, recount the money and wait for the 10 o'clock announcement of 
the winners. Unfortunately, Venezuela is a long way away, and very few Havana 
radios hear the signal clearly. Arguments over what the announcer was really 
saying are the most common cause of bloodshed in the bolita world. The other 
danger of relying on the radio is official manipulation of the airwaves. On 
April 17, 1993, bancos were rocked by a huge number of bets on 33, 9 and 42, 
that night's winners. Raul and Gaby smelled a rat and pulled out their bolita 
bible; they discovered that the same numbers had won on March 11. At 5 the next 
morning, they tuned in to the Venezuela station and heard a completely 
different -- and correct -- set of numbers. The government had taped the March 
11 numbers, inserted the new date and passed the word on Cuba's incredibly 
efficient rumor mill that 33, 9 and 42 were sure things. They jammed the 
Venezuelan signal and broadcast the doctored announcement behind a camouflage 
of static. The huge payouts "exploded" many banks. 
</P>
<P>
 When the numbers have been agreed on, Gaby and her cohorts set to work. Each 
list is scanned for winners, the payouts are totaled and the money is divided. 
The incriminating papers are burned as soon as the work is done, and the head 
collector leaves to distribute the payouts down the network. The oldest 
expression in la bolita is, "The bank loses and laughs; the player wins, and it 
disappears." 
</P>
<P>
 Those rare occasions when the bank has to make a big payout often turn ugly. 
The gamblers expect their winnings immediately, and the penalty for non-payment 
may be death. A banquero's only escape may be to disappear into Eastern Cuba or 
hop on a raft to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask Raul and Gaby why they are not living better on all their earnings from 
the banco. Raul pulls out another sheet of paper covered with figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all the money that my listeros owe me," he says. "They're all 
viciosas , and they keep asking for loans." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the way back, one of my tires goes flat. Manuel's house is more than two 
miles away along a winding avenue. As we walk, night falls, and not a light 
shines in all the neighborhoods we pass through. The electricity is off again. 
Clouds have covered the moon and stars, and I stumble over the cracks in the 
sidewalk. We begin to climb a long hill and now and then hear the whir of 
bicycles coasting by invisibly in the dark.  
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, the sun returns to scorch Havana. Julio drops by, and as he 
and Manuel chat, I can't take it anymore.  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, what were the winning numbers?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Buzzard, bed and doctor," says Julio. "Thirty-three, 57 and 80." 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel shrugs his shoulders. His prediction, 49 for drunk and 89 for lottery, 
is good for three days. He rocks and looks out from his porch. The bench is 
empty, but the line for the bus is still there. He begins to count, one, two, 
three, four . . . 23 people waiting along the curb. It is a sign.

 Like objects in a Proust novel, this year's best gifts stir remembrances of 
holidays past, of colorful packages nestled under a tinsel-covered tree, warm 
candlelight filling a roomful of family and friends, evergreen wreaths scenting 
the air with fir and pine. Recapturing that old-fashioned spirit, these 
presents are elegant in their simplicity and, just as important, modest in 
price. Their rich golden patina is ideal for handsome gift-giving as well as 
festive home decorating. So be of good cheer: It is possible to enjoy the gilt 
without the guilt.

 Aggregate crime in the county dropped by more than 5,500 incidents in 1993, 
compared to 1992. Most of that decline was recorded in two categories, burglary 
and larceny. Violent crimes declined by only about 100. By far the most 
striking difference occurred in Santa Ana, where incidents declined by around 
2,000. There were just over 600 more crimes in Huntington Beach, the city with 
the largest increase. 06,21,08,09,08,10,09 Total Forcible City crime Murder

HUGE PAY JUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding your story on the Thousand Oaks city manager's retroactive pay 
raise: he started in 1978 at $3,458 per month to his present $10,764. I guess 
he has something to be thankful for while we taxpayers are like the turkey that 
I just ate: helpless. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder how many of your readers have been lucky enough to have a 311% 
increase in pay doing the same job. My wife is to be laid off before Christmas 
because the plant that employed 800 in Oxnard will make the widgets at a 
cheaper cost in Singapore. With a science degree and 20 years' work experience, 
companies want to offer her entry-level pay; why should they pay a premium when 
there are 100 applicants for every job offer? But alas, city bureaucratic 
bosses are different. The money is not coming out of their income or company 
profits.

PALM LATITUDES: THE BIZ; HOLLYWOOD PARKS

 Looking for that big break? Think all you need is the right contact? You might 
have better luck at a park than at Morton's. Try taking your toddler (or borrow 
a friend's) and let them break the ice.A guide to who hangs were: 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Lake Rec Center: Screenwriters. Look for the parents with the glazed 
look in their eyes, trying to hold paper cups of coffee while pushing their 
precocious kids in the swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxby Rec Center, Beverly Hills: Producers (and other people with investment 
potential). Their kids' toy cars are more expensive than half the cars on the 
freeway. If you can exchange tips on shopping and private school admissions, 
your career could be made. Visit on Saturdays or you'll only meet the nannies. 
</P>
<P>
 Elysian Park: Cinematographers and production designers. It might be something 
about the lights of Dodger Stadium glowing in the evening sky. Production 
designers have paint on their shoes; cinematographers are always looking up. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Park, Hollywood: Actors. These are without a doubt the most 
attractive parents in town. They look casually beautiful in parent grunge, 
which on them always seems to expose a lot of skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescent Bay Park, Santa Monica: Directors. It's not true that they all wear 
sweat pants and baseball caps; sometimes they wear shorts. You'll know who they 
are by the way they talk to their children: "Let's try going down the slide 
again, this time with a smile." Diana Wagman

PALM LATITUDES: SCENE OF THE CRIME; LOOTING LARGE

 It used to be just towels. Now it's love seats as well. Whereas hotel guests 
once contented themselves with "souvenir" linens, today's larceny-minded 
travelers are ripping off hair dryers, coffee makers, lamps, cable-TV boxes, 
fire extinguishers, small appliances and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are people who look at a hotel stay almost like a shopping 
trip," says Anita Kramer, executive vice president of the California Lodging 
Industry Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Linens remain the hottest items on guests' lists. Renier Milan, rooms manager 
at the LAX Doubletree Inn, estimates that theft-replacement consumes about 30% 
of his six-figure linen budget. Erlene Gaskin, a manager at the Sheraton 
Anaheim, loses 25,000 towels a year. She says she has spent about $80,000 to 
replace missing towels thus far this year. The Anaheim Hilton reports that 
34,199 washcloths left the premises in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 As for pricier items, gaskin says guests who request overnight use of a hair 
dryer "take it almost every time nowadays." Don Boyd, director of sales and 
marketing at Sheraton Universal in Universal City, has noticed a run on irons 
ad ironing boards. And Ann Flower of the Regent Beverly Wilshire recalls that 
when she worked at another posh hostelry, "people took things out of the public 
areas: artwork, tables -- they'd pull them right off the wall." And how exactly 
do people make off with love seats? No sweat, says Gaskin: "People would think: 
'Oh, they're just taking it to clean it or fix it or whatever."' 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels are not quite throwing in the towel. "A guest who asks for a hair dryer 
can only use it for an hour," says Gaskin, "then house-keeping comes back and 
gets it." To decrease souvenir value, hotels are shying away from 
logo-imprinted items. They are also taking sizable deposits from cash 
customers. The L.A. Bonaventure is among many hotels that have secured their 
TVs in massive furniture consoles. "Anyone who wants the TV has to take the 
whole armoire," says security director Bob Schaeffer. Some Hotels are also 
making use of electronic surveillance. Results have been mixed. "I've worked at 
places," says Boyd, "where they've taken the security cameras." Steve Salerno

PALM LATITUDES: WILD THINGS; CALL OF THE FAIRLY WILD 
</P>

 Paul Kenis is a little wolf mad. To the endless distress of his wife, the 
living room decor is wall-to-wall wolf mobiles, wolf plates and wolf 
decanters.He even plays a howling wolf tape; it's not the musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, in his 20-acre back yard high in the canyons above Julian, Kenis has 
created a real Alaskan gray wolf preserve -- the only one in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenis, 51, a biologist and retired Navy marine environmentalist, started the 
11-wolf pack from two cubs back in 1977. As the population grew, he and his 
wife, Judy, a botanist, turned the preserve into the Center for Science and 
Education, a nonprofit, self-funded field station that allows students and 
other researchers to observe Alaskan wolves without having to make a long trip 
north. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most people who keep wolves, Kenis allows his to run wild. "People 
socialize wolves so they can work with them," he says. "It may be fun, but it's 
not natural. Here, in this situation, you see how they really are: timid and 
fearful. They hide and pace and show a lot of wild behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 They don't eat like their cousins in the wild, though; Kenis feeds them 
carcasses donated by nearby ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he is not a conservationist (he's vociferously critical of the Sierra 
Club and other environmentalists), he hopes at some point to breed Mexican gray 
wolves, which are nearly extinct. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he continues to study his wolf pack "casually," he stresses. 
"Most of my stuff is anecdotal," he says. He leaves the hard science to 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Animals in the wild have a beauty that's unique. They're almost a natural art 
form. You can't control them," he says. "The only way they're controlled here 
is that they're in captivity. Judy Raphael

running back Josh Hawkins broke through the left side of the line and took off 
on an 88-yard touchdown run in a Division IX semifinal. 
</P>

 The play was wiped out because of a holding call on Nordhoff, but Hawkins did

 It was the Friars' offense that got them to the final. They had scored only 19 
points in two playoff games but finally broke loose in the second half. They 
finished with 340 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedard scored on runs of two, 39 and 23 yards. His last touchdown, with 48 
seconds left, clinched the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite's defense, which had three consecutive shutouts, was strong again in 
the first half. The Friars allowed only 62 yards in the first half. CHRIS

<P>
By JAMES SALTER, James Salter is the author of Light Years, Dusk and Other

<TEXT>
<P>
 Warner LeRoy, the restauranteur, once sat down to a lavish meal at the Grand 
Vefour, the old favorite tucked away in a corner of the Palais Royale in Paris 
-- superb food, great wine, the works. At the end of it, the headwaiter came 
over to inquire if it had been all right, and was there anything else he would 
like? "Yes," LeRoy decided after a moment. "Bring it again." 
</P>
<P>
 They did, and he ate it, establishing himself, if not as immortal, at least as 
someone to be reckoned with. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is with books about France. There's a wealth of them, but if they're 
good, can there be too many? No. Bring it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you remember the Deux Magots, where the poets argued -- Rimbaud, Mallarme, 
Verlaine -- and Simone de Beauvoir used to come to write? Of course. It's a 
classic, the terraces outside, the chairs, sitting, reading, talking, looking. 
Or the Deux Garcons in Aix, which is almost as well known? Cezanne used to sit 
here, sometimes with his old school friend, Zola. French cafes are a special 
haven, many with an impressive artistic or intellectual history, or just as 
important, social or sexual, and in The French Cafe, which is beautiful if 
light and a bit gushy, there are many to choose from. Let us say it is a kind 
of appetizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Another book of photographs, of a different order, is Henri Cartier-Bresson's 
A Propos de Paris, based on an exhibition at the Musee de Carnavalet in 1984. 
There are 131 photographs, taken over a 50-year period. Cartier-Bresson, who 
started out to be a painter, is the old master of European photography and a 
brother in spirit to the Jean Renoir of "Grand Illusion" and "Rules of the 
Game" -- wise, utterly human. These are black-and-white images with a kind of 
sadness and affection, as well as Cartier-Bresson's customary jewel-like 
clarity; one has the feeling they should not be allowed to lie unseen on the 
pages but should be cut out and pinned to the wall, as in an artist's studio, 
to allow them to continually exert their power. The Paris they reveal in some 
way has vanished, but in another way it will never vanish, in part because of 
work like this. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three new books about Provence, the region, coast and uplands, from 
Nimes through Marseilles, Saint-Tropez and Cannes, to Nice and the Italian 
border: the south of France. It is difficult to think of any place more 
romantic, more beautiful, more celebrated. Colette, Jean Giono, F. Scott 
Fitzgerald and Somerset Maugham are among the many writers who have contributed 
to its fame, and among the many painters there are Bonnard, Matisse, Picasso 
and Cezanne. This is apart from gamblers, opera stars, royalty and the merely 
rich. A friend of mine in a wheelchair went to lunch at Eden Roc for the first 
time, white linen overlooking the blue of the sea, and came back to recount the 
movie stars he had seen. "But, my God, their women!" he said. "What women!" 
</P>
<P>
 All the dazzling photographs in Peter Mayle's Provence are aerial, taken from 
a helicopter, and there are no women, apart from some figures on the beach a 
fraction of an inch high. In English and probably many other languages, Mayle 
has become the voice of Provence, and readers will recognize the light-hearted 
text as his own. There is a tantalizing if not great amount of detail; villages 
you may want to note, such as Pernes-les-Fontaines; restaurants he praises, 
such as La Feniere in Lourmarin (I see it has three forks and spoons in the 
Michelin); and recommended wines, such as Chateau de L'Isolette, which is a 
Cotes du Luberon. 
</P>
<P>
 A more intimate look at some of these same villages, as well as nearly 20 
others, can be had in The Most Beautiful Villages of Provence, a kind of 
large-format guide which, like John Russell's awe-inspiring Paris, you would 
like to take with you, if it weren't too big to pack. There are places such as 
Gordes, perhaps the most perfect of all; Lacoste, the setting for de Sade's 
"Justine" and "One Hundred and Twenty Days of Sodom"; Roussillon, where Samuel 
Beckett found refuge during World War II and also had a nervous breakdown; Eze, 
famous for Nietzsche's residence there in the 1880s, hilltop towns with tile 
roofs and shaded squares, vineyards and olive groves. Though a bit on the 
pretty side, the book nevertheless addresses the practical, with names of 
hotels, restaurants, dates of festivals and open- air markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardens of the French Riviera is one of those books that is interesting 
precisely because of the intensity of its focus. Filled with photographs and 
exotic descriptions, it also has stories: the banker who created an Eden for 
his young wife and later, ruined at Monte Carlo, threw himself into the sea a 
la Norman Main. The names that pour forth! Les Cendres, Villa Thuret, La 
Fiorentina, as well as those of figures associated in one way or another with 
the Cote d'Azur: Cole Porter, Edith Wharton, Baroness Beatrice Ephrassi de 
Rothschild. Every sort of garden is included, from the vast and inimitable ones 
established in the last century by rich foreigners such as Thomas Hanbury or 
King Leopold II of Belgium, to smaller, terraced gardens; intimate gardens, 
gardens to be lived in. 
</P>
<P>
 Baroness de Rothschild named her 17 acres poised above the sea after a famous 
ocean liner, Villa Ile de France, and dressed her gardeners as French sailors. 
King Leopold loved flowers, but that was not all he cultivated; he linked his 
gardens to the property of a neighboring French girl by a bridge of greenery. 
It has been often said that, if you possess the wherewithal, you can be richer 
in France than anywhere on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same vein of narrow subject that manages to cast a broad light is an 
exceptionally beautiful book called The Book of Fine Linen, with text that 
draws on sources as various as Flaubert, Homer, the Goncourt brothers and the 
infamous Abbe de Brantome, whose "Tales of Fair and Gallant Ladies" itself 
deserves as elegant a book. Linen -- sheets, pillowcases coverlets, towels -- 
was once, long before Porthault, a sign of wealth, as well as a symbol, stacked 
in chests or cupboards, of domestic comfort and order. The principal evocation, 
of course, is bed: "The lazy mornings that stretched on after long evenings of 
tenderness," as Zola wrote, and there are glimpses of private life in ancient 
civilizations as well as Europe in the Middle Ages, when the entire household, 
servants included, slept naked together in the same very wide bed. The 
trousseau of 7-year-old Isabelle of France, when she was promised to Richard II 
of England in the 1390s, is listed as "14 pairs of sheets, 12 large cloths, 24 
smaller cloths, several colored bedspreads in velvet and satin, and a few 
dolls." In bourgeois families of the 18th and 19th centuries, trousseaux often 
contained more linen than would be necessary in a lifetime and were passed down 
at death to the children, half-unused. 
</P>
<P>
 "A center of order that protects the house from uncurbed disorder" -- this is 
Gaston Bachelard's description of an armoire with its neatly folded piles of 
linen, and although the true center of a household is probably now the VCR or 
swimming pool, it is debatable if our ideas of living have become more highly 
evolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, encompassing more than France, though close to it in every way, is 
The Oxford Companion to Wine. With more than 3,000 entries and many 
illustrations, it announces itself as indispensable, if only to settle 
arguments. Everything conceivable is covered, including biographical sketches 
of significant individuals, one of them, properly, being Alexis Lichine, who 
wrote his own encyclopedia of wine, and whose book, "The Wines of France," was 
the first I ever read on the subject and remains the basis of almost all I 
know. "The Oxford Companion" describes "The Wines of France" as "an excellent 
primer," which pretty well takes care of my expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 I have drunk many wines, however, and if I am not able to discuss varieties of 
grape or organic acids convincingly, I think of an old, retired doctor I know, 
much-traveled in Europe with his wife as indefatigable guide. He likes to say 
he has seen every cathedral, museum, graveyard and painting in Europe. "I don't 
remember them," he says, "but I've seen them." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Oxford Companion" is there to remedy that.

SEASON'S READINGS; EVERYBODY'S GOT ONE; THE BODY: PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE HUMAN

 "To collect photographs is to collect the world," as Susan Sontag observed. 
The world William A. Ewing has curated in this lovely-to-look-at, 
delightful-to-hold book, is nothing less than the world we all share and in 
which we are all isolated: the human body. More than 350 photographs, culled 
after many years of international research, exemplify the myriad ways the 
all-seeing eye of the camera has regarded the body during the past 150 years. 
Here is the body romantic and repulsive, modified and commodified, constructed 
and deconstructed; images of flesh and folks and of the air turbulence caused 
by sneezing. 
</P>
<P>
 The unfailingly arresting selection is arranged according to an intriguing 
framework; there are sections on the body fragmented, the nude figure, and 
scientific and medical photography of the body, as well as on the oppressed and 
victimized body, the body erotic and political, and as conceived by the mind in 
dream, fantasy and obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 The essays that begin the dozen chapters are erudite guides not only to the 
plates, but to the history of photography. The body has been a favorite subject 
of photographers since the earliest days, and the technology itself has had and 
continues to have profound influence upon the body. The snapshot, for example, 
is largely responsible for our awareness of our own aging, for it provides 
incontrovertible evidence of the passage of time. The major advances in plastic 
surgery techniques were once propelled by war; they are now propelled by the 
camera. 
</P>
<P>
 In medical diagnosis generally, the physician's touch was long ago replaced by 
photography through X-rays and other imaging techniques. Though these are of 
undisputed social value, not all the effects of photography on the body have 
been benign. "Photography is often employed to deceive, to exacerbate anxieties 
and to reinforce stereotypes and prejudices," Ewing writes. Some argue that 
pornography, and advertising and fashion photographs of an impossible ideal of 
slimness and youth, for example, devalue the female body. And it may be that 
the widespread promulgation in newspapers of photographs of the body brutalized 
and in extremis inures us to human misery. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lot here to think about, and a lot to savor, from the cornball 
pictorialists at the turn of the century, to the postmodern masters of the last 
few years. "The Body" would make an ideal gift for anyone who has one.

SEASON'S READINGS; CRIMINAL PURSUITS; CRIMINAL MINDS

<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerome Charyn's Isaac Sidel quartet has a unique place in crime fiction. 
Although set in the 1980s, it depicts an anarchic, decaying Manhattan that 
feels far more appropriate to some acrid day after tomorrow, "Blade Runner" in 
Gotham. In Little Angel Street (Mysterious: $19.95; 274 pp.), Sidel is a few 
weeks short of his inauguration as the mayor of New York, but to get away from 
it all he has been living pseudonymously as Geronimo Jones in a shelter for the 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Then corpses, all insinuatingly tagged as Geronimo Jones but otherwise 
unidentifiable, start showing up at shelters all over town. The corpses prove 
to be linked to a scheme involving babies imported from Romania for illegal 
adoptions. But that's only a minor thread in Charyn's demented tapestry. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone, population and happenings in Charyn's books are in fact harder to 
summarize than an almanac, involving as they do universal corruption, 
misalliances of all kinds, murder, blackmail and real love (usually jinxed). 
The books have the quality of some fantastic limbo between dream and nightmare, 
and serve as dark, prophetic parables of societal dissolution. They are also 
funny, as inventions of a determined incongruity, and perhaps the last 
incongruity is that Isaac is a touching figure, carrying a sadness for all that 
has been lost and the shreds of tenderness that have been saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustrations of people living beneath an airport flight path provide the 
heartbeat of Jack Trolley's Balboa Firefly (Carroll & Graf, $19.95, 262 pp.), a 
multi-stranded, tough and amusing novel set in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 A psycho and a tycoon (who might as well be a psycho) independently plan to 
gun down an airliner on its final approach to Lindbergh Field. The psycho wants 
quiet, the tycoon wants the field relocated so the real estate he's been buying 
up beneath the flight path will shoot up in value. 
</P>
<P>
 Deciphering the plot (there are several murders along the way) falls to what 
the author invents as the San Diego PD's SCUMB squad (Sickos, Crackpots, 
Underwear & Mad Bombers). (Would I kid?) Sergeant Donahoo is its point man. 
</P>
<P>
 Trolley is like a noir voice out of the past, fast-talking, sardonic, heavy on 
action, short on rumination, generating a good deal of suspense, if of a 
who-really-cares sort, and very enjoyable to read. The last, mad collision of 
contending forces is Class A plotting, with a crisp coda in which just desserts 
are tasted. 
</P>
<P>
 William Murray's chronicles of magician-bettor Shifty Lou Anderson at 
trackside are always amusing, atmospheric and affectionate in their view of 
horses and horseplayers. His latest, Now You See Her, Now You Don't (Holt: $22; 
244 pp.) is one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 The her of the title is a gorgeous, elusive person doing public relations for 
a right-wing presidential candidate who uses a race horse as a symbol of his 
valiant, underdog candidacy and who thus commands Lou's curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 A Lou both curious and infatuated is always a sight, and a concern to his 
friends, who believe that infatuation with horses is enough for any man. This 
time more than Shifty Lou's heart is at risk and he ends in the hospital, badly 
whumped. The lady's secrets tumble out, as they will, and they are startling. 
This time Murray has created a character and events that for once overshadow 
the racetrack lore, and give the book an unusual resonance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Llewellyn, a deep-sea sailor himself, has been called the Dick Francis of 
yachting, water being as fecund with villainy as the track. He has written 
several muscular thrillers, among them "Clawhammer" and "Riptide," which 
feature helmsman heroes grappling with both storms and brutish but clever 
enemies. The violence is abundant, the sea stuff as tangy as saltwater. 
</P>
<P>
 Maelstrom (Pocket Books: $20; 402 pp.) is even more ambitiously plotted and 
written than before. Fred Hope, a fighting environmentalist in the Greenpeace 
tradition, is now living quietly, running a small coastal hotel in England. His 
wife is a quadriplegic, a casualty of protest bombing that went wrong and for 
which Hope took undeserved blame and went to prison for manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's drawn back to sea to help a corrupt and stupid stepbrother involved 
with a Norwegian neo-Nazi. Llewellyn runs a parallel story, a half- century 
history of beloved Uncle Ernie, the mentor who was an old lefty, lately 
murdered and somehow connected to the Norway caper. The plot-lines converge in 
a very well-managed last page denouement. Before that, there has been one of 
Llewellyn's trade-marked shipboard battles, this one in freezing northern 
waters, with nuclear warheads as the disputed treasure. A first-rate thriller. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Andrus, a television writer, makes his print debut with Tracer, Inc. 
(Scribner's: $20, 249 pp.). John Tracer, a down-on-his-luck, out-of-work 
husband and father becomes a PI and signs on to, uh, trace a missing Carmel 
teen-ager, whose disappearance involves some quite unpleasant people. 
</P>
<P>
 The jacket describes the book as a mixture of whimsy and darkness, but the 
twain here seem to have the affinity of oil and water. The plot proceeds 
largely by dialogue, which leans toward the folksy or, it may be, the 
whimsical. The prevailing tone is of the sitcom, lighter than air and 
insufficiently involving. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus is obviously a skilled writer, but the darkness is several hues too 
light to engage the reader's interest, and Tracer and family fall short of a 
cozy zaniness that was evidently sought. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) The Year's Best Pursuits 
</P>
<P>
 Lists of "bests" are as quirky and individual as fingerprints . . . but here 
are the 10 mysteries "Criminal Pursuits" columnist Charles Champlin admired 
most this year.  
</P>
<P>
 THE CONCRETE BLONDE, by Michael Connolly (Little , Brown) Third in his police 
procedurals featuring Harry Bosch of the LAPD, this is also a fine courtroom 
drama with a classic plot, featuring the weighted lady. 
</P>
<P>
 DIXIE CITY JAM, by James Lee Burke (Hyperion) One of mystery's best prose 
stylists with a fully-realized hero in Dave Robicheaux, Burke here creates 
particularly nasty villains in pursuit of a German sub. 
</P>
<P>
 THE DYING OF THE LIGHT, by Michael Dibdin (Pantheon) Christie-like characters 
in a ghastly nursing home where the sane plot an imaginary murder as a means of 
escape. Bizarrely, wonderfully ingenious. 
</P>
<P>
 MENACED ASSASSIN, by Joe Gores (Mysterious Press) Often funny ("32 Cadillacs") 
Gores turns serious, using a mystery -- who wants to bump off a scientist? -- 
to explore science, creationism and the springs of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 NORTH OF MONTANA, by April Smith (Alfred A. Knopf) The year's most promising 
new voice, Smith introduced a part-Latino FBI agent in Los Angeles in a drug 
case involving an aging movie queen. 
</P>
<P>
 PERFECTLY PURE AND GOOD, by Frances Fyfield (Pantheon) Sarah Fortune, a London 
lawyer and enchanting free spirit given to nude handsprings on the lawn, 
confronts a batty family and a clever killer. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE WALKS THESE HILLS, by Sharyn McCrumb (Scribner's) A folk legend, mountain 
mysticism and several present plot lines (one a manhunt) converge in a 
masterful, flavorful story set in the Tennessee hollows. 
</P>
<P>
 STRAWGIRL, by Abigail Padgett (Mysterious) Second in an excellent series about 
a social worker fighting manic depression as well as crime, here a child murder 
with an innocent suspect. Thrilling, angry and compassionate. 
</P>
<P>
 TUNNEL VISION, by Sara Paretsky (Delacorte) The author's unflagging series 
finds new social concerns and perils for V. I. Warshawsky amid the (real) 
flooding of Chicago's Loop when ancient tunnels gave way. 
</P>
<P>
 YOU KNOW WHO, by Nicolas Freeling (Mysterious) The most philosophical of 
mysterians, Freeling offers murder and suspense along with wit and musings on 
values, as Henri Castang seeks an Irish diplomat's killer.

SEASON'S READINGS; THE CALL OF DUTY; SOME PHOTOGRAPHERS MOVE FROM CONFLICT TO 
CONFLICT. OTHERS ARE THERE FOR THE LONG HAUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By IRIS SCHNEIDER, Iris Schneider is a Times staff photographer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are endless opportunities for photojournalists to document man's ongoing 
inhumanity to man, from Haiti to Bosnia to the Persian Gulf or the West Bank. 
One must wonder if the world is becoming so inured to violence -- on our city's 
streets or in villages throughout the third world -- that searing images which 
should stop us in our tracks fail to penetrate our bombarded senses. Yet 
photographers will, and must, continue to shoot these pictures, hoping that 
their images will somehow change the world. Witness James Nachtwey's continuing 
documentation of the world's conflicts, Gilles Peress' ongoing chronicle of 
ethnic and religious war with his latest book on the violence in Sarajevo. And 
last year, Annie Liebovitz, the darling of Vanity Fair and vanity portraits, 
found herself shooting black and white in the former Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing in with two hefty and ambitious volumes, Phaidon Press presents their 
latest contribution to the history of the world's conflicts: Allah O Akbar: A 
Journey Through Militant Islam by Magnum photographer Abbas, and Humanity and 
Inhumanity: The Photographic Journey of George Rodger, another Magnum 
photographer and one of that cooperative's founding members. 
</P>
<P>
 A third book represents, on a much smaller scale, another focused effort to 
bring attention to an ongoing struggle: the plight of the Kurds. When the 
Borders Bleed: The Struggle of the Kurds, is a collection of color images by Ed 
Kashi, with Christopher Hitchens providing a written narrative chronicling 
abuses throughout the history of the Kurds, complete with a timeline providing 
historical context for these images. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phaidon volumes, containing over 200 images and at least 300 pages, will 
no doubt end up on coffee tables, since once you get them to your coffee table 
you won't want to lift them again. The black-and-white photographs, refreshing 
in today's world of color images, are rich and gorgeously reproduced on 
luxurious stock that seems to give the books even more weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers got his start during the blitz of London and documented World War II 
through its end with the liberation of Belsen concentration camp. After 
witnessing the aftermath of Nazi atrocities there, he vowed never to photograph 
another war and spent the rest of his career traveling through Africa and the 
world, living with and documenting other cultures. The images in this book that 
were taken at Belsen are the most powerful in the collection. We see a young 
boy out for a walk, strolling past rows and rows of bodies lying in heaps, 
collapsed, it seems, haphazardly as if they simply lost the strength to go on. 
The enormity of this tragedy still boggles the mind, in part because conflict, 
violence, racism and ethnic wars still rage throughout the world. It is as if 
we have learned nothing as history marches on. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers' book chronicles his life of social conscience and adventure while 
shooting and traveling for Life magazine in 1940. Rodgers never achieved the 
celebrity of his colleagues Robert Capa and Henri Cartier-Bresson, but he was 
among those early pioneers of war photography, in the days when it was a lonely 
job. The streets of London during the Blitz were far different from the streets 
of Haiti during our last invasion, where for every shot fired there were 
legions of photographers. Rodgers was alone in London's bomb shelters and 
bombed-out buildings to record the terror and how it affected the lives of 
Londoners. 
</P>
<P>
 His images are less well-known and lack the poetry and elevation of the 
ordinary that Cartier-Bresson's work exudes, there are some memorable, 
essential images of war in this book. It is almost a textbook on the roots of 
photojournalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is interspersed with entries from Rodgers' diaries, and they are 
written with humility and humor. His dedication is daunting, his commitment to 
his craft admirable. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Rodger, Abbas is not interested in the quick hit. Unlike so many 
photojournalists who flit from conflict to conflict, he devoted seven years to 
this volume. He uses his knowledge as an Iranian transplanted to the West to 
bridge the gap between these two cultures, to open the Western mind to the 
breadth and diversity of militant Islam."Driven," says Abbas in the book's 
introduction, "by a desire to understand and expose the internal tensions 
within Muslim societies," his book attempts to humanize and document the world 
of militant Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbas spent the seven years traveling to 29 countries on four continents. Some 
of these images are beautiful for the sweep of the crowd, the sheer numbers of 
people, some heart-stopping for their sadness, sorrow or devotion. There is the 
solitary Muslim praying inside a textile mill in Bradford, England and a page 
full of veiled women at Friday prayer in Jakarta, Java. In an affecting 
contrast, one page juxtaposes women in Kashmir mourning and wailing over the 
death of a loved one, and a young Kashmiri peering from his hospital bed, his 
eyes wide with fear and worry. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbas has written affectingly in the first person about his travels through 
the Islamic world, and for those who wish to understand the passion, pain and 
enormity of Islam, this is a good place to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Borders Bleed" by Ed Kashi is a more modest attempt to educate 
through photography. Obviously inspired by the ongoing struggle of the Kurds, 
Kashi documents the war victims, the refugees, the transplanted. Along with 
narrative by Christopher Hitchens, which includes a history and timeline of 
their long suffering, it includes some powerful work directed at a very narrow 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 These three photographers, to their credit, were not interested in the sexy 
story. These three weren't searching for celebrity but answering to a higher 
calling, truly trying to inform and educate.

SEASON'S READINGS; WHO YOU KNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GLIONNA, John Glionna is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am a book collector of sorts. Over the years, I have come to appreciate even 
the mere physical apprising of a hard-covered book, feeling its weight in my 
hands, treasuring this thing beyond the tale it tells, or the lessons it may 
teach. 
</P>
<P>
 That same eternal quality applies to the telling photograph. Shot in 
black-and-white or in color, the well-conceived image can often surpass the 
power of mere words, making it something you want to possess, like a priceless 
painting. Or youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Together -- book and picture -- they can be a thing of rare beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, a bevy of hardcover photographic collections has hit the 
bookselling market, covering a wide-ranging, eclectic turf: From personality to 
pop culture to plain old commercial schlock. 
</P>
<P>
 There are new books on sports, arts, music and media personalities, such as 
the one that takes us on the road with jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis or on a 
personal journey with golfer Arnold Palmer. There are photographic treatments 
of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis and race car driver Mario Andretti, and 
one that celebrates being gay in America. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a new book combining pictures with the song lyrics of Elton John 
and Bernie Taupin, a picture book on the Beatles, another on the life of 
couturiere Gabrielle Chanel, and a pictorial treatment of the classic ballet 
partnership of Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the one examining the elusive cool of street style in America and 
abroad; an embarrassing collection of schmaltzy photographs concocted by 
Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida -- animal shots superimposed on pictures of 
children; and one that relives the finer moments of the first 20 years of the 
"Saturday Night Live" television show. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are keepers -- adventuresome marriages of word and image. Others are 
well-bound trash. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite of the latter genre, which editors call The Art of Barbie, I call 
the shameless art of holiday money-making. The high -- or low -- concept is to 
ask an international cast of visual artists to answer the question that has 
haunted us all for decades: Who is Barbie? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is a thinly-imagined collection of photographs and paintings that 
include one shot with blurred images of the naked doll itself, entitled "Nude 
Barbie Descending a Staircase." And my favorite, an acrylic painting of a 
thunder-thighed Barb-o-rama gorging herself on a banana split. This one calls 
itself: "Healthy Appetite Barbie." 
</P>
<P>
 In Thomas Hauser's book Arnold Palmer: A Personal Journey, there are priceless 
shots of the old, fired-up Arnie, his private army in tow, as he charges up 
Augusta's green fairways looking like golf's version of James Dean himself. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the poolside Annie, Arnie on an airplane, Arnie blasting out of 
numerous sand traps, a grimacing Arnie missing putt after putt. And best yet, 
there's a picture of Arnie and a young Jack Nicklaus, arm in arm, prior to the 
1960 U.S. Open -- an image that so defines the lost brazen youth of both men it 
makes you want to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 In Out in America: A Portrait of Gay and Lesbian Life by Michael Goff and the 
staff of OUT Magazine, there are priceless color and black-and-white 
photographs that define the gay experience in America with a knowing, 
compassionate eye. 
</P>
<P>
 There are shots of gay partners two-stepping at the Ramrod bar in Boston, of 
men playing scrabble at New York's Gay and Lesbian Community Center, pictures 
of gays and lesbians engaged in sporting and artistic ventures: Boxing. 
Sky-diving. Bronco-riding. Baseball and ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, perhaps, are images of gay and lesbian couples that show 
people in both physical and emotional sync -- embracing in bed, hugging on a 
sidewalk, taking vows of marriage. There are shots of old couples and those of 
the incredibly young -- like the photograph of the two Asian teens celebrating 
the L.A. School District's first gay and lesbian senior prom. 
</P>
<P>
 And just when you thought you've seen every shot, from every conceivable 
angle, of the Fab Four, comes Terence Spencer's It Was Thirty Years Ago Today. 
This collection of black-and-white images, most of them previously unpublished, 
show the Beatles -- and their hyper-ventilating teen-aged fans -- at their most 
innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 The behind-the-scenes photography showing Our Boys at work and at play is just 
the antidote for a musical culture overdosed on pointlessly slick MTV images. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite book of the bunch, however, is entitled Sweet Swing: Blues on the 
Road, a photographic diary of a recent Wynton Marsalis tour. In this 
collection, photographer Frank Stewart's compelling black-and-white shots 
catalogue a jazz musician having fun on the road and on the stage: In smoky 
bars and dressing rooms, with friends, family members and fans. There are shots 
of the musician's expressive face as he blows his notes as well as intimate 
images of the jazz instruments themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Laden with insight and anecdote and a lexicon unique to modern-day jazz, 
Marsalis' text gives syncopation and a sense of rhythm to Stewart's 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like this interplay between Marsalis and another player reviewing a piece of 
sheet music: 
</P>
<P>
 "Say, man, what does this mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It just says 'Veal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "That means be Veal in that spot." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, what do you want?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you hearin.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The words and the pictures, man, make me feel the music.

SEASON'S READINGS; A FAN'S CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HORN, John Horn, the entertainment writer for the Associated Press, 
recently gave up golf. Again. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Thomas' miraculous baseball triple crown and Wayne Gretzky's pursuit of 
yet another scoring title -- that's what sports fans should be discussing these 
days. Obstinate (OK, greedy) owners instead have reduced us to athletic 
co-dependents in recovery, taping monster truck pulls and waking early to watch 
Division II football (Depauw at Wabash with breakfast) in a futile attempt to 
shake our box-score D.T.'s. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball strike and the hockey lockout make the flood of new sports books 
-- particularly those whose vivid prose transports us to the stadium, arena or 
links -- more appealing than usual. Unless, of course, you've given up on 
sports entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the "new" baseball books this Christmas are in fact older works with 
fresh paint jobs and should be avoided (two dated Daniel Okrent reprints try to 
cash in on his appearance on TV's recent "Baseball"). Two other 1994 titles, 
though, are worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 William Brashler's The Story of Negro League Baseball is one such volume and a 
good gift, especially for young fans. Geared for teen readers, the book adeptly 
mixes light social commentary with lively sports history. There's little new 
here, but Brashler has fun. Tracking the era's top stars, he smartly does not 
skip the best personalities and wackiest (and often saddest) stories. Among 
them: Blocked from signing black players, big-league manager John McGraw 
insisted Negro League second baseman Charlie Grant was actually a Cherokee 
Indian named Chief Tokohama. The idea flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Shadows of Summer: Classic Baseball Photographs 1869-1947 is filled with 
several pictures so artistic and emotional Dorothea Lange could have snapped 
them. There's a great shot of a contemplative Honus Wagner picking over bats, 
and a hilarious picture of a muscle-bound Jimmie Foxx squeezing Ted Williams' 
scrawny arms. Donald Honig's text is engaging, too. He tells why Brooklyn 
Dodger manager Wilbert Robinson never played Val Picinich: Robinson didn't know 
how to spell the catcher's name on a lineup card. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf course architect Pete Dye's anecdotal Bury Me in a Pot Bunker follows 
recent, similar works by designers Tom Doak and Robert Trent Jones Jr. and 
compares favorably. Dye's 17th hole at the Stadium Course at TPC is arguably 
the most famous par-3 in North America behind Cypress Point's ocean-carrying 
16th. Designing the island green at TPC was almost accidental, Dye writes, but 
more interesting was the PGA tour's reaction to the intimidating hole and the 
course. After a round on the par-eating track, Fuzzy Zoeller asked, "Where are 
the windmills and animals?" Jack Nicklaus whined: "I've never been very good at 
stopping a five-iron on the hood of a car." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus may be golf's greatest ever, yet it was the more handsome Arnold 
Palmer who brought water hazards and dog-legs into the popular vocabulary. 
Arnold Palmer: A Personal Journey is a fine, well-illustrated account of golf's 
first matinee hero. With go-for-broke shots and horrific swings (lunges, 
actually), the gallery-friendly Palmer gave hope to all those hackers whose 
game never came within a fairway of competency but who enjoyed golf 
nonetheless. Biographer Thomas Hauser doesn't ignore Palmer's famous collapses, 
and his retelling of the Palmer-Nicklaus rivalry is the book's best section. 
</P>
<P>
 Sportswriter Grantland Rice missed Palmer's ascent, but he was there for Bobby 
Jones and his generation's stars: Babe Ruth, Bill Tilden and Knute Rockne among 
them. The informative but overly academic biography by Mark Inabinett, 
Grantland Rice and His Heroes: The Sportswriter as Mythmaker in the 1920s 
chronicles that time when athletes emerged as larger-than-life icons. 
Everything was a little overblown: It was Rice who dubbed the Notre Dame 
football backfield "The Four Horsemen" and called Red Grange the "Galloping 
Ghost." Writing before television could show the public how good star 
performers really were, Rice reeled off superlatives with abandon: Jack Dempsey 
hit harder than any boxer "in all the history of the ring, dating back to days 
beyond all memory." Even with time's advantage, it's still arguable whether 
Rice was a wordsmith or a heavy-handed hack. He did leave a legacy, though, 
including the frequently repeated phrase, "(It's) not that you won or lost -- 
but how you played the game." 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of crap" is how Red Auerbach characterized Rice's paean to good 
sportsmanship. As memorialized by Dan Shaugnessy in Seeing Red: The Red 
Auerbach Story, the Boston Celtics coach and general manager comes across 
equally shrewd and crude. Despite his many successes and innovations, he was as 
fair-minded as his contempt for Rice would suggest: Auerbach's accomplishments 
suffer from a basic lack of decency. Sadly, he's now an archetype of good 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 "Red's ethics were those of convenience," Shaugnessy writes evenhandedly. 
Indeed: Auerbach opposed the NBA's drafting college underclassmen -- until he 
wanted to pick freshman Ralph Sampson, encouraging him to quit Virginia at age 
18. Auerbach believed contracts should be honored, but he wanted to bust Danny 
Ainge's baseball deal so he could play Celtic basketball. Pat Riley accurately 
sums up Auerbach's unspoken credo: "To hell with dignity. To hell with fair 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to basketball and baseball, professional football has not contributed 
much to sports libraries. A Game of Passion: The NFL Literary Companion tries 
to change that anemic record with spotty results. The volume mixes the gridiron 
musings of Don DeLillo and a young Gay Talese (and several other prominent 
authors) with the stories of more predictable sportswriters such as Jim Murray 
and Paul Zimmerman. Most of the pieces aren't terribly new, and many aren't 
terribly good, either. Since when do the words "by John Madden" and "literary" 
belong in the same document? 
</P>
<P>
 You're Okay, It's Just a Bruise doesn't showcase much better writing but it's 
certainly more riveting reading. The memoir of Los Angeles Raiders internist 
Robert Huizenga is often lurid and rarely dull. Marked by prescription 
painkillers consumed by the handful and rampant steroid abuse, Huizenga's world 
is violent and not always palatable. The inventory of Lyle Alzado's frightening 
medicine chest is exceeded by the story of lineman Mike Wise, whose 
muscle-building chemical intake pushed his forehead bones to "Neanderthal" 
proportions. Plastic surgery cured that side effect, but only suicide ended 
Wise's mental anguish. "It's Just a Bruise" is a useful counterpoint to overly 
romantic notions of the NFL, and a good reminder of how fans' expectations 
don't always match the realities of professional sports.

By CHARLES SOLOMON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 December once again found Santa searching the bookstores for paperbacks to 
leave people on his "nice" list: The elves had moved the toy factories south 
after NAFTA (North Arctic Free Trade Accord) passed, which made it hard for him 
to collect enough presents in time. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first volumes that caught his eye was JACOB LAWRENCE: The Migration 
Series edited by Elizabeth Hutton Turner (Rappahannock Press/Phillips 
Collection: $25; 172 pp., paperback original) . All 60 paintings in the series 
are reproduced for the first time since the noted African American artist 
completed them in 1941. The boldly colored canvases depict the movement of 
thousands of African American families from the rural South to the urban North 
during the early 20th Century. Lawrence's more recent work may be seen in JACOB 
LAWRENCE: Thirty Years of Prints (1963-1993) edited by Peter Nesbett 
(University of Washington Press: $14.95; 64 pp., paperback original). Most of 
the lithographs and screen prints portray events in black history, including 
the 22-print suite "The Legend of John Brown" (1977) and eight prints on the 
life of the Haitian revolutionary leader Toussaint L'Ouverture. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the "emigrants" Lawrence painted moved to Harlem, where some more 
talented and fortunate individuals found work in the jazz clubs that flourished 
during the '20s and '30s. THE COTTON CLUB by Jim Haskins (Hippocrene Books: 
$14.95; 170 pp.) chronicles the celebrated nightclub. The archival photographs 
show off some of the most celebrated musicians in the history of jazz 
performing: Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Bessie Smith, Josephine Baker, Bill 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Another standout among the season's art books is WHISTLER: Prosaic Views, 
Poetic Visions: Works on Paper from the University of Michigan Museum of Art by 
Carole McNamara & John Siewert (Thames & Hudson/University of Michigan Museum 
of Art: $29.95; 220 pp., paperback original). These subtle, atmospheric 
etchings and lithographs reveal the artist's ability to find beauty in the most 
mundane subjects: Whistler imbues a decrepit London bridge with the eloquent 
grace of a Hiroshige print. 
</P>
<P>
 Paintings, drawings and architectural designs from the art nouveau and 
Secessionist schools that followed Whistler are featured in ART IN VIENNA 
1898-1918: Klimt, Kokoschka, Schiele and Their Contemporaries by Peter Vergo 
(Phaidon/Chronicle: $24.95; 256 pp.). The opulent exoticism of Gustave Klimt 
and Jan Toroop contrasts sharply with the darker, Angst-ridden visions of 
Kokoschka and Schiele. A more thorough survey of Schiele's intense opus can be 
found in EGON SCHIELE by Simon Wilson (Phaidon/Chronicle: $14.95; 80 pp.). His 
stark nudes may fall outside traditional holiday imagery, but any art fan would 
appreciate this intriguing book. 
</P>
<P>
 Several volumes straddle the lines that separate fine art, popular art and 
kitsch. THE ART OF ROY LICHTENSTEIN: Mural With Blue Brush Stroke by Calvin 
Tomkins (Arcade: $19.95; 128 pp.) follows the creation of Lichtenstein's 
five-story-high mural in the lobby of the Equitable Life Assurance Society 
building in Manhattan, from the first sketches to the installation of the 
finished work. Even more playful works fill WILLIAM WEGMAN: Paintings, 
Drawings, Photographs, Videotapes edited by Marvin Kunz (Abrams: $24.95; 224 
pp.). Wegman's most successful creations are the absurd photographs of Man Ray 
and his other long-suffering dogs in improbable poses and costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 FASHION ILLUSTRATION TODAY by Nicholas Drake (Thames & Hudson: $24.95; 176 
pp.) focuses on the work of some the most original contemporary illustrators. 
Their styles range from the minimal calligraphic sketches of Michel Canetti and 
the imaginative origami forms of Bertrand le Pautrement to the gimmicky 
collages of Zoltan and the raunchy drawings of T. Perez, which would look more 
at home in a porno magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobin Fraley offers an affectionate look at a popular American amusement in 
THE GREAT AMERICAN CAROUSEL: A Century of Master Craftsmanship (Chronicle: 
$18.95; 132 pp., paperback original). The hand-carved horses display an elegant 
grace that transcends the shabby settings in which they often appear. Jane and 
Michael Stern pay tribute to the popular image of cowboys in WAY OUT WEST 
(HarperPerennial: $18; 400 pp.). The West depicted in movies, comic books and 
TV shows has little to do with the real men and women who rode the range, but 
these photographs of hilariously tasteless products, performers and monuments 
would make a great gift for anyone who's slept in cowboy print pajamas or sent 
jackalope postcards to friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic depictions of rare animals and plants in WITNESS: Endangered 
Species of North America by Susan Middleton & David Liittschwager (Chronicle: 
$29.95; 256 pp., paperback original) make it the most beautiful nature book of 
the year. Two well-matched smaller volumes offer more thorough looks at New 
World predators: WILD CATS: Lynx, Bobcats, Mountain Lions by Candace Savage 
(Sierra Club Books: $20; 144 pp.) and WILD DOGS: The Wolves, Coyotes and Foxes 
of North America by Erwin A. Bauer, photographs by Erwin & Peggy Bauer 
(Chronicle: $16.95; 120 pp., paperback original). The color photographs of 
animals in action will please any nature-lover on the gift list. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more poignant are the words and images in ENDANGERED PEOPLES by Art 
Davidson (Sierra Club Books: $20; 176 pp.). From the Yup'ik in North America to 
the Aborigines of Australia, these ethnic groups are seeing their traditional 
ways of life eradicated by habitat destruction, pollution, desertification, 
overpopulation, assimilation and murder. (An estimated 200,000 indigenous 
people are killed each year.) An Aboriginal woman summarized the tone of this 
eloquent plea for respect and survival when she told a group of concerned 
Australians, "If you've come here to save us, then go home. But if you've come 
to struggle with us on our common problems, then let's go to work." 
</P>
<P>
 All these diverse people and animals inhabit just one of the places depicted 
in Nigel Henbest's stunning THE PLANETS: Portraits of New Worlds (Penguin: 
$17.95; 208 pp.). Photographs from recent space missions, some of them 
computer-enhanced, offer clear visions of the worlds in our solar system. The 
majesty of Jupiter's swirling atmosphere, the harshly scarred beauty of Venus 
and Mars and the eloquence of Saturn's rings all pale before the pictures of 
the small but achingly lovely planet we call home. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Larson's recent announcement that he plans to quit drawing "The Far Side" 
at the end of the year only increases the appeal of his latest collection, THE 
CURSE OF MADAME (Andrews & McMeel: $8.95; 109 pp., paperback original). Another 
sure-to-please gift choice is the large-format HOMICIDAL PSYCHO JUNGLE CAT by 
Bill Watterson (Andrews & McMeel: $12.95; 175 pp., paperback original) , the 
latest adventures of Calvin and Hobbes. And Matt Groening launches his 
deliciously barbed observations on parenting, relationships and life in BINKY'S 
GUIDE TO LOVE (HarperPerennial: $16; 128 pp.).  
</P>
<P>
 On his way out, Santa paused to slide a stack of "Nicole Brown Simpson" books 
into a convenient shredder before giving his traditional holiday apostrophe, 
"Merry Christmas to all and to all a Good Read!"

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: SEASON'S READINGS; PICTURE BOOKS FOR DREAMERS AND 
PRANKSTERS, DOG FANCIERS AND ART LOVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Cart, Formerly director of the Beverly Hills Public Library, Michael 
Cart is now a full-time writer and observer of the children's book world. His 
first two books will appear in 1995. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one can see memory, of course, but if we could, I suspect it would appear 
to be as magical and mesmerizing as the images of Prague which Czech-born 
author-illustrator Peter Sis has created for The Three Golden Keys. Designed to 
show his New York-born daughter "where her father came from," Sis says, the 
book tells the richly imagined and dreamlike story of a man -- Sis himself, 
presumably -- whose hot air balloon is blown off course and lands in the Prague 
of his distant childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Rushing through the empty, serpentine streets, the man arrives at his boyhood 
home to find the door secured by three rusty padlocks. A black cat -- perhaps 
his childhood pet -- appears and, with magical, shining eyes, guides him to 
three favorite places from his childhood. In each place he meets a strange 
person: a librarian made of books, in the manner of the 16th-Century artist 
Arcimboldo; an emperor composed of plants, and a mechanical man. Each of them 
gives him a gold key and a scroll containing a local legend. Armed with these 
literal and symbolic keys, the man returns to his house, unlocks the door, and 
finds the shadowy figures of his parents: He has come home, a boy again. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the elaborate pen-and-ink drawings, executed on paper stained to 
resemble colors, is contained in a gold frame, a device which suggests that 
reading the book is like strolling through a wonderful museum of memory. As the 
man in the book continues his quest, Sis plays with perspective and fills his 
pictures with the kind of symbolic images that haunt our dreams. An aerial view 
of the city shows that the streets form the shape of a cat; the zodiac fills 
the sky like a sun which circles the seasons round; faces appear in windows of 
deserted-looking buildings like ghosts -- or like memories of the day when Sis 
said "good-bye to this forever." The late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who 
edited this book shortly before her death, called Sis "a genius." Few who sees 
this book will disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrated New Yorker cartoonist James Stevenson shows us another way memory 
looks in this fifth autobiographical picture book Fun No Fun (Greenwillow: 
$14). For him it is all softly impressionistic but evocative watercolor scenes 
of events charmingly blurred by the passage of time. With his signature wit, 
Stevenson recalls things from his boyhood which were FUN . . . and some which 
weren't. Examples: fun was cowboy boots. No fun was galoshes. Fun was "my 
birthday." No fun was "my brother's birthday." More than a simple list of 
things, though, "Fun No Fun" is an inventory of childhood; its individual 
particulars transformed by unassuming art into an experience that is universal. 
</P>
<P>
 One of America's greatest poets, Donald Hall, shares a memory not of his own 
but of his ninety-year-old mother's long-ago childhood in Lucy's Christmas 
(Browndeer Press/Harcourt, Brace: $14.95). Michael McCurdy has recreated the 
rural, turn-of-the-century world of New Hampshire in his amazingly apposite, 
color scratchboard illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, whose recent recommitment to the picture book is a blessing to the form, 
has also written I Am the Dog, I Am the Cat (Dial: $15.99), hilarious poems for 
the contrapuntal and very opinionated voices of American's favorite pets. 
Designer and illustrator Barry Moser has provided watercolor pictures which 
invest them with individuality and engaging personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Moser's rotweiler Rosie served as the canine model for Hall's book and makes 
an encore appearance in Moser's own book My Dog Rosie (Blue Sky/Scholastic: 
$13.95). Sharing the spotlight with the rotweiler is the artists's 
three-year-old granddaughter, Isabelle Harper, who tells us about her day with 
Rosie. Since this is her story, her doting (and brilliantly gifted) artist 
grandfather gives her co-authorial credit! 
</P>
<P>
 If this has been a good year for granddaughters, it's been a great picture 
book year for dogs. They're heroes of two other offbeat titles: Dav Pilkey's 
Dog Breath (Blue Sky/Scholastic: $12.95) is the hilarious story of a family pet 
whose name -- "Hally Tosis" -- reveals the nature of his "horrible trouble." 
Needless to say, by the end of this pun-filled adventure, problem has 
miraculously turned to opportunity and Hally has become a hero. Pilkey's 
cartoon art is filled with humor and heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Lunch, the famous pooch whose profession is bird-chasing, debuted in last 
year's Mr. Lunch Takes a Plane Ride. This time around Mr. Lunch Borrows a Canoe 
(Viking: $14.99) and, improbably, paddles all the way to Venice, where he finds 
the greatest challenge of his career: the pigeon-filled square of St. Mark's. 
Like Hally, Mr. Lunch proves his heroic mettle while co-authors J. Otto Seibold 
and Vivian Walsh show us their imaginative panache. Seibold, who doubles as 
illustrator, creates his terrifically idiosyncratic art using a Macintosh IICi 
computer. See it to appreciate it. 
</P>
<P>
 The canine's cousin, the coyote, is the eponymous hero of Gerald McDermott's 
new trickster tale, Coyote (Harcourt, Brace: $14.95) But this time it's the 
trickster who is fooled when he tries to fly with the crows. Inspired by Zuni 
legend, the book has the look of native-American design and the warm, rich 
colors of its setting, the desert southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 American folklore is the inspiration for Anne Isaac's original tall tale, 
Swamp Angel (Dutton: $14.99). It's the rollicking story of Angelica Longrider, 
the greatest woodswoman in Tennessee and her amazing encounter with "a fearsome 
bear known as 'Thundering Tarnation."' Angelica ultimately triumphs, as does 
illustrator Paul O. Zelinsky. A chameleon of an artist, Zelinsky brilliantly 
creates new styles to match the spirit of each new project. This time he 
affects the look of the American primitive and, to give his pictures the proper 
period flavor, has painted in oil on cherry, maple and birch veneers. His 
pictures brilliantly capture the epic energy and scope of the American 
frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Desmini operates on a smaller scale but with equal imagination and 
idiosyncratic style in My House (Henry Holt: $15.95). Working with a 
combination of collage, paint and photographs, Desmini shows us a house in -- 
and for -- all seasons. Her house is our own cozy home but better because it is 
"filled with dreams."

 Writer Kathleen Krull shares whimsical and offbeat moments fromthe lives of 
other authors in her engaging Lives of the Writers (Harcourt, Brace, $18.95). 
Krull's collaborator Kathryn Hewitt has created brilliant, full 
page-caricatures to capture, exactly, the tone of the text while deftly 
expanding, in their details, our understanding of what made these writers so -- 
individual.

 British illustrator Stephen Biesty is another specialist in detail -- but on a 
staggering scale! The master of the intricate cross-section, Biesty this time 
takes us behind the scenes of a fourteenth-century castle under siege while 
author Richard Platt supplies the fact-filled text for Stephen Biesty's 
Cross-Sections: Castle (Dorling Kindersley: $16.95). Kids will no doubt 
particularly enjoy the more excruciating details of weapons and punishment but 
the domestic details of daily life are equally captivating and crowd the 
oversized pages. If attention flags, the author and illustrator have added a 
spy to the works and invite keener-eyed readers to find him in each of the ten 
cross-section spreads. Castle is much more than a medieval "Where's Waldo," 
though. Like all of the titles discussed here it is an expression of the 
picture book's mind-expanding capacity for combining breathtaking art and 
imagination.

 Kenny G on the R&B chart? A lot of folks would argue that he doesn't belong 
there with those easy-listening-style, pop-jazz sax instrumentals. Yet, there 
he is, perched on top of The Times' Southern California R&B chart with a 
collection of Yuletide tunes, "Miracles, the Holiday Album." Even more 
suprising is that the album tops both the Southern California and national pop 
album charts too. It's remarkable because instrumental albums rarely crack the 
pop Top 10, let alone make it to No. 1. Ice Cube is doing strong business with 
a package, "Bootlegs & B-Sides" of mostly old material. In Southern California, 
it's not only the leading rap album but also ranks No. 7 on the pop chart.
