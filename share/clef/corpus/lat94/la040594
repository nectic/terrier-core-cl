STRAWBERRY HAS SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEM, WON'T PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry, who disappeared from the Los Angeles Dodgers for a day, has 
a substance abuse problem and has been placed on the disabled list, the team 
announced Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Fred Claire, who said Strawberry will immediately enter a 
treatment center, could not predict when -- or if -- the outfielder will rejoin 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl Strawberry has admitted having a substance abuse problem and has 
requested assistance from the Dodgers," the team said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire did not say specifically whether Strawberry, who has been treated for 
an alcohol problem, was having trouble with drinking or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry failed to show for the team's exhibition game Sunday against the 
California Angels at Anaheim Stadium. His absence prompted a frantic all-day 
search by the team. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally was located with his family late at night. The Dodgers remain 
dissatisfied with his explanation, which they did not disclose. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger players, coaches and Manager Tom Lasorda met for 45 minutes Monday 
before going through a light workout at Dodger Stadium. The team opens at home 
Tuesday against the Florida Marlins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like he's really let us down," said Lasorda, who has been a staunch 
Strawberry supporter. "He's let this ballclub down. I'm very disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very angry with him, absolutely. Players have a commitment to the man 
who's paying them their salary. I'm not happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's getting paid good money, he's getting paid a lot of money, his 
responsibility should be to this ballclub, and when it isn't, then he's making 
the biggest mistake of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire said Sunday night the reason Strawberry gave for his disappearance was 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "This type of behavior is extremely detrimental to the ballclub and will not 
be tolerated," he said, adding he would speak to Strawberry on Monday and 
determine "appropriate disciplinary action." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest in a series of problems concerning Strawberry. Since 
breaking into the majors with the New York Mets in 1983, he has fought with 
teammates and feuded with managers, entered an alcohol rehabilitation clinic, 
admitted hitting his first wife, Lisa, from whom he is now divorced, and was 
arrested for threatening her with a gun. He has admitted considering suicide at 
one point. 
</P>
<P>
 KABC-TV reported that several people said Strawberry was at an Anaheim 
nightclub from about 10:30 p.m. Saturday until closing time, about 2 a.m. 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is about a mile from Anaheim Stadium, where Strawberry had played in 
the Dodgers' 5-2 loss to the Angels on Saturday night. He homered in his final 
at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Hong, who owns the nightclub, confirmed to the Associated Press the 
television station's report that Strawberry was drinking alcohol, but said 
Strawberry didn't cause a disturbance and was signing autographs and 
socializing with other patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "He only had a couple drinks and was very well-behaved," Hong said. "He was a 
very friendly man." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said he had not been informed of the reason for Strawberry's 
disappearance, but emphasized that the team is ready to go about its business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready to open the season tomorrow, and that's what we're concentrating 
on," Lasorda said. "I just told the players that we're going to have to go 
forward and we're going to have to win with or without anybody on this 
ballclub." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, 32, has two years remaining on the five-year, $20.25-million 
contract he signed with the Dodgers after the 1990 season, following eight 
mostly successful years with the Mets. He is owed $8 million over those two 
years.

 TOUGH JOB: Mary Lee must be crazy. Why else would she leave her secure 
position as president of Valley College for the same job at Pierce? The place 
is deep in debt, and losing students. Besides, there's no guarantee she'll be 
able to stay beyond two years. . . . The answer is simple. Lee loves a 
challenge, and she's certainly got one. Times staff writer John Chandler 
interviewed her about her plans for Pierce (B5). 
</P>
<P>
 NOISES OFF: If you were stoked to see "Burbank Airport, The Meeting" on your 
TV, tough luck. It's canceled without even a pilot. The powers that be at 
Burbank Airport scrapped the idea of broadcasting their meetings (B5) . . . Bad 
light and takeoff noise would make the show hard to watch, they said -- and 
that runway roar might become a weapon in the hands of the airport's vociferous 
noise critics. 
</P>
<P>
 WAITING: The quake was supposed to mean good business for Valley companies 
(above) that do repairs. But, so far, it hasn't worked out that way for 
everyone. Blame it on the long waits for federal aid and insurance money. . . . 
"It's frustrating," said the owner of a Reseda company, "because I'm out there 
spinning my wheels." See Valley Business, Page 3. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS AWARENESS: At first, some feared an AIDS education program held last 
month by the Sulphur Springs School District in Santa Clarita might be too 
graphic. But a survey released Monday indicates it should help open a dialogue 
between parents and children about the problem. . . . "This program should be 
mandatory for all kids in the school," wrote one parent (B14). 
</P>
<P>
 MIGHTY MATADOR: Golf will take center stage this weekend with the Masters. And 
although ex-CSUN player Bob Burns won't compete, he's already made quite an 
impression on the PGA Tour this season. He's pocketed more than $90,000, and 
might win Rookie of the Year. . . . Ex-coach Jim Bracken is not surprised. "I 
knew it was just a matter of time," he said. "He's just a great ball striker, 
and is so consistent." Michael Arkush

 DUCK & COVER: Whereas the Northridge quake was only a "wake-up call," the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors declares April as Earthquake Preparedness 
Month. The supervisors kick off the month's events by diving under their desks 
this morning in the annual "Duck, Cover and Hold" drill. All this is being 
taken more seriously, given the devastation of the Jan. 17 quake. "The idea is 
that wasn't the big one," said Dale Carnathan of the emergency services office. 
"The big one is still to come." 
</P>
<P>
 STANDING FIRM: The futuristic radar tower perched on an Ojai hilltop has 
weathered another court challenge (B1). This time, a judge said the neighbors 
have no evidence the government misled the locals by suggesting the 98-foot 
tower would blend into the scenery. . . . But the neighbors are still fighting 
mad. One sounds a bit like the character he once played on "Dallas." "They're 
liars and cheaters and they've broken the law," Larry Hagman said. "They can do 
things we'd be thrown in prison for." 
</P>
<P>
 FAST BREAK: As March madness concluded with the NCAA championship game (C1), 
one of the year's biggest winners wasn't on either of the men's teams. Marion 
Jones, the Thousand Oaks High grad and point guard for North Carolina, 
predicted her team would take the women's title. . . . The dramatic victory 
over Louisiana Tech brings Jones and women's basketball long-overdue notice. 
Thousand Oaks Athletic Director Anna Merriman sees yearly gains. "The girls are 
training appropriately and getting the attention they deserve." 
</P>
<P>
 STILL GROWING: Amgen Inc., the biotech firm that competitors would love to 
clone, has moved up 22 places on the Fortune 500 list (Valley Business, Page 
9). . . . The Thousand Oaks firm is now 304th in size. But its stock dropped 
last year prompting Fortune to ask: "Is red-hot Amgen, tops in 10-year total 
return to investors, cooling off? Sales of Epogen, its market-leading kidney 
treatment, have begun to slow down."

5,000 UNDERGOING RADIATION TESTS, WITH CONSENT, FOR U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 5,000 people are currently being exposed to low levels of radiation 
-- with their permission -- in government-funded medical research, the Energy 
Department reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has been under pressure to release information about current 
radiation experiments after reports of Cold War-era testing in which people 
were unwittingly exposed to radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41 research projects with 5,056 participants do not seek to study the 
effect of radiation on humans, but use radiation as a diagnostic tool, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 All require the consent of the subjects and are approved and supervised by an 
independent Institutional Review Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John Glenn (D-Ohio), chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, said 
he was reassured by the report and by the creation of a new database to allow 
easy public access to information on Energy Department testing. In January, 
Glenn's committee asked the department to report on its testing. The committee 
released the report and its own summary Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Glenn said the department should do more to check on the testing being 
done in its name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have learned from the department that for all these tests, not one 
investigation has been conducted in the last three years to ensure compliance," 
Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Department spokesman Jeff Sherwood said the Institutional Review 
boards, which include consumer advocates and experts not affiliated with the 
research institution they oversee, closely monitor the medical testing they 
approve. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41 projects involving radiation break down into three groups: 
</P>
<P>
 * 31 with 3,208 subjects involve exposure to radiation in trace amounts 
similar to those used in the nuclear medicine tests given in hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seven projects with 1,228 subjects are follow-up health studies that include 
the use of routine diagnostic X-rays, such as chest X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three projects with 560 subjects involve the use of radiation in the 
development of new treatments for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 At Brookhaven National Laboratory, for example, Energy Department scientists 
are developing "radiopharmaceuticals" for detecting tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, a department-funded project is 
using a radioactive isotope to develop antibodies known as "magic bullets" for 
detecting and treating cancer.

LEVEL OF INTEREST RATES TOO HIGH, CLINTON SAYS; ECONOMY: HE SEES SOLID STOCK 
MARKET AND BELIEVES RATES WILL 'COME BACK DOWN.' HE CONTRADICTS FED ON THE 
POSSIBILITY OF RENEWED INFLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton, expressing confidence in the economy in the face of another 
day's plunge in stock and bond prices, said Monday that rising interest rates, 
which triggered the latest stock selloff, are "too high." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they'll come back down," Clinton said in a television interview after 
throwing out the first ball at the Cleveland Indians' baseball season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's comments appeared to reflect a concerted Administration effort to 
put pressure on the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates in check. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed, signaling its concern that the economy is growing so quickly that it 
might generate a new round of inflation, has raised short-term interest rates 
twice in the last two months. Those moves triggered the recent fall in stock 
and bond prices because they fueled investors' fears of slower economic growth 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, contradicting the Federal Reserve's prognosis, insisted: "There is no 
inflation in this economy. I don't think there is anything to worry about in 
terms of the long-term health of the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that the recent plunge in the stock market reflected investors' 
judgment that the market, after rising steadily for almost four years, was 
"somewhat overvalued." He urged small investors not to panic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fundamentally, it's a solid stock market and a very solid economy," Clinton 
told reporters as he left Cleveland for the college basketball championship 
game in Charlotte, N.C. "We'll get through this if everybody will just remain 
calm and let the market work itself out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had shed about 350 points since the 
Fed's first move to drive interest rates higher in early February, slid another 
42 points Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market also tumbled. Interest rates on 30-year Treasury bonds, which 
had been below 6% last October, rose to 7.42% Monday. Economists said that 
Clinton seemed to be properly trying to reassure wary investors, not putting 
improper pressure on the independent Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the fears of rising inflation are well-founded," said Barry 
Rogstad, president of the American Business Conference, which consists of 100 
high-growth corporations. "I think what the President is doing is a valid and 
appropriate role for a leader -- to stand up and give a sense of what is going 
on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Marko A. Budgyk, managing partner of the Los Angeles investment management 
firm of Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin, said: "If you just look based on the 
inflation numbers out there, it would appear the bond market overreacted." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that some of the plunge in bond prices could be caused by the 
unwinding of speculative positions by big investors rather than by any 
fundamental weakness in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Budgyk said Clinton's statement that interest rates are too high was the 
natural response of a politician. 
</P>
<P>
 The President used the decline in interest rates over the last year "to 
justify his entire program, saying it was evidence his program worked," said 
Budgyk. "Now the opposite is happening and he can't say it's because of his 
program. He has to say investors are crazy." Clinton's line echoed that of his 
top economic advisers. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said Monday on ABC-TV's 
"Good Morning America" that the U.S. economy should convince investors that 
there is no reason to panic. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing is -- again -- good, solid, sustainable growth on all 
fronts," Reich said.

BRISENO ALTERS TESTIMONY; LAWSUIT: OFFICER NOW BELIEVES THAT RODNEY G. KING WAS 
STRUCK ON THE ARM INSTEAD OF THE HEAD. HIS NEW ACCOUNT IS BASED ON AN ENHANCED 
VIDEO OF THE BATON BLOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The police officer whose testimony helped convict two fellow officers in the 
Rodney G. King beating changed his story on the witness stand Monday, saying 
King was not struck on the head with batons. 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore J. Briseno, who broke ranks with co-defendants in one criminal trial 
and whose videotaped testimony was used against them in another, testified in 
King's lawsuit that he now believes those blows hit King's arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno said a viewing of an enhanced videotape of the March 3, 1991, beating 
changed his mind about what he once believed to be head blows, which are 
forbidden by the Police Department because they can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please explain how it changed your perception," asked defense attorney 
Michael Stone, representing one of the officers being sued by King in federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, the night of March 3, it was my impression that the officer was 
delivering blows from the shoulders up," Briseno said under cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "In looking at the enhancement, does it appear you were wrong?" Stone asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Briseno said. "The video clearly shows where the blows landed." 
</P>
<P>
 "And where was that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The arms," Briseno replied. "The right arm." 
</P>
<P>
 King, 29, is seeking millions in damages for the beating videotaped by an 
onlooker. The lawsuit names the city of Los Angeles and several police officers 
and commanders. The city has conceded liability, and the two-phase trial is 
being held to determine compensatory damages owed by the city and punitive 
damages that could be levied against individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 In other testimony, King's mother, Odessa, testified in a choking voice about 
how she saw her beaten son in a hospital and asked him what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said . . . 'Those white boys really beat me, Ma,' " she recalled. "I told 
Rodney, 'Look, just leave race out of this. I'm getting you out of here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Four officers including Briseno were acquitted in a 1992 state trial that 
sparked three days of riots. During that trial, Briseno testified that King was 
struck in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the officers, Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. Koon, were later 
convicted of civil rights violations in a federal trial after Briseno's 
testimony against his former colleagues was played on videotape for jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell and Koon are serving 30-month sentences in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, who is represented by Stone, is alleged to have struck repeated blows 
to King's head, and that allegation could weigh against Powell in the 
punitive-damages phase of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court, King's lawyer said he believed Briseno was motivated to change 
his testimony because he stands to suffer if jurors award King large punitive 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney John Burris said Briseno also might want to mend fences with other 
police officers who viewed him as a traitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a self-motive to minimize Mr. King's damages," Burris said. "And Mr. 
Briseno has been held in disfavor with other officers. This was a way to bridge 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Burris said, however, that Briseno was forced to stick with his original 
account of what he saw at the scene and to base the change in his perception on 
the videotape. Otherwise, Briseno could face perjury charges, Burris said.  
</P>
<P>
 Briseno said he knew about the enhanced video and had seen it last year at a 
lawyer's office during the federal civil rights trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, when he testified at his own internal police hearing in 
September, Briseno never mentioned the video and told again the familiar story 
of how he saw Powell strike King repeatedly above the shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "So are you trying to tell us your perceptions may have been changed, but you 
gave testimony contrary to those perceptions?" Burris asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's correct," Briseno said, adding that his personnel hearing remains open 
and he will testify further when it reconvenes at an unspecified date.

 Do you know where your kids are this semester?Stressing that L.A. was a safe 
place to live, the other day L.A. County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said: "I 
would not have my children living here if that were not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the L.A. Daily Journal pointed out, Garcetti's son is studying at 
Oxford while his daughter is a law student at Duke University in Chapel Hill, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 We contacted Garcetti's office and were told by spokeswoman Suzanne Childs: 
"He always thinks of them living here. They grew up here. They're just away at 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 Yup, far away.

 Tree score cards ready?As you can see from our photos, this is Only in L.A.'s 
special opening day baseball column.  
</P>
<P>
 What? The connection isn't clear? Well, let's lead off with No. 30, one of the 
famous Painted Number Trees on City Hall's south lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 The ficus trees were so indexed before a Dodger championship celebration at 
City Hall because of the tendency of some over-exuberant fans to climb them for 
a better view. The thinking was that if any tumbled to the ground, police could 
alert paramedics where to go. 
</P>
<P>

NERVE-JOLTING RIDE IN THE MARKETS; THE FED MUST SIGNAL STABILITY IN INTEREST 
RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The financial markets appeared to have weathered the worst of a widely 
expected selloff on Monday, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 42.61 
points. However, some unnerving seesawing in the markets -- triggered by rising 
interest rates and, ironically, favorable economic indicators -- is likely to 
continue for a while.  
</P>
<P>
 The situation is downright disconcerting for most of those with investments in 
stocks, bonds and mutual funds. The stock market was due for some correction, 
but the sudden and sharp run-up in long-term interest rates had not been 
foreseen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve nudged up short-term rates twice in the last month, a 
quarter percent each time, to squeeze out "a speculative development in the 
financial markets" and as a preemptive strike against inflation. The bond 
market went ballistic during the same period, with long-term interest rates 
shooting up to 7.42% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said on Monday that Americans should not overreact to the 
stock market drop because the economy was fundamentally healthy and interest 
rates, while too high now, would turn down again. That indeed is the 
conventional wisdom, assuming the markets settle down. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates, however, moved beyond 7% on Monday, possibly putting the 
recovery into a danger zone. "Based on what we know, our view of how strongly 
the economy will grow this year is not changed by an interest rate in the 
neighborhood of 7%," Laura D'Andrea Tyson, chairwoman of the President's 
Council of Economic Advisers, said over the weekend, "but if the level goes 
much above 7%, then that would exercise a contractionary effect on the 
economy." That, in turn, would curtail job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a contraction would set back California in a big way. Three years behind 
the rest of the nation in the economic recovery, the state is only now emerging 
from its worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. It's a fragile 
recuperation at best, and without significant progress in California the 
national recovery will be hampered. 
</P>
<P>
 Riding the market's roller coaster is no fun. With uncertainty in the bond 
market and interest rates spooking the stock market, the last thing needed now 
is the prospect of another, imminent hike in rates by the Federal Reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Stability is what is necessary. Most investors, though nervous, are hanging 
in, but they want to see signals that they are not being foolhardy. The Fed, by 
not further increasing interest rates now, can help to quell overblown 
inflation fears and settle market jitters.

CIVIC WATCH; MOUNTAIN CLIMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank G. Wells, one admirer said, "climbed mountains even when he wasn't 
climbing mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 It was just one of many superlatives used in paying tribute to the president 
and chief executive officer of the Walt Disney Co., killed Sunday in a 
helicopter crash.He had been on a skiing expedition -- one of the many 
adventuresome pursuits he enjoyed. An avid outdoorsman, Wells, 62, and two 
others were killed during a trip to the remote, rugged mountains of northeast 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells' business record speaks for itself. Along with Disney Chairman Michael 
D. Eisner -- whom he recommended for that job -- Wells turned the Disney Co. 
around in less than a decade. A prime candidate for corporate takeover and 
valued at roughly $2 billion in 1984 when Wells arrived, the company was valued 
at $22 billion by 1992. Throughout his successes, Wells never tarnished a 
reputation for adhering to the highest ethical standards of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Less known, but no less important, were his civic works -- Wells' support of 
environmentalism and fund-raising on behalf of the arts and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the impressive personal achievements. Graduate of Pomona 
College and Stanford Law School. Rhodes Scholar. Mountain climber who scaled 
the highest mountain on each of the seven continents -- save only Mt. Everest 
-- writing about his quest in a book, "Seven Summits." 
</P>
<P>
 In losing Frank Wells, this community will miss not just an important business 
leader but an important civic leader.

CHARTER STATUS PAYS OFF, IN CASH; VAUGHN SCHOOL HAS $1.2-MILLION SURPLUS IN 
FIRST YEAR OF STATEWIDE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget bake sales. Principal Yvonne Chan dreams of bigger things, such as who 
should be her school's investment counselor. She's going to need one. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Chan's Vaughn Street Elementary School in Pacoima applied for and 
was granted charter status within the Los Angeles Unified School District. The 
statewide charter program allows a limited number of public schools to operate 
independently of their parent districts while continuing to receive district 
funding. The school changed its name to the Vaughn Next Century Learning 
Center, but that was hardly the only difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan and her charges have rung up a surplus of $1.2 million this year, an 
astonishing feat in a school system that has been forced to cut more than $1 
billion from its budget over the last several years. Another LAUSD charter 
campus in the Valley -- Fenton Avenue School -- is projecting a $200,000 
surplus. These examples are two of the best arguments yet for site-based 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Chan scaled back administrative costs. Vaughn did its own hiring rather 
than paying the district for personnel services. Public schools are also funded 
according to student attendance, and Vaughn achieved a daily rate of 99%. 
Telephone calls were made to students' homes whenever they were absent, and 
incentives for perfect attendance were created. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan will use the surplus to buy surrounding properties for use as a cultural 
center and library, and for more classroom space for a school so overcrowded 
that it needs three rotating schedules to accommodate its students. 
</P>
<P>
 Such extra effort is essential at Vaughn. Its students, who are mostly Latino 
and poor, live in one of the San Fernando Valley's toughest neighborhoods. 
Vaughn students are among the lowest-achieving in a district that as a whole 
was lackluster in the recent California Learning Assessment System exams. 
</P>
<P>
 What Vaughn has saved can now be directed toward improving academic 
performance. In the meantime, its noteworthy success ought to be studied 
closely by the rest of the LAUSD.

ONEROUS PRICE FOR TIDINESS; SINGAPORE HAS LITTLE GRAFFITI . . . AND LITTLE 
INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By sentencing an 18-year-old American vandal to a caning for spray-painting 
cars, Singapore has earned a measure of approval from Americans fed up with 
juvenile crime. However, that should not obscure the reality that the tiny 
city-state is a repressive place whose disgraceful standards of political 
participation, press freedom and criminal justice are unattractive by any 
modern democratic gauge. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the 225-square-mile republic, half the area of Los Angeles, find a 
clean, booming city, almost devoid of crime, litter, gangs, graffiti and 
poverty. Stepping out of line can bring harsh penalties: death for drug 
importation, caning for petty offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is that the Singaporean government is also intolerant when it 
comes to political dissent and free expression of ideas. Singapore has the 
trappings of parliamentary democracy, but little of the reality. The People's 
Action Party has exercised one-party control since independence in 1965. After 
Dr. Chee Soon Juan challenged Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong in the 1992 
elections he found himself without a job amid a controversy that some suggest 
was related to his political activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day a senior judge fined five men, including editors and reporters 
at the Singapore Business Times, under the Official Secrets Act. The crime: 
publishing an early government estimate of second-quarter economic growth for 
1992. Hardly likely to bring down the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign press likewise has been subjected to intimidation. Time, the Asian 
Wall Street Journal, the Economist, the Far Eastern Economic Review and 
Asiaweek have been put under distribution restrictions because of government 
disapproval of their coverage of Singapore. All of this has contributed to a 
stifling intellectual climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Goh has promised a more open, less intrusive government. But we see little 
sign of that yet. Singapore has high hopes of making itself the economic 
capital of Asia, rivaling Hong Kong. But it cannot do so in an atmosphere of 
fear, intimidation and repression in which the market may be free but not 
individual lives. Singapore may have beaten drugs and graffiti, but the price 
is too high.

SCRIPPS GLOBAL WARMING STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times published articles (March 22-26) on a Scripps experiment to develop 
an acoustic monitoring system for determining the realities of global warming 
possibly associated with a clear buildup of greenhouse gasses.  
</P>
<P>
 The first article presaged a public hearing on the project that day in 
Washington. Unfortunately, there were many incorrect statements which 
subsequently led directly to a firestorm of protest in the national press. The 
article stated that the source was so loud that it could deafen whales; this is 
incorrect. The source power is 200 watts, and this level would only be 
encountered if the whale's ear was right up against the source, which is 3,000 
feet beneath the sea surface. Permanent damage occurs at about 60,000 watts. 
Near the surface the power is down by a factor of a million, comparable to loud 
speech. Only if a diver were to descend into the water directly above the 
source would the tone be apparent; because the transmission of sound from water 
to the atmosphere is so inefficient, someone in a boat wouldn't be able to hear 
the source. 
</P>
<P>
 As sound propagates away from the source, the intensities continue to decrease 
and reach the ocean's ambient noise level at a distance near 150 miles; the 
sound cannot be "heard" in New Zealand as reported in The Times. Why bother to 
transmit if the sound cannot be heard? A 200-watt light bulb on the surface of 
the moon could not be seen by humans on the Earth at night either. However, the 
light bulb could be observed by Southern California's telescope at Palomar. The 
same is true of the acoustic signal. Acoustic arrays search for the narrow band 
signal and computers are further exploited to extract the coded signal. These 
sophisticated approaches were taken specifically to avoid the transmission of 
loud acoustic signals which might harm marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Your articles state that 677,000 whales, dolphins and seals in the Pacific 
will be affected by this experiment. In fact, the National Marine Fisheries 
Service has a policy of listing the entire Pacific population. It is highly 
unlikely all these marine mammals will swim by the sources. Even if they do, 
they will not be harmed; perhaps distracted if too close, but certainly not 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 That The Times would think that we would act with callous disregard for the 
environment and the living creatures in the sea is extraordinary. Your 
sensational reporting was picked up around the country and the fallout has done 
great damage.

 Scientists reportedly are willing to chance deafening marine animals in order 
to monitor global warming via ocean temperature measurements. But what 
government agency is funding this experiment? The National Weather Service? The 
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration? The Environmental 
Protection Agency? Nope, it's the Defense Department! 
</P>
<P>
 Can anyone explain to me why the Defense Department is more interested in 
global warming than any of the more environmentally focused agencies of our 
federal government? Especially when budget cuts are forcing the Pentagon to 
eliminate its favorite toys, exotic weapons systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing this public-relations maneuver as a cover-up for military testing 
at least explains why the experiment must take place off two of the most remote 
and pristine coasts in the United States (Big Sur and Kauai) instead of heavily 
populated and more convenient locations like Los Angeles and Oahu.

ISRAELI GOVERNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If they ever award a Nobel Prize for resurrecting defunct organizations, 
Israeli government officials would certainly win one. First, they save the 
terrorist PLO from extinction by helping it set up an autonomous region and 
giving it an armed force to hold it.Now, the Israeli government has made the 
extremist Kach movement, founded by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, the darling of 
the Israeli public. By suddenly jailing Kach activists without trial or 
charges, under the Draconian "Administrative Detention Law" left over from the 
days of the British Mandate, and by banning Kach and its little sister, Kahane 
Chai, everyone from the chief rabbis, the print media, to the ultra-liberal 
Israeli Assn. of Civil Rights has rushed to defend them. People are glued to 
their televisions, as Kach leader Baruch Merzel taunts the government by giving 
live interviews from his hide-out, to where he has disappeared since the 
banning. Youngsters in school look at Kach as the underdogs, fighting the 
Establishment on their behalf. Now, Kach youth leaders are openly invited to 
speak to their peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is pouring into the organization from American Jews who now compare Kach 
people to the fighters of the Irgun and Sternists, who were imprisoned by the 
British during Israel's struggle for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 What the government has done is set the stage for a final showdown. It will be 
a battle between the PLO and Kach for the hearts and minds of the Israeli 
public. The voices of reason in the center can no longer be heard.

JAPANESE VIEWS ON GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe they are right. Maybe America is too dangerous to live in. In November, 
I went to visit my relatives in Japan. Out of all the relatives that I came in 
contact with one stands out in my mind. Twelve-year-old Ken-chan is a cousin of 
mine, although this was the first time we met. You see the last time I visited 
Japan I was 12 myself, and he wasn't even born yet. After a fun-filled day of 
kicking a soccer ball around, playing cards and eating immense meals with Ken 
(which he personally served to me with his chopsticks), I asked him to come 
visit me in California this summer. The first words out of his mouth were: "No, 
I will be shot there!" I told him that he'd be fine, but he didn't believe me. 
</P>
<P>
 Now after the killings of Takuma Ito and Go Matsura I am not so sure that 
Ken-chan is too far off. One night in Japan I was traveling on the train at 10 
p.m. and noticed a boy, probably 8, on the train by himself. Now I know this 
will probably never occur in the United States, but I guess I can dream. I 
don't know what can be done to solve the gun problem we have here, but I know 
that Mr. Winchester was terribly frightened when he saw what his rifle could 
do.

 I came to Southern California six years ago. I hoped I would enjoy the sunny 
weather and life here. But I've lived here with fear of violence since Day One. 
</P>
<P>
 When I purchased a new car I got an alarm in it. And I bought an anti-theft 
device the next year. And the third year I got a cellular phone in my car. I 
thought this was good enough to protect me from violence, robbery, murder, 
etc., etc. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning about the two Japanese students who were senselessly killed in 
a pretty safe neighborhood, what do I buy next to protect me from this kind of 
violence? Guns? No way! Japanese are very sensitive, peaceful, educated and 
intelligent people. We don't buy guns to protect ourselves. I really don't know 
what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 When Yoshihiro Hattori was killed in Louisiana in 1992, the Japanese collected 
signatures to ban guns in the U.S. But some American told us to back off and 
don't interfere in other countries. But please listen to others. Learn from 
others, especially Japan where a woman can go for a walk to the park at night 
alone, where children are safe to play in a park alone, where I can walk home 
alone from a station at night. And most of all, where there is strong gun 
control. And learn from a Japanese who loves America. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you want to walk on streets without the fear of being shot, raped or 
mugged? Don't you want your children to live safely? You still have hope, Los 
Angeles. I still believe in you. 
</P>
<P>
 I pray for Tak and Go to sleep peacefully in heaven.

 * Conrad's cartoon "The Bob and Elizabeth (Dole) Show" (March 29) is another 
great example of Conrad's liberal speak.According to Conrad, the Clintons want 
to give everyone free health insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons are not going to give us anything unless they plan to pay for it 
out of Whitewater and pork-belly profits. As for it being free . . . what a 
joke. President Clinton wants employers to pay 80% of the cost, which in turn 
they will pass on to the consumer. Translated, you and me baby! Gee thanks,

PERSPECTIVE ON WHITEWATER; A DIVERSION THAT'S COSTING US ALL; THIS MEDIA-DRIVEN 
INQUEST IS REMINISCENT OF THE WITCH HUNT THAT DISTRACTED OUR TOP AIDS 
RESEARCHER FOR FOUR YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

University and author of You Just Don't Understand: Women and Men in 
Conversation (Ballantine).

<P>
 As the Whitewater teapot is whipped into a tempest, let us consider the case 
of Dr. Robert Gallo. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallo is the American virologist who co-discovered the human immunodeficiency 
virus, which causes AIDS. He is also the one who developed the technique for 
studying T-cells which made that discovery possible, and taught it to other 
labs, including that of Luc Montagnier, the Frenchman who then independently 
identified the virus. Most important, Gallo developed the test to detect HIV in 
blood. But, as Nicholas Wade explained recently in the New York Times Magazine, 
Gallo became the object of a four-year investigation into allegations that he 
had stolen the AIDS virus from Montagnier. The investigation concluded that 
Gallo had done nothing wrong. Nothing. But this exoneration cannot be 
considered a happy ending. Never mind the personal suffering of Gallo, who was 
reviled when he should have been praised. Never mind that, in his words, "These 
were the most painful years and horrible years of my life." The truly awful 
result is that this top-ranked researcher had to spend four years fighting 
accusations instead of fighting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 This diversion from the task at hand is the undiscussed scourge of Whitewater. 
And the victims are not only the Clintons but the country and all its citizens 
-- and, since the United States is so prominent in global events, the world. 
The Whitewater investigation is taking the time and attention of the President 
and of Hillary Rodham Clinton, the person primarily responsible for addressing 
one of the most significant problems facing our country, health care. It is 
time necessarily taken away from what they should be doing -- and what we 
desperately need them to be doing. As investigations and headlines proliferate, 
and members of the White House staff are hauled in for questioning or forced 
out of their jobs, it is no surprise to read in Newsweek that "Inside the 
Administration there is a looming sense that its entire domestic agenda is at 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that any President or public figure should be above 
criticism. If wrongdoing surfaces, of course it is the responsibility of the 
press and the opposing party -- indeed, of the party in question -- to 
investigate the matter. But Whitewater did not come to light because it had 
ramifications in public affairs. It was dragged to light by reporters digging 
in Little Rock garbage, searching for something -- anything -- to provide the 
exposure of errors that our public discourse now requires. Whitewater filled 
the slot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gallo investigation, too, was sparked by a particular type of journalistic 
zeal. The hint of scientific theft originated in an article addressing the 
puzzle of why Gallo's and Montagnier's viruses resembled each other so closely 
that they had to be related. The article was written in the currently popular 
spirit of demonography: not to praise the person it features but to bury him -- 
to show his weaknesses, his villainous side. Gallo's great failing -- like 
Caesar's, according to Brutus' oratory -- was ambition. (And, yet, how else to 
win a battle against such a virus, if not by single-minded obsession of the 
type ambition provides?) The journalist found colleagues willing to claim that 
Gallo had "hogged the credit for joint discoveries." This was presented as 
evidence that he was the sort of person who would steal a virus and claim to 
have discovered it. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the implication that Gallo had stolen the virus was created to 
fill a requirement of the discourse: In demonography, writers must find 
negative sides of their subjects for readers who enjoy seeing heroes pulled 
down. So the suspicion led to investigation and the investigation became a 
juggernaut that acquired a life of its own, continuing for years after the two 
scientists solved the puzzle of their matching viruses. (A third virus had 
overrun both Montagnier's and Gallo's, carried by samples Montagnier sent to 
Gallo.) 
</P>
<P>
 And so with Whitewater: The investigations themselves are a graver threat to 
the country than any conceivable effects of the behavior they are examining. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure the journalist writing his story on the puzzle of HIV did not intend 
to set AIDS research back by years. One would like to think that Rep. Jim 
Leach, Sens. Alfonse D'Amato and Bob Dole (all Republicans) and the journalists 
pumping up the story do not intend to prevent the government from addressing 
issues like crime, health care and international trade. But that is what they 
are doing. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said he "thought initially it was a one-to-three-week issue, that you'd 
have a hearing and then put it behind us. Now the great challenge is how to 
bring the issue to resolution." Indeed. That, now, is the challenge for us all.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JOEL FOX: WE SHOULD TAX CONSUMPTION, NOT PROPERTY; MICHIGAN IS 
THE LATEST STATE TO COME TO TERMS WITH THIS UNJUST WAY OF RAISING REVENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To hearty applause at the California Education Summit, Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward), president pro tem of the state Senate, suggested that Proposition 
13 be "re-examined" -- meaning property taxes should be increased, especially 
for schools. 
</P>
<P>
 One month later, at a special election in Michigan, 70% of the voters ended 
property-tax funding for schools, increasing the sales tax and cigarette tax as 
a substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 These diametrically opposed positions leave an important question unanswered: 
Whither the property tax? 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, property taxes were a levy on productive land. Those who worked 
the land gave part of their bounty to the feudal lord protecting them. Today, 
in most states, residents are taxed on an arbitrary value of the property. For 
residential property owners, the property tax is nothing more than a tax to be 
paid out of their incomes -- but not based on their incomes. As home values 
increase and earning power remains flat, the onerous aspects of the property 
tax become obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, pressure increased on the property tax nationwide because of 
spiraling education costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan is not alone in trying to peel schools from property-tax support. 
Wisconsin has passed legislation to limit a school district's reliance on 
property taxes. Officials in South Carolina, Vermont, New Hampshire and Rhode 
Island are looking into similar plans. 
</P>
<P>
 California acknowledged the school funding problem earlier than most. The 
sales tax was established in this state to support schools during the 
Depression. Property values were low and the people who lived in those 
properties were broke. They couldn't afford to pay. Sales tax, a tax on 
consumption indicating the buyer had resources to pay, supplemented the 
property tax in school financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Four decades later, the California Supreme Court's Serrano decision of the 
early 1970s recognized that schools relying on local property taxes for revenue 
would end up with unequal funding. Richer communities, like Beverly Hills, 
could offer many more dollars to educate their students than poorer 
communities. In Michigan, under property-tax financing, the poorest districts 
spent $3,200 per student, the richest $10,000.  
</P>
<P>
 California not only leads the nation in recognizing the inadequacies of 
property-tax funding of schools; California voters also recognized the punitive 
effects of unrestricted property taxes on home ownership. For taxpayers, 
property taxes are a poor measure of ability to pay, while forcing the taxpayer 
to use his or her home as collateral against the possibility of not being able 
to pay the taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 While Proposition 13 tried to provide safeguards for the property-tax payer, 
Proposition 13 itself is just a step on the evolutionary path of curtailing and 
perhaps eventually eliminating the property tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many years ago, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher attempted to get 
rid of the property tax entirely. Eliminating the property tax received 
favorable response, but that plan failed when her substitute flat fee, called a 
poll tax, was protested out of existence. 
</P>
<P>
 While actions in the United States have not reached that point yet, clearly, 
the trend is toward diminished importance of the property tax. At most, the tax 
will end up as a tax on property-related services. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, look for Michigan's alternative of consumption taxes to gain 
wider acceptance. It deals successfully with a pragmatic political problem. 
Because of the surging education costs placed on the property-tax bill, many 
senior homeowners are resistant to school tax increases that threaten their 
homeownership. The consumption tax removes the threat to homeowners while 
requiring all to help pay the education bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In some states, there may be a movement toward a split property-tax roll, in 
which commercial property would be taxed at a different rate or assessment 
schedule than residential property. 
</P>
<P>
 The education Establishment has been pushing the business community to get 
behind greater education funding. If business signs on and falls into the trap 
of supporting increased property taxes across the board, more than just the 
changes they propose will end up on the table. It is conceivable that taxpayers 
would support a split-roll plan that would not only squeeze more property taxes 
out of business, but offer property-tax cuts to some homeowners as well. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the question, whither the property tax? there can be only one answer: 
Wither the property tax!

A 'DISCRIMINATORY' TEST THAT'S VALID; LAPD: WOMEN HAVE TO PASS THE WALL TEST AS 
LONG AS PHYSICAL ABILITY, LIKE GOOD EYESIGHT, IS CRUCIAL IN POLICE WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIE L. WILLIAMS, Willie L. Williams is chief of the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much has been said recently about the Los Angeles Police Department "wall," 
which is part of the physical abilities test that police candidates must pass 
in order to be hired. Critics are quick to point out that women have a more 
difficult time scaling the wall than men. Their conclusion is that the wall is 
discriminatory and must be removed as part of the testing process; then the 
LAPD will be able to easily achieve the long-range 43% female hiring goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 To be legally defensible, a personnel test must be validated as job-related. 
If it is not, there is no purpose for that test, regardless of whether it 
discriminates. There are many valid tests that may discriminate against certain 
segments of society. For example, there is no question that police officers 
must be able to see; therefore, we have a minimum visual acuity standard for 
police officers. This legally discriminates against a large portion ofthe 
population, yet no one is calling for an elimination of the eye exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Is ability to scale a 6-foot wall job-related? Without question, the answer is 
yes. Every day, police officers have to climb fences and walls to pursue 
suspects, or to search for evidence or missing children, or any one of a number 
of other reasons. The California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and 
Training mandates that all police officers successfully scale a wall prior to 
completing training. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a belief by some that the role of police officers will change 
dramatically as law enforcement moves toward community policing. Some people 
say that police officers will switch from being crime fighters to problem 
solvers. This is not quite an accurate analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The role of police officers is expanding instead of shifting. Communication 
skills, conflict resolution and problem-solving abilities are becoming more 
critical, and finding effective ways of measuring candidates' abilities in 
these areas is crucial. However, police officers of the future will still be 
required to respond physically to disturbances; physical confrontation will 
always be part of the job. Therefore, physical abilities will always be 
job-related, at least until society changes dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD is committed to increasing representation of women and eliminating 
gender bias. While it is true that female candidates fail the physical 
abilities test at a higher rate than men the first time, they succeed at nearly 
the same rate after being provided remediation. The results show that women can 
pass the wall test. 
</P>
<P>
 Another area of contention is that incumbent officers are not tested on the 
wall; so, if we do not require officers to qualify with the wall throughout 
their careers, why require it initially? It is true that officers are not 
required to pass the physical abilities test after they graduate from the 
Police Academy. In fact, they are not required to take any of the entry-level 
tests after graduation. LAPD officers used to get a periodic medical exam, but 
that was cut in 1978 in a budgetary response to Proposition 13, and there is no 
reason to believe that money is now available to begin re-examining incumbent 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The aging process results in physical abilities deteriorating in everyone, 
including police officers. Since most officers enter the profession in their 
20s, it is natural to expect their abilities to lessen as they reach their 30s 
and 40s. It is legally permissible to establish standards at entry level that 
are higher than what is required for tenured employees. Once again, we can look 
at eyesight for a similar parallel. Visual acuity diminishes with age. 
Entry-level eye standards are tough so that middle-aged officers will still be 
able to perform their duties in a safe, acceptable manner. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Personnel Department is nearing completion of a comprehensive 
validation study of the entry-level police officer testing process. All aspects 
are being carefully evaluated. The Police Department has cooperated fully with 
the study and is eagerly awaiting its results. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD is committed to the mandate that all elements of the testing process 
must be valid. 
</P>
<P>
 What must be remembered is that hiring qualified police officers based on 
job-related criteria is the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety of Los Angeles' residents as well as its police officers must 
remain paramount.

 Boeing Expects Drop in '94 Plane Deliveries: Boeing Co. said it delivered 82 
commercial jetliners in the first quarter and estimated that total 1994 
deliveries will amount to 260 commercial planes.The deliveries, which vary from 
quarter to quarter, depending on airline orders, compare with 330 in all of 
1993 and 441 in 1992. Boeing got orders for just nine new jetliners during the 
quarter. First-quarter deliveries included 39 737s, 15 747s, 16 757s and 12 
767s, Boeing said. The company plans to unveil its latest jetliner, the 777, 
this weekend.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A LOOK THROUGH A SKEWED KALEIDOSCOPE; GLORIA: A NOVEL BY

<P>
 Unreliable narrators are as old as the novel form itself -- characters who 
purport to correct the record, but in their fictional worlds spend much time 
manipulating the reader, justifying their lives and choices. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question that Marvin Stone, the narrator of "Gloria," is 
unreliable, but even on the last page it's impossible to gauge the extent of 
his unreliability.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he's genuinely haunted by the death of his sister at the hands of a 
serial killer, obsessed with his failure to save her . . . yet unable to 
acknowledge fully his complicity in Gloria's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd never guess, given the sophistication and craftiness of its narration, 
that this novel is Mark Coovelis' first. And that's not the only thing making 
"Gloria" a remarkable literary debut: Stone's version of events is ambiguously 
colored, and complicated, by the fact that Gloria has become, posthumously, 
something of a media star -- through the accounts of the journalist-scholar 
Lauren, who seduced Stone to ensure his cooperation with her book on Gloria's 
murder, and that of the killer, Tunney, who prompted Lauren's interest by 
claiming Gloria had participated in his killing spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the film "Rashomon," famous for giving equal credence to various versions 
of a crime, "Gloria" shows us intertwined versions, all reactive to one 
another, none trustworthy. Together they demonstrate that truth is unavoidably 
incomplete, invariably dependent on context and personal interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone, a Berkeley restaurateur, begins his story by explaining that Gloria's 
real name was Elizabeth and that in adulthood, she began to disappear for days 
at a time. At first she lived in Oregon, near her parents and with a family of 
her own, but she eventually abandoned them, moving to the San Francisco area to 
be near her brother (or so Stone speculates). 
</P>
<P>
 Did Gloria want Stone to protect her, as he had not in the past, and even 
though she rarely talked to him? Did she blame him for her rootlessness, for 
her inability to form healthy relationships? 
</P>
<P>
 These are questions that pass through the reader's mind, and sometimes through 
Stone's, although he seems intent on avoiding rather than answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The ideas behind Gloria -- the nature of truth, the distortions inherent in 
storytelling, the strange powers people have over one another -- turn out to be 
more compelling than their execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone's narration, although generally sincere, is also self-protective and 
thus patchwork, fragmentary: He skips frequently from present time to the 
recent past to the distant past, then back to a new present time. Unable, and 
at times unwilling, to give a personal account, Stone quotes extensively from 
Lauren's tape-recorded talks with Tunney, reproduces a long passage from 
Lauren's best-selling book, sets down dramatic scenes from the film based on 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading "Gloria" often feels like looking through a kaleidoscope at an angle: 
It's frustrating as well as tantalizing, for the viewer must wait until a 
center reveals itself, until images resolve into a pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone eventually reveals a secret that may explain Gloria's ill-fated life -- 
a fact he has kept not only from Lauren and the reader, but also, at some 
level, from himself -- yet its disclosure proves a disappointment. Given this 
novel's high literary ambitions, you'd think Coovelis could have found a fresh 
device around which to build Gloria's story. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall impact of "Gloria" isn't compromised by such weaknesses, however, 
because Coovelis' web can withstand the failure of a few threads -- which, in 
any case, are constantly being modified and re-spun. Tunney's account, which 
seems pure fiction at first, eventually is shown to hold some truth; Lauren's 
version is plausible, but Stone, by withholding information, has ensured its 
incompleteness.  
</P>
<P>
 Stone's story, as he intends, is closer to reality: When he writes of Gloria 
in this book's final sentence, "I remember her in the light of truth," the 
reader believes him. For all that, though, the reader is simultaneously 
skeptical, because he recognizes that between what Stone remembers, and what he 
says, there stands a yawning gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gloria" is a good novel because it does one of those things fiction does best 
-- exploring the known as a way of outlining the vast expanse of the unknown.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; STEWART: PLUGGED IN, BUT THE CONNECTION IS WEAK; THE

 When it comes to aging, some pop music artists wear it well. Think of Eric 
Clapton, Neil Young, Lou Reed, Leonard Cohen -- there's a lengthening list of 
performers who are finding ways to deepen their art and preserve their dignity 
as they approach and pass the half-century mark. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not so easy for Rod Stewart. His initial appeal in the late '60s and 
early '70s was based on a youthful bravado that would be unseemly to revive at 
age 49. He's not primarily a songwriter, so he can't really develop that side 
of things. What to do? 
</P>
<P>
 The solution that Stewart has proposed on his current tour -- which came to 
the Anaheim Pond on Sunday and ends its run there tonight after nine months on 
the road -- is a frantically paced arena-rock vehicle that drives him at high 
speed away from his remaining viable strength -- as a vocal interpreter.

 Sunday's two-hour-plus concert was so pumped up that it left him no room to 
breathe. "Every Picture Tells a Story," from 1971, is his pinnacle as a 
songwriter and a pretty indestructible song, but Stewart rushed through it as 
if he thought its essence is its hammering beat rather than its wry, picaresque 
coming-of-age narrative. He seemed utterly detached from the story the song 
tells. 
</P>
<P>
 That's pretty much how it went as Stewart operated from a stage planted like a 
boxing ring in the center of the arena's floor. Sitting on a stool on a raised 
platform for the softer stuff and working the edges on the rockers, he served 
up an indiscriminate set of everything from his disco dreck to his appealingly 
warm, mainstream ballads to old soul and rock 'n' roll hits. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 His voice has lost some of its pliancy with the years, but it still has that 
great raspy texture, full of longing and ache. But the impersonal, flavorless 
sound of his band didn't really allow him to reach into the songs and reveal 
their essence, and moments of real conviction were fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake, it was a crowd-pleasing show. But it was a panorama without 
context or taste, geared toward satisfying an audience's presumed requirements 
rather than establishing a purposeful artist's agenda. The retrospective 
emphasis only underscored the lack of current creative vitality in a career 
that's doing fine commercially, thanks at the moment to the success of his 
"Unplugged" album. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times, as Stewart navigated the stage and worked the crowd, that he 
seemed genuinely to connect with the audience, and his face would light up with 
pleasure and surprise. But the moment would pass and he'd seem almost regretful 
that it was time to race to the other side or go off and change costumes. There 
used to be self-mockery in his swagger, but now his movements telegraph an 
almost desperate need for adulation.

 The BBC's Holocaust Silence: KCRW-FM (89.9) observes the nationwide Holocaust 
Remembrance Week with its broadcast at 12:25 p.m. today of "The Unspeakable 
Atrocity," a half-hour BBC documentary investigating the BBC's own censorship 
role in refusing to air any information about German concentration camps during 
the Holocaust. Today's broadcast marks the U.S. premiere of the program, which 
won a prestigious Peabody Award last week. TELEVISION

 Dixie's New Pilot: Former "Designing Women" star Dixie Carter will star in 
"Her Honor," a CBS pilot to be co-executive produced by Carter and former 
"Designing Women" head writer and executive producer Pam Norris. The pilot will 
be the first project for Carter's newly formed company, Little Lambs 
Productions, which also aims to produce additional TV series, 
movies-of-the-week and home videos. Carter says that she formed the company, 
named after a family term of endearment, to "put together truly entertaining 
television fare that two or even three generations in the same family can watch 
together without embarrassment. I don't believe trashy content is a requisite 
of a funny or touching or compelling program."

THEATER REVIEW; FINDING LOVE, STRENGTH IN SISTERHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The heat is unbearable, and the deadline is almost past. The product is due, 
the equipment isn't paid for and La Migra may be at the door. What else is 
there to do but strip down to your undies and dance? 
</P>
<P>
 In "Real Women Have Curves," humor is survival and in sisterhood there is 
strength. Five Latinas toil in an East Los Angeles sweatshop, working overtime 
to finish an order of petite pink satin dresses. Their task underscores their 
plight: They can neither afford nor fit into these frocks. It's a metaphor for 
their new American life. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also have universal female concerns, from cellulite to contraception, 
anorexia to abortion, sexual obligation to spousal abuse. In a powerful display 
of feminist defiance, they bare their flawed bodies and celebrate their unity, 
individuality and potential to pursue the American dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Josefina Lopez created the autobiographical piece five years ago, 
when she was 19. It's a touching, humorous memory play, a loving look at 
hard-working immigrant women. Through her alter ego, Ana, Lopez preaches 
empowerment. At San Diego Repertory Theatre, Lopez plays Ana. Like the title 
character in Lopez's "Simply Maria," Ana doesn't feel she belongs in her 
mundane world; she wants to be a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her diary readings make the implicit unnecessarily explicit. Not quite 
trusting her audience, Lopez hammers home the lessons of her play. This, like 
the overabundance of issues, may be attributed to youth. But there is 
confidence and maturity in her snappy dialogue and her ability to create real 
characters with real concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The play demands ensemble work, which was not yet evident on opening night. 
But the warmth and camaraderie grew during the evening. Director William 
Alejandro Virchis has given a lot of latitude to his cast. Lopez the actor is 
not as convincing as Lopez the playwright, but very strong performances are 
turned in by Roxane Carrasco as the oversexed Rosali and Lupe Ontiveros as 
Ana's hilarious mother, Carmen. 
</P>
<P>
 John Iacovelli has designed a deliciously detailed set, suitably lit by Brenda 
Berry. Dione Lebhar's costumes befit the characters, but Debby Van Poucke's 
sound design is unimaginative. Here the text, rightfully, takes center stage. 
In a modulated, less strident voice, playwright Lopez continues to challenge 
the sexual-political status quo, not just for Latinas, but for all real women. 
</P>

POP ALBUM REVIEW; FLOYD FAMILIAR, IF NOT IN PINK

 ** 1/2 "To martyr yourself to caution is not gonna help at all," sings David 
Gilmour; he's talking about the ways of love, and we know what he means. Had he 
only heeded his own words when it came to this, Pink Floyd's first album in 
seven years, the hallmark of which would have to be caution aplenty.(It's due 
in stores today.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Gilmour reconvened the band in the wake of the acrimonious split 
with Roger Waters, Floyd has been busy going about the business of being Floyd 
-- that is, re-creating best-remembered sonic elements without anything like 
the artistic leaps from album to album that characterized the band's '70s 
prime. Thus you get the slightly funky "What Do You Want From Me," which feels 
like "Have a Cigar" redux, or "Keep Talking," which employs "Another 
Brick"-like riffing, plus several "Shine On"-style instrumental passages. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a comfortingly wistful sound, and Gilmour's airy singing and 
economically bluesy guitar leads are perennially lovely, if drummer Nick Mason 
and keyboardist Rick Wright are by now dead weight. Gilmour's lyrics focus on 
the personal politics of separation with a mixture of sweet-seeming, regretful 
idealism and semantic clumsiness. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

TV REVIEW; 'KEVORKIAN FILES' PROBES DEATH ETHICS; PBS' EXAMINATION OF THE 
CONTROVERSIAL PATHOLOGIST AND HIS PATIENTS SHOWS THEM ALL TO BE DRIVEN BY 
STRONG BELIEF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Between the lines of "Frontline's" report, "The Kevorkian Files," is the 
notion that Dr. Jack Kevorkian represents an attitude toward death unacceptable 
in a predominantly death-denying culture. Producer Michael Kirk's account of 
the doctor notorious for his "death machine," his suicide-driven clientele and 
his incessant faceoffs with the courts suggests that there's something much 
deeper here than headline-grabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 As a trained pathologist, Kevorkian could have quietly plied his craft. For 
decades, however, he appears to have linked his training with the knack of an 
experimental scientist. He studied eye movements in hospital patients at the 
moment of death. He published articles calling for organ donations and 
transplants from death-row inmates and blood transfusions from dead to wounded 
soldiers in the field. He even painted death imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian was persona non grata in the U.S. medical Establishment long before 
the death machine, and in the numerous video recordings shown here of his 
consultations with patients before their suicides, it's easy to sense Kevorkian 
getting his ammunition together for another battle. Perhaps the Kevorkian 
presented in "Files" is pathological about pathology, but he also seems driven 
by the faith of his patients that they are both doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the story are accounts of key patient histories, from Alzheimer's 
victim Janet Adkins' case (which triggered the first murder indictment against 
the doctor) to the more mysterious case of Marjorie Wantz, whose maladies 
couldn't be detected by the medical examiner who did her autopsy. Friends and 
family members uniformly express a mixture of sadness and relief as they recall 
their loved ones' suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not seem concerned by the ethical problems of the Wantz case and 
others, just as some of the doctors interviewed do not seem concerned by the 
patients' demands for some kind of release from their pain. Kevorkian may or 
may not be performing some form of quackery; at the same time, these patients' 
medical desires can't be callously dismissed as merely seeking quick fixes. 
</P>
<P>
 We never hear from Kevorkian's most virulent critics, those allied with the 
anti-abortion movement. Instead, a doctor who has also assisted a patient with 
dying speaks for those in the conflicted middle on the issue. Dr. Timothy Quill 
is often unsure of Kevorkian's means and ends, but he dramatically concludes 
that this "File" of patients is actually a condemnation of doctors unwilling to 
help those in their direst hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did these people have to resort to Kevorkian? Where, Quill asks, were 
these people's doctors? 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Kevorkian Files" airs on "Frontline" tonight at 9 p.m. on KCET-TV 
Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15, and at 8:30 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24.

 Bankruptcy case -- Because of a bankruptcy filing error, The Times reported 
March 29 that Stewart Typesetters Inc. had been listed as part of a personal 
bankruptcy filing involving Perry and Barbara Stewart. In fact, Stewart 
Typesetters is not in bankruptcy and has nothing to do with the Stewarts' 
bankruptcy case, and an attorney has since amended the filing to clarify that.

THE WEEK AHEAD: JERUSALEM; A NATION REMEMBERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the sirens wail throughout Israel on Wednesday morning , pedestrians will 
freeze in mid-step, cars will brake to a stop and factories will pause as the 
Jewish state stands silent for a minute of contemplation, memorial and unity. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Holocaust Day in Israel, the day designated to recall the destruction of 
a third of European Jewry at the hands of the Nazis during the 1930s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Holocaust Day in Israel is remarkably secular in its commemorations. Radio and 
television air mournful music punctuated by daylong first-person accounts from 
survivors. Movie theaters are closed for 24 hours from sundown tonight, an 
irony this year since "Schindler's List," the Oscar-winning account of the 
Holocaust, will be closed to the throngs that have flocked to see it since the 
film opened here last month.

 A cease-fire announced by the Irish Republican Army is scheduled to begin at 
midnight tonight in Northern Ireland and last for three days, the same length

 Gerry Adams, leader of the political arm of the IRA, called on the British to 
engage in talks during the cease-fire in an effort to end the violence in 
Northern Ireland.But British authorities so far insist that the government will 
only engage in direct talks with Sinn Fein or the IRA three months after 
attacks cease in British-ruled Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Cahal Daly, Roman Catholic primate of all Ireland, appealed to the 
IRA to extend the cease-fire to let the peace process, initiated by London and 
Dublin, continue.

MARKET SCENE; 'KILLER' BEES MAKE HONEY OF A DEAL WITH BRAZIL; PRODUCTION HAS 
SOARED SINCE THE ORNERY INVADERS TOOK OVER BEEKEEPERS' HIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAC MARGOLIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When this summer rolls around in Southern California, the season may bring 
more than hot weather and bougainvillea. Migrating steadily northward for 
years, swarms of Africanized "killer" bees have crossed the Rio Grande into 
Texas. Large colonies have already been spotted in Arizona and are expected to 
reach California this fall, perhaps sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 American authorities are waging war at the front, trying desperately to trap 
and kill the winged aliens. But here in Brazil, where the notorious migration 
began, beekeepers in prosperous farming communities are enjoying another 
fruitful season of honey production. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the Africanized bees arrived, beekeeping was a hobby in Brazil," said 
Lionel Goncalves, a geneticist at the University of Sao Paulo's rural campus in 
Riberao Preto, Latin America's leading research center for apiculture -- the 
process of raising bees for honey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it is a thriving business," said Goncalves. Honey production in Brazil 
has increased from about 6,500 tons a year, before the arrival of African bees, 
to 40,000 tons a year today. 
</P>
<P>
 The bees that are terrifying North Americans are the direct descendants of 26 
queens from Africa that Brazilian entomologist Warwick Kerr imported for 
research purposes in 1956, then accidentally released. Until then, it was 
European bees, brought by Brazil's Old World immigrants, that dominated the 
apiaries here. Then came a genetic coup d'etat, a case of what Alfred W. 
Crosby, an environmental historian from the University of Texas at Austin has 
called "ecological imperialism." 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller, faster African bees out-flew their Italian and German rivals and 
mated with the European queens. So, in a few generations, Brazil's bee 
population was almost entirely "Africanized." These bees, known in 
entomological shorthand as Africanized Honey Bees, or AHBs, flourish in 
tropical climates, where they quickly dominate other bee colonies, but are not 
known to advance into colder regions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Africanized bees are far more agile and aggressive than their larger, 
lumbering European counterparts. Bee for bee, they are no more ornery or 
venomous than European bees, but they are renowned for attacking in strength, 
and occasionally stinging to death, any intruders on their turf. Pursuing their 
prey for up to half a mile, they have terrorized farmers, killed thousands of 
livestock and reportedly stung to death as many as a thousand people in the 
past three decades throughout the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was this untoward behavior that became the stuff of horror movies and 
screaming tabloid articles and earned these insects their fearsome moniker. 
</P>
<P>
 But these killers do not faze Pedro de Assis Caetano. Dressed in padded white 
overalls and a nylon-netted hood, Caetano plucked a dusky honey bee off the 
back of a fellow worker and placed it on his own bare forearm. The angry bee 
lowered its abdomen, unsheathed its stinger and squeezed a yellowish venom into 
the exposed flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 "See how he pumps?" said Caetano, casually waving a gloved hand through a 
buzzing black cloud of bees. "He only stops when all the venom is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 If this had been a Hollywood movie set, Caetano would be writhing on the 
ground, mugging for the camera in a fit of fatal anaphylactic shock. So it is 
in the 1978 horror film, "The Swarm," in which killer bee attacks claim 37,000 
lives, provoke the explosion of a nuclear power plant and set all of Houston 
ablaze. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was a thriving commercial apiary in bucolic Riberao Preto, Brazilian 
honey country and for more than three decades the home of the scutellata bee 
species -- the Africanized honey bee. Caetano, who works eight hours a day 
collecting honey from the combs of these dreaded bugs, said he is stung so 
often -- normally, 30 or 40 times a day -- that he has developed an immunity to 
the venom. "I don't even feel it anymore," he shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Brazilian beekeepers are so ready to offer up bare flesh to the bees. 
Yet after more than three decades of working with Africanized bees, Brazilian 
scientists and apiculturists say the Africanized bees are more feared than they 
are understood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call these bees defensive not aggressive," said geneticist Goncalves. "In 
the first years, we had a lot of trouble with these bees, but now beekeepers 
prefer the Africanized bees." 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, as in other countries, the takeover by Africanized bees at first 
threw beekeepers into a state of confusion, if not panic, and as they learned 
to deal with the invasion their honey production tumbled. Here it fell from 
6,500 tons in 1957 to 4,120 tons in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, however, man and bee came to terms, and honey output climbed steadily 
to about 40,000 tons last year, making Brazil the world's seventh-largest 
producer and the third in Latin America behind Mexico and Argentina. There are 
some European bees surviving in the temperate latitudes of South America -- in 
Argentina, Chile and Uruguay -- but in subtropical and tropical countries like 
Brazil, the Africanized bees reign. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the apiculturists, the Africanized bees have the advantage of 
being faster and more efficient pollinators and collectors of nectar, and so 
produce far more honey than the European bees. 
</P>
<P>
 Manoel Tavares Ferreira, who has worked with Africanized bees for three 
decades, said that when he started in beekeeping as a boy in the 1960s, his 
Italian bee colonies produced about 44 pounds of honey per hive per year. Then 
came the more vigorous Africanized bees, and Tavares' pastime became a cottage 
industry and then a going business. He calls it Apis Flora. 
</P>
<P>
 His home on the edge of Riberao Preto is something of a monument to his 
metier. Daily, his work teams haul in truckloads of combs to Apis Flora, a 
processing factory and wholesale store installed in the basement of his 
two-story house, which is made with honey-colored bricks and hexagonally shaped 
windows that look like cells of a beehive. With his downy brown beard and 
mustache, Tavares has even taken on a bee-like aspect himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got stung a lot at first, but now we know how to manage the Africanized 
bees," he said fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares' bees produce an average of 138 pounds of honey per hive per year, 
more than three times the average output of the European bees. Some of his 
African queens reign over super-colonies, which turn out better than 220 pounds 
a hive annually.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Tavares' 980 hives yielded 52.4 tons of honey and total sales of $1.2 
million. Working with entomologists, Tavares said he hopes by 1995 to produce 
kinder bees and still maintain high productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 North Americans have known about the inevitable migration of the Africanized 
bee into the subtropical zones of the United States since the late 1960s. A 
1972 report of the National Academy of Sciences concluded that the Brazilian 
bee was "dangerous to people and animals and is difficult to manage," and 
recommended exterminating the Africanized Honey Bees. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, U.S. agriculture authorities have occasionally asked scientists in 
Brazil about the nature of the AHBs. "Many people take advantage of the 
sensationalism and fear to win research funding," said David de Jong, an 
American entomologist at the university apiculture center in Riberao Preto. 
"But they never once came to us for management solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than trying to trap and kill the bees, he said, American officials 
ought to be working with local beekeepers to teach them how to manage the 
Africanized bees and educate the public on how to stay out of harm's way. "It's 
no good to get dressed up in a moon suit and have your neighbors stung," said 
De Jong. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the answer may be, paradoxically, to encourage the keeping of 
Africanized bees. "The absence of apiaries will favor the spread of wild bee 
colonies, which will nest in trees, fields and homes," said De Jong. "That 
could really cause some problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if they wanted to, it is doubtful that authorities could stop the 
Africanized bee Anschluss. Everywhere they have gone in the tropics, these bees 
have toppled European colonies and established their own empires. But while 
Texans tremble, and Californians soon may, beekeepers in Central and South 
America have learned to live with, and even covet, their invaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares' Apis Flor has plans to create an African queen bank, to preserve and 
then sell the best-producing stock. At one apiculture fair in southern Brazil, 
an Africanized queen bee was auctioned off at the startling price of about 
$400. By contrast, a European queen sells on the commercial market for about $7 
to $8. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico took a cue from the Brazilians and recently placed orders for 100,000 
African queens from Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Historically, when Africanized bees arrive, societies suffer," said De Jong. 
"Then they get used to them." Brazil's Honey Production Estimates, in tons:

 1957*: 6,500

 1967: 7,300

WORLD VIEW; DEALING WITH JAPAN; TWO WAYS TO CUT A TRADE DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was almost exactly five years ago that France's then-minister of European 
affairs, Edith Cresson, lectured a pair of American reporters about the abysmal 
U.S. trade deficit with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans don't see what's going on with the Japanese," she insisted. "They 
are like ants, eating you up. You just don't notice it, don't feel it, don't 
see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing, she added, "We plan to be firm with the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Europeans did try firmness. 
</P>
<P>
 They worked to keep a tight control on Japan's auto exports, with France and 
Italy resorting to especially tight quotas to guard their domestic industries. 
Since 1989, the European Union has launched 26 anti-dumping actions against 
Tokyo, charging the Japanese with unfair pricing practices. Occasionally, EU 
member countries even took a page out of the Japanese book of 
subtle-but-effective non-tariff barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 French customs authorities, for example, quietly decreed that all imported 
Japanese videocassette recorders be cleared at Poitiers, a city nearly 100 
miles from the nearest port and staffed by a single customs inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 The collective impact of these measures, however, hardly dented the Japanese 
trade juggernaut. 
</P>
<P>
 For Europeans, as for Americans, the imports kept growing, Japan's home market 
remained closed and trade deficits soared. 
</P>
<P>
 But as a frustrated United States reaches for a hammer to resolve its trade 
disputes with Tokyo, the Europeans are now trying the kid-gloves approach. 
</P>
<P>
 While Washington has opted to revive its feared "Super 301" legislation, 
giving President Clinton the ability to impose sanctions against Japan, and has 
forced showdowns with Tokyo in areas such as cellular telephones and 
semiconductors, the Europeans are engaging the Japanese in a conspicuously 
quiet dialogue to coax the Asian industrial giant toward greater openness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree with the Americans' goal (to reduce Japan's trade surpluses by 
opening the Japanese domestic market) but not their means," said Peter 
Guilford, the EU's chief spokesman on trade matters. "The Americans give the 
impression they can't venture out the door (on trade matters) without a gun and 
holster." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hardly surprising that the Europeans have changed tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since Cresson vowed firmness, the European Union's cumulative 
trade deficit with Japan has reached $142 billion -- a figure even greater than 
the American imbalance with Japan when expressed as a percentage of total 
trade. 
</P>
<P>
 (Taken together, Japan's trade surpluses with the United States and the 
European Union, the world's two other great industrial trading powers, total 
$384.5 billion for the past five years.) 
</P>
<P>
 While the EU's trade imbalance with Japan declined slightly in 1993, few see 
it as the start of an encouraging trend. And there are other problems. For 
instance, Japanese direct investment in the 12 EU states was running at about 
15 times the rate of European investment in Japan the last time it was 
measured, two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the present European strategy is a so-called trade assessment 
mechanism (TAM) in which groups of Japanese and Europeans review the flow of 
trade in about 30 specific product areas, then trouble-shoot if there are 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 15 months since they were established, the groups have met eight times 
in either Tokyo or Brussels, with many of the initial sessions devoted to such 
basics as statisticians from both sides explaining methods and databases. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been an intensive exercise," noted Tetsuo Yamashita, a senior trade 
specialist at Japan's mission to the EU. "People have gotten to know each other 
well. We're hoping for a positive outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to keep the TAMs away from the public eye, both sides have 
agreed to a virtual news blackout on the contents of the talks -- refusing, for 
example, even to name the product areas under discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The first real proof of the TAMs' effectiveness, however, is expected to come 
toward the end of next month, when EU Trade Commissioner Leon Brittan travels 
to Tokyo to discuss with Japanese leaders what action the results of their 
discussions require. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts believe the Europeans could benefit from the intensity of 
Japan's dispute with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese will be under pressure to do something," declared an EU trade 
official. "They've got to show that there's a softer way to resolve these 
issues, that something less than browbeating works." 
</P>
<P>
 Europeans, it seems, have decided to coax Japanese markets open with praise 
rather than prod with criticism. As the EU applauded the modest market-opening 
measures announced by Tokyo last week as a "positive first step," U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor dismissed the package as "half-finished work" with 
few specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 The package included pledges to further stimulate Japanese domestic demand and 
reform government purchasing procedures, presently biased toward domestic 
suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Europeans employ such a low-profile strategy reflects the 
very different images Japan has in Europe and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its steady inroads, Japan still accounts for only about 10% of the EU 
nations' total foreign trade. Partly because of this, Japan-bashing has yet to 
become a political sport here. In the United States, the Japanese percentage of 
total American foreign trade runs around 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, since the collapse of the Iron Curtain in 1989, West European 
politicians have been far more preoccupied with the potential trade impact of 
the new, low-wage democracies on their eastern doorstep than with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent to which the Europeans have tried to distance themselves from the 
latest U.S. clashes with Japan was underscored in recent comments by Brittan, 
who described the American approach of setting numerical targets for specific 
products variously as counterproductive and discriminatory, "incompatible with 
Europe and America's mutual commitment to free trade and multilateralism," he 
huffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent European economists tend to support the EU's tactics, at least for 
the present. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experience has shown that Japan only reacts to pressure, but that pressure 
can't just be brutal demands," said Helmut Laumer, a director of the 
Munich-based Ifo Institute for Economic Research. "The consciousness in Japan 
has grown enormously that something has to be done. Now is the time to work 
carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Said James Rosenstein, spokesman for the Brussels-based Assn. of European 
Automobile Producers: "We agree with this general approach. Most Europeans 
don't like managed trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the criticism of American tactics, however, Brittan and other EU trade 
officials have begun to talk about a trilateral approach to the problem, in 
which they would work with the Clinton Administration and Japan on the trade 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 But they claim that Washington has so far failed to share information from its 
contacts with Tokyo that, they say, is necessary for any greater U.S.-EU 
cooperation. Some question the sincerity of American calls for closer 
coordination. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain suspicion that the Americans only want some cover and 
international respectability for Japan-bashing," commented Guilford, the EU 
trade spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The American ambassador to the European Union, Stuart Eizenstat, denies that 
the United States is withholding information on its talks with Japan. He said 
in an interview that "a rather intensive exchange" of data has already begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the EU) may not be fully satisfied with the detail they've gotten, but 
the process has begun and it's continuing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eizenstat also cited two key factors that could drive the EU into closer 
cooperation with Washington on the Japan issue. 
</P>
<P>
 * Europe's deepest recession since the 1930s has generated an urgent need to 
create more export-led jobs. Opening up the large and rich Japanese domestic 
market could help do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 * Data gathered during the TAMs process could convince Europeans that their 
products are running into the same trade barriers that American goods have hit 
in trying to penetrate Japanese markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They haven't come to any final conclusions yet, (but) they are beginning to 
recognize -- as we have -- that many of the problems are not of their own 
making," Eizenstat said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are also signs that even supporters of the EU's less confrontational 
tactics are growing impatient for results as the deficit with Japan persists. 
</P>
<P>
 While negotiators from the EU and Japan last month concluded an agreement that 
offers Japanese auto makers a slight increase (to about 12%) in their share of 
the huge EU market in 1994, there has been little progress in Japan's 
commitment to open its auto market to European cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Automobiles, the biggest single item in the EU's trade with Japan, also 
constitute roughly one-third of the EU's 1993 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "At present, it's all for them and nothing for us," said Rosenstein, the 
spokesman for the European auto makers. "In a reasonable world, European 
producers should be able to get about 10% of the Japanese market, when we're 
now getting about 2%. We're entirely dissatisfied with this." 
</P>

THE WEEK AHEAD: NEW DELHI; THE TALBOTT MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With U.S. relations with Pakistan and India at a low point, the State 
Department's No. 2 official jets to the region this week for some fence mending 
and horse trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit of Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, due in New Delhi on 
Wednesday and Islamabad on Friday, is intended to personify high-level White 
House commitment to the two countries, which have felt ignored by the Clinton 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is trying to broker a three-party deal to promote nuclear 
non-proliferation on the subcontinent. It wants to deliver F-16 fighters to 
Pakistan in exchange for a verifiable cap on Pakistan's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 To win Indian assent, Talbott, a friend of President Clinton, may be carrying 
promises of greater Indian access to American-made high-tech wares.

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; BOSNIAN VILLAGE GOES FROM RAGS TO RICHES -- AND BACK; 
MEDJUGORJE ENJOYED A RELIGIOUS TOURIST BOOM IN THE 1980S UNTIL WAR DROVE AWAY 
THE VISITORS. NOW U.N. TROOPS CAMP THERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the boom time of the late 1980s, when Medjugorje's only paved 
thoroughfare was bumper to bumper with air-conditioned buses, that convinced 
Nikola Karacic to move from the tourist town of Mostar to this desolate 
highland village. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman Catholic pilgrims were then arriving by the hundreds, even thousands, 
most days, to walk the hallowed hilltop where six Croatian children claimed to 
have seen and conversed with the Virgin Mary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business was good then," recalls Karacic, a 27-year-old pizzeria owner, who 
jumped into the development frenzy that has transformed tiny Medjugorje from a 
dirt-farming backwater to a neon-lighted center of commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 But the change inflicted on Medjugorje by the vision and the flood of 
religious tourists that followed was just the first of many chaotic 
transformations for the people of this village. Their lives have been tethered 
to the juggernaut of recent East European history. 
</P>
<P>
 Medjugorje has been on a 13-year roller-coaster ride, rocketing to fame and 
fortune as a place of pilgrimage after the children's vision of 1981, only to 
crash into tourist doldrums three years ago, when war began to consume the 
surrounding territory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decade between boom and bust, the village, like all of the former 
Yugoslavia, watched its political structure and security crumble as the 
Communist federation fractured. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the site of one of the largest U.N. peacekeeping deployments in the 
Balkans and a front-line bivouac for aid workers and the Western press, 
Medjugorje has had to adjust to its latest role as a military staging ground. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,400 Spanish troops and military observers of the U.N. command have 
set up camp at the foot of the rocky hill where the purported vision occurred. 
The mission has swallowed a cluster of whitewashed bungalows that housed 
religious pilgrims. It now serves as a barracks for U.N. soldiers trying to 
sort out one facet of Bosnia's three-sided war. 
</P>
<P>
 While the peacekeepers' number would seem to compensate for the lost pilgrim 
traffic that came in spring and summer, Medjugorje residents whose livelihoods 
were built around the restaurant, souvenir and hotel patronage of the religious 
tourists complain that the soldiers rarely venture outside their compound. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get any business from them," grouses taxi driver Stipe Sego. "They 
just stay at their base all night. We hardly ever see them." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not entirely a bad thing, in the view of some villagers who feel war 
and hardship have further burdened a simple community that had already been 
sent reeling by the influx of foreigners spurred by the apparition. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilja Culjak, for instance, worked at a nearby textile factory for 30 years to 
augment the meager proceeds of the family farm run by her husband, daughter and 
three sons. But an artillery shell destroyed the factory during the early days 
of the Serbian rebellion against Bosnian independence. So she turned to making 
lace doilies and tablecloths in hopes of selling them to the trickle of 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are nervous. They're afraid to come here -- they think they'll be 
shot," laments Culjak, who says she is on the verge of abandoning lace-making. 
</P>
<P>
 The rocky landscape outside Medjugorje has been repopulated by locals who once 
made their living taking in tourists or working in the gaudy strip of 
restaurants, shops and bars. They have returned to the fields that in 
pre-apparition years at least fed them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some here are heartened by what appears to be yet another change on the 
horizon. A U.S.-brokered peace pact announced March 1 in Washington has 
triggered movement toward reuniting Bosnian Croats and Muslims who had been 
battling for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Mostar, the heavy artillery that had been blasting Muslims has 
fallen silent, and residents in both halves of the segregated city are allowing 
themselves thoughts of reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 If the peace lasts and Western promises of assistance in rebuilding the 
economy are fulfilled, reconstruction could get under way on the accommodations 
and revered monuments that drew tourists to this area for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostar's Stari Most, or Old Bridge, for which the riverfront city was named, 
was one of the former Yugoslavia's most popular tourist sites and a symbol of 
the Balkan marriage of Eastern and Western culture. The 400-year-old limestone 
relic of the Ottoman Empire was damaged during a two-month artillery barrage by 
Serbian rebels in 1992, then finished off by Croatian nationalists during an 
attack on the Muslim-held east bank last October. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is going to be a lot better here soon," says Divna Lovric, a 
23-year-old shop clerk selling souvenirs along Medjugorje's business strip. "It 
is in everyone's interest to preserve the peace, because otherwise the 
foreigners won't come back here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some Catholic pilgrims have continued to visit, despite the dangers of a 
nearby war, and they too express hope for a new wave of prosperity for 
Medjugorje. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere is already much better here, because there used to be 
communism, and now that's gone," says H'Eloise Cunningham of Bozeman, Mont., 
visiting with a religious tour group. 
</P>
<P>
 The war, if it really is over, hasn't left without traces. Most local families 
saw their fighting-age males drafted into the Bosnian Croat army that first 
deflected Serbian rebel attacks, then succumbed to fighting with Muslim allies 
over control of the sparse Bosnian territory that was left. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those who lost loved ones, the war will never really be over," says 
Karacic, the pizzeria owner, who counts himself among the fortunate for having 
lost only his home to the shelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think everyone is hoping that this stage of our lives is over and we 
can get back to working."

CULTURE; FAMILY LAW; PALESTINIANS IN ISRAELI-OCCUPIED LANDS TURN TO TRIBAL 
TRADITIONS FOR JUSTICE, LEAVING THE PLO AND MILITARY OFFICIALS ON THE 
SIDELINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Suppose you're a Palestinian cruising through this historic city, chosen to be 
the capital of a new Palestinian enclave. Then some menacing-looking guy with a 
black-and-white head scarf and an attitude plows into your car. Who are you 
going to call? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to that question says much about justice these days in the 
Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories. 
</P>
<P>
 If you answered the Israeli military police, try again. Ditto for the 
Palestine Liberation Organization's local office. Or the sheik at the local 
mosque. Or even a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, when there's trouble afoot in Jericho, Abu Ghazi's the man to see. 
Patriarch of the powerful Kaabneh tribe, he holds court in the reception room 
off his garden, where he dispenses advice on resolving everything from 
fender-benders to home burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jericho, his word has the force of law in a way the Israeli military 
authorities never had. And as the chaos and confusion of the transition to 
Palestinian self-rule evolve, the time-honored prescriptions of Abu Ghazi's 
tribal traditions are questioned by almost no one. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody stole your VCR? Get him and his father in front of Abu Ghazi and get 
them to give it back to you, plus an apology. Trying to subdivide your land as 
the pre-autonomy real estate boom hits Jericho? Get Abu Ghazi to sort it out 
with your neighbors. Husband not paying his alimony? The tribe, backed by the 
PLO popular committees, will talk him into making payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put our face into the fight, and immediately the fighting stops," Abu 
Ghazi explained in a recent interview. "As Palestinians living under 
occupation, there has been an increase in the number of cases handled under 
tribal law, because we don't want an Israeli who is our enemy to be our 
arbitrator." 
</P>
<P>
 As Israeli authorities' ability -- and willingness -- to intervene in local 
disputes wanes on the approach to Palestinian autonomy in Jericho and the Gaza 
Strip, PLO officials admit that in the time before a Palestinian police force 
arrives, they have been unable to take on the job completely themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Jericho itself wavers on the edge of the frustration that comes with 
continuing delays in the autonomy plan, PLO leaders say they have been more 
than willing, in the interim, to hand over most civil enforcement to tribal 
traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a society centered on the family from birth until death, the extension of 
families into tribes has long formed a foundation of Arab society. Political 
power and business success are often more a function of a person's last name 
than his skills in entrepreneurship or speechmaking. In Arab societies from 
Palestine to the Gulf undergoing modernization at a dizzying pace, the old 
tribal leaders and traditions remain constant reservoirs of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tribal law has always existed. It was inactive during the intifada (the 
Palestinian uprising), but now it has been reactivated because Israeli 
authorities are refusing to investigate crimes," said Abu Maxim, spokesman for 
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine in Jericho. "We are resorting 
to tribal law because we don't have any other mechanisms to handle these 
crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Adnan Hamad -- who leads the Palestinian Democratic Union in Jericho, a 
pro-peace-plan PLO faction -- said PLO officials fear Jericho could descend 
into the turbulence seen in the Gaza Strip if local political leaders are not 
able to deal with the widening dissatisfaction. That fear has grown in the wake 
of the February massacre by a Jewish settler of dozens of Palestinians at a 
Hebron mosque, which has sent violent shock waves throughout the occupied West 
Bank.  
</P>
<P>
 "Things aren't as difficult here as they are in Gaza, but there is a change," 
Hamad said, noting that an initial sense of euphoria in Jericho has given way 
to impatience. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Sept. 13 when the agreement was signed, when there was a quarrel between 
two people, they just smiled and it's finished," he noted. "Now, any single 
problem becomes a big one, and there is a crowd in the street, shouting and 
fighting. . . . What we want is to prevent people from hurting each other, and 
to make people quiet and do their business in the little time that we have" 
before a final agreement on Palestinian autonomy begins to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the autonomy agreement is signed -- possibly within the next few weeks -- 
Palestinians in Gaza and Jericho will be subject to a new national authority 
appointed by the PLO, with an elected ruling council to succeed it within a 
matter of months. Gradually, civil rule in Palestinian population centers 
throughout the West Bank will come under the new authority's purview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, the people for years have felt there is no authority, and the new 
authority we're going to have is not yet here," said Hamad. "A lot of disputes 
that were suspended during the intifada , especially land disputes, have come 
to the front of the picture now. With all this traffic, we had 20 car accidents 
last month, with two killed. What do we do? We are using what we call 
traditional law, a law that has always worked for the Arabs throughout 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Palestinians point to an example last month in neighboring Jordan, 
where King Hussein, in tribal tradition, sat down the quarreling parties of 
North Yemen and South Yemen to seek a truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal laws have even found their way into cosmopolitan East Jerusalem, where 
the frenetic activity to win a piece of the action as peace dawns has put many 
an Arab businessman's nerves on edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanna Ghazzawi, whose Petra Rental Cars leases most automobiles in the 
occupied territories, had sold a car to another businessman, who didn't like it 
and brought it back. Insinuations about the transaction flew on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Ghazzawi's sons were attacked one night outside a restaurant. The 
attackers, the boys said, were from the Abu Aysha family -- one of Palestine's 
largest and the one that had been involved in the sour car deal. The two sons 
roared over to the Abu Aysha family businesses and smashed up more than 30 cars 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli police in Jerusalem sent three vehicles to sort out the mess. Officers 
took reports and left at 11:30 p.m. Then the real work started. Abu Yacoub, 
patriarch of the Sharabati tribe, was called in for a full rundown on the case 
and left at 2 a.m. for the Abu Aysha house, where he negotiated a three-day 
truce. 
</P>
<P>
 Abu Yacoub later went to the diwaniyya , the traditional Arab reception and 
meeting place, of Abu Aysha. The Abu Ayshas said they weren't prepared to start 
talking until Ghazzawi put up 200,000 Israeli shekels, almost $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We paid the 200,000 shekels, and they gave us a three-month truce period," 
Ghazzawi recalled in a recent interview. "In Arab tribal law, the three months 
are important to defuse the high emotions. And within this three-month period, 
no one of us is to attack them. And no one from them is to attack us. Because 
to do otherwise would be to insult the tribal leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 21, one of the biggest events on a Palestinian social calendar then 
took place: Ghazzawi invited 200 business leaders, politicians, dignitaries and 
family friends from as far away as Bethlehem, Gaza, Hebron and Nazareth for 
lunch, then paraded with them in a caravan to Ramallah for the sulha -- the 
official process of mending under tribal law -- with the Abu Aysha clan, which 
had 200 of their closest friends and neighbors on hand as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal leaders consulted alone first. Abu Aysha agreed to give back 135,000 
shekels of Ghazzawi's 200,000-shekel down payment on justice; he kept 65,000 
shekels for his damaged cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were received inside. We shook hands, we hugged, we kissed and we made 
up," Ghazzawi said. "Somebody stood up for me from the tribe and thanked them 
for demonstrating goodwill. Hearts became clean and white. And that was the end 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In Jericho, Abu Ghazi conducts similar sulhas for any imaginable sort of 
offense, including murder. Recently, when a young woman was kidnaped from her 
home in Jericho and found dead nearby, the police were powerless to 
investigate, as were local PLO officials. That's when the elders started asking 
questions, and it began to look as if the woman's father-in-law was the 
culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal leaders from Bethlehem, Hebron, Ramallah and surrounding villages were 
called in. "We knew that there was going to be a huge amount of money that was 
going to have to be paid in this case," Abu Ghazi said. 
</P>
<P>
 By agreeing to pay 15,000 Jordanian dinars, about $21,000, as truce money -- 
thus possibly avoiding a murder by the woman's family -- the man essentially 
admitted his guilt, in Abu Ghazi's view. "The minute he paid the initial money, 
he was guilty, and I would say he will end up paying 50,000 or 60,000 dinars 
more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are different degrees of punishment, and the punishment depends on the 
intensity and the intention of the crime," he said. "There are many times when 
something happens by accident, where tolerance and forgiveness seem to be the 
appropriate response. And of course we can't send people to prison, so we have 
to increase the fines they must pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians who are busily drafting new legal codes for self-rule scoff at 
the prospect that the tribal ways will play any role in the Palestine of the 
future. They say it is decades of Israeli occupation that have created the 
present situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Gaza Strip, this traditional way of dealing with things through sulha 
, it was almost vanishing before the occupation, because the Palestinian 
civilian judicial system had created a means of dealing with civil disputes," 
said Raji Sourani, director of the Gaza Center for Rights and Law. 
</P>
<P>
 After Israel's occupation in 1967, he said, the Israelis transferred much of 
the authority to military courts in cases ranging from traffic offenses and 
drugs to taxation and theft, and ordinary decisions of the civil magistrate 
often went unenforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The credibility of the system is gone, and for the people, what to do? What's 
the alternative? The alternative was in a way of having this sort of tribunal 
law, and unfortunately, people have begun to be more and more dependent on it."

MARKET SCENE; PUFFS OF WORRY CLOUD CUBA CIGARS; A BIG EXPORTER, THE INDUSTRY 
HAS BEEN LEFT LARGELY ALONE. BUT SEVERAL FACTORS THREATEN ITS PRIZED PRODUCT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the cult of the fine smoke, the region called the Vuelta Abajo is the 
be-all and end-all. It is Nirvana, El Dorado, The Source, all rolled into -- a 
cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in a valley surrounded by gentle hills about 100 miles southwest of 
Havana, is where the most sought-after grade of corojo is grown, the tobacco 
used as the outside leaf of a cigar. 
</P>
<P>
 Referred to as "the wrapper" in English, corojo gives the cigar its color and 
the aroma that causes either expressions of ecstasy or choking, gagging 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
 By nearly all authoritative accounts, a cigar wrapped in oily and fragrant 
Vuelta Abajo corojo is the best in the world. Known to the cigar enthusiast as 
the Habana Puro, this cigar is the equivalent of wine produced by the great 
French chateaux. 
</P>
<P>
 As a major export earner, the cigar industry -- largely free of the central 
planning and bureaucratic obstacles of Fidel Castro's version of communism -- 
has been competitive and profitable. But some believe that is changing and that 
the Puro is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Shifting tastes, a major challenge from the Dominican Republic, the lack of a 
U.S. market because of a three-decade trade embargo, rumors of quality-control 
problems, a shortage of money and devastating weather have combined to weaken 
Cuba's hold on production of the best cigar in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Habana Puro that Rudyard Kipling wrote about in his poem "The 
Betrothed." "And a woman is only a woman, but a good cigar is a smoke," Kipling 
intoned, anticipating the man who, asked what he would do if his wife objected 
to his Cuban cigars, responded, "Get a new wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Cigar smokers from boardrooms to barrooms will pay almost any price and, in 
the case of some Americans, break any law to get a Habana Puro. 
</P>
<P>
 This is no small matter limited to a handful of plutocrats. Hundreds of 
millions of dollars and thousands of jobs are involved, as is one of the few 
positive economic sectors of Cuba under Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Cuba produced about 257 million cigars, with 200 million sold on the 
domestic market and the rest -- by far the best -- exported, mostly to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 At a price ranging from $2 to $20 apiece, cigars rank behind only sugar, 
nickel and citrus fruits as an export earner and have long marked Cuba as 
world-class in this limited industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, 1993 saw a disastrous downturn in the Cuban cigar business; exports 
fell 10 million short of industry projections. 
</P>
<P>
 The root cause of the decline was a hurricane and unseasonable rains that hit 
the Vuelta Abajo at the peak of the February-March harvest period, destroying 
not only much of the precious crop but also most of the cloth that is used to 
tent or shade the wrapper leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 But even without the terrible weather, 1993 production would have continued a 
decline that was already beginning to threaten Cuba's preeminence in the world 
cigar market. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither government officials nor executives at Cubatabaco, the state 
cigar monopoly, responded to requests for interviews, other industry sources 
and diplomats based in Cuba provided some figures. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, Cuba was exporting about 120 million quality cigars 
annually -- about 90% the handmade varieties treasured by the premium-cigar 
fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1990, exports had dropped to 80 million, with the handcrafted cigars making 
up only about 75% of the total, probably the result of shortages in fuel, 
fertilizer and other products that followed the implosion of the Soviet Union 
and the rest of Communist Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, total exports were 77 million, in 1992, 67 million, and last year, 57 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview in Cigar Aficionado, a U.S. quarterly published in New 
York that chronicles the luxury cigar world, Cubatabaco Director Francisco 
Padron said Cuba will export no more than 50 million cigars in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But Padron projected that exports will climb to 80 million to 90 million by 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats and independent foreign economists in Cuba are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the weather holds up," one international official said, "Cuba just 
doesn't have the money to buy the fertilizers, the fuel, the tents needed to 
restore production to what it was, let alone make serious increases." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the Soviet Union and its Communist allies either gave Cuba direct 
aid or traded goods for sugar at concessionary rates, which allowed the cigar 
industry to operate cheaply, the expert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, now Cuba has to have cash. And while Cubatabaco was probably the most 
efficient industry in the country, the money it generates is sucked up by the 
government and not available for the cigar business. It's the death of the 
Golden Goose." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but Cuban tobacco officials claim the ear of Castro and are able to 
obtain otherwise scarce resources because he accepts their argument that 
high-quality cigars are important to the country's world image. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent tour of the 100,000 acres that make up the tobacco fields of the lush 
Vuelta Abajo showed no shortage of tents -- at least in this key growing area 
-- and the current harvest appeared plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of two of the Havana-area factories that turn out such quality 
brands as Montecristo and Cohiba also say that there has been no real shortage 
of quality filler and wrapper leaves, although the size of some wrappers has 
been difficult to maintain in severe weather, and cheaper brands have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Castro Revolution of 1959, there really was no challenge to the 
Habana Puro. But when the United States instituted an economic embargo in 1962 
to punish Castro for his strident anti-Americanism, the cigar market shifted 
measurably as non-Cuban manufacturers sought to win the U.S. smoker. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, the once second-rate cigars of Honduras, the Dominican Republic and 
a few other Caribbean countries improved, particularly as the leaders of the 
old Cuban tobacco business went into exile, taking their seeds and expertise 
with them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, some of them have developed cigars very close to -- although 
not yet the equal of -- the Cuban products, targeting a newer clientele 
favoring a lighter taste. Cuba's competition is particularly strong in the 
Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Habana Puro traditionally provided a strong taste and an aroma of pungent 
spices. While Cuban makers insist that their cigars remain the overwhelming 
favorite of true connoisseurs, they have also been quietly creating some new, 
milder versions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in spite of all the gainsayers, the pessimism and skepticism about the 
future of the traditional robust Cuban hand-rolled cigar seems premature at 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sales figures in Spain and France, the two largest markets for 
Cuban cigars, not to mention the rest of Europe, the demand for the Habana Puro 
is increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin R. Shanken, the editor and publisher of Cigar Aficionado, said the 
world market for Cuban Puros, excluding the United States, is as many as 100 
million cigars. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Shanken, who has visited Cuba five times in the last 
two years, quoted Padron as saying he could sell at least 20 million more in 
the United States if the embargo were lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the attraction of Cuban cigars for Americans is so strong that 
Shanken estimates that 6 million to 8 million of the banned cigars make it into 
the United States regardless of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cuban cigars are world-class," Shanken said, dismissing as jealousy or 
wishful thinking any claims by competitors that the quality of Habana Puros has 
fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," he boomed over the phone. "Quality control is at the very 
highest levels. If you like a strong, robust taste with spice, the Cubans are 
as good as they ever were."

<P>
 The queue, that long-standing exemplar of British convention, is under threat 
-- from within. 
</P>
<P>
 A most distressing habit, queue-jumping, is on the rise and may well be 
threatening civilization as the British know it. 
</P>
<P>
 The queue -- the traditional first-come, first-served file of customers, more 
or less in a straight line -- has been faithfully observed here since the 
dimmest memories of cultural observers. British queue for buses, for taxis, for 
food, for tickets, for just about everything. Quietly and politely. 
</P>
<P>
 As a wag once put it: "An Englishman, even if he is alone, forms an orderly 
queue of one." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a century at least, the British have professed to abhor the 
practice of scrambling for tickets, seats or anything else, the 
every-man-for-himself scrimmage that Britons believe is characteristic on the 
Continent, particularly in the Mediterranean areas that the British describe as 
Latin. 
</P>
<P>
 But times clearly are changing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was big news in the British tabloids, for instance, when Prince Charles, on 
a recent skiing vacation in the Alps, announced that he and his sons, princes 
William and Harry, would queue at the crowded ski lifts. Charles' private 
secretary, Cmdr. Richard Aylard, revealed: "The Prince does not want the boys 
to go through life thinking they can jump queues. They will queue here like 
everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 But when the royal party arrived to find a line of 300 skiers and a 45-minute 
wait, the signals were suddenly switched -- purportedly on security grounds -- 
and the prince's group moved directly to the front of the line. So much for the 
egalitarian education of the young princes. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, queue-jumping is becoming more frequent in Britain, and an Oxford 
University psychologist, Peter Collett, sees danger to traditional British 
civility in this trend. The breakdown of queuing, Collett said, is a "great 
threat to our sense of stability and order," which could lead to "highly 
charged" situations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new book called "Foreign Bodies, a Guide to European Mannerisms," Collett 
identifies the various types of queue-jumping afflicting British civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Jockeying, he said, consists of shifting from one line to another in a 
multi-queue supermarket to find the fastest line. 
</P>
<P>
 Colonizing is keeping a sharp eye open for another cash counter or ticket 
window to open and dashing to reach the head of the new queue. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the transgressors who pretend that they didn't notice a queue 
and slip into an up-front gap in the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's remarkable about jockeying and colonizing is that they are regarded as 
quite legitimate, even though they contravene the basic rule about first-come, 
first-served," Collett said.  
</P>
<P>
 That tradition has some remarkable permutations in Britain, even in these 
days. In some instances, Collett points out, the British don't queue 
physically, say in shops or pubs where they form "invisible queues," expecting 
the person behind a counter to remember who is next to be served. Often, an 
orderly British customer will point to another person to indicate the first "in 
line." 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of self-denial is something the Latins do not understand," Collett 
said, "unless it is performed with some ulterior motive in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, Collett said, in the middle of the 19th Century the French were 
considered a queuing nation, and the English borrowed the word queue from the 
French word, meaning "tail" and pronounced "cue." 
</P>
<P>
 But somehow the cultural habits got reversed in Paris and London. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several reasons for queuing. American anthropologist Edward Hall 
said queues are found in societies where people are treated as equals and 
espouse the egalitarian ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 Queues also apportion a fair distribution of time, Collett said, and nations 
that value time and punctuality tend to favor queues -- while societies that 
take a more dismissive attitude to time prefer to do without queues. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastern European societies tend to queue, Collett said, not so much from 
cultural heritage but because of the appalling shortages in consumer goods and 
other services. In the former Communist countries, queuing for foodstuffs has 
become a way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians, French and Spaniards are the least queue-conscious in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," Collett said, "is because Latins do not accept the basic philosophy 
behind queuing, namely the idea that people should be served in the order in 
which they arrive. For them a queue is an imposition, an unwarranted form of 
regulation and interference, like the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is debasing, regimented, and it prevents individuals from using their 
intelligence and initiative to personal advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 The British, Collett said, "have a compulsive need for orderliness, not in 
terms of requiring a neat and tidy environment, but in the sense of needing to 
know where they stand and what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
 "They usually feel uncomfortable when the situation is fluid or where there is 
a general free-for-all -- when goods are not priced, when they have to bargain 
over a purchase and when the rules of the game, so to speak, are not clear. 
Predictability is essential for the British." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining a queue provides that, Collett said. "For the British, a queue is 
therefore a cameo of an idealized society, where everyone knows their place, 
accepts it and doesn't try to steal an unfair advantage over others." 
</P>
<P>
 But there may be a deeper, more primitive reason for the British penchant for 
queuing, the psychologist said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The British," he said, "have gained a reputation for being slow to anger 
because they stand in disciplined lines, but the more likely explanation is 
that they are so easily angered that they need the protection of queues." 
</P>
<P>
 The increasing practice of queue-jumping is partly due, Collett said, to the 
rise of the "me generation," with people increasingly "out for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the decline of the British queue is rather sad to observe, Collett said. 
"There is an underlying principle that is under threat here -- and that is the 
British principle of fair play."

 Outside, an icy wind funnels down from the Kremlin into one of Moscow's most 
popular shopping streets, but inside Bread Store No. 755, the air is warm, damp 
and pungent. 
</P>
<P>
 The homey aroma of fresh-baked Russian black bread mingles with the odor of 
wet wool overcoats. There is also the unmistakable smell of raw capitalism as 
people surge toward the counter to buy, buy, buy -- even at prices they 
consider unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 For Russia's last mammoth Soviet-era government monopoly -- bread -- is ever 
so gradually being wrested from state control and placed into private hands. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a politically delicate, even spiritually traumatic process. Cheap, 
plentiful bread was the very symbol of the Bolshevik Revolution, and Vladimir 
I. Lenin came to power in 1917 on the slogan "Peace, Land, Bread." Bread stayed 
cheap and plentiful even in the poorest days of the Soviet Union, the best-kept 
covenant between the Communists and the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 For three decades, the price of a dense, round loaf of rye bread remained 
unchanged at 16 kopeks. It was so cheap that peasants fed it to their pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, as the Soviet Union lay on its deathbed, authorities broke a sacred 
taboo and raised bread prices. Then, last October, President Boris N. Yeltsin 
decontrolled prices entirely, and by last week a loaf of rye bread cost 376 
rubles -- still only 21 cents, but 2,262 times what it cost just three years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumption has dropped between 10% and 12% -- not because people are eating 
less but because they are wasting less and have stopped feeding bread to their 
livestock, said Alexander A. Chistyakov of the Russian Committee for Grain 
Products. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bread should be expensive, not cheap," declared Chistyakov, a statement that 
would have been capitalist anathema two years ago. "People are beginning to 
behave more rationally." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a new generation of revolutionaries is trying to do the unthinkable: 
make money from bread. The owner of store No. 755, Natalia D. Pelenitsina, is a 
former medical textbook editor turned bakery entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 In a startling break with tradition, Pelenitsina has managed to train her 
employees not to be surly to the customers -- though it is impossible to train 
the customers not to be nasty to the workers about the ever-increasing prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelenitsina has also instructed employees to sell the warm bread first, 
forsaking the Soviet custom of trying to force customers to buy up every last 
scrap of old bread before letting them have the fresh stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 About three months ago, Pelenitsina at last persuaded the bread factory to 
bring fresh bread several times a day, especially in the morning, when the 
customers want it. Previously, the bread typically came at closing time and sat 
overnight, unwrapped, growing cold and stale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bread was supposed to come four times a day every day, but it never did," she 
said. "They always brought it when it was convenient for the factory, not when 
it was convenient for the store or for the customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Russians are fussy about their bread, and many bakeries offer customers a 
spoon with which to prod the loaves to test their freshness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easier to force bad bananas on the customers than stale bread," said 
Vladimir Y. Panichev, director of the Vykhino Confectionery and Bread Baking 
Factory in southeast Moscow. Russians speak of their daily bread in almost 
religious terms. "Bread is father, mother and water," one proverb says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bread Store No. 755 has developed a reputation for always having fresh bread 
on hand. Several customers said they come from other neighborhoods to buy it, 
as well as imported tea and cookies, fresh cakes, pizzas and steaming pirogi , 
or buns stuffed with pork, potatoes and cabbage, that the employees make 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, these and other innovations have helped Bread Shop No. 755 boost 
sales from 2,000 loaves a day when Pelenitsina took over three years ago to 
5,000 loaves daily now. 
</P>
<P>
 She gives much of the credit for the turnaround to the Western-style 
management advice she received from Arthur Andersen & Co. executives under a 
program funded by the British government. Pelenitsina raves about the extensive 
help she received, which included personal business tutorials, a 10-day trip to 
London and a visit from former British Prime Minister Edward Heath -- but not a 
kopek of financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by her success, Pelenitsina has borrowed $40,000 and is building a 
small bakery of her own in what was the crumbling back of the bread store. It 
will be staffed mostly by her 40-ish, overeducated, unemployed friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "At my cash register is the former head engineer for a defense contractor," 
Pelenitsina explained, pointing out a middle-aged woman in a blue apron, one of 
25 employees who earn an average of $74 a month. "Of course, it's a big 
comedown for her. But since they are not being paid there, she has to do 
something else." 
</P>
<P>
 Such innovation, born of government decree and economic despair, is beginning 
to ripple through what was once one of the world's most inefficient food 
production chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever so gradually, the privatization of Roskhlebprodukt, the giant state grain 
monopoly, has begun. The massive organization consists of 3,000 separate 
enterprises that once controlled and subsidized every link of the grain chain, 
from the elevators that bought grain from the collective farms to the millers 
and bakers and bread distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a decree signed by Yeltsin in December, all but 140 of the enterprises 
were to be sold off by April 1, said Igor V. Kazankin, who is handling the 
privatization program at the State Property Committee. Despite delays, Kazankin 
said the turnover will still be accomplished before July 1, when the vouchers 
that Russian citizens can use to buy shares in privatizing enterprises are due 
to expire. 
</P>
<P>
 The slow unraveling of state control has now begun to touch private farmers, 
who account for 15% of the grain sold to the flour millers of Moscow. The 
millers and the giant bakeries now operate without state subsidies. And 
competition, a concept that remains alien two years after Russia set out to 
form a free market, is keeping bread prices from rising even faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is extremely tough competition among bread bakers," Panichev said. "It 
is rather dangerous and unprofitable to raise bread prices sharply." 
</P>
<P>
 Political opposition to making money from the staff of life remains high. 
Although Yeltsin decontrolled the price of bread by decree in October, a law 
passed by the old Supreme Soviet that banned reaping more than 15% profit from 
baking or selling bread expired only on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Worried that price-gouging will create a political backlash, the bread 
factories still don't allow the retail stores they supply to add more than a 
15% markup to their bread. Some local authorities have also imposed profit 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Price-fixing among Moscow's 40 large bread factories does go on, but it is 
informal and sporadic, Panichev said. The difference is that it is bakers, not 
central planners, setting prices based on the cost of flour, oil, electricity 
and other costs. Some factories absorb these costs as long as possible in order 
to have a jump on their competitors, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To give stores an incentive to sell bread, the city of Moscow does not collect 
taxes on stores where 65% of the wares are bread or bread products. To increase 
profits, more and more bread stores also peddle everything from baby food to 
blue jeans, candy bars and sometimes even alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bread stores would rather sell anything but bread," Panichev complained. 
"Vodka does not go stale." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the regulatory limitations and the deregulatory confusion, reformers 
believe that the lifting of government controls over bread production will 
bring Russians more psychological and economic independence from the state that 
once fed them like children -- and demanded childlike obedience. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the demise of the bread monopoly, the last vestige of Soviet rule will 
finally collapse," said economist and newspaper columnist Mikhail L. Berger. 
"Giving up land and bread amounts to giving up power and control over the 
people. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "If bread becomes an item of commerce and ceases to be a super-sacred thing, 
like bread and wine at church Communion, people will stop worshiping the 
current leadership," Berger said. Russian Bread Prices

 DRESSING UP: State officials and the American Cancer Society are hosting a 
lunch for 200 Santa Ana schoolchildren Wednesday. It's to teach them the 
importance of adding more fruit and vegetables to their diet. . . . What better 
way to do that, they figure, than to put together what they're billing as the 
world's largest salad bar: 3,000 pounds of food ranging from figs and avocados 
to bell peppers and cherries. They'll serve it on a 180-foot-long table at the 
Sporting Club in Irvine.

 ELECTRIC MAN: Disney President Frank G. Wells, killed Sunday in a helicopter 
crash (D1), loved alternative-fuel cars. His death was a special blow to 
organizers of the 1994 World Clean Air Road Rally to Disneyland, a four-day 
Southland event that culminates Monday in Anaheim. Two of Wells' electric cars 
had been scheduled to participate. . . . Organizer Peter Hackus of Seal Beach 
says of Wells: "He was a quiet friend toward the whole movement for alternative 
energy. We are going to dedicate (the rally) to his memory." 
</P>
<P>
 BY THE GROSS: If you have watched this new Ellen DeGeneres TV sitcom Wednesday 
nights, "These Friends of Mine," maybe you've seen her co-star, Arye Gross, 
before. He attended UC Irvine and went on to study acting for three years at 
South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa. . . . His last play there was "Let's Play 
Two" two years ago. Gross was also one of the three teens who drove 
cross-country in the movie "Couple de Ville," and played the Jewish soldier in 
"A Midnight Clear."

 PREVENTING BLAME: Men are twice as likely as women to commit suicide, often 
leaving wives with the riddle of finding out why (E1). Answers aren't always 
forthcoming, which can lead to deep guilt for their mates, says Shvonne 
Stricklen, who runs a support group in Santa Ana called Widows of Suicides. . . 
. "They feel they didn't do enough for their husbands," she explains. "They 
feel people blame them, that they couldn't prevent this sad, desperate act."

SCOTT HARRIS: DEAR DARRYL STRAWBERRY: SAY IT AIN'T SO; THE WAY THINGS ARE 
GOING, IT LOOKS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO THE WAVE FOR YOU. THE WAVE GOODBY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 DARRRR -- RYLLLL! 
</P>
<P>
 It was so much easier when the man was a Met. 
</P>
<P>
 DARRRR -- RYLLLL!! 
</P>
<P>
 This is sung as a taunt, not a cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 DARRRR-RYLLLL!!! 
</P>
<P>
 Make that a plea. If you can hear me, Darryl, wherever you are, say it ain't 
so! 
</P>
<P>
 My hope was that you had a good explanation for your disappearance -- that 
maybe you were on your way to the game Sunday when you spotted an orphanage in 
flames and rescued 14 kids, only to be overcome by smoke and rushed to the 
emergency room. My fear was that you'd gotten in trouble with gangsters or a 
new girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 To paraphrase "Mrs. Robinson," where could you be, Darryl Strawberry? Whatever 
the story, don't expect clucks of sympathy. Another millionaire athlete with a 
"substance-abuse problem." Alcohol? Cocaine? Chewing tobacco? Fred Claire 
wouldn't say. 
</P>
<P>
 You turned up AWOL just when I was preparing to wax lyrical on our national 
pastime and its deeper meanings. If George Will can devote a page of Newsweek 
to Lenny Dysktra, then I should be able to indulge my delight over Chan Ho 
Park, Delino DeShields and Mike Piazza. The Dodgers seemed poised to make this 
one of those "next years" that Dodger fans, dating back to Brooklyn, have 
historically waited for, and sometimes received. But now you've put me in a 
foul mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Your timing was perfectly awful and awfully perfect. In a way, it's an 
appropriate way for the season to begin. To be a Dodger fan is to ride the 
proverbial roller coaster, and things had been going too well, really. Your 
latest escapade made my heart sag, but no Dodger fan could really be surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the nice things about not working for the Sports section is that I 
don't have to hide my allegiances. As the baseball scribes put it, I'm a homer. 
I can take it personally. Of all the teams in all the sports, amateur or pro, 
the Dodgers are my team. They are also L.A.'s team, more so than all the rest. 
It's all very nice that Gretzky scored his 802nd goal, and I'm happy that Magic 
is coaching the Lakers. But as a hometown boy, Darryl, you know that no team 
can lift the spirits of Los Angeles the way the Dodgers can. 
</P>
<P>
 The daring of Wills, the magnificence of Koufax, the chin music of Big D -- 
all helped win my young heart. The Angels tried to woo me with a new stadium 
within biking distance of my home, but I stayed true blue. Why, I even became a 
fan of the Dem Bums of Flatbush, reading those heroic biographies of Reese, 
Robinson, Campanella, Snider. . . 
</P>
<P>
 More so than other sports, baseball is steeped in tradition and continuity. 
True fans hang tough in the lean years, and we Dodger fans have been rewarded 
time and again for our loyalty. When I think about Game 1 of the '88 World 
Series, with Gibson limping up to the plate against Eckersley, it almost makes 
me pity the fans of other teams. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 All considered, Dodger followers have had it pretty good. Our memories are 
more sweet than sad. I think I'm a fairly typical fan. Offhand, I can think of 
only a couple of things that may distinguish me from most. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is that I witnessed Fernando's final performance with the Dodgers -- 
in an exhibition game at Vero Beach. A sportswriter friend nabbed me a press 
pass. When Fernando struck out the first batter, I committed a sin: I applauded 
in the press box. Then I was embarrassed. Now the memory makes me proud. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember when the Marriott Corp. took over the concessions at Dodger 
Stadium and tried to do away with grilled Dodger Dogs? Many fans were angry, 
but this one was positioned to channel his rage into a journalistic crusade, 
grilling Marriott executives like so many wieners. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I'm not saying it was my efforts alone that persuaded Marriott to install 
more grills. (But if anybody sees me at the game, I take mine with mustard and 
onions.) 
</P>
<P>
 So when I started to write this column, I wanted to celebrate Park or 
DeShields or Dodger Dogs -- any aspect of Dodgerdom, really, except 
DARRRR-RYLLLL! I was just happy that the season was finally about to begin. And 
this team seemed like it might be special, that it might lift L.A.'s spirits, 
even with the annual reports of a "rejuvenated" you-know-who. 
</P>
<P>
 Promises, promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Your troubles off the field and in the clubhouse have been well-documented. 
Quite possibly I was the last Dodger fan to think you might live down your 
domestic altercations and the intemperate "let it burn" quip last November 
during Los Angeles' wildfires. Maybe it has something to do with a chat I had 
once with your older brother Michael, the Los Angeles cop who dodged death 
during the riots of '92. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the story: Michael was riding in a patrol car with Officers Charles 
Cho and Mark Ramirez when a sniper shot out the rear window. All three men were 
wounded, none severely. But it was a close call all the same. For Michael, it 
was a bullet fragment wedged in his skull. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael seemed to be a dedicated officer and a decent guy. With a brother like 
that, maybe there was hope for you. The "let it burn" quote didn't bother me. 
For all your bad karma, I thought you might come through in the clutch, that 
you could still have the happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well. The way things are going, it looks like we might have to do the wave 
for you. The wave goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda says the Dodgers will win with or without Darryl. It's not like I'm 
going to sell my 1/9th share of two season tickets. It's not like I'm waiting 
'til next year. 
</P>
<P>
 CHAN HO PARK! CHAN HO PARK! CHAN HO PARK! 
</P>
<P>
 That's a cheer. I hope. 
</P>

CAMARILLO PANEL WEIGHS PROJECT FOR LEMON ORCHARD; DEVELOPMENT: COMMISSION WILL 
CONSIDER CHANGE IN ZONING THAT COULD LEAD TO BUILDING OF HOMES AND GOLF COURSE 
ON 236-ACRE SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to turn a lemon orchard into a 302-unit residential development 
will come before the Camarillo Planning Commission tonight, amid concerns that 
the project would further speed the loss of agricultural land in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo-based Knightsbridge Holdings Inc. wants the city to change the 
zoning of the land, on the extreme northwestern border of the city, from 
agricultural to residential. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal calls for the construction of 207 single-family houses, 95 
condominiums and a 150-acre semiprivate golf course. The 236-acre site, near 
Wright and Beardsley roads, is home to the 168-acre lemon orchard, which was 
first planted in the early 1940s, and vacant land. The orchard has not been 
actively farmed since August, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project first came before the City Council in January, 1993, when the 
council voted to give developers approval to proceed with planning for the 
development, including an environmental study. However, any amendments to the 
city's General Plan require a Planning Commission recommendation before final 
City Council approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Knightsbridge officials could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because soil quality varies at the site and because the property could serve 
as a buffer for adjoining farms under pressure of development, city staff is 
recommending that the commission approve the plan, said Matthew J. Boden, 
Camarillo's director of planning and community development.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned about the loss of farmland around the county but feel this 
project is in keeping with surrounding developments and will help preserve 
other farm parcels nearby," Boden said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Buettner, the county's chief deputy agricultural commissioner, said the 
loss of any farmland should be cause for "real concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Buettner said the county has a little more than 100,000 acres of irrigated 
farmland remaining, and acreage is shrinking at the rate of about 1,000 to 
1,400 acres each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are talking about is a non-renewable resource," he said. "Once it's 
gone, it's gone. Sadly, we have seen a steady decline in the amount of farmland 
in this county. We are very concerned about this trend." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Les Meredith, chairman of the Planning Commission, declined to comment on the 
Knightsbridge project, but expressed concern for the county's diminishing 
farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every square foot of land you pave, you create just that much more of a 
runoff problem, and that means less and less water is getting into the water 
table," Meredith said. "Personally, because of that reason and others, I am 
very cautious when it comes to making decisions surrounding the use of 
agricultural land." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the issue of converting agricultural land, members of the public who 
have submitted written comments on the environmental impact report were 
concerned that the proposal included no parkland space or equestrian 
facilities. Knightsbridge officials have amended the proposal to include 
parkland, open space and equestrian facilities in their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Planning Commission approves the project, it will come before the City 
Council later this spring. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo Planning Commission's public hearing on a proposal to turn a 
lemon orchard into a housing and golf course development starts at 7:30 tonight 
at City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive.

OFFICIALS SEEK INTERVENTION IN DISPUTE WITH NURSES; HEALTH: SUPERVISORS WILL BE 
ASKED TO FORCE THE HOSPITAL WORKERS, WHO ARE THREATENING TO STRIKE, TO ACCEPT A 
CONTRACT THAT CUTS THEIR PAY AND BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With negotiations deadlocked and nurses threatening to strike, Ventura County 
health officials will ask the Board of Supervisors today to force nurses at the 
county hospital to accept an overall cut in pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nurses want the board to delay action until they can return to the 
negotiating table and modify the contract, particularly its provisions allowing 
Ventura County Medical Center to lay off even the most senior nurses and send 
others home when the wards are empty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel the administration is a little too far removed from what we're doing," 
said Sheila Raives, an intensive-care nurse and member of the employees' 
negotiating team. "Being at the bedside, we're the best people to say where to 
save money." 
</P>
<P>
 Raives and about 60 employees marched in front of the hospital Monday, 
protesting the county's proposal to proceed with its "final and best offer," 
rather than work for a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 But county health officials, in their resolution to the Board of Supervisors, 
said that months of meetings ended in impasse, "making further negotiations 
futile." 
</P>
<P>
 The contract, as drafted, would save the county as much as $1 million a year, 
which county officials say is needed as part of overall budget tightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're up against the wall as far as the money is concerned," 
Supervisor John K. Flynn said. The board will consider the contract at today's 
meeting and could vote as soon as April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he expects that he will vote for the proposal, but hopes to see 
changes in workplace practices that are damaging morale. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurses, still angry about changes in their work schedules that cost them 
pay, are contemplating a strike if the county proceeds with the controversial 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the local chapter of the California Nurses Assn. voted to 
authorize a walkout. But the union delayed action in hopes of bringing the 
county back to the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to strike, but if they give us no other options, we may do it," 
union representative Tammy Gamblin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about the potential strike, county officials went to court last week 
to block a walkout by 208 of the county's 334 nurses who provide "vital 
services." Superior Court Judge Edwin M. Osborne issued a temporary restraining 
order, requiring nurses to give at least 72 hours notice before a walkout. He 
will consider more permanent restrictions at an April 11 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses say they hope that the hospital and the county don't push them into a 
strike, which would be a first by Ventura County's nurses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to leave," said Ann Hallett, a neonatal nurse, who ate her lunch 
as she marched in Monday's protest. "But I want to start using my energy in a 
positive way." 
</P>
<P>
 Hallett said her pay was cut 14% when the hospital unilaterally adjusted 
shifts and cut her hours. Now, she and other employees fear that the new 
contract would further reduce pay and gut the hospital's seniority system, 
exposing senior nurses to layoffs. They also fear that the hospital would send 
licensed nurses home when there are few patients, and leave non-licensed, 
lower-paid employees on duty as a way to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials say they have no intention of replacing nurses with 
non-licensed workers. And they defend the contract changes as necessary given 
the cost reductions sweeping the health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not trying to single out nurses," hospital administrator Pierre Durand 
said Monday. "Health care is going through a lot of adjustments. There's a lot 
of frustration. There's a lot of pain."

ALL ABOARD FOR OXNARD METROLINK RAIL STATION; TRANSPORTATION: DESPITE A FEW 
SNAGS, THE CENTER SERVICES ITS FIRST PASSENGERS. IT IS THE LAST OF SEVEN STOPS 
ADDED TO HELP EASE POST-QUAKE FREEWAY CONGESTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The ticket sellers were late, the coffee maker was on the fritz and at 5 a.m. 
Monday, the train storage station for the new Oxnard Metrolink service was 
still under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the 54 paying passengers and train lovers who joined politicians at 
the Oxnard Transit Center, only one thing mattered: Metrolink had made it to 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard is the last of seven Metrolink stops added to ease congestion caused by 
earthquake-damaged freeways. The rail service now stretches 346 miles through 
six counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we've been working on for years, so I'm really thrilled to 
see this day finally come," Supervisor John K. Flynn said as he passed out 
plastic Metrolink pens. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all relieved that we were able to make this happen," Gherardi said. 
"Now we've got to work on keeping it." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal disaster aid for trains to Oxnard, as well as a Camarillo station 
added in February, runs out Oct. 1, and Ventura County transit officials are 
searching for funds to continue the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn got help for the official Oxnard Metrolink ribbon-cutting from 
6-year-old John Arevalo, who sported an oversized purple Metrolink cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just loves trains," said John's mother, Debbie Arevalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Oxnard Councilman Mike Plisky complained about the pre-dawn chill. 
"It's freezing," he shouted, as the Oxnard High School Band performed a rousing 
march. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky described his support for Metrolink service as lukewarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I normally don't support these kinds of things because they don't 
pay their way and are usually government boondoggles," he said. "But since it's 
here, I'm going to encourage people to ride it, because it could be good for 
the city's image and good for business." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Metrolink's impact on the city's economy, many passengers who rode 
the train to Los Angeles and back Monday were enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the bell rang and the first double-decker, violet-and-white train 
pulled away from the station, briefcase latches popped and laptop computers 
whirred as passengers settled in for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Riders arranged themselves in seats diagonally across from each other, 
propping their feet on empty chairs while keeping watch for the conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 Some passengers chatted quietly, while others, heads thrown back and eyes 
squeezed shut, were determined to catch a little extra sleep. A library-like 
hush was broken only by the squeaks and groans of the train rumbling over the 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Staring out into the morning darkness, customer service manager Patricia 
Johnson said she had taken the train a few times from Moorpark and Camarillo to 
her job in downtown Los Angeles. But now that Metrolink stops near her home in 
Oxnard, Johnson pledged to become a faithful rider, even though taking the 
train will add an hour each way to her commute. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I drive, I can make it to work by 6:30, but that's breaking all speed 
records," Johnson said. "This way, I'll get there by 7:30, but in a much more 
relaxed frame of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Joni Hawe drove 75 miles from Monrovia so that her 15-year-old son, Lew 
Edwards, could spend a day of his spring break riding the train. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're both train buffs," Hawe said. "But I wouldn't have come all this way if 
it wasn't for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Lew said he planned to compare the ride to San Francisco's Bay Area Rapid 
Transit. "I'm going to check to see if they are taking good care of their 
trains," he said. "It's terrible when people don't take good care of their 
trains." 
</P>
<P>
 Lew's assessment of the three-hour round-trip excursion at day's end? The 
trains are well-tended, and "the ride was pretty smooth, but it wasn't long 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ojai resident and avid Metrolink fan Diana de Noyelles, the Oxnard stop 
will make her daily commute a little easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of driving to Camarillo, I can go to Oxnard, which is closer," said 
de Noyelles, who works as a legislative analyst in downtown Los Angeles. "The 
less I have to drive, the better." 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Commission spokeswoman Mary Travis said Oxnard ridership will 
have to double in the coming weeks to at least 100 passengers a day for the 
station to qualify for extended service. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily ridership from the Camarillo station has remained steady at about 120 
passengers each way. Ridership throughout the system has doubled to 18,500 
since the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there are a lot of people who are counting on this service," Travis 
said. "We expect Oxnard ridership to grow in the next few weeks as people hear 
about the train from their friends." 
</P>
<P>
 For the trek home from Los Angeles' bustling Union Station, purple-shirted 
Metrolink workers fanned out at the entrance to the track, assuring first-time 
riders that even though the big, lighted sign said "Destination: Moorpark," the 
train would indeed take them to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one rider, however, would be perfectly happy if service to Camarillo 
and Oxnard ended tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Simmons, a map archivist who boards the train in Moorpark, yearns for 
the days when she could hop aboard and plop right down at one of the coveted 
desk-equipped seats. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, who is paid by the hour, bills her company for the time she spends 
working while riding the train. She said she can get more work done with a 
desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the good old days, the train would be practically empty," she said. "Now I 
find myself saying, 'Oh no, another new station, more people.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink workers toiled through the night Sunday and most of Monday to finish 
laying tracks and installing fences for a temporary storage facility in 
Montalvo, about 1 1/2 miles from the Oxnard station, Travis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many things that go into starting up new service," Travis said. 
"But now we've made it through the first day and it will only get easier."

JUDGE THROWS OUT LAWSUIT OVER TOWER; OJAI: JURIST RULES THAT THERE IS NO 
EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT RESIDENTS' CLAIMS OF HAZARDS FROM THE WEATHER ANTENNA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Monday threw out a lawsuit by Ojai residents aimed at shutting 
down a radiation-emitting weather tower until more health studies are 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. said there is no evidence to support 
residents' claims that the government intentionally misled local officials when 
it described the 98-foot tower as an antenna that would blend in with the 
scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter, who refused in February to grant an injunction stopping the 
$2.5-million project, also ruled that the government took reasonable care to 
ensure that levels of radiation emitted by the tower are safe to nearby 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer for a coalition of Ojai area residents, who fear that cancer and 
other diseases will result from exposure to the radiation, downplayed the 
ruling and vowed to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale G. Givner, who also lives near the tower, said the judge was not allowed 
to consider evidence outside the administrative record compiled by the National 
Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I wanted to get across was the lack of due process and how the 
government deceived local officials," Givner said. He said that would be an 
important issue for appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't lie and cheat to get what you want," Givner said. "Why should the 
government be able to lie and cheat to get what it wants?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant U. S. Atty. Donna Everett, who argued the government's case 
Monday, said the weather service did everything required before erecting the 
tower in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court looked and saw that the agency took a hard look at all the 
environmental consequences and all of the health risks and found there was 
nothing harmful about the radar to the environment or the people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these people are more concerned with the aesthetics of it rather than 
the health effects of it," Everett said of the Ojai residents. "They just don't 
want it in their back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sulphur Mountain weather station, operating for nearly a month, is one of 
165 Doppler radar systems being built by the government as part of a 
decade-long renovation of its forecasting arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials say the Sulphur Mountain station will replace an aging 
tower atop the federal building in Los Angeles, as well as provide 
state-of-the-art forecasting data to military, aviation and weather service 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the last two storms, it has performed very well," said Todd Morris, area 
manager of the weather service office in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It showed us things we've never seen before off the Ventura and Santa Barbara 
coasts," Morris said. "This radar is showing us information in great detail, 
well past Point Conception." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of the tower complain that studies on the health effects of 
long-term exposure to the radiation have not proved that the system is safe. 
They say the tower should be moved to a less populated area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 750,000 watts of microwave radiation coming out of this thing, and 
it's been put in a residential area," said Dr. Richard Scribner, a researcher 
at the USC School of Medicine who lives near the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never been a radar in a civilian population with that much power," 
Scribner said. "This is a technology that's untested as far as the type of 
exposure these people will be getting." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett, however, said the studies that have been completed have identified no 
adverse effects from the systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no health hazard here," she said. "The fact is it's benefiting many 
thousands of people. I think their complaints are really unfounded." 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members, including actor Larry Hagman, do not discount the benefits 
of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagman said he was not surprised with Hatter's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the thing with the government," he said from his Malibu office. "They 
keep you in court until they grind you down financially. But we're rather 
tenacious up there in Ojai." NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 Residents opposed to the Ojai radar tower have two months to appeal the 
judgment against their lawsuit. Fund-raisers are planned in the Ojai Valley to 
continue the legal battle in the U. S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; VOLUNTEERS FULFILL 
NEEDS OF THE PATIENTS 
</P>

 On Thursday mornings, Judy Campeau is the complaint department at 
Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the volunteers in the Patient Relations Program, Campeau spends four 
hours a week in Tarzana making sure patients' problems, needs and complaints 
are heard. 
</P>
<P>
 The program uses volunteers to meet with patients within 24 hours of admission 
to let them know someone is there to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had this in place at the Tarzana campus for 10 years," said Geri 
Klanfer, volunteer director for the medical center. "We realized nurses don't 
have time always to spend time with a patient and this does take time. They are 
busy doing the medical aspects of the patient care. It's another personal touch 
that the patient can use." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers at both Encino and Tarzana start with a set of standard questions 
to ensure patients' needs are being met. Questions range from efficiency of the 
admitting process, cleanliness of the rooms, noise levels and responsiveness of 
the nursing staff. 
</P>
<P>
 And occasionally a patient will admit "Oh, I'm dying for a hamburger," Campeau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients are often stunned when Campeau -- after checking with nurses and 
the kitchen staff -- delivers their burger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rewarding type of a thing," said Campeau, who has volunteered as a 
patient liaison for seven years. "You come in and you feel like you 
accomplished something." 
</P>
<P>
 For information about volunteering, call Klanfer at (818) 995-5036. 
</P>

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TAFOYA TO RUN AGAIN FOR COLLEGE BOARD 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Tafoya, an outspoken board member of the Ventura County Community College 
District, has announced his bid for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 A former community college student and community college instructor, Tafoya, 
45, said his objective for a second term as a trustee is to better manage the 
district's increasingly strained financial resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most critical things we have to do is to keep whatever resources 
we do have directed toward the classroom," Tafoya said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tafoya has often clashed with some of the district's more conservative board 
members. He voted against endorsing a controversial ballot initiative that 
would have provided public funds for private schools through a voucher program, 
which a majority of the board supported. He also advocated lowering fees for 
foreign students, while other board members voted to raise them. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Port Hueneme, Tafoya will run for the Area 5 seat, which 
represents the cities of Oxnard and Port Hueneme, and the El Rio area. He works 
as an engineering manager for the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied at College of the Sequoias in Visalia before graduating from Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo with a bachelor's degree in engineering. He also has a 
master's degree from the University of Idaho and is completing his doctorate in 
engineering at UC Santa Barbara. CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; REAGAN LIBRARY EXHIBIT TO FOCUS ON 
FIRST LADIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sandwiched between the time Martha Washington dressed herself in lace and 
finery and Hillary Rodham Clinton hung her law degree on her office wall is a 
lot of history, said Richard Norton Smith, director of the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library near Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A soon-to-open exhibit called "Madame President" will use these items and 
others gleaned from each of the nation's more than 40 First Ladies to tell the 
story of how roles have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A typical First Lady exhibit would be more like a fashion show -- bland, 
really," Smith said. "We're trying to do something different here. We're trying 
to show the evolution of the First Lady's role in the White House by telling 
more than 40 individuals' stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Using $50,000 in private donations, the library contacted museums, private 
collectors and descendants of each of the nation's presidential families to 
gather the more than 200 artifacts that will be used in the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with slippers worn by the nation's first First Lady, there is a 
whalebone corset worn by Abigail Adams, a modish-looking black turban headdress 
with plume worn by Dolley Madison, a well-worn Bible owned by Julia Grant and 
Clinton's law degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith hopes that people will be drawn to the exhibit by the unique collection 
of items on display and then drawn into the history of the women as they learn 
each First Lady's biography. 
</P>
<P>
 "People might learn that First Lady activism didn't start with Hillary Clinton 
or Eleanor Roosevelt -- the history is much richer than that," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Hayes, wife of President Rutherford B. Hayes, was a pioneering feminist, 
according to Smith. In the late 1870s, the mother and First Lady was 
campaigning for women's right to vote, he said. The press referred to Abigail 
Adams as Mrs. President, suggesting that she controlled her husband, John 
Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't true, but she was a better politician than her husband," Smith 
said. "If he had listened to her, he may have won a second term." 
</P>
<P>
 The six-month exhibit will open May 6 with Luci Johnson, Susan Ford and Peggy 
Hoover recollecting how their mothers coped with life in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will be open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays and 
noon to 5 p.m. Sundays. Admission is $4 general, $2 for senior citizens and 
free for children under 15. For details, contact the Reagan Library at 
522-8444. SCOTT HADLY

 Simi Valley park district board member James Meredith has bowed out of the

victory would jeopardize his Veterans Administration pension. 
</P>
<P>
 The race for the 4th District seat is narrowed to three, with Simi Valley City 
Council members Judy Mikels, Barbara Williamson and Moorpark Councilman Scott 
Montgomery still in the running. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith, who is retired, said he had assumed that his pension would remain 
untouched during a four-year term as supervisor but discovered late last week 
that the annual income he receives would be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a member of the Simi Valley park district board, Meredith receives 
only a stipend for that position. He said he needs the full VA pension to live 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticizing the VA's policy as unfair, he said he will ask to remain on the 
ballot in the unlikely event he can work out a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something is wrong here," Meredith said. "Veterans in this country have been 
run over for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 He receives a disability pension for an injury he sustained while serving in 
the Air Force during the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith said he regretted having to quit the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't doing it for the income," he said. "I was doing it because all the 
people who were running weren't who I wanted to represent me. But my wife and 
our future has to come first." MARY F. POLS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY TO CONSIDER PURCHASE OF 27 ACRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council tonight will consider spending $545,000 to 
purchase Fireworks Hill, a 27-acre parcel adjacent to the former civic center 
on Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 By buying the property, the city would be able to block development along the 
ridgeline, widely considered one of the most prominent and visible hilltops in 
Thousand Oaks, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase might also increase the value of the civic center parcel because 
the council could offer potential buyers an integrated development plan for the 
entire hillside, Councilman Alex Fiore has said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been trying to sell the civic center at 401 W. Hillcrest Drive 
for years to help fund the new Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Now zoned for commercial use, Fireworks Hill has been proposed as a site for 
restaurants, a hotel or condominiums. But several residents have urged the 
council to preserve the ridge as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not anxious to spend the money, but I am anxious to make sure the hilltop 
is not commercially developed," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. STEPHANIE SIMON

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: YEARLY PHONE BOOK RECYCLING DRIVE STARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning this month, Ventura County residents will be able to recycle 
outdated or extra telephone books as part of a yearly collection drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Drop-off points in every city in the county have been set up to operate in 
conjunction with existing curbside recycling for most homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We set up drop-off points so businesses and residents of multifamily 
complexes could also participate," said David Goldstein, spokesman for the 
Ventura County Solid Waste Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the county collected more than 300 tons of recycled phone books, 
but recovered little of the cost for the hauling and processing involved, 
county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, for the first time in the four-year life of the recycling program, 
county officials found a domestic buyer to recycle the phone books. A mill in 
Washington state will pay the county $40 for each ton of phone books, allowing 
the county to recover more of the costs incurred. For information on the 
location of phone book drop-off points, call the countywide recycling hot line 
at 654-3935. MATTHEW MOSK

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 33-year-old Port Hueneme man has been arrested on suspicion of firing a 
bullet at his wife, with the round entering an adjacent apartment and narrowly 
missing a neighbor, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 11:30 p.m. Sunday as John Tran and his wife, Qin 
Chen, 24, were arguing loudly in their apartment on Madera Circle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the argument, police said Tran pulled out a .38-caliber handgun and 
fired one shot that missed Chen by two feet. The bullet then passed through a 
wall and into the apartment of 39-year-old Richard Garza next door, police 
said. The bullet missed Garza, who was standing at a sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran was taken into custody by police and booked into Ventura County Jail on 
suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. He was released Monday on $5,000 
bail. He is scheduled to be arraigned Friday in Ventura County Municipal Court.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION : OXNARD; CANDIDATES SOUGHT FOR ECONOMIC BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Candidates are being sought to fill two openings on the board of directors of 
the newly formed Greater Oxnard Economic Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members are responsible for helping develop a long-range plan to guide 
the corporation, formed earlier this year to lure new businesses and beef up 
Oxnard's economic base. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the economic development corporation can claim partial credit for 
persuading GTE California to move to Oxnard. Due in part to a longstanding push 
to lure new businesses, the Thousand Oaks-based telephone company announced 
last month that it will establish a customer service center in Oxnard, a move 
that will bring 650 jobs to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is scheduled to expand from seven to nine members in a few months, 
and prospective board members should be prepared to actively govern the 
fledgling corporation and help support its mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in applying should contact corporation President Steve Kinney 
at 385-7444 or write: Greater Oxnard Economic Development Corp., 711 S. A St., 
Oxnard, 93030. FRED ALVAREZ

WEST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION : VENTURA; CLUB GETS $2,500 FOR OUTREACH PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Boys and Girls Club of Ventura has received a federal grant to develop a 
program to steer gang members and their friends away from gang life, club 
officials announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2,500 grant from the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency 
Prevention will be used to recruit 50 youths considered at risk of gang 
involvement, said Jane Goldschmidt, the club's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to isolate the kids and tell them they're bad because they 
belong to a gang," Goldschmidt said. "We'll be trying to mainstream them by 
creating a positive alternative to the gang lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys and Girls Club will work with police and school officials to identify 
youths eligible for the outreach program, Goldschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have staff who also know who's who out there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning for the pilot program is continuing, but Goldschmidt said it will 
contain a comprehensive sports schedule and career guidance, including talks by 
various professionals about their work and tutoring on how to apply for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers plan to talk with the at-risk youths about what they would like in 
the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean they have to leave the gang altogether," Goldschmidt said, 
"but it means the integration of kids who are involved in gangs or on the 
fringes, to explore the positive options of other activities." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is being developed with the understanding that gangs "fulfill 
young people's needs for belonging, competence, usefulness and influences," 
Goldschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
 A training session for community leaders will be held from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m. 
on April 18 at the Robert Addison Youth Center, 1440 N. Olive St. For more 
information, call the club at 641-4485. PATRICK McCARTNEY

LEADERS IN THOUSAND OAKS URGE 'BUY LOCAL' CAMPAIGN; BUSINESS: CITY COUNCIL 
MEMBERS TONIGHT WILL CONSIDER A PROPOSAL ENCOURAGING RESIDENTS TO SPEND MONEY 
INSIDE THE CITY LIMITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to keep residents from spending money outside the city, Thousand Oaks 
business leaders want City Hall to join them in a "buy local" public relations 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will consider a proposal from the Mayor's Business 
Roundtable to use city staff members to help spread the message to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 With billboard-like placards, inserts in city mailings or messages on the TOTV 
cable television station, members of the mayor's panel hope to encourage 
residents to buy in local stores, use local services and understand how local 
businesses contribute to everyone's quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all in this together -- it's not us versus them," said Harry Selvin, a 
local executive who chairs the Mayor's Business Roundtable. "We want businesses 
to understand the residents' problems, residents to understand the businesses' 
problems and the city to understand both of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has not established a detailed game plan nor determined how much 
it would cost or who would pay. But in a one-page memo to the council, Selvin 
and Karen Livesay, co-chairwoman, are asking for government backing of their 
concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of legal limitations, the city may be unable to support a campaign 
that advertises specific businesses. As a taxpayer-financed government channel, 
for instance, TOTV is prohibited from airing advertisements, according to 
Shirley Cobb, the city's media service manager. 
</P>
<P>
 But a generic "buy local" message would be acceptable, she said, considered as 
information rather than promotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good idea," Councilman Frank Schillo said. "We all stand to 
gain from this -- the whole city as well as the business community." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To kick off the program, committee members hope to develop an ad campaign 
thanking residents for shopping locally. They also want to emphasize that each 
purchase in Thousand Oaks generates sales tax dollars used to support city 
services from street lights to crossing guards to landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce has already launched a similar campaign, 
distributing "buy local" buttons and talking up the slogan "It's good business 
to do business in the Conejo." 
</P>
<P>
 Given that ongoing effort, chamber President Steve Rubenstein said he feared 
that the new campaign would be redundant. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, ever a business booster, Rubenstein added: "I don't think it can be said 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar agreed that such a message bears repeating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to better explain the relevance of businesses to our community," she 
said. "I, for one, have real guilt if I shop outside Thousand Oaks. I cringe 
whenever I go to the Price Club, and I try to avoid letting anyone see me 
there. We need to encourage our own residents to think about that." 
</P>
<P>
 While setting a bottom-line goal of increased local sales, committee members 
also talked about a more lofty aim: improving communication between commercial, 
residential and governmental sectors in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, they said, stereotypes impede conversation; some residents may 
distrust the motives of business people, and some company executives may view 
homeowners as impediments to growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, we'd really like to be recognized as part of the community," 
said Livesay, a management consultant. "We're all here for the same reason -- 
because we like it here -- and we might as well talk to each other."

CHEMICAL WARFARE; MAN'S FIGHT TO HALT COUNTY SPRAYING IN YARD GOES TO COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A decade-long environmental fight between a Thousand Oaks resident and the 
county Flood Control District will be reviewed by the Thousand Oaks City 
Council tonight -- with city intervention a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flood Control District lined the stream in Jim Nichols' back yard in 
Thousand Oaks with concrete and began spraying the vegetation around the stream 
bed with herbicides in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols has been protesting ever since, peppering everyone from former First 
Lady Barbara Bush to U. S. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) with letters asking 
that the spraying be stopped and the stream bed be allowed to return to its 
natural state. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on the repeated requests of Nichols, the city's Planning Commission has 
developed a report outlining both sides of the issue to be presented at 
tonight's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that report, officials say, the council may choose to ask the flood 
district to make a presentation outlining its herbicide use in the stream bed 
or could order an outside study to investigate the effects on animals and 
humans. A third option -- the one that Nichols expects -- is to take no action 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flood Control District maintains that the herbicide, known as Rodeo, kills 
only the plants on which it is sprayed. The district sprays three to four times 
a year to keep the flood channel clear and has permits from the California Fish 
and Game Department to do so. In addition, the federal Environmental Protection 
Agency approves the use of Rodeo near water-carrying regions. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Nichols, that reassurance isn't enough. A devoted gardener, he says he 
has seen bad effects on his fruit trees, mainly on their ability to fight off 
such parasites as aphids and whiteflies. He believes that the destruction of 
the plant life along the stream bed is to blame, saying a whole world of 
beneficial insects that would normally eat the parasites has been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest concern, however, is for his two youngest children, Jimmy, 12, and 
Hilary, 9, who find the stream bed an irresistible attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't let them play here," he said, walking next to the greenish trickle 
running through the cement channel. "But kids don't always do what they're 
told." 
</P>
<P>
 He also fears that the herbicide may become wind-borne immediately after it is 
sprayed. He blames at least one fruitless harvest of an almond tree near the 
stream on airborne toxins. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, a lighting technician in the film industry, has lived on the same 
Hillman Drive property overlooking the Castano tributary channel for 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 His first problem with the Flood Control District's actions were cosmetic. He 
hated to see the spring that feeds the stream altered. Poking around there over 
the years, he has found fossils, including a whale's rib, which he believes to 
be millions of years old. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the spraying started, his concerns deepened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called up the county and asked, 'Hey, how come everything is dead along the 
stream bed?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually the county sent him a letter enclosing information about the 
herbicides Rodeo, Round-up and Oust, all manufactured by Monsanto. Alex 
Sheydayi, deputy director of the Flood Control District, said only Rodeo, which 
is approved for use near streams, is used in the flood channel behind Nichols' 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols said he doesn't believe that the county thoroughly examined the 
environmental impact of the herbicide before using it. He said the manufacturer 
told him that the herbicide may have a suffocating effect on fish. He believes 
that it has driven away other wildlife as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wildlife has disappeared," he said. "I don't think that would have 
happened if they'd done a proper environmental impact report." 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Goulet, director of the county's Department of Public Works, said the 
concerns of Nichols are unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we don't agree with him," Goulet said. "We use only herbicides 
approved by the state of California, and we follow all the rules scrupulously. 
We're not going to create a situation where we leave behind toxic materials." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very strident about his feelings," Greg Smith, the Thousand Oaks city 
planner who prepared the report for the City Council, said of Nichols. "But 
he's a concerned citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Nichols knows that he is not popular with local officials. Other area 
residents have complained to the Flood Control District about the channel, but 
none so vehemently. 
</P>
<P>
 Goulet said the county's maintenance crews hold Nichols responsible for the 
glue they have found in their gate locks and upturned nails placed on 
maintenance roads near the stream bed. Nichols denies it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been told they have a dossier on me as an environmental radical, which 
is fine by me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheydayi said the department has tried to make concessions to Nichols over the 
years, including telling him that he could try to control the vegetation on the 
stream bed near his home himself. But that didn't work out to the county's 
satisfaction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the Planning Commission's report gives background on both sides of 
the issue, but makes no specific recommendations to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've indicated that if they wish to consider this further, perhaps what they 
should do is invite the flood district to make a presentation," he said. "After 
exhausting those possibilities, they may want to hire an outside expert to 
consult. We're not experts in this field." 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith expressed some doubts about Nichols' concerns, pointing to the lack 
of scientific evidence that the herbicide is bad for humans and wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be published scientific papers and documents, and there just 
aren't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lack of scientific proof, Nichols trudges on, trusting in what his 
orange trees tell him and scolding his children for going near the stream. His 
notebook of correspondence keeps getting thicker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been addressing everybody I can think of," he said. "And all I can get 
from them are polite thank-you notes." 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't placing much faith in the results of tonight's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably just get another thank-you letter," he said.

RADAR RISKS ARE FEARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am concerned not only about the NEXRAD radar tower, which has been built in 
my community, but for all communities where the National Weather Service has 
built or is planning to build these radar towers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a great debate among scientists concerning the health risks involved 
with chronic exposure to microwave radiation.I'm worried that the government is 
partaking in another project that has not been researched with enough accuracy 
or care to protect the health and lives of our children and families. 
</P>
<P>
 My life and many other people's lives were put at risk by years of 
above-ground nuclear testing at the Nevada test site from direct exposure and 
from nuclear fallout. In the early 1960s, at a very young age, I was exposed to 
nuclear fallout in my community, miles from the Nevada test site. I was 
diagnosed with thyroid cancer before the age of 30, and my doctor attributed it 
to my early exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not want my 2-year-old daughter to be an "acceptable risk" as I was.

RIVER APPRECIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks for the excellent two-piece feature on the Ventura River by Joanna 
Miller. The articles are a fine example of diligent journalism.Despite keeping 
in close personal touch with the Ventura River situation, I still learned new 
details from Miller's reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hoped that her articles and the efforts of local environmental groups 
will result in a major shift in the city of Ventura's thinking about the 
Ventura River. In this time of heightened ecological awareness, it is 
remarkable that city officials do not see the river first and foremost as a 
valuable feature that could add greatly to the local quality of life, if 
managed in an enlightened way.

DANGEROUS CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the freeway police chase of March 29, I find it incredible that 
three police agencies were involved in apprehending a suspect with three 
warrants for drug possession and a no-show in court. 
</P>
<P>
 They created an extreme danger to the public during heavy morning traffic 
hours, just to have some fun. Knowing that the suspect was not an armed ax 
murderer, they should not have pursued. They could have arrested him later in a 
more safe manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, why cannot the police take the car keys from stopped drivers, until they 
finish running the records check?

 I wish to comment on your article concerning the idiot who moved the fire 
engine ("Driven to Trouble," March 23).I have been a professional firefighter 
for 12 years, and this is by far the most stupid thing I have read about to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 Having been involved in the destructive brush fires this past year, I can 
honestly say that people who had idling fire engines outside their homes, 
sometimes all night, felt great that we were there.

WILDLIFE PRIORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article on March 16, "The Fur Flies," illustrated beautifully the 
difference between a mountain and a molehill.Surely, the people who are 
complaining about the squirrels must have realized that living in Wildwood 
would place them smack in the middle of what makes Thousand Oaks such a grand 
place: wildlife right outside one's door. 
</P>
<P>
 When those folks get tired of the molehill (a.k.a. squirrels), show 'em to the 
mountain so they can tackle some real problems like gangs, drive-by shootings 
and drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 As for me, I'll take the squirrels and coyotes and hawks and possums and all 
that crawls and slithers any day over those other problems.

COMPUTER ACCESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following up on the interesting article "Fast Lane" technology in the 
classroom (March 27), I wanted to point out that Ventura County Juvenile Court 
Schools is part of the computer generation, too.  
</P>
<P>
 Students here -- almost exclusively at-risk, minority and many with special 
needs -- have daily access to both IBM and Macintosh systems.Through Perkins 
Grant funding and allocation of other resources, we provide CNN in the 
Classroom, CompuServe, access to the California Technology Project and are just 
now getting into Internet. We also use CD technology to assess "Nautilus," a 
monthly publication. We also have a main server supporting more than 30 
computers at three sites, all for classroom use with educational-based software 
in the basic core course areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks for a positive look at the techniques of tomorrow. The students here 
like it and, more important, we are getting some very good results with the new 
system.

MISLEADING PHOTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your coverage of "Owner of Dog Killed by Police Files Claim" (March 31) is an 
example of sensationalism that I am disappointed to see in your paper. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first saw the picture on B1 of a helpless puppy, I was led to believe 
that was the dog shot by police. Further reading of the story revealed that the 
owners had lost their pit bull, not a puppy. While all pit bulls may not fit 
the vicious stereotype, the picture was very misleading.

BOY DIES AFTER COLLAPSING ON BALL FIELD DURING LUNCH; THOUSAND OAKS: A HOSPITAL 
OFFICIAL SAYS THE DEATH OF GI LEE, 15, MAY BE LINKED TO A CONGENITAL HEART 
PROBLEM. 
</P>

 A 15-year-old eighth-grader at Colina Intermediate School in Thousand Oaks 
died Monday after he collapsed while playing soccer on a playing field during 
lunch hour, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gi Lee of Thousand Oaks died at Westlake Medical Center, where he was taken 
after collapsing about 1:15 p.m., hospital spokeswoman Jane Kelly said. 
Principal Mike Waters said several students who had been playing soccer with 
Lee ran for help when he went down. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not conscious," Waters said. "I'm not a medical person, but he was not 
alert or awake." 
</P>
<P>
 A health clerk and school secretary who responded to the scene performed 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation until paramedics arrived, Waters said. Paramedics 
later told hospital officials that the boy had no pulse, no heartbeat and was 
not breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like an eternity (waiting for the ambulance), but they actually 
responded very quickly," Assistant Principal Phalba Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters said Lee was a happy, fun-loving and positive boy who was well-liked by 
Colina students and staff. Staff members who learned of the boy's death were 
shocked and upset by the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always ready with a smile," Waters said. "It makes you think about how 
fragile life is." 
</P>
<P>
 An aunt of the boy and several relatives gathered at the hospital Monday 
afternoon. The aunt, who refused to give her name, said the teen-ager had a 
medical problem in his past. 
</P>
<P>
 "A long time ago, he had a problem here," she said, tapping her fingers 
against her chest. "But he had been strong for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly said the cause of death was not clear, but she confirmed that 
information from the family indicated that it was probably due to a congenital 
heart problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely seemed to be related to a heart condition," Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy was to be conducted today, said Lt. Fred Corral of the 
investigations division of the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Notification of the family, which is Korean-American, was hampered by a 
language barrier, Corral said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colina students were not told about Lee's death because school officials 
learned of it near the end of the school day, Waters said. A crisis team of 
counselors will be available at the school today to help students deal with 
their emotions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students will probably experience shock and disbelief, in addition to grief, 
Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our message to them will be the same one we sent to the staff in a meeting 
after school today. He collapsed out on the field and that's where he was 
happy, out playing with his friends," Waters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students interviewed after school said they heard that Lee collapsed and was 
taken to the hospital. They described the boy as friendly and outgoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes showing off his cousin's computers," said Kulsoom Qamar, 12, a 
seventh-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a very nice person," added seventh-grader Leila Mobayen, 12.

PROSECUTOR SAYS SUSPECT TRIED TO RUN OVER DEPUTY; COURTS: TRIAL OPENS FOR 
JEFFREY HEDLUND OF NEWBURY PARK, WHO IS CHARGED WITH SELLING DRUGS AND 
ASSAULTING A POLICE OFFICER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Newbury Park drug suspect intentionally tried to run over and seriously 
injure a Ventura County sheriff's deputy in June before being shot and wounded, 
a prosecutor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert D. Meyers' statement came during opening remarks in 
the trial of Jeffrey Hedlund, 26, who is charged with one count of 
transportation and sale of cocaine and two counts of assault on a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedlund slammed his pickup truck in reverse and sped toward Deputy Patrick 
MacCauley on June 30 after realizing that the man he had just furnished with 
cocaine was a police informant, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 MacCauley managed to dive out of the way of the charging pickup truck, tearing 
the sole off one of his shoes before firing several shots at the suspect, 
Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant's attorney, Richard W. Hanawalt, declined to give an opening 
statement in court or to respond to Meyers' comments outside court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was shot three times in the neck, arm and jaw, Hedlund rammed an 
unmarked sheriff's car before leading the officers on a high-speed chase 
through Thousand Oaks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested after surrendering in front of his Maple Road home. The 
district attorney's office ruled that the shots fired by the deputies were 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers told the jury that he will present evidence that shows Hedlund provided 
an informant with 10 small plastic bags containing a total of a half an ounce 
of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 The first witness to take the stand was the informant who allegedly bought the 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The informant acknowledged that he had an auto-theft case pending against him 
and agreed to help sheriff's deputies arrest Hedlund only after they promised 
to dismiss the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also don't believe it's right to sell drugs," said the informant, whose 
name is being withheld because he is involved in other investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant said he had known Hedlund for about three months before the 
undercover operation. Hedlund had told him on previous occasions that he needed 
a cellular phone to conduct drug sales, the informant testified. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of the undercover sting, the informant said, deputies provided 
him with a cellular phone and instructed him to trade it for drugs from 
Hedlund. 
</P>
<P>
 With narcotics officers present, the informant called Hedlund from a Newbury 
Park grocery store and agreed to meet Hedlund in the parking lot of the 
In-N-Out Burgers near Hedlund's house. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant said the deputies fitted him with a wire transmitter and ordered 
him not to get into Hedlund's truck. But when he arrived at the restaurant, 
Hedlund was playing loud music and insisted that the informant get into his 
truck or the deal would be called off, the informant said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said as soon as he got in the truck, Hedlund sped off, drove onto the 
Ventura Freeway and continued to Moorpark Road, where they exited the freeway 
and went to a gas station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were doing over 100 m.p.h.," the informant testified, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 At the gas station, Hedlund gave him the drugs for the telephone, the 
informant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said deputies had lost sight of Hedlund and the informant until Hedlund 
pulled back into the In-N-Out parking lot. He said that is when MacCauley and 
other deputies approached Hedlund's truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies illuminated lights on the truck and yelled 'Sheriff's 
Department!' " Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of surrendering, Hedlund backed straight toward MacCauley before 
fleeing, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedlund faces a maximum of 10 years in state prison if convicted on all the 
charges. His trial continues this morning before Superior Court Judge Charles 
R. McGrath.

TOUGHER HOME-BUSINESS RULES OFFERED; THOUSAND OAKS: PROPOSAL WOULD BAN A DOZEN 
OCCUPATIONS AND ALLOW CITY TO REVOKE PERMITS FOR OTHERS CREATING UNWANTED NOISE 
OR CLUTTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Photographers, hair stylists and welders would be banned from working out of 
their houses, and other home-based businesses would be restricted under a 
proposed law up for discussion at tonight's Thousand Oaks City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking tighter control over the thousands of residents who run kitchen-table 
typing services or living-room massage parlors, city leaders have drafted an 
ordinance imposing tough restrictions on such businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law, written in the form of revisions to an existing code, would 
ban outright a dozen in-home businesses, and would allow the city to revoke 
permits for any other occupation that generated unwanted traffic, noise, 
clutter or smells. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impacts on the neighborhood are our primary concern, rather than the 
freedom to do whatever you want to do," said Planning Commissioner Forrest 
Frields, who helped draft the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will not vote on the proposal tonight. Instead, they will 
consider referring the draft ordinance to the Planning Commission for a formal 
public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents are already gearing up for that battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council keeps trying to make things more stringent when they're already 
strict in the first place," said Steve Rubenstein, president of the Conejo 
Valley Chamber of Commerce. "This is just another opportunity to 
over-regulate." 
</P>
<P>
 To keep residential neighborhoods quiet, the law would require that home-based 
businesses generate no more traffic than the average house on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trips to and from a business -- including both professional calls and personal 
errands -- could total no more than 10 a day in a neighborhood of detached 
single-family residences, and no more than six a day in a high-density 
apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 City enforcement officers would make traffic counts and prosecute violators 
only after receiving complaints from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But several entrepreneurs complained that the ordinance, if adopted, would put 
them in the uncomfortable position of knowingly violating city law by accepting 
several customers a day. They also questioned why their businesses were being 
singled out as the source of congestion, when their neighbors are allowed to 
hold big parties and invite guests over several times a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are so small-minded here," said Hildegard Zentarra, a music teacher who 
trains up to seven students a day in her Thousand Oaks home. 
</P>
<P>
 Because each aspiring pianist travels both to and from her house, Zentarra 
would be over the legal car-trip limit simply by accepting her normal load of 
students -- even if she never left the house for groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a little old lady who wants to earn a bit of extra money; I'm a 
professional musician," Zentarra said. "It wouldn't be fair to limit (car 
trips). It's a right of my property." 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders who drafted the measure respond that they must consider the 
property rights of all residents -- including the right to enjoy a peaceful 
neighborhood, without clients traipsing in and out of a next-door studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to encourage home businesses, but not at the expense of the 
neighbors," Frields said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city issues roughly 3,000 permits a year for residents seeking to start 
businesses in their homes. Aside from the permit, which costs $15, 
entrepreneurs must obtain a business license, which carries an annual fee that 
varies depending on gross revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, city officials have received just a smattering of complaints 
from residents concerned about neighborhood-based businesses. Aware that 
home-based offices are becoming more popular, however, a committee of planning 
commissioners and council members set out four years ago to draft new 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played with this for a long time, going back and forth, trying to make it 
as reasonable as possible," said Councilwoman Judy Lazar, who helped write the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The five-page draft stipulates that all work must be conducted inside the home 
or office, except for gardening in the rear yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Prohibited uses include work with diesel engines or motor vehicles, personal 
services that require client visits, and any job requiring explosives or toxic 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 To gain permission for other potentially noisy businesses -- including animal 
breeding, carpentry, fix-it shops or furniture refinishing -- residents must 
convince city staff members that the businesses will not affect neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 While low-impact businesses such as typing are not mentioned in the ordinance, 
they would fall under the strict new traffic limits. In addition to the ceiling 
on car trips, the ordinance states that home-based businesses "shall not 
generate pedestrian traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed law would also prohibit outdoor advertisements, banning 
free-standing signs and requiring all identifiably commercial vehicles to be 
parked in enclosed garages.

LASORDA, PLAYERS REACT WITH DISMAY TO STRAWBERRY NEWS ( LOS ANGELES); BASEBALL: 
DODGER MANAGER IS UPSET AND ANGRY AT LATEST ESCAPADE AND THE PLAYERS BELIEVE 
STRAWBERRY'S TIME ON TEAM IS OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tim Kawakami 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After three exhausting, often embarrassing years of watching him act as the 
Los Angeles Dodgers' focus and flash point, his teammates and manager began 
speaking of Darryl Strawberry in the past tense Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the cameras and tape recorders moved in for reaction, no Dodger doubted 
that the latest Strawberry crisis would be his last as a Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Rodriguez will probably start in left field in Tuesday's opener, 
probably sharing the job with Cory Snyder when the latter comes off the 
disabled list; the lineup will be rejuggled, and Strawberry will not be there. 
</P>
<P>
 How long Strawberry will be gone, nobody was sure, but, as Strawberry and 
Dodger Executive Vice President Fred Claire met in secrecy Monday, the only 
questions about the end of Strawberry's Dodger career seemed to be when and how 
-- not IF -- the Dodgers would operate without him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I want him on the ballclub? That's not my decision to make," said Manager 
Tom Lasorda. "He has a ton of talent. He's also had a lot of problems in his 
baseball career. It's sad. You can't do those things." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 40-minute clubhouse meeting, Lasorda updated the team on the latest 
developments with Strawberry, then several players forcefully declared that 
their promising spring would not be derailed by one player's erratic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to go forward, assume that he's not going to be here, approach it 
with that attitude," said center fielder Brett Butler. "Pick it up where we 
can, whoever's out there." 
</P>
<P>
 After all of his bizarre behavior and injuries the past three years, is it 
possible the Dodgers are better off without Strawberry? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say yes, I can't say no," Butler said carefully. "All I know is that 
this my fourth year (as a Dodger) and this is the best spring training that 
we've had in those four years -- focused and driven and our attitude. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was fired up that Darryl was coming back, then all of a sudden when 
this happened, it wasn't like Awwww. . . . I was like, 'OK, now we've got to do 
this and this and this.' It was not a letdown, it was now we've got to turn in 
this direction and move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I sad for him? How can I answer that? There are things going on within 
Darryl Strawberry that nobody can answer but Darryl Strawberry. He's going to 
have to someday answer those questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Lasorda and others have pointed to Strawberry as one of the team's 
biggest keys for 1994 -- Strawberry is the Dodgers' sole left-handed power 
hitter -- the team has played without him more than they have with him the last 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A serious back injury limited Strawberry to 75 games the past two seasons, and 
he has hit only 10 home runs since 1991. Playing without Strawberry is 
something they will not have to get used to. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something new," Butler said of playing without Strawberry. "We've 
got the personnel to be able to win it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing how you have a guy who has played 50 or something games the last 
two years, and the focus of our ballclub has been the last two years has been 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's refreshing to have the focus be on a (Chan Ho) Park or a (Darren) 
Dreifort or a rookie of the year candidate in (Raul) Mondesi . . . not on the . 
. . the last few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lasorda: "There comes a time when one door will close on you, and if 
you're so concerned with the door that closes, you'll never find the one that's 
open. So we're looking for the open door." 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the players willing to comment -- Delino DeShields, perhaps 
Strawberry's closest friend on the club, politely said he wouldn't talk about 
Strawberry Monday -- the goal was to avoid becoming absorbed with the daily 
trials and tribulations of their star-crossed teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no issue," said catcher Mike Piaza. "Just go out there and play with 
the people we have. I've never felt it was a distraction."

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; RANGERS STILL RULE, BUT THE DEVILS ARE GETTING THEIR 
DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What could have been the New Jersey Devils' finest hour instead became a 
diabolically bad weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Long the butt of jokes, the Devils are playing serious hockey this season. By 
last Thursday, they had a club-record 101 points, tying the Rangers for the 
overall point lead and giving them a claim to supremacy in the New York 
metropolitan area and the NHL. But by Saturday night, after the Devils lost to 
the Washington Capitals and to the Rangers -- their first back-to-back defeats 
of the season -- the Rangers had gotten the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Devils, 0-6 against the Rangers in an otherwise terrific season, can't 
seem to overcome their chief rivals or the weight of history. Although it's 
tough to get a ticket at Madison Square Garden, the Meadowlands Arena sells out 
only when the Devils play the Rangers -- and even then, Ranger fans form a 
majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain things you can't control and that's one of them," Devil 
General Manager Lou Lamoriello said. "You have to respect the success the 
Rangers are having. They got out strong early and they're one of the original 
six teams. We've learned that when you cannot control something, you can't let 
it bother you. You do only what you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 What the Devils have done is build a team that's rugged, strong defensively 
and balanced offensively. They can't beat the Rangers' 58-year tradition, but 
the Devils, who were born in 1974 as the Kansas City Scouts and moved to 
Colorado before settling in New Jersey in 1982, might still beat the Rangers to 
a Stanley Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a lot from everyone; you really can't single anyone out," said 
Lamoriello, whose team isn't represented among the top 25 scorers but has the 
NHL's second-best goaltending, with a 2.60 goals-against average. "We don't 
have any big scorers but we have the second-most goals scored in the league and 
we have a couple of players who can break open a game." 
</P>
<P>
 The catalyst is Coach Jacques Lemaire, who preaches the virtues of defense. A 
Hall of Fame member and eight-time Cup winner with the Montreal Canadiens, he 
has transformed castoffs Bobby Carpenter, Corey Millen and Bernie Nicholls into 
solid two-way centers. Defenseman Scott Stevens leads the NHL with a plus-50 
defensive rating, and no Devils" player has a minus rating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jacques and Larry (Robinson, his assistant) have certainly made the 
difference, because we're basically the same team we were last year," 
Lamoriello said. "There's a sense of responsibility, a belief in themselves 
that wasn't there. . . . We're a team that competes every night." 
</P>
<P>
 The Devils' struggle to compete at the box office led to speculation they 
might move, but owner John McMullen is trying to buy the Meadowlands Arena and 
end the club's unfavorable lease. "We're here to stay," Lamoriello said. 
</P>
<P>
 In more ways than one. HARRIED SINDEN 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Milbury's surprise decision to quit as assistant general manager of the 
Bruins to become coach at Boston College left General Manager Harry Sinden in a 
quandary. Sinden, 61, had been delegating some of his duties to Milbury with 
the intention of retiring after next season. Does he now bring in a young 
protege for on-the-job training or does he lure a current GM to Boston this 
summer? 
</P>
<P>
 Sinden has indicated that he wants experience, sparking rumors he might hire 
Oiler General Manager/Coach Glen Sather, his longtime fishing buddy. Sather 
talked to Sinden but said he's happy rebuilding his team and isn't going 
anywhere. "Harry and I are friends, but I've had lots of friends offer me jobs 
over the years and I'm still in Edmonton," Sather said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital General Manager David Poile, also a Sinden crony, is a strong 
possibility even though he hasn't won so much as a conference title in 12 
years. His contract expires on June 30 and he has said his first choice is to 
stay in Washington, but an early playoff loss might eliminate that option. 
Although Mike Smith's name has come up, the former Winnipeg Jet GM is an 
unlikely pick because of his affinity for European players. The Bruins don't 
sign many Europeans, believing they can't play the Bruins' traditional grinding 
game. OILING UP AGAIN 
</P>
<P>
 After a string of five Cups in seven years that ended in 1990, the Oilers have 
hit tough times. They've missed the playoffs two successive seasons after 
qualifying for 13 straight years, but Sather thinks they'll be back in 
contention next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through the worst already," said Sather who coached four of those 
Cup teams and was GM of all five. "It's nice to have a great past behind you, 
but it's (also) nice to re-establish something successful." 
</P>
<P>
 He has a good nucleus in 19-year-old center Jason Arnott, second among rookies 
with 32 goals; defenseman Boris Mironov, 21; Doug Weight, 23, and promising 
youngsters Vladimir Vujtek, Dean McAmmond and Kirk Maltby. He also has two 
early first-round draft choices -- his own and a pick he got from the Jets, 
with Swedish standout Mats Lindgren, for the overrated Dave Manson. 
</P>
<P>
 The key is re-signing goalie Bill Ranford, who has been superb this season 
under constant siege. Ranford is earning $1.225 million and will probably ask 
for $3 million. "I just traded Manson (who was paid $1.1 million) so I ought to 
be able to afford Bill," Sather said. "You can't break the bank for anybody, 
but if Bill's reasonable, I'm sure we can make a deal with him." FADING AT THE 
FINISH 
</P>
<P>
 Who is less deserving of winning the Central Division, the Red Wings, who are 
4-5-3 in the last month, or the Maple Leafs, who are 5-8-1? Detroit can't stop 
goals -- Bob Essensa is 2-5-2 since being acquired from Winnipeg -- and Toronto 
can't score many. The Maple Leafs' power play, once the NHL's best, has fallen 
to 15th overall. "Special teams are losing games for us," Dave Andreychuk said. 
"Our power play is struggling and we've got to get that going. We've got to get 
our act together going into the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Pat Burns said: "We can't beat anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither can Montreal, which is 1-4-3 since March 19 and has seen Patrick Roy 
allow 32 goals in his last eight starts. The Northeast remains a four-way 
scramble among the Canadiens, Bruins, Pittsburgh Penguins and Buffalo Sabres. 
</P>
<P>
 The only team in any division finishing impressively is San Jose, which has 
won a club-record six straight games and is 6-0-2 since mid-March. SLAPSHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Milbury said he "left a million dollars on the table" to take a $150,000 
annual salary from BC for five years. However, he's getting college tuition for 
his four children and should come out almost even financially with far less 
stress. . . . Washington Coach Jim Schoenfeld has benched Mike Ridley the last 
two games. Ridley, a quietly steady center, has averaged 29 goals for nine 
seasons and is the Capitals' second-leading scorer. . . . The Calgary Flames' 
Gary Roberts has 15 goals in his last 14 games. . . . Devil defenseman Ken 
Danyeko's consecutive games-played streak ended Friday at 388 because of a 
separated left shoulder. It was the NHL's longest active streak. . . . Sather 
will be Canada's general manager in the World Championships. His coaches will 
be George Kingston, formerly of San Jose, and Tom Renney, who coached Canada's 
Olympic team to a silver medal at Lillehammer, Norway, in February. . . . The 
Stanley Cup finals could end on June 14, the latest ever.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enough is enough. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If it's not one thing with Darryl Strawberry, it's another. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After he completes his stay at a drug abuse center, the Dodgers should release 
him even if it might mean a legal battle over whether they would have to eat up 
the rest of his contract. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's inability to cope with the pressures and temptations of life in 
his hometown have soured what had been one of the most productive careers in 
baseball. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He has turned mild-mannered fans into boo birds with his poor work habits, 
lack of production, run-ins with the law, and even a show of disrespect for 
fire victims. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Drug abuse is a disease. It might have had something to do with his behavior. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 If he shows dedication in putting the pieces of his life back together, 
Strawberry will have earned another chance on the ball field. But not here. The 
Dodgers don't need any more distractions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas' 76-72 victory over Duke Monday night fit the tradition of one major 
sports event, the NCAA basketball championship, that is rarely disappointing. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was a lot better game than many who picked Arkansas to win easily 
had expected. When the Razorbacks took a six-point lead in the second half 
after coming from 10 points down, it seemed as though the fatigued Blue Devils 
might fold. They didn't. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Unless sophomore forward Corliss Williamson decides to turn pro, the 
Razorbacks will be prohibitive preseason favorites to repeat. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Back-to-back home runs: Joe Carter's ended the 1993 season and Ray Lankford's 
opened the 1994 season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Ripken's 1,897 consecutive game streak is 1,735 games ahead of his closest 
pursuer, Jeff Conine. The Florida outfielder was the only other major league 
player to participate in all 162 games last season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Giving the home-field advantage automatically to the AL East and Central and 
NL Central and West winners in the first round of the playoffs doesn't make 
sense. It should be based on won-loss records, wild-card teams excluded. . . . 
The Cleveland Indians' new uniforms are a nice fit for Jacobs Field. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Murray might not like to chat with writers, but few first basemen are as 
sociable with baserunners as the Locke High graduate who set a major league 
record Monday for number of games played at that position. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Laker fans should not fret about the growing possibility that the team will 
miss the lottery again. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 First of all, this is a shallow draft. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And if they finish with the best or second-best record among the lottery 
teams, the odds against the Lakers improving their draft position in the 
Ping-Pong ball draw and landing one of the top three picks will be enormous. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Besides, this team has shown so much spark since the coaching change to Magic 
Johnson that it just might give someone trouble in the playoffs. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Remember how Randy Pfund's team scared the Phoenix Suns last year? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the Lakers, the Clippers have shown about as much emotion 
lately as the L.A. Kings. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Abdul-Jabbar will pinch-hit for Magic Johnson, who has business 
elsewhere that night, and present the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. lifetime 
achievement award to Marcus Allen Saturday at Magic's ninth annual award dinner 
and auction at the Beverly Hilton. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The 76ers vs. the Celtics used to be a big thing in Philadelphia, but they 
drew a crowd announced as only 7,810 Sunday at the Spectrum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Bob Arum is planning a multi-title fight card in Southern California 
in conjunction with the World Cup finals in July. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Arum's next show at the Olympic Auditorium -- Hector Lopez vs. Rod Sequenan, 
Ray Lovato vs. Bronco McKart -- has been set back to April 23. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Riddick Bowe is scheduled to fight Buster Mathis Jr. June 11 at Atlantic City. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky, who won't be in the playoffs, is featured in a Stanley Cup 
promo on ESPN. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If I owned the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, I would have made Jimmy Johnson coach, 
general manager, and part-owner the day after he left the Dallas Cowboys. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 Only 29 of 64 jockeys who have ridden at Santa Anita this meeting have won a 
race and only 150 of the 336 trainers have entered a horse. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The team from Santa Anita that plays in the Glendora roller hockey league 
calls itself the Horsemen. But that isn't as catchy as the nickname of a recent 
opponent that was composed of policemen and firemen -- Guns and Hoses.

 The Final Four all-tournament team was Corliss Williamson of Arkansas (most 
valuable player), Grant Hill of Duke, Antonio Lang of Duke, Corey Beck of 
Arkansas and Scotty Thurman of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke is 2-5 in NCAA championship games, which is the record for most losses in 
title games by one school. Kansas, Kentucky and North Carolina each have four. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski is 39-9 in NCAA tournament games. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Having Hillary Rodham Clinton as a guest speaker at Duke's graduation in May 
does not bother Blue Devil senior Antonio Lang, despite the First Lady's 
association with Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as she remembers who I am (from the NCAA championship game)," said 
Lang, who will graduate with a degree in economics, "I don't have any 
complaints." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Final Fours of the future: Kingdome, Seattle (1995); Meadowlands, East 
Rutherford, N.J. (1996); Hoosier Dome, Indianapolis (1997); Alamodome, San 
Antonio (1998); ThunderDome, St. Petersburg, Fla. (1999); Hoosier Dome, 
Indianapolis (2000); Metrodome, Minneapolis (2001); Georgia Dome, Atlanta 
(2002).

<P>
 Next year's sub-regionals: Albany, N.Y. and Baltimore (East); Memphis and 
Tallahassee, Fla. (Southeast); Dayton, Ohio, and Austin, Tex. (Midwest); Salt 
Lake City and Boise, Idaho (West). Regional finals: East Rutherford, N.J. 
(East); Birmingham, Ala. (Southeast); Kansas City (Midwest), Berkeley (West).

 Duke star Grant Hill: "Where I lived in Reston (Virginia), there were a lot of 
good players. Michael Jackson was from my neighborhood and he grew up and 
played for Georgetown and won a championship. Everybody wanted to be like 
Michael Jackson -- both Michael Jacksons, I guess. We wanted to dance and shoot 
the ball, too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's father, Calvin, former NFL star, met a fellow Yale alumnus, President 
Clinton, last Saturday at the Charlotte Coliseum. Grant said: "Instead of 
calling him Mr. President, he just walked into the room and yelled 'Bill!' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spoofing a popular TV commercial, President Clinton began the telecast of the 
Duke-Arkansas game by saying: "Am I going to the national championship? Yes, I 
am!" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The coach of North Carolina A&T, Arkansas' first-round opponent in this year's 
tournament, had a special interest in Monday night's championship game. Jeff 
Capel's son, Jeff Jr., is a freshman guard for Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so rewarding to to see him play at this level," the elder Capel said. "I 
was very proud of him. The three seniors (Grant Hill, Antonio Lang and Marty 
Clark) have really helped Jeff make the transition. And I don't mean just on 
the basketball court. They have helped him in a lot of ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been at his games at the last two sites Duke has played. We are very 
proud of him." LONNIE WHITE

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD; REDLANDS SENIOR MAKES FAST RISE TO THE TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat Johnson's rise to the top of the track and field world has been almost as 
fast as his sprint times this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a senior at Redlands High, did not take up the sport until last year, 
and then a hip injury sidelined him for much of the season. Although he has 
raced only 16 times, Johnson leads the nation in the 100 meters, with a time of 
10.42 seconds, and 200, with a 20.70. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why I never thought about going out for track earlier," he said. 
"Some of the (football) coaches at school noticed my speed and encouraged me to 
give it a try. I'm just out there having some fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The hip injury healed in time for Johnson to compete in the Citrus Belt League 
Championships last season, and he eventually qualified for the Southern Section 
and State meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson placed fourth in the State 200, in 22.04, but it was not until the 
Inland Empire Championships at UC Riverside 10 days ago that Johnson put 
everyone on notice. He upset Bryan Howard of Moreno Valley Canyon Springs in 
the 100 and 200, clocking the nation's leading prep times in both events. 
Howard, a junior, is the defending State champion in the 100 and was second in 
the 200. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bryan and I are good friends, but I noticed he didn't call me last week," 
Johnson said. "I'm just out there running as fast as I can and I'm not really 
thinking about him or anyone else. Right now, this is something I'm trying not 
to take too seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Howard face a rematch in the Arcadia/Foot Locker Invitational 
Saturday night at Arcadia High. The meet, one of the most prestigious of the 
season, features top athletes from 15 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Another record-setting performance by Johnson might cause him to second-guess 
his decision to sign a football letter of intent with Oregon in February. The 
wide receiver said he did not want to risk waiting on a track scholarship in 
case he suffered another injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I faxed the (Oregon) football coaches a story on the Inland Empire meet, so I 
hope they passed my times along to the track coaches," Johnson said. "I would 
like to compete in both sports there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most attractive events at Arcadia figures to be the boys' high 
jump, featuring the nation's top three competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading the list is Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo, who leads the pack with a 
jump of 7 feet 4 inches. Fischer, a senior who signed with Wisconsin, set his 
personal mark of 7-4 in the recent Santa Barbara Easter Relays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to set height records, but it would be great if I could go 7-5 
or 7-6 before I graduate," he said. "Since I'm only 5-9, that's really jumping 
over my head." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, who finished second in the State meet last year, will face Art Lloyd 
of Rialto Eisenhower and Rodney White of Indianapolis Pike, among others. Lloyd 
jumped 7-2 in a dual meet last month, and White has cleared 7-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The national prep record of 7-5 1/4, set by Dothel Edwards of Athens, Ga., in 
1984, is likely to be broken this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Keep an eye on freshman Obea Moore of Pasadena Muir, one of the youngest 
competitors at Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 15, will run in the 800 and 1,600 relay. He has clocked a 1:54.78 in 
the 800 and anchors the team's 1,600 relay team, which has the second-fastest 
time in the nation at 3:14.10. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm going to have a chance at all in the 800, it is going to have to come 
from the heart," he said. "But I'm not running to place fourth. I'm going out 
to win it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore had a glittering junior high career, breaking 2 minutes in the 800 when 
he was 12 and running 47.16 seconds in the 400 last year. 
</P>

 After sitting out three games last week, pitcher Randy Wolf of Woodland Hills 
El Camino Real returned to the mound Wednesday and led his team to a 14-7 
victory over Thousand Oaks in the championship game of the Thousand Oaks 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, I just wanted to do it for dad," Wolf said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most valuable player in the City Division 4-A last season was referring to 
James Wolf, who died of a heart attack on March 27. He was 56, and had attended 
all of El Camino Real's games. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Wolf, who has signed a letter of intent with Pepperdine, sat out a 
doubleheader last Monday and attended Tuesday's game against Quartz Hill, but 
did not play. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Thousand Oaks, Wolf hit a home run and improved his record to 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of got me in the heart a little bit," teammate Justin Martin said 
of the homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Services for James Wolf were held Friday, and the family requested that in 
lieu of flowers, donations should be made to the school's baseball program.

 Irvine Woodbridge center fielder Alison Johnsen and shortstop Carrie Brown 
were injured when they collided while going after a fly ball in a softball game 
against Santa Ana Mater Dei on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen was knocked unconscious for a minute, and Brown suffered a broken left 
fibula. Both were taken to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana and hospitalized 
overnight for observation. Johnsen is expected to be sidelined for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 29-minute delay, umpires suspended the game until Monday. Mater Dei 
was ahead, 6-0, in the third inning at the time of the collision and eventually 
won, 11-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnsen caught the short fly, but Brown could not stop and hit her teammate in 
the temple with her knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Dugard, Woodbridge's coach, said it was the worst collision he has seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're both going to get anything that's hit. Unfortunately, both were going 
full tilt when they hit," he said. "Losing a game means nothing; losing kids, 
that's tough." Times' Top 20 Baseball Poll

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: FINISHING SECOND WAS NOT ALL BAD FOR COYOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If losing in the final of the NCAA Division II women's basketball tournament 
has diminished the feeling of accomplishment for Cal State San Bernardino, it 
should not. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first trip to the tournament for the Coyotes (29-4), and few 
teams make it to the final on their first try. 
</P>
<P>
 North Dakota State defeated San Bernardino, 89-56, in the championship game at 
Fargo, N.D., for its second consecutive title. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino knew ahead of the game that it faced a difficult task.  
</P>
<P>
 Playing the defending champion Bison in their home state was difficult enough, 
but it became even tougher with only eight players on the Coyote roster. 
</P>
<P>
 This lack of depth turned out to be a major factor in the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Felice Logan and Mary Alice Lott fouled out early in the second half, so San 
Bernardino, which had trailed by 11 points at halftime, was down to six 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, two of San Bernardino's stars, Kim Young and Tammie Beckley, were 
injured. Young finished the game despite a twisted ankle, but Beckley had to 
leave for a second time after she chased a loose ball into the stands and 
hyperextended a knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Chery'll Few, San Bernardino's only four-year player, led the Coyotes with 25 
points and Young had 22. Both were named to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
 Although San Bernardino's trash-talking and physical style of play did not win 
many friends among its opponents, Coach Luvina Beckley should be commended for 
taking a team of eight all the way to the final. 
</P>

 Kenny Warren has played in five Final Fours during four years at Cal State 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren, a senior guard, went to four the traditional way as a member of 
Bakersfield's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he went a fifth time as the only Division II player invited to the 
National Assn. of Basketball Coaches All-Star game played during Final Four 
weekend Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if he didn't play a lot and missed all seven of his shots.He played 
his style of game -- five of those seven shots were three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, it was only an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Warren had stood out, his chances of reaching the NBA were as slim as 
his 6-foot, 175-pound frame. 
</P>
<P>
 When it really counted -- in the NCAA Division II final against Southern 
Indiana last week -- Warren stood big and tall. He made 50% of his shots, 
including two three-pointers, for a game-high 21 points. He also had 11 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 His three-point shot from NBA range helped spark an 11-2 first-half run that 
put Bakersfield in command of the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember feeling great last year, but this year was just indescribable," 
Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season's team was undefeated. This season's was under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much talk of a second championship only three weeks ago, after 
Bakersfield lost in the CCAA tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
 During the conference tournament, the defense, which had been ranked second in 
the nation, gave up nearly 10 more points than its average. The offense was 
inconsistent at best. Star point guard Tyrone Davis said that even the 
victories seemed tough. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Roadrunners turned it around and ultimately defeated Southern Indiana, 
92-86, to become only the third school to win consecutive NCAA Division II 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield (27-6) is the first to do it in 25 years. The last was Kentucky 
Wesleyan in 1968 and 1969. Evansville accomplished the feat twice, in 1959 and 
1960 and in 1964 and 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren holds seven school records, all in three-point categories.

KERNEN'S DOGHOUSE FILLS BEFORE CSUN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Kernen went to the symphony over the weekend, but predictably, his 
thoughts weren't far from the baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 While watching Zubin Mehta, whom Kernen called the "Babe Ruth of conductors," 
wave his wand through Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, the Cal State Northridge 
baseball coach couldn't help but wonder about the discordant state of his own 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a quarter of a million notes or whatever in a symphony and he did it 
all without sheet music," Kernen said. "You should have seen it. All those 
instruments, working together." 
</P>
<P>
 Minus the players Kernen says continue to march to the beat of their own drum, 
the Matadors nonetheless managed to knock off Pepperdine, 6-4, in a 
nonconference game at Eddie D. Field Stadium on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Northridge (18-16) loses any more players, Kernen may be soon be 
singing a capella. He can't seem to find the same magic wand. 
</P>
<P>
 Second verse, different from the first. The coach posted a list on the 
clubhouse wall at Northridge of players who were making the bus trip to Malibu. 
Seven players -- including starters Keyaan Cook, Tyler Nelson, Josh Smaler and 
Kevin Howard -- weren't listed and were left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen said the seven have not been suspended or removed from the team, but 
remain in a "limbo" that started Wednesday against Cal Lutheran when the coach 
refused to allow the team to play in uniform and benched several starters. 
Kernen said the team routinely has not played with requisite fire and that the 
exiled seven refuse to be coached. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, only 12 players dressed against Pepperdine and Kernen said he 
doesn't expect the number to grow for tonight's game at Cal State Long Beach. 
First baseman Jason Shanahan and shortstop Chad Thornhill, benched last week, 
were reinserted into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assume whoever wasn't in uniform has some kind of problem," Kernen said. "I 
had a few days to think about things, I had a lot of questions on my mind. 
There was no evidence from the entire team standpoint that anything changed 
dramatically (from last week)." 
</P>
<P>
 The banished seven attended the game and watched from the stands in street 
clothes. The mood was subdued, both in the stands and the dugout. The seven 
remain a little mystified about what kind of commitment Kernen is seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has it in his mind who's gonna play and it doesn't matter what you think," 
said sophomore pitcher Evan Howland, one of those sidelined. "I went to 
practice all week. I want to be out there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to figure out what the magic solution is." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Howland admitted there has been no consistency in the team effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's right about that," Howland said. "It's different every single day. But 
we all want to go out and play." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kernen: "I'm laying the groundwork for future teams and validating the 
effort of past teams. I can write certain guys off. The conclusion I reached is 
that some guys won't be coached." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the patchwork lineup, the Matadors (18-16) managed to hold off 
Pepperdine (19-14), which had won 10 of 13. The Waves committed five errors, 
including three by shortstop Erik Martinez and another by third baseman Jason 
Cohen, both transfers from Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like watching us play," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brian Vasey singled home two runs in the first, Northridge didn't score 
another earned run. Aaron D'Aoust (6-1) allowed two runs in five innings of 
relief to pick up the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kernen's intent is to motivate, he has done exactly that. And not just with 
the benched players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't let you get comfortable," said second baseman Joey Arnold, who had 
two hits. "The minute you get comfortable, you could be outta here."

VALLEY AREA HIGH SCHOOL ROUNDUP; KOZLOWSKI, KAVANAGH PROPEL SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was a rally that started with a cloud of dust and ended with a blast. It 
was only four batters long, but for Simi Valley High right-hander Kary 
Kozlowski, it was plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pioneers scored four runs on four consecutive hits in the sixth inning of 
a 4-1 victory against host Thousand Oaks in a key early-season Marmonte League 
game Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley was having trouble hitting Thousand Oaks starter Tim Baron, 
managing only two hits in the first five innings. But with one out in the 
sixth, Ryan Hankins beat out a chopper to second. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Scheffels sliced a soft double into right field, advancing Hankins to 
third base. Thousand Oaks pulled its infield in and Pioneer Jeff Michael 
grounded a single down the third base line, driving in Hankins and Scheffels. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Kavanagh followed Michael with a home run, his third of the season, 
giving Simi Valley a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always going to hit," Kavanagh said. "It's just a matter of time. 
Sooner or later the other pitcher is going to throw us one of those meatballs 
and we're going to get him." 
</P>
<P>
 Kozlowski (4-0) gave up only three singles, struck out four and walked one. At 
one point, he retired 13 consecutive batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron (4-1) pitched almost as well, giving up six hits and no walks. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was the first in a key week for the Pioneers (10-1, 4-0 in league 
play). Having handed Thousand Oaks (9-4, 2-1) its first league loss, Simi 
Valley will play host to Newbury Park, the only other Marmonte team without a 
loss in league play, on Wednesday and Agoura on Friday. JEFF FLETCHER

PREP BASEBALL; DAEDELOW, HUNTINGTON BEACH STAGE ANOTHER COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a comfortable situation for Huntington Beach's Craig Daedelow. The 
Oilers were trailing and he was at the plate late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 A moment later, the score was tied and Huntington Beach was on its way to a 
3-2 victory over Capistrano Valley in the first round of the Dole Big West 
Invitational at Irvine High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Daedelow's two-run triple sparked a three-run sixth. It was the sixth 
come-from-behind victory this season for the Oilers (10-2), who are ranked 
second in Orange County. It also was the third consecutive loss for the 
ninth-ranked Cougars (8-4), who have fallen rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars have lost four of six games since they were ranked No. 1 in the 
county two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're snake-bit," Cougar assistant coach Ron Drake mumbled after Monday's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were going fine for the Cougars through five innings. They were ahead, 
2-0, and pitcher Brandon Puffer was sailing along. But the Oilers were far from 
rattled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother us when we get behind," said Daedelow, a senior shortstop. 
"We figure we can come back no matter the score." 
</P>
<P>
 That's more than idle talk. After all, the Oilers trailed Edison, 11-3, in a 
game earlier this season and rallied to win, 12-11. 
</P>
<P>
 So Monday's comeback was child's play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why we get behind," Coach Mike Dodd said. "I know we haven't 
been swinging the bat real well." 
</P>
<P>
 Daedelow, in fact, is the only Oiler hitting with much consistency lately. He 
had two triples against the Cougars, including one in the sixth that scored 
Scott Palmer and Brad Lineberger. 
</P>
<P>
 Puffer had been strong until that point. He had given up only two hits and had 
retired eight in a row going into the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's curve ball was getting me," Daedelow said. "He threw me only two 
fastballs. I hit them both for triples." 
</P>
<P>
 Daedelow scored the go-ahead run on a groundout by Jason Segal. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitchers Jim Brewer and Ryan Evans closed out the victory. Brewer went 6 2/3 
innings, striking out five. His only mistake was a two-run double by Paul Day 
in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer (4-0) didn't get to face Day again. Evans came in with a runner on 
first and two outs. He walked Day, then struck out Ryan Gauntner for his third 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Dole Big West games: 
</P>
<P>
 Marina 6, San Jose Archbishop Mitty 3 -- Craig Wilson had two hits, including 
a single in the sixth that scored two runs, giving the Vikings a 5-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 La Quinta 8, Reno (Nev.) 0 -- C.J. Livernois went three for three with two 
runs scored and Sean Carlson was two for three with two RBIs for La Quinta 
(12-2). 
</P>
<P>
 University 7, Los Amigos 6 -- Reza Sader got his first victory, pitching five 
innings of relief for University (5-8-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Servite 5, Woodbridge 4 (10) -- Mike Sullivan singled in the top of the 10th 
to bring home Jon Goldsmith with the winning run for Servite (6-4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Carlsbad tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 7, Tucson (Ariz.) 2 -- Robert Frith went two for three, including 
his fourth home run of the season, and Brian Cook added a bases-loaded double 
for San Clemente (9-4). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Coachella Valley tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 9, Blythe Palo Verde 0 -- Andy Linnen (1-0) gave up one hit and struck 
out 10 in four innings for Edison (8-3). 
</P>
<P>
 In Freeway League baseball: 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills 7, La Habra 6 -- Andy Volpp's bases-loaded double in the bottom of 
the seventh scored two runs and completed a four-run rally for Sunny Hills 
(6-7-1, 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Garden Grove League: 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica 2, Rancho Alamitos 0 -- Zach Allen and Jeff Barndollar combined on a 
five-hit shutout for Pacifica (7-8, 2-1).

PREP SOFTBALL; UNBEATEN UPLAND BEATS MATER DEI IN TITLE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The fifth time's a charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Free-swinging Upland High won the Woodbridge Classic Monday at Harvard Park in 
Irvine, scoring a 2-1 victory over Mater Dei in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders (12-0) teased Mater Dei (10-3) before scoring two runs in the 
bottom of the sixth inning and winning the tournament for the first time in the 
five years they've attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good tournament," said Upland Coach Ed Ulloa, who lives in Irvine. 
"We like coming here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders beat three of Orange County's top 10 teams to win the title: 
Fifth-ranked Kennedy in the quarterfinals, ninth-ranked Foothill in the 
semifinals and eighth-ranked Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 They won the final because tournament most valuable player Kelly Smith (10-0, 
0.10 earned-run average) gave up five hits, facing only two over the minimum in 
the final six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei scored in the first. Lisa Tully got the first of her two singles, 
took second on a sacrifice bunt, reached third on Candace Kollen's single and 
scored on Margaret Hollis' grounder to shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 Kollen's hit gave her nine in her previous 10 at-bats; she had four hits, five 
steals and three runs batted in in an 11-2 victory over Woodbridge in the 
semifinal, a game played earlier in the day; it was suspended Saturday after 
two Warriors were injured and taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Monarch pitcher Patty Godwin (10-2), who pitched five innings in Monday's 
portion of the semifinal, battled fatigue and a blister on the index finger of 
her pitching hand. Upland hit her hard from the fourth inning on -- and scored 
in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Loya doubled and Christy Sears was hit by a pitch. A double steal and a 
passed ball on a walk scored Loya, tying the score 1-1. With runners at second 
and third, Shanna Humphries' grounder to shortstop scored Sears with the 
deciding run. 
</P>
<P>
 In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill 7, Woodbridge 0 -- Marie Gieron gave up seven hits for Foothill 
(11-5) in the third-place game. Woodbridge is 13-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy 2, Bellflower 1 -- Lisa Pitt pitched a one-hitter as Kennedy (10-3) 
took fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro 2, Lakewood 0 -- Misty Lauby pitched a two-hitter and struck out 13 
for El Toro (8-4) in the consolation championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague softball: 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia 5, Santa Ana Valley 4 -- Magnolia (7-5) won in the bottom of the 
seventh inning when Shannon Carlson tripled and scored when Santa Ana Valley 
overthrew the catcher. Jannell Hanstein also had a two-run double for the 
Sentinels.

 Barry Switzer's first team meeting with the Dallas Cowboys went fine for 20 
minutes, until wide receiver Michael Irvin spoke up and then walked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin, demonstratively upset at coach Jimmy Johnson's departure last week, 
spoke out when Switzer credited team owner Jerry Jones for building the Cowboys 
into two-time Super Bowl champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvin interrupted by talking about the difficulty players had in contract 
negotiations. Switzer reportedly asked Irvin to let him continue and asked for 
them to meet later, but Irvin marched out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got nothing to say to nobody," Irvin said later. "I don't know anything. 
Don't even bring those cameras over to my locker, because I'm not talking." 
</P>

 Irvin told the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram that he and Jones will meet today.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; KEY PROVES A PERFECT OPENING-DAY PITCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For starters, the New York Yankees couldn't have asked for anything better. 
</P>
<P>
 The sun was shining after a terrible, snowy winter. Yankee Stadium was full. 
Joe DiMaggio threw out the first pitch. And then Jimmy Key became the first 
Yankee to win consecutive opening-day starts since the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Key, coming off an 18-6 season, pitched the Yankees to a 5-3 victory over the 
Texas Rangers on Monday with late-inning help from Bob Wickman and Xavier 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at it as here is our first chance, the first test for our bullpen," 
Key said. "It was a big test, a lot of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Wickman came through, pitching out of the eighth-inning jam. Then Hernandez 
finished the job with a perfect ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Key, 5-0 in openers, gave up five hits in seven innings before Hulse and Clark 
chased him. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Boggs had four consecutive singles for the Yankees, and Danny Tartabull 
and Mike Stanley hit fifth-inning home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 7, Chicago 3 -- Roberto Alomar and the rest of the Blue Jays got to 
celebrate again at Toronto in front of Jack McDowell and the White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the Blue Jays received another set of World Series championship 
rings, Alomar hit a three-run homer that led Toronto past the White Sox and 
their Cy Young winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Carlos Delgado and Ed Sprague added consecutive home runs as Juan 
Guzman and the two-time champions won on opening day before a sellout crowd of 
50,484. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox lost in their first game since moving from the West to the new 
Central. They lost their final game of 1993 to Toronto, too, in the sixth and 
deciding game of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Alomar's home run in the seventh inning put the Blue Jays ahead for good, 4-2. 
After Joe Carter drew a leadoff walk from Jose DeLeon to start the eighth, 
Delgado and Sprague homered for a 7-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 9, Detroit 8 -- Thanks to some new speed, the Red Sox got off to a fast 
start on opening day at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Otis Nixon raced home on Mickey Tettleton's passed ball, capping a three-run 
eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Clemens, coming off the worst of his 10 seasons, broke Cy Young's Red 
Sox record with his seventh opening-day start, but was hammered for eight runs 
in 4 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston had only 73 stolen bases last season and signed Nixon to a $7-million, 
two-year deal to jolt its offense. It paid off in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Red Sox trailing 8-6, Scott Cooper doubled and John Valentin singled 
against Storm Davis. Damon Berryhill struck out, Scott Fletcher flied out and 
Nixon walked, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Hatcher's ground double inside the right-field line scored two runs. 
Mike Greenwell, booed in the seventh after his fourth consecutive out, then 
came up. With a 2-0 count, a high pitch went off Tettleton's glove and rolled 
to the backstop as Nixon scored easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 6, Kansas City 3 -- Mike Mussina rebounded from a dreadful spring 
training, and the Orioles extended the Royals' opening-day woes with the 
victory at Baltimore.  
</P>
<P>
 Mussina, who had a 6.75 ERA in six exhibition starts, gave up one run on two 
hits in eight innings. Lee Smith, signed to replace Gregg Olson as the stopper, 
got the last out for a save. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Palmeiro, also part of the Orioles' big-bucks makeover, hit a solo 
homer in his Baltimore debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost played a perfect game -- good pitching, a lot of hitting and 
outstanding defense," Palmeiro said. "It was a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmeiro received a huge ovation before the game and was asked to come out for 
a curtain call after opening the seventh inning with a homer over the 25-foot 
wall in right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some great games, but today was the first day I've gotten a ovation 
and I never felt so good in my life," he said. "I know I'm going to love this 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 47,549, the biggest regular-season crowd in the history of Camden 
Yards, saw the Orioles send Kansas City to its eighth loss in its last nine 
openers.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; CUBS LOSE DESPITE RHODES' 3 HOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karl Rhodes did the swinging and Hillary Rodham Clinton did the singing 
Monday, and still it wasn't enough for the Chicago Cubs to win on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Rhodes' three solo home runs against Dwight Gooden, the Cubs lost to 
the New York Mets, 12-8, at Chicago on a day in which the First Lady throw out 
the first pitch and later joined broadcaster Harry Caray in a rousing rendition 
of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to tell you, I don't try to hit home runs. I never have and I never 
will," Rhodes said. "I go up there and try to hit line drives." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes and George Bell are the only players to hit three home runs in an 
opener. Bell did it on April 4, 1988, for Toronto at Kansas City, but Rhodes 
was the first to do it in his first three at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden, 27-4 in his career against the Cubs, knew it might be a wild day when 
he saw the 22 m.p.h. winds blowing out to left. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was typical Wrigley Field," he said. Gooden didn't get a chance to face 
Rhodes a fourth time. He was lifted for reliever Eric Hillman, who walked 
Rhodes in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 After his walk, Rhodes singled in the ninth against John Franco to complete 
his four-for-four day. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 8, Pittsburgh 0 -- The belief that Matt Williams would feel the 
loss of free agent Will Clark was quickly put in doubt when the Giants' hitter 
homered in his first two at-bats and finished with five runs batted in.  
</P>
<P>
 That made it easy for John Burkett, who limited Pittsburgh to five hits in 
seven innings before 58,077 at San Francisco.  
</P>
<P>
 After hitting a solo shot to right-center leading off the second inning, 
Williams hurt Pirates starter Zane Smith again in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith walked Darren Lewis, who stole second and took third on an errant 
pickoff throw by catcher Don Slaught. After Willie McGee drew a two-out walk, 
Williams worked the count to 3-2 before driving the next pitch over the 
left-field wall for a 4-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 0-9 against the Giants since 1987, went four innings, giving up four 
runs on three hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 12, Colorado 6 -- Getting a homer and four RBIs from Mariano 
Duncan, the Phillies began defense of their National League East title by using 
an eight-run eighth inning to win before 72,470 at Denver. Although the game 
began in 51-degree weather, the temperature dropped steadily and light snow 
flurries began falling in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Galarraga and Joe Girardi had run-scoring singles in the seventh to put 
the Rockies ahead, 6-4, but the Phillies rallied in the eighth on only two 
hits. There were six walks, and left fielder Howard Johnson made a three-run 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies loaded the bases on two walks and an error by shortstop Walt 
Weiss before Duncan doubled into the gap in right-center field against closer 
Darren Holmes. Ricky Jordan produced the go-ahead run with a groundout, and 
another scored on Holmes' wild pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 After Johnson's error on Jim Eisenreich's liner let in three more runs, Tom 
Marsh capped the inning with an RBI single. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Heathcliff Slocumb was the winner. Mike Munoz took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 4, San Diego 1 -- Two-time Cy Young Award winner Greg Maddux gave up 
seven hits in eight innings, and Deion Sanders and rookie Ryan Klesko hit 
homers at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The Padres, who lost 101 games in 1993, got off to a bumbling start. The game 
was delayed 16 minutes to accommodate fans stuck in ticket lines due to a 
computer crash. Batting star Tony Gwynn, honored in lengthy pregame ceremonies, 
left after four innings because of a strained left calf. 
</P>
<P>
 Then staff ace Andy Benes was touched for two homers and two doubles in seven 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Javier Lopez doubled into the left-center gap with two outs in the 
second to score Fred McGriff from third. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 6, Montreal 5 -- Mitch Williams was Wild Thing again. This time, his 
new team got him off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams walked home two runs in the top of the 12th inning, but Jeff Bagwell 
singled in one run and Ken Caminiti hit a two-run double in the bottom half, 
giving the Astros the victory at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams relieved to start the 12th with the score tied at 3-3. He struck out 
Larry Walker and retired Darrin Fletcher on a grounder to shortstop, then got 
into trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wil Cordero and Jeff Gardner singled before Sean Berry walked on four pitches, 
loading the bases. Randy Milligan walked on five pitches, forcing home the 
go-ahead run, and Marquis Grissom walked on a 3-2 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 5, St. Louis 4 -- Kevin Mitchell hit a one-out homer in the 10th 
inning at Cincinnati on the day designated as the Reds' traditional opener. 
</P>
<P>
 John Smiley, the Reds' biggest disappointment last season, pitched five 
shutout innings, and Cincinnati got two-run homers from Reggie Sanders and Joe 
Oliver to go ahead, 4-0, in their pseudo opener. But the Reds' bullpen couldn't 
hold, letting St. Louis tie it in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 After winner Hector Carrasco pitched out of a bases-loaded threat in the top 
of the 10th, Mitchell hit the second pitch from Rob Murphy into the third deck 
beyond the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Marge Schott, Reds owner, snubbed the nationally televised Sunday opener 
because downtown businesses couldn't organize a pregame parade. The Reds' owner 
broke out the red-white-and-blue bunting and mascot Schottzie 02 before 
Monday's game.

CLEVELAND CHRISTENS ITS BRAND NEW ERA WITH A 4-3 VICTORY; BASEBALL: PRESIDENT 
CLINTON WATCHES THE INDIANS RALLY TO DEFEAT MARINERS ON KIRBY'S SINGLE IN THE 
11TH INNING DURING DEBUT OF NEW HOME STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The new Jacobs Field is 1.3 miles from old Municipal Stadium in the downtown 
district here, but it is more a separation of eras than of areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdened with what General Manager John Hart described as "40 years of 
baggage," the Cleveland Indians began to unload on Monday, officially opening 
their impressive new stadium, a promising new era and the 1994 season in 
befitting style. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcoming 2-0 and 3-2 deficits, the Indians defeated the Seattle Mariners, 
4-3, in 11 innings before 41,459. The crowd included an Arkansas basketball fan 
named Bill Clinton and Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller, whose statue graces an 
entrance to Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Feller delivered the ceremonial first pitches on a bright, mid-40s 
afternoon that provided a proper showcase for the $167-million stadium, 
centerpiece of the $425-million Gateway redevelopment that will also include a 
neighboring new arena for the Cleveland Cavaliers, returning from the suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, Cleveland is off the rocks and on a roll," Ohio Gov. George 
Voinovich said during a pregame news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mayor Michael White: "The story is not just the stadium, but what's 
behind it. I'm talking about the spirit and tenacity of a city that for too 
long was the brunt of unkind jokes and said 15 years ago it was going to go 
down a different road." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians have been traveling a different road since Richard Jacobs and his 
late brother, David, bought the team in 1986 and made Hart the general manager 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 They rebuilt the farm and scouting departments. They traded only for young 
players. They used creative financing to avoid arbitration and sign multiyear 
contracts with the best of those young players. 
</P>
<P>
 They now have a powerful lineup augmented by a winter foray into free agency 
and clearly stimulated by the new environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's one more thing to help us turn the corner," pitcher Chuck Nagy 
said of the new stadium. "Atmosphere is everything in the workplace. The old 
stadium was cold, dismal, depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The empty seats were a reminder of how bad we were. The result was we'd drag 
to work as late as possible. Now it's going to be just the opposite. Now we 
can't wait to get here. It's really exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, who seldom sold more than 6,000 season tickets in their 
73,000-seat former home and drew more than 2 million only twice after 1948, 
when they last won a World Series, have sold 21,000 season tickets in 1994 and 
might draw 3 million for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven Indians now make Cleveland their full-time home, attracted in part by 
the amenities of the new stadium, including a clubhouse steam room, sauna, 
weight room, hydrotherapy area, swim-in-place pool and indoor batting cages. 
</P>
<P>
 There is luxury elsewhere as well, including 119 suites costing $45,000 to 
$100,000 a year, the most expensive at ground level behind the plate. There is 
a children's play area, a picnic plaza and the largest free-standing scoreboard 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by the architects of Camden Yards and Comiskey Park and squeezed into 
28 acres, there are quirky dimensions, angles and wall heights, with the city 
skyline providing a backdrop in left and center fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Financed in large measure by an alcohol and cigarette tax and named after the 
team owner, who paid $13.8 million to the stadium commission for that honor, 
Jacobs Field can be seen as different things to different people, but Hart said 
he saw in it a positive impact on his promising team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about hope and optimism," he said of the stadium. "There are some 
charming old ballparks like Wrigley and Fenway, but there was nothing charming 
about Municipal Stadium and it's been a long time since there were any memories 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians provided some for their opening day crowd. Held hitless by Randy 
Johnson through seven innings, they gained a 2-2 tie in the eighth on a double 
by Manny Ramirez, tied the score again, 3-3, on a double by Jim Thome in the 
10th, then won in the 11th on a Wayne Kirby single after Eddie Murray doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key acquisitions of the winter, Murray appeared in his 2,369th game 
at first base, a major league record. Dennis Martinez, another important 
addition, gave up only two runs in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 A new era? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not Jimmy Johnson. I can't guarantee a pennant, but we do have a chance 
to win -- and not just this year, but through the rest of the decade," Hart 
said. "It's probably been since the 1940s or '50s that there was that kind of 
feeling in this town."

 T-Bill Rates Rise: The Treasury Department sold $12.7 billion of new 
three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.71%, up from 3.5% last week. 
Another $12.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an average discount 
rate of 4.02%, up from 3.85% last week.The three-month bill rate was the 
highest since the bills sold for 3.75% on June 1, 1992. The rate for six-month 
bills was the highest since it averaged 4.19% on March 30, 1992. The new 
discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 3.8% for 
three-month bills, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,906.20, and 4.16% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,796.80. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value.

SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: ALSO-RANS IN THE NAME GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE APPLEGATE, Jane Applegate is a syndicated columnist and author. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a plummeting stock market and jitters brought on by an overheated 
economy, 540 Americans stopped worrying long enough to submit more than 600 of 
their favorite and least favorite business names to the 1994 Great and 
Not-So-Great Small Business Name contest. 
</P>
<P>
 It took one exhausted columnist about 12 hours to open, sort, laugh and review 
the submissions. While most people sent in one or two names, some sent in two 
dozen or more. Others, in a blatant attempt to influence the judge's decision, 
sent in autographed baseball cards, plastic wind-up toys, T-shirts, computer 
mouse pads, hand-made greeting cards, family photographs, videotapes, business 
cards and photocopied Yellow Pages from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Proud fathers nominated sons, mothers crowed about their daughters and several 
husbands cheerfully submitted their wives' business names. Due to the 
overwhelming outpouring of nominations, the runners-up in several categories 
follow. The national grand prize winners will be featured in this space next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Some names, like "The Garden of Beadin" bead shop in Garberville, Calif., were 
clever. Irene McDonnell of Falls Church, Va., nominated a beauty shop called 
"Hairforce 1." The name sticks in her mind because it's near Andrews Air Force 
Base where Air Force One is stationed. A couple of Northwest coffee companies 
were nominated, including the "Higher Ground" in Eugene, Ore., and "The Bean 
Buzz" in nearby Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac Broberg of Minneapolis came very close to submitting this year's worst 
name with the "Cheek to Cheek" diaper service. "Useful Products" based in Los 
Gatos, Calif., would win the most boring name category, if there was one. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Leach of Piedmont, Calif., likes the "Uprisings Bakery" in Berkeley, 
especially since it's "an apt double entendre if you know Berkeley's 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the construction and home improvement category produced a wealth of 
contenders. Martha Miller nominated her husband, Gene, who's known around Iowa 
as "Miller the Driller." His Des Moines-based drilling contractor has been 
dubbed "Iowa's Most Boring Contractor," and "rest assured, we do the 'hole' 
job," writes Mrs. Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Hutson, a Sierra Madre handyman, calls his business, "Ron's Around Tuitt 
Fix-It Service." Hutson admits he borrowed the name from a small wooden sign he 
spotted in a Solvang gift shop. The sign said: "We know your husband can make 
these for you, but will he ever get around tuit?" 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood-based "Totally Nuts & Bolts and Supply Co." topped the list in 
the construction category. Eddie Joseph submitted the name with a reminder that 
his federal trademark registration is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and Him Carpet Cleaning" was submitted by its grammatically challenged 
owner, Trevor Ward. Laurie Touhey of West Paterson, N.J., cast her vote for 
"Sham Home Improvement," based in Queens, N.Y. "The owner's name is Ghan Sham, 
so apparently he thought it was appropriate," writes Touhey. "I wonder if he 
realizes the implications his name is giving to his carpentry and Sheetrock 
business!" 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Sweet likes her husband David's name for his Story City, Iowa, 
construction company: "Home Sweet Home Construction." And, any knucklehead 
could figure out that San Francisco-based "Floods, Floods, Floods Inc." 
provides emergency pumping and drying out services to water-logged businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 John Smith, owner of "HappyVac Cleaning Service" in Orlando, Fla., sent in a 
color photograph of himself proudly standing next to his HappyVac van. He says 
his name is great because "it is positive and easy to remember." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sewer Rat," a sewer cleaning service in Arlington, Tex., was nominated by Gay 
Hawke of Centreville, Va., Treasurer Paul Machado nominated his family's "Macho 
Concrete Construction Co." in Upper Marlboro, Md. Machado says his mother, who 
serves as president, "had second thoughts" about the name, but most people like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Minneapolis health care consulting firm called "Third Opinion" was a front 
runner, as was "A Tale of Two Kitties," a catalogue for cat lovers based in 
Studio City. "Oph Tha Waul Surfware," in Orlando, Fla. is pronounced "off the 
wall," according to owner Charlie Trefry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once our customers figure it out, they can never forget it." Briefly . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Save the date: The 1995 White House Conference on Small Business is set to 
convene June 11 to 15 in Washington, D.C. But there's plenty to do before the 
national meeting next summer. Fifty-nine state and regional conferences have 
been scheduled to identify the top small-business concerns and to elect 
delegates to the conference. A total of 1,825 elected and appointed delegates 
will be charged with drafting and prioritizing national small-business policy 
recommendations. Anyone who owns, works for or serves as an officer of a 
business with fewer than 500 employees can qualify to be a delegate. The work 
done by the delegates will be submitted to President Clinton and members of 
Congress. The first state conference is slated for June 2 in Wilmington, Del. 
For additional information, call the White House conference headquarters: (202)

</P>
<P>
 Douglas Whaley, who works on "The Simpsons" television show, says he spends 
his days "satirizing the wonderful world of business." Whaley, who previously 
worked in advertising and design, sent in these tips for business owners trying 
to select a good name for their venture: 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep the name to three or fewer syllables. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tape record your voice to hear how your business name will sound to others. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid overused name extensions such as Bar Stools 2000 or Hair Plugs R-Us. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure your business name is easy to spell. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose a name that accurately reflects your business. Don't call yourself 
Creative Croissants if your business isn't innovative in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Visualize your name on a directory. Ask yourself if someone would be able to 
guess what business you're in by your name alone.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: DISNEY TEAM WAS EXAMPLE OF RARE STABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the tragic death of Walt Disney Co. President Frank G. Wells on Sunday, 
Hollywood seemed to be enjoying a rare period of calm. For the first time in 
recent memory, all of the major entertainment companies had their executive 
houses in order, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Daly and Terry Semel agreed to share power as co-chairmen at Warner 
Bros., Tom Pollock extended his contract as MCA movie chief, Sherry Lansing and 
Kerry McCluggage were reaffirmed as division chiefs by Paramount's new owners 
and Peter Chernin settled into his chairman's job at 20th Century Fox. Even 
Sony Pictures, known as management upheaval central, was recovering from the 
defection of movie group president Jonathan Dolgen. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of quietude is increasingly rare in Hollywood, even though it pays 
serious lip service to the value of stability in deference to Wall Street and 
the creative community. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells was one exception. In his decade-long career at Disney, the 62-year-old 
executive helped create one of the all-time corporate successes in partnership 
with Chairman Michael D. Eisner. The company's value rose more than tenfold, 
from $2 billion to $22 billion. But Disney executives also had a rare personal 
unity. In the wake of Wells' death, even those close to the company had trouble 
delineating who did what. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells was also one of Hollywood's best-liked executives. News of his death on 
Monday brought an unusual outpouring of grief. Many in Hollywood saw a direct 
correlation between the kind of management stability Wells brought to the 
company and its creative success. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman and President Sidney J. Sheinberg have the 
longest working relationship, at more than 30 years, although the company is 
now owned by Matsushita. Second place belongs to Warner Bros., where Daly and 
Semel have worked together for more than a decade. The premium that the two 
companies place on longevity was illustrated last week, when both made 
prominent announcements of executive-stabilizing moves within days of one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney team had the third-longest marriage, before Wells' untimely death. 
On Monday, the executive, who also served as chief operating officer of the 
company, was credited with playing a role in everything from television and 
feature film successes to the broad expansion of Disney's theme park and 
retailing businesses. People close to the company predicted that Eisner will 
take his time replacing Wells, who was a close friend in addition to a business 
associate. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining studios have tacitly acknowledged the benefits of stable 
management at one time or another, but without the same level of commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony Pictures Entertainment Chairman Peter Guber is the next most senior 
executive, with five years experience. Sony Corp., the parent company, extended 
his contract in November, and Guber recently said that he intends to remain on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Guber's efforts to project a stable image have been undercut by the 
departures of former co-chairman Jon Peters, former Columbia Pictures Chairman 
Frank Price, former TriStar Pictures Chairman Mike Medavoy and Dolgen, who 
shared responsibility for Columbia and TriStar. 
</P>
<P>
 Company sources say that a search is under way for a credible successor to 
Dolgen. They also say Sony's revolving-door problems are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Day-to-day business is quieter at 20th Century Fox. Chernin is said to have 
the full confidence of owner Rupert Murdoch, who is filling the role played by 
former Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller. 
</P>
<P>
 While the film community is still getting to know Chernin, a former TV 
executive who was named to his post in late 1992, sources credit him with 
bringing a low-key, collegial style to Fox -- which went through a succession 
of chairmen before him. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernin also gets high marks for recruiting former Disney executive Bill 
Mechanic as 20th Century Fox president. 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger question mark is Paramount. Film chief Lansing and TV head McCluggage 
seem to have the confidence of Dolgen, who was brought over to run 
entertainment by Viacom Inc. But rumors persist of lower-level changes at the 
studio, which has had three chairmen in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone is also expected to consolidate some 
operations, which could lead to other studio changes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He's got the power: Rack up another honor for super director-producer Steven 
Spielberg. Premiere magazine has named him the most powerful person in 
Hollywood on its Top 100 list. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg, whose name was No. 13 on last year's list, was elevated in 
recognition of the runaway success of "Jurassic Park" and "Schindler's List." 
"Jurassic" has taken in nearly $1 billion worldwide; "Schindler's" recently won 
the Academy Award for best picture -- as had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out Premiere's Top 5 are Warner Bros.' Daly and Semel, Creative 
Artists Agency Chairman Michael S. Ovitz, Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey 
Katzenberg and MCA President Sheinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore is ranked No. 100, in recognition of his influence in 
shaping communications technology policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiere also has a Top 10 category for "behind the curtain" players.

 Politics: A 26-year-old state legislator from Providence, R.I., is winning 
strong support from Hollywood in his campaign for Congress.MCA Chairman Lew R. 
Wasserman's fund-raiser for the young politician attracted contributions from 
QVC chief Barry Diller, Motown Records Chairman Clarence Avant, MCA President 
Sidney J. Sheinberg and other luminaries, the Providence Journal-Bulletin 
reported. Non-industry backers include real estate baron and San Francisco 
Giants owner Walter Shorenstein, professional golfer Amy Alcott and Los Angeles 
gay activist David Mixner. The source of the youthful Rhode Islander's appeal? 
Hollywood tends to favor liberal causes, so perhaps it's that candidate Patrick 
Kennedy is a left-leaning Democrat, much like his father, Sen. Edward M.

VOLUNTEERS: THEY HELP INJURED HUMMINGBIRDS FOR A SONG; RETIREES JIM AND HELEN 
BISHOP OF ANAHEIM GIVE THEIR TIME AND MONEY TO REHABILITATE AND RELEASE THE 
DELICATE CREATURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY K. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim and Helen Bishop are tending to a hummingbird as if it were their precious 
child. They quietly peer into its cage, carefully checking the tiny creature 
for signs of distress. 
</P>
<P>
 With a diminished look of concern on their faces, the Bishops are momentarily 
satisfied by the bird's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its frailty, Jim and Helen will continue to check for changes every 
few minutes. A significant drop in food and water levels requires instant 
replenishing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bishops call themselves "bird rehabers." For the past nine years, they 
have volunteered their services and donated some of their savings to help 
injured hummingbirds. 
</P>
<P>
 They nurse these delicate creatures back to health with the hope of releasing 
them back into the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 As the only state and federally licensed people in Orange County to actively 
take in hummingbirds, they receive about 250 injured birds a year from local 
veterinarians and animal shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Their Anaheim home resembles an Army M.A.S.H. unit. Two incubators await an 
emergency arrival of baby hummers. And cages are scattered throughout the 
property, filling up the back yard and almost every room of the house. Not all 
of the cages are occupied, but all are meticulously set up, ready to house a 
new occupant. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are both retired -- he worked in tool maintenance at McDonnell 
Douglas in Long Beach, and she was a nurse at St. Mary's Hospital in Long Beach 
-- the Bishops are so dedicated to birds that they haven't traveled far from 
their home of more than 20 years since they started caring for them. "The 
reason we haven't taken a vacation is that hummingbird season is almost 
year-round," Helen said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Bishops -- who have no children -- decided to specialize in hummingbird 
care because "no one seems to want to get involved helping with hummingbirds' 
recuperation. They require a lot of attention, and the formula we import from 
Germany is very expensive," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we spent about $450 to $500 just for the imported hummingbird 
food," she said. "That's not counting the other food we use" as a diet staple. 
</P>
<P>
 He explained: "The (baby) hummingbirds get fed every 15 minutes, from sunup to 
sundown, with the imported formula. So with the time spent in formula mixing 
and feedings, we maybe get a few hours sleep before we have to get up again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This little fella was about that big when we got him," Jim said, pointing to 
the tip of his little finger. "We fed him for about a day, then he started to 
self-feed." 
</P>
<P>
 Found on a driveway, he said the bird must have fallen out of his nest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they fall there is no way for the mother to get him back home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within five days of care, the little hummer took its first flight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back yard, larger permanent "flight cages" are set up for the next 
phase of the birds' recovery. These cages simulate a natural environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make sure (the birds) know enough to go into the flowers for food by 
keeping different types of feeders in the cage," Jim said. "We also hang a 
bucket of banana skins to attract fruit flies for their needed protein." 
</P>
<P>
 He said store-bought feeders with the red-dyed sugar water will not keep the 
birds alive without an additional source of food supplement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bird will not survive on sugar alone. They need protein to absorb the 
sugar," he said, adding that birds should not be allowed to become dependent on 
the feeders. "Sugar water should be used as a supplement when natural food is 
not available: early in the morning, just before sundown or in the heat of the 
day when the flowers are shriveled up." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than using the prepackaged hummingbird food with red dye, Jim suggests 
people mix their own sugar water, eliminating the red dye that may be hard for 
the bird to ingest. He said to use distilled water or water that has been 
boiled for at least 10 minutes to kill bacteria. Let it cool, then mix one part 
sugar to four parts water. Feeders should be taken down every few days, cleaned 
and refreshed with new sugar water. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bishops are also licensed to care for passerine (small songbirds) and the 
California gnatcatcher. But Jim doesn't think he'll be able help a gnatcatcher. 
"Being that the California gnatcatcher is an endangered species, chances are 
very slim that anyone would ever find one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Records are kept of each bird that has entered the Bishops' home and are 
submitted every month to the state and every year to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The required record-keeping serves another purpose: The Bishops glance through 
these records as if they were scrapbooks of children who have left the nest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep track of every bird that comes in here," said Helen. "We insist that 
every one of them is given a name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a call yesterday (from a person who had brought in an injured 
hummingbird) and we looked up the bird," Helen said. 
</P>
<P>
 With an ear-to-ear smile on her face, she said, "It was released." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Bishops encourage people who have found injured birds to take them to the 
nearest veterinarian or animal shelter. Because of the possibility of 
overcrowding at their home, the Bishops do not receive the birds directly.

FIRST LADY'S BROKER USED IMPROPER BLOCK TRADING; MARKET: PRACTICE COULD ALLOW 
UNFAIR SPLIT OF PROFITS, LOSSES. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT MRS. CLINTON 
BENEFITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Hayden McIlroy made spectacular 
profits in the commodities markets by doing business with Robert L. (Red) Bone, 
a broker in the Springdale, Ark., office of a Chicago-based trading firm. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until McIlroy visited the trading floor in Chicago in early 1979 
that he met a young trader named Ira Brill and discovered what may have been 
one factor in making such success possible. 
</P>
<P>
 As McIlroy recalled in subsequent court testimony, Brill revealed that he 
regularly bought cattle futures in blocks of 600 contracts at a time on behalf 
of a large pool of Springdale clients of the trading firm. Then, after the 
market closed and the outcome of the day's ventures was clear, the contracts -- 
many purchased without the permission of the individual customers -- were 
divvied up and assigned to specific accounts by the trading firm, Ray E. 
Friedman & Co., commonly called REFCO. 
</P>
<P>
 "His (Brill's) job was to hold the orders and not turn them in until 
Springdale had called him after the market closed and (had) given him customer 
account numbers and how they wanted those orders divided between all customers 
in the Springdale office," McIlroy said. In other words, brokers in the 
Springdale office were buying and selling contracts in large blocks, then 
allocating gains and losses after the fact to their roster of clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Such so-called day-trades were subject to less stringent margin, or credit, 
requirements and the pooling of resources also made it possible for REFCO to 
make larger commodity purchases. Thus, investors with relatively modest amounts 
of capital could take part in deals that offered far larger potential profits 
than they otherwise would have been able to obtain. 
</P>
<P>
 One of REFCO's clients in 1978 and 1979, a notably successful one with a 
modest grubstake, was Mrs. Clinton, wife of the governor of Arkansas and future 
First Lady of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Block trading is a practice that violated the rules of the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange at the time and has since been made illegal because it gives 
unscrupulous brokers the power to allocate profits and losses to their clients 
on the basis of favoritism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It opens the window of opportunity for fraud," explained Elliot Bercovitz, 
vice president for strategic planning at Lind-Weldock, Inc., of Chicago, one of 
the nation's leading commodities trading firms. 
</P>
<P>
 According to White House officials, Mrs. Clinton had no knowledge of any block 
trade allocations, was not aware at the time she began dealing with Bone that 
he previously had been censured for making improper commodity trades and did 
not authorize him to make trades in her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is there documentary proof that she benefited from block trading or 
allocation. But there is extensive evidence contained in federal court records 
now warehoused in Ft. Worth, which suggest that many of Bone's clients 
benefited at one time or another from the unauthorized allocation of trades. 
The beneficiaries included clients who had "non-discretionary" accounts, which 
require the client's approval of trades. Mrs. Clinton's account was 
non-discretionary. 
</P>
<P>
 James Blair, whom Mrs. Clinton has identified as the mentor who assisted her 
in her commodities trading, acknowledged in court testimony that he was aware 
of these so-called "600 orders" and occasionally had unauthorized trades 
allocated to his own account. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, REFCO brokers and traders who were familiar with practices at the 
Springdale office during the late 1970s said the practice was so widespread 
that it would have been difficult for Mrs. Clinton to have earned $99,000 on an 
initial investment of $1,000, as she did, without benefiting to some extent -- 
wittingly or not -- from Bone's trading practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Commodities analysts have expressed particular puzzlement over how an ordinary 
investor with as little capital as Mrs. Clinton -- and with such modest total 
resources -- could have taken positions large enough to win the profits she 
banked. During the period she was trading commodities, she and her husband 
owned no substantial assets and were living on a combined income of about 
$50,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the White House portrayal of Mrs. Clinton as an exceptionally canny 
and attentive commodities trader contrasts with the Clintons' description of 
their role in the Whitewater real estate development during the same period. In 
Whitewater, the Clintons said that they were passive investors who did not 
follow the project's financial activities closely and left its management 
entirely to their partners, former savings and loan owner James B. McDougal and 
his then-wife, Susan. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater became entangled in a series of complex financial transactions 
involving McDougal and his Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, which ultimately 
went bankrupt at a cost of at least $47 million to U.S. taxpayers. The Clintons 
have said that they were not aware of McDougal's activities, which are now part 
of the wide-ranging investigation by special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 In her commodities trading, Mrs. Clinton turned out to be luckier than many of 
Bone's other clients because she got out of the cattle futures market in July, 
1979, just as many of REFCO's other big Arkansas clients -- including her 
friend Blair -- were starting to lose millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the losers later claimed in civil lawsuits that they were victims of a 
fraudulent scam devised by REFCO President Thomas Dittmer in Chicago. The suits 
were unsuccessful, but they produced extensive testimony by REFCO employees and 
others about how Bone and the Springdale office operated during the period in 
1978 and 1979 when Mrs. Clinton traded there. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1979, according to Elizabeth J. Robbens, a Little Rock lawyer who has 
representedREFCO, Bone and other brokerage officials admitted to the Chicago 
Mercantile Exchange that the office made a practice of trading in block orders 
for numerous customer accounts. They were sanctioned by the exchange for 
violating trading rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbens insisted that, while Bone has acknowledged allocating trades, none of 
his clients ever complained that they were treated unfairly. (The lawsuits 
focused primarily on other aspects of REFCO's activities.) 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, Mrs. Clinton was persuaded to enter the risky world of 
commodities trading by Blair, now the general counsel for Tyson Foods, which is 
headquartered in Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, REFCO was widely regarded as the biggest player in the cattle 
futures pits. Bone, a onetime employee of Tyson, was widely known among the 
Arkansas elite as a broker who had made many investors rich. 
</P>
<P>
 With an initial investment of only $1,000, Mrs. Clinton quickly made $5,300 on 
her first trade and withdrew $5,000 in profit. There is no documentation of the 
exact trade and some experts said that she did not have enough money in her 
account at the time to cover a trade that would produce such a large profit so 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast starts were not unusual for Bone's new clients, however. McIlroy 
testified in court that he did not even have an account at REFCO when he 
received notice that Bone had purchased cattle futures on his behalf. The 
unauthorized investment made money for McIlroy, however, and that success 
persuaded him to keep trading with REFCO. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying blocks of contracts and allocating them to customers after the market 
closed was dismissed as a time-saver by Bone and other REFCO brokers, even 
though they were aware it violated the guidelines of the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange. When former REFCO broker Bill McCurdy explained the system on the 
witness stand, he was asked if the practice was considered proper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that it is," McCurdy said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known what criteria Bone used to allocate the trades. Since Mrs. 
Clinton's trading records were made public last week, some people who were 
frequent traders at that time at the Springdale office have questioned whether 
she received some favoritism, but there is no documentary evidence of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the White House has said that she was unaware of improprieties by REFCO 
at the time she stopped trading, Mrs. Clinton could have learned about them 
later while she served briefly as McIlroy's attorney in a lawsuit against the 
brokerage firm. It was one of dozens of suits filed around the country in the 
early 1980s by traders and brokers -- some of whom lost large sums in 
commodities trading -- who accused REFCO officers of market manipulation and 
other improper activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Elgison of Atlanta, attorney for a REFCO broker who lost large sums in 
trading after July, said that "Mrs. Clinton was fortunate to have gotten out 
when she did. One can speculate it was just luck or it was something more 
sinister." 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, who also had a non-discretionary account, said that Bone sometimes made 
trades on behalf of his clients even if they had not authorized them. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during the summer of 1979 that REFCO's Springdale brokers apparently 
were chastised by their supervisors in Chicago for buying cattle futures 
contracts in blocks and then allocating them to customers who never authorized 
them. McCurdy, in his testimony, described the flurry of activity in the 
Springdale office after he was told in August that the so-called "600 orders" 
had to be covered up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We locked the doors with the people that worked there still left there," 
McCurdy recalled. "I don't believe Red Bone was there at that time. And it was 
approximately 2:30 in the afternoon and he said . . . . 'We've got to go back 
and individually time and date stamp all these 600 orders' that had been 
ordered out of Chicago. And we sat down and changed our clocks back and the 
dates back and took the 600 orders and matched up and stamped enough orders to 
match the 600 that had originally gone in. . . . It was pretty close to dark 
when I left." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton's last transactions with REFCO occurred in July, 1979, just as 
many traders at the Springdale office began suffering large losses. White House 
officials said that she was pregnant at the time and did not think that she 
could devote enough attention to commodities trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final months of 1979, many longtime customers of Bone lost all of the 
money they had amassed with his help. Not only did the market take a sharp 
downturn, but many traders claimed they were double-crossed by REFCO President 
Dittmer, who made a tidy profit in October by taking a position that was 
exactly the opposite of the advice he was giving his customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dittmer denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Blair, who lost several million dollars, later sued REFCO for $15 million and 
settled out of court. McIlroy came out ahead in his account but sued on grounds 
that he was entitled to about $800,000 more than he received.  
</P>
<P>
 REFCO attorney Robbens said that Mrs. Clinton was just one of many smart 
traders who withdrew from the market at the right time. "They all made money 
and none of them ever sued us," she said. "In fact, nobody who made money sued 
us, except Hayden McIlroy."

AMES COULD BE FORERUNNER OF OTHER SPY CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The CIA's Aldrich H. Ames may turn out to be merely the first of a number of 
U.S. government officials who will be accused over the next few years of spying 
for the Soviet Union or its Warsaw Pact allies during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 The collapse of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall have made 
available a wealth of records and data from the Soviet's KGB secret police, 
East Germany's Stasi and other East Bloc intelligence agencies about their 
intelligence-gathering operations in the United States. American 
counterintelligence officials are believed to be using this information to 
investigate U.S. government employees who may have worked for foreign 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of information has been trickling out," said one source familiar with 
U.S. intelligence operations. "Individuals have been coming forward. If people 
come away with the impression that Ames is the end of all this, that's naive 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Ames case involved the CIA, future instances, unrelated to Ames, 
could involve other federal agencies, such as the State or Defense departments 
or the National Security Agency. In this sense, Ames could be merely the first 
big post-Cold War spy story in a series that will unfold over the next four or 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Ames, who was arrested in February on charges of spying for the 
Soviet Union at least since 1985, critics have complained that the CIA did not 
notice or act upon clear signs that one of its employees was spending large 
amounts of money. Ames told colleagues the money had been inherited by his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, who once headed East European counterintelligence for the CIA and had 
access to some of the agency's most sensitive secrets, is believed to have 
accepted $2.5 million from the Soviets and later Russia for his spying.  
</P>
<P>
 "Other cases undoubtedly have the same earmarks as Ames," said another 
knowledgeable U.S. official recently. While more than four years have passed 
since the fall of the Berlin Wall and nearly three since the collapse of the 
Soviet Union, U.S. officials are still piecing together information about East 
Bloc intelligence operations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ames is the only one of its kind prosecuted with the help of the new 
post-Cold War materials, because U.S. officials are moving cautiously. "You do 
not rush to judgment just because you have a name," explained one U.S. 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. government officials are believed to be examining how much classified 
information can be made public and how far they can go in investigating U.S. 
government employees or accusing them of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Any additional prosecutions of U.S. officials will depend on such legal 
questions as the ability of investigators to establish probable cause that a 
crime has been committed and to obtain warrants from the special courts set up 
by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, Congress is considering proposals that would make it easier for 
U.S. counterintelligence officials to examine the financial records of 
government employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. William S. Cohen (R-Me.) and Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman 
Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), each has introduced legislation to this end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are broken at the CIA and need to be fixed," DeConcini said when he 
introduced his bill last month.  
</P>
<P>
 Such records can be obtained now only if the federal employee is notified. CIA 
Director R. James Woolsey said in a speech last month that he supports wider 
access to intelligence officials' financial records. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey said that the federal government should be given "the legal authority, 
which it does not now have, to check the financial situations of some employees 
in sensitive positions at a relatively early stage of a counterintelligence 
investigation, without alerting them to the fact that the investigation is 
taking place." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect that there may be more spying cases could help the CIA and FBI 
fend off efforts in Congress to cut back their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Ames case broke, Woolsey and other top CIA officials have been 
trying to prevent Congress from reducing the intelligence budget or ordering 
other far-reaching changes in the way the CIA conducts its business.

LAPD SLOW TO ENACT MANY CHRISTOPHER PANEL REFORMS; POLICE: MONEY, BUREAUCRATIC 
SNAFUS ARE MAIN BARRIERS. OVERSIGHT COMMISSION SAYS COMMITMENT IS STILL STRONG. 
</P>

<P>
 Dozens of Los Angeles Police Department reforms recommended more than two 
years ago by the Christopher Commission remain stalled by budget shortfalls, 
bureaucratic snafus, stalled labor negotiations and, in some cases, a lack of 
resolve, according to police officials and department documents. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of the city's Police Commission and department insiders say that 
the push for reform has been reinvigorated in recent months, propelled by 
pressure from the commission and by a growing trust between department 
officials and the commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some waffling in the beginning," Police Commission President Gary 
Greenebaum said. "But we've made clear that we will not be sidestepped on these 
issues, and things are starting to pop." 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-plus recommendations of the Christopher Commission -- named for its 
co-chairman, Warren Christopher, who is now secretary of state -- have become 
the guiding document of the city's police reform advocates. They see it as the 
standard for judging the LAPD's willingness to respond to the communities it 
serves. As a result, the halting progress of the reforms has alternately 
encouraged and angered department critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the reform proposals still not in place: 
</P>
<P>
 * A recommendation that the LAPD more carefully track officers' complaint 
histories, which the department proposes to do using a computer system, has 
been stalled by budget hang-ups. Police commissioners say they intend to break 
the impasse by funding the system out of their budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * A proposal to add a civilian member to police disciplinary boards was 
approved by city voters, but it is opposed by many officers. Two years after 
voters backed the idea, it is still in the planning stages. 
</P>
<P>
 * A department order dealing with a controversial practice of forcing suspects 
to lie on the pavement while they are searched still has not been distributed 
to officers, even though the LAPD said in late 1992 that it was forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like myself are very disappointed in the pace of reforms," said Joe R. 
Hicks, executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of 
Greater Los Angeles. "We have a chief who certainly sends a better message from 
the top, but this is a culturally entrenched bureaucracy that moves very 
slowly, that is very resistant to change." 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for delays are varied. In most cases, money is the chief obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent analyses prepared by Police Commission staff also cite confusion 
about some proposals and the need to resolve personnel questions with the 
Police Protective League. In other instances, the holdups are the result of 
bungling: A much-heralded plan to install video cameras in some police cars was 
set back for almost six months even after cameras were donated because the 
Police Department did not have enough tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the tapes were donated, officials could not work out the logistics for 
picking up the tapes and installing the equipment in police cars. The pilot 
project was finally launched about three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took a little while to get it going," Police Chief Willie L. Williams 
conceded recently. "A few of us got gray hairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Although that program is at last under way, other reform recommendations 
remain stalled. That concerns some department critics and some LAPD officials 
as well, and it has raised questions about whether the Police Department is 
prepared to move ahead on the central recommendation of the Christopher 
Commission, retooling the LAPD so that its officers practice a more 
community-oriented style of policing. 
</P>
<P>
 One telling example of the difficulties faced by reformers has been the 
struggle to build a computerized tracking system to monitor complaints against 
police officers. The Police Commission has repeatedly approved creation of the 
system -- the Officer Behavioral Indicator Tracking System, known as OBITS -- 
only to be turned away at City Hall or to encounter resistance from police 
officers who worry that OBITS will unfairly characterize their records. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, money has been at the heart of the debate. According to 
department estimates, the system would cost about $39,000 to get started.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials, who oversee about 30,000 employees and an annual budget of 
nearly $4 billion, pleaded poverty. The LAPD, with 10,000 employees and a 
budget of more than $500 million, also said it was too strapped to pay for it. 
So despite protestations from department outsiders and the Police Commission, 
years went by without any progress toward implementing OBITS. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a gesture of frustration and determination, members of the commission 
-- whose staff of 63 consumes about $3 million a year -- say they are prepared 
to vote today to break the logjam by dipping into their own funds and paying 
for the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "That should send an important signal to this department about how important 
this is," Greenebaum said. "We wanted to make this symbolic act." 
</P>
<P>
 Although OBITS has, for some, become a symbol of the city's unwillingness to 
fully embrace the reform efforts, other proposals have been implemented and 
have substantially changed the way certain aspects of the Police Department 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notable are the procedures for hiring and firing the chief of police. In 
the closing days of Daryl F. Gates' tenure as chief, he and the Police 
Commission engaged in a divisive power struggle over the commission's attempts 
to oust him. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Los Angeles voters approved Charter Amendment F in 1992, they 
overhauled the system for hiring and firing the chief, as well as other basic 
aspects of department management. Unlike his predecessor, Williams was hired to 
serve a five-year term, renewable at the pleasure of the commission. And unlike 
Gates, Williams can be fired by the commission, with the concurrence of the 
mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Other significant changes have occurred as well. Among other things, improved 
cultural awareness training is taught at the Police Academy, new procedures for 
background checks are being employed for LAPD applicants and supervisors are 
held to tough new standards when it comes to the behavior of subordinates. All 
of that has heartened reform proponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the reforms are going as well as can be expected, given that we have 
no money," Commissioner Art Mattox said. "There's a real commitment to make 
these changes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mattox and other police officials acknowledge that much remains to be 
done. And most concede that the pace of reform slackened last year. The 
previous commission -- led by several outspoken reform advocates -- wound down 
its tenure over the summer, and some department officials waited to see in 
which direction the new commission headed. 
</P>
<P>
 That uncertainty was magnified by the mayoral race, as Richard Riordan was 
conspicuously silent on the issue of police reform during the campaign. His 
decision not to reappoint any of the five commissioners and his appointment of 
Police Protective League President William Violante -- a well-known critic of 
Williams -- redoubled the sense that Riordan had little commitment to reforming 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in office, however, Riordan and Violante took pains to emphasize the 
mayor's devotion to the reforms. "The mayor is committed to implementing the 
Christopher Commission report," Violante reiterated last week. "He's absolutely 
committed." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the new police commissioners set out from the start to demonstrate 
their resolve on the issue. Greenebaum was a leader of the Charter Amendment F 
campaign, and the other commissioners quickly joined him in pressing the 
department for evidence of progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially many people in the department did not know where we were coming 
from," Commission Vice President Deirdre Hill said. "Now they understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Lawrence Fetters, whose candor has impressed commission members, 
acknowledged during a recent hearing that some critics blame the LAPD for 
dragging its feet. But he told the commissioners that he does not believe the 
department is resisting the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "One could come away with the impression that the department has stonewalled 
these recommendations," Fetters said. "Quite the contrary, I find that everyone 
is fully supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few months, commission members have received oral and written 
briefings on the progress of the reforms -- a process that is scheduled to 
conclude this month. A review of those meetings and documents reveal that 
although more than one-third of the recommendations are fully implemented, 
dozens more are not in place or only partially implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the area of training officers how and when to use force -- one of the 
central questions surrounding the Rodney G. King incident and the one that has 
underlain three trials growing out of it. Three years after that infamous 
altercation, the LAPD still has not completed a manual to revisit the issues of 
what force police officers may use under what circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 That angers many officers, some of whom express confusion over what kinds of 
force are authorized and what kinds could lead to punishment, even prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not clear-cut guidelines for officers in this area," said Danny L. 
Staggs, president of the protective league and a former training officer. 
"That's created a lot of concern among the rank and file." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a Christopher Commission recommendation that the LAPD review its 
policy on "proning out" suspects -- making them lie on the pavement during 
searches -- was promised in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year later, the order is still 'in the review cycle,' " Police Commission 
staffers concluded. "This is a critical issue, and the order should be 
completed and disseminated immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Although commissioners say the order should be released soon, the delay has 
baffled people inside and outside the department. 
</P>
<P>
 In other areas, the explanations for inaction are all too obvious. Most times, 
it comes down to money. The Christopher Commission recommended pay incentives 
to encourage officers to work patrol; that would cost money, and no such 
bonuses have been offered. The commission recommended that probationary 
officers receive special instruction on verbal skills; the department claims it 
would take 22 sergeants and $2.3 million to fully carry out that 
recommendation, so it has languished. 
</P>
<P>
 Other reforms would cost relatively little, but have met with different kinds 
of resistance. A proposal to put a civilian member on police boards of rights 
-- the department's chief disciplinary bodies -- concerns some police officers 
and remains the subject of negotiations with the police union. 
</P>
<P>
 And a recommendation to make easily understood, multilingual complaint forms 
available throughout the city has been only partially achieved. A recent 
commission audit found that the forms were available at only seven of the 29 
sites and that Korean and Chinese versions were out of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Reform advocates credit the department with some positive steps in the wake of 
the King beating, but they worry about how much remains to be done. Some 
question the LAPD's resolve when it comes to carrying out the remaining tasks. 
And they are particularly concerned about the implementation of community-based 
policing, a law enforcement model that emphasizes crime prevention and 
community relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What community-based policing is about is the cultural transformation of the 
LAPD," said Constance L. Rice, western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal 
Defense and Educational Fund. "That simply has not happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Commission staffers have raised questions on that front as well. In 
their analysis of the LAPD's reforms, commission staffers note: "The 
department's definition of and plan for community-based policing seems vague. A 
clear understanding of what community-based policing is and how it will be 
implemented should be communicated to department members." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Williams distributed a special order that for the first time 
spells out the department's vision of community-based policing. Even that is 
mostly a blueprint and is short on specifics, and commissioners say the idea is 
being taught mostly by the example of a few highly regarded department leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker, the popular commanding officer of South Bureau, has 
aggressively pushed community policing, winning accolades from the 
commissioners. But they concede that more needs to be done to pass the message 
to the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody like Mark Kroeker, it's his nature," Greenebaum said. "He's the 
perfect guy to be doing this. But the ideas have to be written down, 
institutionalized and implemented." 
</P>
<P>
 None of that will come quickly, Greenebaum and others agree. But few now 
question the determination of the Police Commission to lobby for reform, and 
most observers express optimism that in time, the vast majority of the 
Christopher Commission recommendations will be put in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not be deterred," Greenebaum said. "We consider this our primary 
public trust, and we intend to carry it out." Reforming the LAPD 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the 1991 beating of Rodney G. King, the Christopher Commission 
conducted an extensive review of the Los Angeles Police Department, focusing on 
issues that involved the use of force by police officers. The commission 
produced more than 120 recommendations for reform. Here is are some key 
recommendations and their status: 
</P>
<P>
 * Recommendation: The chief of police should serve a five-year term, renewable 
at the discretion of the Police Commission only once. The commission should 
have the authority to fire the chief, with the concurrence of the mayor and 
subject to an override by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 * Status: In place. Voters adopted the recommendations as part of Charter 
Amendment F. Chief Willie L. Williams was hired under those terms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recommendation: The Police Commission staff should include an inspector 
general responsible for overseeing citizen complaints and monitoring internal 
affairs investigations, among other duties. 
</P>
<P>
 * Status: Commissioners have recently begun reviewing proposals for designing 
and filling such a position. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recommendation: The department should try to put video and audio equipment 
in police cars on an experimental basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Status: In place. Last October, DARE America donated 36 video cameras to 
launch a pilot program. But the department at first could not buy enough tapes 
to make the system work, and then it struggled to install the equipment. The 
first ones were put in cars last month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recommendation: The department should address problems created in minority 
communities by the unnecessary use of the "prone out" tactic, in which suspects 
are ordered to lie on the ground while officers search them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Status: Chief Williams says a special order on the tactic has been prepared 
and is being reviewed. In its December, 1992, update on the reforms, the 
department said the same thing, however, and no order has yet been 
disseminated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Recommendation: The LAPD should adopt the community-based policing model and 
implement it, albeit carefully, throughout the department. 
</P>
<P>
 * Status: In progress. Police Commission staff concluded that the LAPD 
"definition of and plan for community-based policing seems vague." 
</P>
<P>
 * Recommendation: Officers should be retested psychologically during their 
careers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Status: Not in place. The department opposes this recommendation. KEEPING 
SCORE 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Commission has monitored reform efforts. In its recent review the 
commission analyzed roughly 90 categories of recommendations -- and found that 
another 30 or so proposals had been carried out. Of the 90: 
</P>
<P>
 * 28 are fully implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 * 38 are partially implemented or are in place and being expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 5 require negotiations with the police union before they can be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 * 19 have not been implemented, some for budget reasons, others because the 
department opposes them, among other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: The above categories do not always reflect the department's official 
view. In some cases, the commission staff and department disagree, and in some 
cases the department calls reforms "in progress" even though little if anything 
has been done to implement them.

<P>
 The young woman's face blushed the color of borscht. 
</P>
<P>
 Her chin disappeared into the high collar of her fur coat as she looked 
furtively around the hospital waiting room making sure no one she knew was 
there. Then she whispered that she had caught "it" from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman could not bring herself to speak the name of her ailment: syphilis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody cares how she got it; it's still considered a disgrace," said Valery 
V. Kuznetsov, chief doctor at the Skin and Venereal Disease Clinic No. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Russia, where a new sexual permissiveness coexists with the old 
Soviet puritanism, venereal disease is still seen as shameful and revolting. 
Above all, patients feel it must be kept secret from a prying and punitive 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Until about a year ago, confidential treatment for venereal disease was 
unknown here -- and most syphilis patients were still being locked up in a 
little-known gulag of high-security hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Russia is facing an epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases -- an 
ominous indicator that a serious AIDS problem could be looming, although so far 
the former Soviet Union has largely been spared that scourge. Syphilis rates 
have shot up eightfold since 1988 and are at twice U.S. levels, according to 
the Russian Ministry of Health. The incidence of gonorrhea is also climbing. 
The rise of these diseases indicates widespread unsafe sexual habits that 
invite HIV transmission, said Mikhail I. Narkyevich, who heads the ministry's 
national AIDS prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no illusions," Narkyevich said. "Syphilis is rising in the young. In 
two years, it will be AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 A delayed sexual revolution is under way in Russia. Political liberalization 
begat an explosion of pornography, prostitution and provocative advertising. 
Authorities complain that the public has interpreted democracy as a license for 
promiscuity. 
</P>
<P>
 But before doctors can heal the sick -- let alone preach prevention -- they 
must undo the legacy of decades of mistrust created by the frightening, 
coercive, punitive Soviet system for treating sexually transmitted disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of Alexander O., who spent two weeks in a Soviet prison hospital 
in 1973. His crime: contracting gonorrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as he realized he was infected, Alexander went to a local VD clinic 
for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected them to help me, but instead the doctor subjected me to a real 
interrogation," Alexander said. "At the end of it, I felt like a criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor opened a dossier on Alexander that included his passport number and 
information about his family and workplace. She demanded that he disclose his 
sexual contacts. When he demurred, not wishing to subject his girlfriend to the 
same treatment, the doctor threatened to lock him up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Alexander was sent to one of the 42 high-security VD hospitals the 
Soviet Union continued to run decades after the discovery of antibiotics that 
could cure most syphilis and gonorrhea cases with a single injection. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment at the hospital where Alexander was sent was not gentle, and the 
place was so filthy he was afraid to eat in the cafeteria for fear of catching 
an even worse malady. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors examined us very seldom and spoke to us like scum and criminals," he 
said. "There were very few nurses. And you really had to chase a nurse around 
the hospital to get the prescribed medicine" -- usually, up to a month of 
injections of weak Soviet penicillin. 
</P>
<P>
 If a patient was docile, his ailment was listed on his papers as eczema or 
another non-contagious skin disease, sparing him further humiliation. If he was 
uncooperative, doctors threatened to prolong his hospital stay, or write his 
true condition on the sick leave form he would have to give his employer to 
explain his absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years after his release from the hospital, Alexander contracted gonorrhea 
again. Determined to stay out of the clutches of the "VD police," he did what 
privileged or well-connected Soviet citizens had done for years. He sneaked off 
for a private consultation with a doctor recommended by a friend and paid a 
steep bribe for a prescription. Alexander was able to buy penicillin. Then he 
bribed a nurse recommended by the doctor to give him injections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been lucky ever since, but if I get sick again, nothing will make me 
get official treatment, even though they claim you can be treated anonymously 
now," he said. "I just don't trust the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Changing that attitude is an urgent priority for the Russian Ministry of 
Health, which is determined to convince citizens that treatment today is 
humane, dignified and confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry is gradually closing the VD hospitals, about half of which have 
already been shut down. And anonymous treatment for sexually transmitted 
diseases, although not for AIDS, has recently become available in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the message is traveling slowly, while the maladies are spreading fast. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate of reported syphilis shot up from 4.4 per 100,000 people in 1988 to 
13.4 in 1992 and 32.3 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, syphilis has spread even faster. In the city of Cheboksary, for 
example, about 350 miles east of Moscow, the syphilis rate has jumped 20-fold 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonorrhea is even more prevalent, with 211.4 cases per 100,000 people. And 
chlamydia, a disease with few symptoms that remains difficult to diagnose 
because most Russian clinics do not have the necessary laboratory equipment, is 
so widespread it has become a leading cause of infertility among Russian women, 
as it is in the West, public health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the surge in sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) may be explained by 
better reporting as public health officials spread the word that patients need 
no longer fear coming forward. Many of the "new" syphilis patients have in fact 
been infected for some time, said Lilia I. Tikhonova, who heads the Health 
Ministry's syphilis prevention program. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, judging by the number of newspaper advertisements hawking confidential 
treatment for STDs and the ease with which antibiotics can be bought without a 
prescription, a private underground treatment network persists. This raises the 
possibility that the disease rate may be higher than official statistics 
indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the old Iron Curtain appears to have spared Russia the ravages that 
HIV infection has wreaked on the West. The first AIDS case was not reported 
here until March, 1987. By then, information about the disease had already 
reached Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, 717 Russian citizens have tested HIV positive, and 83 people have 
died, according to the Health Ministry's Narkyevich. AIDS activists say these 
infection and death statistics are vastly understated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are only the people who have been traced," said Irina Savalyeva of the 
AIDS prevention group AESOP. "There were lots of people who might have been 
(HIV) positive but avoided all testing sites because they were afraid their 
anonymity would not be preserved -- and rightly so." 
</P>
<P>
 Public health officials blame the huge increase in STDs on the lifting of 
restrictions on travel into and out of Russia; on a marked rise in prostitution 
that has been accelerated by skyrocketing unemployment among women, and on 
large migrations of refugees and settlers from the Caucasus, Tajikistan and 
other war-torn areas of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The old political controls were somewhat effective in uncovering and isolating 
VD outbreaks. Patients who had been cured had to report back for blood tests 
each year. Teachers, day care providers and food service workers were routinely 
tested, and all Soviet citizens had to be certified syphilis-free before they 
could travel abroad. In Soviet times, sailors were not allowed to prowl foreign 
ports without a KGB minder in tow, Narkyevich said; today, many Russian sailors 
come home with syphilis, and some later test positive for HIV. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many infected people simply avoided treatment or paid bribes to doctors 
who may not have been trained to treat STDs. Others consulted faith healers or 
bought antibiotics on the black market and tried to treat themselves. Some 
syphilis sufferers managed to mask the symptoms of the disease but not cure it, 
so it progressed in those patients with ghastly consequences such as blindness, 
Tikhonova said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is why we finally decided to change our ways," Tikhonova said. "Now, 
under democracy, people have more freedom, and every citizen has the right to 
keep his private life to himself." 
</P>
<P>
 But sex education lags. Although state and private AIDS prevention programs 
exist, they have not yet penetrated the public consciousness -- let alone begun 
to erode the bias against condoms, even imported ones. That bias is partly left 
over from the Soviet era, when thick, unreliable domestic-made condoms were 
long the object of black humor. 
</P>
<P>
 People who catch STDs continue to be viewed as lepers. 
</P>
<P>
 And AIDS patients are often shunned. Even doctors' attitudes can be slow to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as 1992, about 80% of syphilis patients at Kuznetsov's clinic were 
being hospitalized for 20 to 30 days, the doctor said. Yet a dose of penicillin 
from UNICEF costs about 39 cents. This wildly cost-ineffective system persisted 
partly because the Soviet Union neither manufactured nor imported long-lasting 
antibiotics, and to eradicate syphilis using weaker Soviet antibiotics could 
require injections for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Kuznetsov's clinic is one of only four in Moscow that are allowed to 
offer outpatient treatment with imported antibiotics. The clinic hospitalizes 
only about 10% of patients, mainly those with complications, said the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic also offers anonymous VD and HIV testing. The service is so popular 
that by word of mouth alone, the clinic has overflowed with people from Moscow 
and beyond, Kuznetsov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who test positive must give their names if they wish to receive 
treatment, but now that the process has been decriminalized, most are willing 
to do so, the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We convince people that we are not going to tell anyone, we are not going to 
report them and we are not going to lock them up," Kuznetsov said. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS activists say the process is moving too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's still the Soviet psychology that people should be directed and should 
not be allowed to choose their own lifestyle," Savalyeva said. "I'm not very 
optimistic about government agencies being able to change their lifelong 
attitudes." 
</P>
<P>
 Tikhonova and her colleagues are trying to re-educate medical personnel to 
take a non-judgmental approach to sexually transmitted diseases. Patients are 
told that treatment is voluntary and are encouraged -- not ordered -- to bring 
their sex partners for testing. 
</P>
<P>
 In an even more radical step, 200 anonymous treatment centers have been opened 
across Russia, though none in Moscow. This program is considered experimental, 
and the results will be re-evaluated in two years, Tikhonova said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1971 law that established criminal and civil sanctions on VD patients who 
refused to submit to treatment or reveal their sexual contacts has been 
repealed. Authorities, however, want to retain criminal penalties for anyone 
who knowingly infects an unsuspecting sex partner with syphilis or the HIV 
virus, Tikhonova said. That is in keeping with a trend toward criminalization 
of conscious transmission in some U.S. states and many other countries, 
according to the World Health Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russian officials have concluded that coercion ultimately won't work. "All 
our propaganda used to consist entirely of bans and prohibitions," Kuznetsov 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's impossible to ban sex. So now our task is to educate."

7 ACCUSED OF PLOT TO KILL MEXICAN CANDIDATE COLOSIO; INQUIRY: SPECIAL 
PROSECUTOR IMPLICATES ORGANIZER OF PRESIDENTIAL FRONT-RUNNER'S TIJUANA 
SECURITY. FIVE SUSPECTS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED; TWO OTHERS REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED.

<P>
 At least seven people -- including a former police detective who organized the 
Tijuana security detail -- were involved in a conspiracy to assassinate Luis 
Donaldo Colosio, the slain ruling party presidential candidate, government 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on videotapes, photographs and testimony, the special prosecutor 
assigned to investigate the case has concluded there was "a mutual and prior 
agreement to commit the crime," according to a statement, which did not address 
the question of why Colosio was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of those believed to be involved in the conspiracy have been arrested, 
including four men assigned to the Colosio campaign's local security detail; 
two other suspects remain unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
 As the list of accused conspirators grew Monday, Mexicans became increasingly 
eager to know where the investigation will lead. Suspicions have ranged from 
drug traffickers to groups connected with the guerrillas in southern Mexico to 
Colosio's own party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has 
ruled Mexico for 65 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation must continue," said Jose Luis Perez Canchola, the human 
rights ombudsman in Baja California. "I believe that the action involves more 
than just this group. . . . These are people who take orders." 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Aburto Martinez, who authorities say shot Colosio, was apprehended at 
the scene; Tranquilino Sanchez Venegas, an alleged accomplice and security 
guard, was arrested last week. Officials said three others have been arrested 
in connection with Colosio's murder at a Tijuana campaign rally March 23: 
</P>
<P>
 Rodolfo Rivapalacio, a former member of the state judicial police who headed 
burglary investigations. He was one of several former high-ranking officers 
affiliated with the PRI who organized a 45-member crowd control team. 
</P>
<P>
 The team -- which was separate from Colosio's federal guards, who are the 
Mexican equivalent of the U.S. Secret Service -- was made up of former police 
officers, some with checkered records. Rivapalacio was also a member of the 
state secret police, according to the magazine Proceso, and a former bodyguard 
for Margarita Ortega, who became the first PRI gubernatorial candidate ever 
defeated when she lost to Baja California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicente Mayoral Valenzuela, who is believed to have opened a path through a 
crowd of well-wishers for the gunman to move toward Colosio. Mayoral, 60, is a 
former homicide commander of the state judicial police. Aburto's relatives said 
he recruited the shooting suspect into a shadowy political group that may be 
connected to the assassination. Mayoral had been arrested just after the 
shooting but was then released. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodolfo Mayoral Esquer, 23, Mayoral's son, is accused of pushing and 
disturbing Col. Federico Antonio Reynaldos de Pozo, who was second in charge of 
the federal security forces. That distracted him and diminished the 
effectiveness of security measures moments before the gunman shot Colosio at 
point-blank range. Family members assert that both father and son are innocent. 
"This shows how easy it is to destroy two lives," said the elder Mayoral's 
daughter, Aracely. "They are grabbing people as scapegoats." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez and the younger Mayoral were seen speaking with Aburto throughout the 
rally, according to a statement released by special prosecutor Mario Montes. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other men, whose names were not disclosed, are also alleged conspirators. 
One suspect is said to have moved in front of Colosio and fallen on the ground 
to prevent him from advancing, allowing Aburto to position himself. The second 
suspect, who wore glasses, cleared a path toward the candidate's left, then 
hunched down just before Colosio was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear Monday if the two unidentified suspects included other members 
of the security detail, known as Grupo Tucan, which has come under intense 
scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ruffo noted Monday, some of the Tijuana guards provided by the local PRI 
were dismissed from local law enforcement because of dubious conduct. "There 
are names on the list of people who were fired for misconduct," the governor 
said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing widespread sentiment that the conspirators acted on orders from 
someone more powerful, a Tijuana human rights activist said investigators 
should examine how and why the PRI chose its security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are people who do not have the capacity or the motivation to organize 
such an act," said Victor Clark Alfaro, director of the Binational Center for 
Human Rights. "The leaders of the PRI have to explain why this very 
questionable security group was chosen. The leaders of the PRI have direct 
responsibility because they organized the security." 
</P>
<P>
 The political ties of Rivapalacio and the others intensify suspicions of a 
politically motivated plot within the ruling party, Clark and others assert. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the southern guerrillas -- who call themselves the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army -- have expressed concern that Colosio's death will be 
blamed on them, especially since Aburto reportedly has said he fired on the 
candidate because he was upset about the violence in Chiapas state. The 
Zapatistas have denied responsibility for the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 The rebels have halted consultations on a government peace proposal and 
prepared for an assault as a result of the accusations. In weekend editions of 
Reforma, rebel leaders invited the new PRI candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, to visit 
guerrilla-held territory and talk directly with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zedillo campaign has not responded publicly to the invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Darling reported from Mexico City and Rotella from Tijuana.

S. AFRICA WHITES FEAR POST-VOTE ARMAGEDDON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From morning until night Monday, scores of callers to the popular talk shows 
on AM "Radio 702" were in agreement: Armageddon is coming in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's going to be bombings," warned Penny. "People who are 
stockpiling petrol and food are very wise," opined Phyllis. "I'm getting my 
family out," promised Keith. 
</P>
<P>
 The callers apparently were all white and obviously all afraid of what will 
happen to South Africa after polls open for three days on April 26 and the 
long-oppressed black majority votes for the first time and finally takes 
control of the world's most racially polarized country. 
</P>
<P>
 White fears of a black-led future have long dominated the airwaves here. But 
the talk has turned to frantic action in the week since a Zulu protest march 
erupted in blazing gun battles amid the skyscrapers of downtown Johannesburg, 
leaving 53 people dead in the streets, in a public garden and on the roads and 
trains leading to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one white civilian was killed -- an accountant shot at his desk near an 
exposed window. But the bloody battle seemed a nightmare come true for the 
nervous white minority that has been sheltered from the daily violence and 
death that plague many of this country's black townships. 
</P>
<P>
 Several supermarkets reported panic buying of candles, matches, cooking oil, 
canned food and non-perishable milk. Gasoline stations said drivers filled up 
extra jerrycans to store for emergencies. Homeowners lined up to buy fuel for 
stoves and lamps. Shelves emptied of water purification pills. Gun stores 
reported record sales of weapons and ammunition. Travel agents filled flights 
out of the country, while Western embassies denied published reports that 
fleets of jumbo jets were on call to evacuate their citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to get worse and worse and worse from now on," Gordon Strachan, a 
72-year-old white retiree who carries a pistol, warned at a packed supermarket 
in the city's posh northern suburbs. "I think it's gone out of control 
entirely." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Estelle Gautier, 34, said she plans to leave before the election for 
three months in Europe and hopes to resettle there. She admitted mixed feelings 
about fleeing at such a momentous time in her nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your humanitarian side tells you everything should be OK," she said. "But 
your fear . . . drives you away. Because we know the standard of living of the 
whites will come down. It will just have to. It's the price we pay." 
</P>
<P>
 The white fright was fueled in part by a series of mysterious letters and 
faxes sent to offices and schools warning people to prepare for cuts of water 
and electric power after the elections and to expect riots that would close all 
the shops and markets. The source of the missives was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 As doomsday rumors spread, the government asked the national power utility, 
Eskom, to reassure the public that the national power grid is safe from 
sabotage. "Eskom has adequate measures in place to deal with any eventuality," 
the company said later, including increased security around power stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Africa is not going to war," Pangami Kumalo, an Eskom spokesman, said 
Monday. "South Africa is going to the elections." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the alarm, however, was the declaration of a state of emergency last 
Thursday in Zulu-dominated Natal province and the black homeland of KwaZulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the crackdown was announced, more than 60 people have been killed in 
clashes between followers of Nelson Mandela's African National Congress and 
Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The ANC is expected to win a landslide victory, but Inkatha has announced an 
election boycott and mobilized thousands of zealous Zulu warriors to oppose the 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, Buthelezi, President Frederik W. de Klerk and Zulu King Goodwill 
Zwelithini are scheduled to meet in a four-way summit Friday at an undisclosed 
location in hopes of defusing the crisis and curbing the violence. 
International mediators may also be called in. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, ANC spokesman Carl Niehaus complained about the 
panic buying and wild rumors. "It's a very unfortunate response that is 
entirely unrealistic," he said. "They buy into a fear psychosis that helps fuel 
instability at a very volatile time." 
</P>
<P>
 White fear is nothing new here. Over the decades, whites have repeatedly 
spread terrifying tales of a coming "Kill the Whites Day," supposedly a 
secretly planned apocalypse in which the nation's blacks would rise up to 
slaughter whites. 
</P>
<P>
 It never happened, of course, and the overwhelming majority of victims of the 
raging political violence of the last four years have been black. Violent 
crime, which targets comfortable whites far more than political or racial 
violence, is a more realistic concern. 
</P>
<P>
 So, many whites have already voted with their bankbooks and their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The South African Reserve Bank estimates that nearly $5 billion was sent out 
of the country last year, more than twice the year before and triple the year 
before that. It attributed the record capital outflow to "political 
uncertainty, the ongoing internal unrest, pressure on the rand and the high 
cost of borrowing overseas," as well as a growing number of scams used to evade 
the nation's strict foreign exchange controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Department of Home Affairs reported that more than 8,000 South 
Africans emigrated last year in what local papers dubbed the "chicken run." 
That was almost double the total who left in 1992, although it was lower than 
in some periods of the late 1970s and the 1980s. The most popular destinations 
in 1992 were New Zealand, Australia, Canada, the United States and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 The exodus was small compared with white stampedes from European colonies such 
as Angola or Algeria before independence. One reason is that a majority of 
South Africa's 5 million whites are Afrikaners whose families have deep roots 
here. Few have second passports.  
</P>
<P>
 And the number of people who moved to South Africa in 1992 -- drawn home after 
years of bitter exile during apartheid or simply excited at the chance to 
witness the birth of a new nation -- actually surpassed those who left by about 
1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, white flight -- and brain drain -- continues. About 90 whites attended 
a two-hour "overseas moving seminar," sponsored by an international moving 
company, in a hall outside Pretoria last Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending were Dr. Michael Treisman, 28, and his wife, Charisse, 
27. They sold their suburban Johannesburg home two weeks ago at a loss and are 
moving next month to St. Louis, where five of his medical school classmates 
have already encamped. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why, the internist had a quick reply. "Political uncertainty and 
violence. Worrying about getting shot and killed. Worrying about getting 
hijacked. Worrying about the kids. . . . We finally both woke up one morning 
and said, 'We've had enough.' "

NORTHROP WINS BATTLE TO PURCHASE GRUMMAN; INDUSTRY: L.A.-BASED FIRM OUTBIDS 
MARTIN MARIETTA WITH $2.17-BILLION OFFER. DEAL WILL NOT STEM LOSS OF JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Northrop Corp., finally the winner in one of the takeover contests that are 
remaking the post-Cold War defense industry, said Monday it agreed to buy 
Grumman Corp. of Bethpage, N.Y., for $2.17 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal ended a four-week tussle over Grumman between Los Angeles-based 
Northrop and aerospace giant Martin Marietta Corp. of Bethesda, Md. Many 
industry analysts had said Northrop needed victory to preserve its 
independence; had it failed, other defense firms might have set their sights on 
the company, which builds the B-2 stealth bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop prevailed with a final offer of $62 a share, up $2 from its initial 
bid. Martin Marietta stood pat at its original offer of $55 a share, or $1.93 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition ranks the firm -- which will keep its headquarters in Los 
Angeles and take the name Northrop Grumman Corp. -- among the biggest prime 
contractors in the defense business, analysts say. The new entity will have 
annual sales exceeding $8 billion and -- initially, at least -- more than 
40,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal enables Northrop to "pursue its primary business objective of being a 
key member of the nation's defense industrial team well into the 21st Century," 
Chairman Kent Kresa said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Northrop's victory, which followed several failed attempts by the company 
to acquire a defense firm, will do nothing to stem the elimination of thousands 
of jobs at Northrop and Grumman because of continued defense budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the acquisition to some degree will exacerbate the problem, as 
Northrop seeks to efficiently merge Grumman's operations -- which are primarily 
in New York and Florida -- into its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combined Northrop Grumman is still going to have to get a lot smaller 
than the companies are separately today," said Richard A. Bitzinger, an analyst 
with the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan research firm in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Kresa minimized the likely job losses attributable 
to the acquisition, but noted that significant employment cuts already are 
planned by each company. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Northrop said it will eliminate another 3,000 jobs -- 10% of its 
work force -- this year. And with the acquisition, "there will clearly be some 
areas where we can gain some economies of scale, and there could be some minor 
job losses due to those economies," Kresa said. "But it's small compared to the 
numbers (of layoffs) we're facing due to the realities of our business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also important to realize that we don't see any wholesale movement of 
jobs out of California that would move east" to Grumman sites, Kresa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop builds the B-2 bomber in Palmdale and Pico Rivera, much of the F/A-18 
fighter attack jet in El Segundo, the fuselage for Boeing's 747 passenger jet 
in Hawthorne and missiles and defense electronics at various sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman also makes defense electronics and airborne surveillance systems, and 
it provides upgrades for its famed F-14 fighter bomber -- which is no longer in 
production -- and other aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 One key contract that Grumman brings to Northrop is the joint surveillance and 
target attack radar system, or JSTARS, a system for detecting enemy ground 
forces that was used in the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a good, strong program for several years out," said Thomas 
Canning, aerospace analyst at Standard & Poor's Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop, though strong financially, needed a deal to avoid becoming a 
takeover target itself amid the defense industry's consolidation wave. The 
industry's shrinkage is producing a handful of giant companies with sales of $8 
billion or more a year; analysts said Northrop, with 1993 sales of $5.1 
billion, needed to grow quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure to expand by acquisition was heightened because Northrop's huge 
B-2 program is scheduled to end in 1997-98, when the firm completes the last of 
the 20 B-2s ordered by the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there had been speculation on Wall Street that Northrop, even if it 
succeeded in buying Grumman, would remain vulnerable to a takeover. Kresa 
declined to comment Monday, except to reiterate that the company is not for 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Grumman deal, Northrop is poised to be the defense-aircraft 
equivalent of the auto industry's Chrysler Corp., Bitzinger said: a distant 
third-ranked player, but still thriving. In Northrop's case, its two bigger 
rivals are Calabasas-based Lockheed Corp. and St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is the deal likely to be Northrop's last. 
</P>
<P>
 It is widely expected that Northrop will exercise its option to buy the 51% of 
Vought Aircraft Co. that it does not already own. Vought, based in Dallas, 
makes subsections for a variety of commercial and military planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresa strongly hinted that Northrop will take that step, though it has three 
years beginning in 1995 to exercise the option. "Right now I see it fitting," 
he said of acquiring Vought, "but we have some time to sort that out." 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman originally agreed March 7 to merge with Martin Marietta for $55 a 
share, after Grumman had spent the past year quietly talking merger with 
Northrop. Three days later, Northrop launched its competing bid of $60 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Grumman asked for one last round of sealed bids, due last Thursday, 
Martin Marietta decided "it would not be in the best interests" of its 
stockholders to go higher, Chairman Norman R. Augustine said in a letter to 
Grumman's directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, because Grumman had first agreed to merge with Martin Marietta, 
Northrop and Grumman will have to pay Martin Marietta a $50-million "breakup 
fee." Martin Marietta said it is also entitled to up to $8.8 million to cover 
its fees and expenses related to the merger effort. 
</P>
<P>
 In choosing Northrop's final bid, Grumman Chairman Renso L. Caporali said 
Northrop's $7-a-share premium over Martin Marietta's offer "is an excellent 
deal for our shareholders." But not all of Grumman's shareholders prospered. 
Some Wall Street arbitragers, or takeover speculators, and other investors had 
bet that the bidding would go higher, trading Grumman's stock up to nearly $65 
a share late last week. 
</P>
<P>
 After Northrop and Grumman announced their deal, Grumman stock, predictably, 
tumbled $2.94 a share, to close at $61.69, in New York Stock Exchange composite 
trading. Northrop closed at $37.625, down $2.25, while Martin Marietta lost 
$1.375 to end the day at $42.625 a share.

STRAWBERRY TO UNDERGO DRUG, ALCOHOL TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry, on the verge of being released after failing to show up for 
Sunday's game, told Dodger officials Monday that he has a drug and alcohol 
problem and will enter a substance abuse treatment center today. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional meeting in Los Angeles, Strawberry asked the Dodgers for help 
in seeking treatment, and the Dodgers responded positively, said Bob Shapiro, 
Strawberry's attorney. Strawberry was placed on the disabled list on the eve of 
the 1994 season opener today at Dodger Stadium. His future with the team 
remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl will not be playing opening day, he will be in a drug treatment 
center," Shapiro said. "He is taking this as seriously as anyone I have ever 
had. He has apologized to (Dodger executive vice president) Fred Claire and 
asked Fred to apologize to (Manager) Tommy Lasorda for disappointing the team, 
but he knows deep in his heart the stress was too much. He has not had the 
proper outlet for release and has relied on alcohol and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's disclosure came as he was about to be released. The Dodgers have 
tired of his controversial distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest incident came Sunday when Strawberry was missing for nearly 24 
hours, skipping the team's afternoon game against the Angels at Anaheim Stadium 
that ended the exhibition season. Claire and some of Strawberry's teammates 
spent much of the day trying to find him. But when Claire located Strawberry 
about 8 p.m. Sunday night, he said Strawberry's excuse for his absence was 
unacceptable. What Strawberry told Claire is not known. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say we were close to (releasing him)," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that even with Strawberry's disclosure, the club could have released 
him. But after meeting with Shapiro, Strawberry and his wife, Charisse, Claire 
changed course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the reaction was sadness and surprise," Claire said. "Darryl was very 
downcast. I mean, this wasn't an easy thing for him to acknowledge and say but 
frankly I was glad that he did. If that is the issue, then it has to be faced. 
I was glad that he stepped forward." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time in Strawberry's 11-year career that he has entered a 
treatment center, but Claire said he believes this is the first time for drug 
abuse. In February of 1990, as a member of the New York Mets, Strawberry was 
treated at the Smithers Center for alcohol abuse.  
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said Strawberry was unavailable for comment because he was en route to 
an undisclosed treatment center. The specific nature of the problem also was 
not discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire said Strawberry, 32, would continue to be paid barring "anything 
unforeseen." Strawberry signed a five-year, $20.3-million contract with the 
team before the 1991 season. The Dodgers owe him $8 million for the final two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire also said he would not speculate on whether Strawberry would play for 
the Dodgers again, saying only that he and team owner Peter O'Malley want to 
support the Dodger slugger.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to prejudge all that," Claire said. "The future is uncertain, 
but as in the case with Steve Howe, we did give our support and we will be 
consistent in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Howe, a former Dodger left-handed relief pitcher, was suspended for substance 
abuse three times in his five seasons with the team before he was released in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 For Strawberry, who spent most of the last two seasons sidelined with a back 
injury, it was a sudden end to what had appeared to be a promising season. His 
only productive season with the Dodgers was his first -- 1991 -- when he hit 28 
home runs and had 99 runs batted in. Since then, he has played in only 75 games 
and hit a total of 10 home runs.  
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's lower back started bothering him during the 1992 season, and in 
September, he had surgery for a herniated disk. He tried unsuccessfully to come 
back last season. By June, he was out for the season.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Strawberry continued to have troubles off the field. Last 
September, he was arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend, whom he has 
since married. The charge was later dropped.  
</P>
<P>
 After a season in which Strawberry was criticized for disregarding rules 
concerning his physical rehabilitation, Claire had enough, and started offering 
to trade his former superstar to other teams. At one point Claire put him on 
the waiver wire, making him available to any team for $20,000, plus his 
remaining contract. No team responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, Strawberry has been the target of an Internal Revenue Service 
probe of several baseball players for allegedly failing to report income tax 
from baseball card shows. Marty Gelfand, a Strawberry attorney, said the IRS 
has not taken any action. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, Strawberry appeared to be strong both emotionally and physically. 
He was often the first one in the clubhouse in the morning and one of the last 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry was switched from right field to left to ease the stress on his 
back, and at the plate he began to show signs of renewed power. Lasorda put him 
back in the cleanup spot, batting behind Mike Piazza and ahead of Eric Karros, 
an imposing combination for pitchers. But Shapiro said the stress of trying to 
come back was too much for Strawberry. During Friday night's game against the 
Angels at Dodger Stadium, Strawberry was booed by the fans after he misplayed a 
ball in the field, allowing a run to score. He also was hitless in four at 
bats. It was his first game at Dodger Stadium since early June of 1993, and, 
though Strawberry said he was not bothered by the boos, some felt otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met with Darryl and his wife privately . . . before we met with the 
Dodgers," Shapiro said. "And after we talked, he stood up and said to his 
family, 'I'm tired of hiding and I have to admit to what is going on in my 
life.' It was a very emotional time." 
</P>
<P>
 KABC-TV reported that several people said Strawberry was at an Anaheim 
nightclub from about 10:30 p.m. Saturday until closing time at 2 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is about a mile from Anaheim Stadium, where Strawberry had played in 
the Dodgers' 5-2 loss to the Angels on Saturday night. He homered in his final 
at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Hong, who owns the nightclub, confirmed to the Associated Press the 
television station's report that Strawberry was drinking alcohol, but said 
Strawberry did not cause a disturbance and was signing autographs and 
socializing with other patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "He only had a couple drinks and was very well-behaved," Hong said. "He was a 
very friendly man."

DOW DROPS 42, BUT THERE'S NO PANIC SELLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the perverse logic of Wall Street, where good news for the economy 
is often bad news for the market, stock and bond prices continued to tumble 
Monday, with the bellwether Dow Jones industrial average falling 42 points to 
its lowest close since last November. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panic selling some observers -- including top White House officials -- 
had feared would follow the long holiday weekend did not materialize. The Dow 
industrials plunged more than 80 points in early trading Monday, but prices 
recovered as some investors saw buying opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks have been falling for several weeks on concerns that strong economic 
growth will rekindle inflation, and a glowing employment report on Friday, when 
the stock market was closed, sent shivers down the spines of many on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation is the bugaboo of Federal Reserve policy-makers, who want to extend 
the recovery by keeping wages and prices under tight control. Indeed, the Fed 
is widely expected to raise interest rates further to head off inflation. At 
the same time, high interest rates are traditionally the enemy of the stock 
market, which competes with interest-bearing instruments for investors' 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials, led by National Economic Council Chairman 
Robert E. Rubin, spent the weekend trying to calm investors. That may have 
helped temper the decline in the stock market, which analysts said held up well 
under the circumstances, although declining issues beat out advances 2,108 to 
371. The Dow closed at 3,593.35 amid heavy trading of 342 million shares on the 
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The same could not be said for the bond market, however. Prices for 30-year 
U.S. Treasury bonds plummeted $18.13 per $1,000, sending the yield, or 
effective interest rate, up to 7.40% from 7.25% -- the highest rate since 
January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton on Monday said interest rates -- nudged up twice by the Fed 
in the last two months, in part with the intention of bursting the stock 
market's bubble -- already were too high and had provoked an "overreaction" in 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton has no direct control over the independent governors of the 
Federal Reserve Board, let alone investors, and many market watchers expect 
continued declines in both stocks and bonds, albeit nothing as drastic as the 
October, 1987, market crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been such a severe three-day decline that we'll probably get a rally 
sometime this week," said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, 
Lufkin & Jenrette, a New York brokerage. "But it's not at all assured that this 
is the low." 
</P>
<P>
 In many respects, the recent market declines are a logical reaction to a long 
run-up in share prices -- a "correction" in the parlance of Wall Street. Over 
the last several years, investors large and small have poured into the stock 
and bond markets, searching for higher returns at a time of low interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, many of those investors have found themselves overextended just 
when interest rates are going up. 
</P>
<P>
 The current market troubles began in February when the Federal Reserve nudged 
interest rates up slightly -- a move that now appears mainly to have produced 
expectations of a further hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Large investment funds for wealthy investors, known as hedge funds, in many 
cases sustained big losses by betting against rising rates -- bets largely 
placed with borrowed funds -- and they're now being forced to sell, driving 
prices down further. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many other investors -- including small investors in mutual funds 
and individual stocks and bonds -- are sitting tight; they are not necessarily 
getting out of stocks and bonds, but they are not getting in any deeper. Thus 
there are few buyers of any description, a situation traders referred to as a 
lack of "liquidity" in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the small guys to the big guys, the investment community has too much 
exposure to risk," said Kevin Logan, chief U.S. economist for Swiss Bank Corp. 
"Everyone looks at the situation and says, 'I shouldn't buy any more at this 
level; I don't know how high the Fed is going to lift rates.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the same, recent innovations in financial services -- notably the emergence 
of financial instruments known as derivatives, which allow professionals to 
pursue complex, computer-aided trading strategies across many markets at once 
-- have rendered markets far more volatile. Price changes that might once have 
taken weeks to happen now occur in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with these uncertainties, there is little evidence that mutual fund 
investors, many of whom have grown accustomed to fat returns, are abandoning 
the market. Wall Street is hoping that remains the case, because wholesale 
redemptions of mutual fund assets could drive the market much lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But uncertainty and volatility are likely to reign for some time, and analysts 
will have to struggle to explain seemingly dramatic market activity. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, for example, many market participants were shocked by the steep 
decline in bonds, which were traded on Friday and had already fallen 
dramatically in response to the strong employment data. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attributed the fall-off to comments from the widely followed economist 
Henry Kaufman, who predicted that long-term bond yields could hit 9% to 10% 
before reaching the peak of the current cycle, though he said he expects a 
rally in bond prices in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman also said stock prices should not fall far in the near term because of 
strong underlying fundamentals, but that stocks remain vulnerable in the long 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "It is highly unlikely that the setback in stock and bond prices in the 
United States will truncate the current economic expansion," Kaufman said. 
"This is because financial rehabilitation has gone a long way in improving the 
financial health of all key sectors of the U.S. economy."

HEAD OF NUCLEAR RESEARCH LAB RESIGNS UNDER FIRE; SCIENCE: JOHN H. NUCKOLLS WAS 
UNDER INCREASING PRESSURE TO LEAVE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE BECAUSE OF ALLEGED 
MISMANAGEMENT. THE ACTION COMES AT A TIME OF MAJOR RESTRUCTURING AT THE 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, one of the 
government's premier nuclear weapons research centers, resigned Monday -- just 
days before University of California President Jack W. Peltason was prepared to 
call for his termination because of mismanagement at the billion-dollar lab. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Nuckolls, 63, has come under increasing pressure from Peltason to step 
down from the $195,500-a-year post since February, when an internal review 
panel found "serious management shortcomings" during Nuckolls' tenure over the 
last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuckolls was supported by prominent physicist Edward Teller, the father of the 
hydrogen bomb, and appeared to be rallying some support among UC regents, who 
are responsible for overseeing Lawrence Livermore and two other university 
labs, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a March 30 letter to Nuckolls labeled "personal and in strict 
confidence," Peltason cited Nuckoll's "failure to accept my repeated requests 
that you resign" and served notice that he would ask the regents Wednesday to 
fire him for "significant deficiencies in your management abilities." Neither 
Nuckolls nor Peltason could be reached for comment late Monday but both men 
released statements announcing the resignation. Peltason said he will recommend 
a temporary replacement Wednesday for Nuckolls, who is stepping down May 1 "for 
personal reasons" but will continue as an associate director at large. 
</P>
<P>
 In a post-Cold War era of "revolutionary change, I believe the laboratory will 
benefit greatly by the new thinking and new vitality provided by a new 
director," Nuckolls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuckolls' resignation comes at a key time for the lab, which has a budget of 
slightly more than $1 billion. With the ending of the Cold War, the federal 
government has dramatically scaled down funding for nuclear weapons research 
and the university has been scrambling to redirect its scientists into joint 
ventures with private companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Nuckolls took over the lab in 1988, the number of joint ventures with 
companies ranging from IBM and General Motors to start-up biotech firms has 
grown from none to more than 100, said lab spokesman Jeff Garberson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nuckolls has been criticized by some for being too much of a cold warrior. 
Last month, the lab director appeared before a panel of the House Armed 
Services Committee in Washington to warn about the dangers of nuclear 
proliferation and the need to keep nuclear defense skills high, and to argue 
that the withdrawal of government funding for weapons research be reversed, 
Garberson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also fought against a proposal in Congress to consolidate nuclear 
weapons research, a move that would shift those functions from Livermore to 
UC's lab at Los Alamos, N.M., where the atom bomb was developed, said Hugh 
DeWitt, a staff physicist at Livermore for 37 years and a critic of Nuckolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It marks him as a director from the Cold War era," DeWitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nuckolls took over the Bay Area laboratory five years ago, about $315 
million of the annual $896 million in federal funding was spent on weapons 
research. Today, that amount has dwindled to $198 million out of $705 million. 
The lab has 7,400 full-time positions for scientific research, including the 
civilian fields of biotechnology, energy science and laser use. 
</P>
<P>
 Nuckolls joined Livermore in 1955, three years after the lab was founded, and 
worked in the lab's A Division, which designs thermonuclear bombs. He led 
research into "Star Wars" concepts, such as missile-destroying lasers, and 
worked on "inertial confinement fusion," which attempts to create a miniature 
type of hydrogen bomb by using lasers to explode pellets of hydrogen isotopes. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was his management skills that brought about the confrontation with 
Peltason. Even by scientists who support his views on nuclear weapons and 
proliferation, Nuckolls was seen as an "indecisive manager" who "lets things 
slide," DeWitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, DeWitt said Nuckolls left a key position in the physics 
department unfilled for five months, prompting the department to begin 
"drifting" and causing a drop-off in fundamental research. 
</P>
<P>
 His management became the issue after a seven-member panel appointed by 
Peltason last fall conducted a review of how Nuckolls was running the lab. A UC 
spokesman said the panel interviewed more than 70 people -- 34 lab employees 
who submitted written statements and the rest high-level U.S. Department of 
Energy or Pentagon officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although universally known to have been negative, the review's specific 
findings have not been released. But in a letter to Peltason dated March 28, 
Nuckolls said the panel spent only two days at the lab and based its 
conclusions on "erroneous information." 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote that officials from the lab's principal "customers" -- the Pentagon 
and Department of Energy's defense programs -- wanted him to continue for 
national security reasons. He also raised the question of political retribution 
because the review panel was chaired by Richard Truly, a former National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration administrator who was dismissed after 
reportedly being criticized by Teller and others. 
</P>
<P>
 University sources said Teller was involved in lobbying regents in Nuckolls' 
behalf this week but that the showdown was averted by the director's 
resignation.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; GOP CHALLENGER UNZ PLANS MEDIA BLITZ THIS WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capping a months-long "stealth campaign" intended to take Gov. Pete Wilson by 
surprise, a 32-year-old Silicon Valley entrepreneur plans this week to launch a 
$1-million, statewide media blitz to introduce California voters to what his 
literature calls "the Republican candidate for governor." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron K. Unz, a Harvard-trained physicist who owns a financial software company 
in Palo Alto, said Monday that he is spending his own money to "jump-start" his 
campaign to wrest the Republican gubernatorial nomination from the governor. 
And the first-time candidate said he is prepared to spend a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a good deal more than $1 million and less than $35 
million," said Unz (rhymes with nuns ), who said his first paid advertisements 
will begin appearing in newspapers and on radio later this week, with 
television spots beginning next week. "I feel very strongly that Pete Wilson is 
bad for California. . . . In many ways, he's much more of a Democrat than a 
Republican." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign spokesman, said that the governor is unworried 
by Unz's candidacy and that there are no plans to alter Wilson's pre-primary 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In each of our past elections we've run ads in the primary and in all 
likelihood we'll do it again this time. This isn't going to affect either how 
much or what kind of advertising we do," Schnur said, noting that Wilson easily 
defeated his primary opposition in the 1990 race. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling candidate, who has been whispered about in Republican circles 
for weeks, already is appealing to some conservatives. Insiders say he has a 
good chance of being endorsed by the California Republican Assembly, the 
state's largest conservative grass-roots organization, which meets this weekend 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think the CRA would look very favorably on Mr. Unz," said Stephen R. 
Frank, a former CRA president who now chairs the  
</P>
<P>
 CRA fact-finding committee that recommends candidates for endorsement. Frank 
called Unz's effort the "Unzeat Pete Campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 "He understands you can't tax your way into prosperity and that government, 
like business, needs to keep a tight budget. He's an economic conservative," 
Frank said. ". . . We cannot afford to have somebody other than that as 
governor." 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA has long been at odds with Wilson -- at one CRA meeting, for example, 
the governor was burned in effigy. Some Republican observers said they suspect 
that Unz's candidacy, instead of being home-grown, was in fact masterminded by 
former Republican Party officials with a grudge against the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorelei Kinder, Unz's campaign director, confirmed Monday that she was once 
the executive director of the state Republican Party and that John Kurzweil, 
Unz's press secretary, was the party's communications director from mid-1988 to 
mid-1990. She also confirmed that she is at odds with many of the governor's 
policies. But she denied that her work for Unz is motivated by revenge and 
seconded Unz's claim that running for governor was his own idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never waged vendettas, and I never will," she said, adding that she 
believes Unz is a strong candidate. "We'll jump-start (this campaign) and the 
motor will keep running. I don't think that . . . any of our team would be 
involved unless we felt there was an opportunity to go all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur discounted the importance of the CRA endorsement. "The most important 
thing is that the party comes together behind the eventual nominee." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times poll conducted last month found that Wilson has a 57% 
positive job rating among registered Republicans statewide, while 34% 
disapproved of him. When paired against either of the leading Democratic 
candidates, Kathleen Brown or John Garamendi, Wilson retained 72% of the 
Republican vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz, who achieved minor celebrity as a San Fernando Valley teen-ager when he 
was named one of the 100 top math students in the nation, said he decided to 
run for governor because he feels Wilson has abandoned the founding principles 
of the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described Ronald Reagan Republican, Unz said his platform boils down to 
five basic points: smaller government, lower taxes, fewer regulations, quality 
education and traditional moral values. He opposes state funding for abortion, 
he supports the death penalty and he promises that, if elected, he will draw a 
salary of just one dollar a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz's dissatisfaction with Wilson is largely economic, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing he did in coming to office was to push through the largest 
state tax increase in American history," said the soft-spoken candidate, who 
said his experience running a high-technology company prepared him well for 
tackling the state's budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One way he proposes to do that is described in a brochure that his campaign is 
printing this week. In it, Unz laments that state government "has ignored the 
computer revolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Promising several "massive" cuts in government, Unz said he will replace 
bureaucrats with computers ("one cheap computer can do the work of 10 
paper-shuffling bureaucrats"). He also wants to bring the same technology to 
California's public schools, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To learn the basic technologies necessary for their future jobs, our children 
need computers, not condoms," Unz's brochure says. Profile: Ron K. Unz

BIOSPHERE PROJECT AIR SEALS BROKEN; ENVIRONMENT: TWO FORMER INHABITANTS ARE 
SUSPECTED OF OPENING DOORS TO CONTAMINATE THE ECOLOGY EXPERIMENT. ONE SAYS SHE 
ACTED FOR SAFETY REASONS, NOT SABOTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The air locks of Biosphere 2, a controversial ecology experiment 35 miles 
outside Tucson, were thrown open Monday in what a spokesman called an attempt 
to sabotage the $150-million project by contaminating it with fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinal County sheriff's officials said Monday they were looking for two members 
of the previous crew who spent two years inside Biosphere 2. They are suspected 
of opening the doors, breaking the seals and smashing half a dozen oxygen 
valves before dawn Monday. This emptied the mammoth artificial lungs that 
equalize air pressure within the 3.15-acre enclosed complex. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those two, marine biologist Abigail Alling, said in an interview Monday 
that she "flushed" the Biosphere air for safety purposes, but added, "I did not 
sabotage the experiment." Alling spoke by phone from an undisclosed location in 
Arizona. Though Alling claimed that the project was "terminated," other 
officials said it is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven researchers from five countries are still living inside the Biosphere, 
normally sealed from the outside world, in an attempt to operate a 
self-sustaining environment as a possible prototype for space colonization. 
Air, water and waste are recycled. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Helms, a project spokesman, denied that the experiment was over, and 
John B. Corliss, the project's science director, said the incident would have 
little impact on the research under way when the dome was breached. About 20 
outside scientists are involved in various aspects of the project, from rain 
forest ecology to coral reef studies.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Biospherians were enthusiastic about continuing," Corliss said. "That's 
the present plan." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how much air was exchanged, but it is a significant exchange," 
Corliss said. But he added, "From my point of view, the effect on the ongoing 
research was minimal, since it can be measured." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident came just three days after Texas billionaire Edward P. Bass, the 
financier behind the project, took court action to oust the management team 
that conceived and built the sprawling, high-tech greenhouse as a microcosm of 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Alling, who spent two years as a crew member inside the dome, tending its tiny 
self-contained ocean, said after the attack Monday, "The Biosphere experiment 
was terminated this morning out of concern for the safety of the Biospherians 
and the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is categorically not sabotage," she said. "I flushed the Biosphere air to 
be sure that the safety of Biospherians and the system would not be in jeopardy 
during this trial period."

 Alling and Mark Van Thillo, who ran most of the life-support equipment, were 
wanted by local police for questioning in connection with the early morning 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Belia Fessenden, a spokeswoman for the Pinal County sheriff's office, said 
that someone who identified herself as Alling called the Biosphere around 4 
a.m. and claimed responsibility for damaging the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If in fact these people did commit trespass and criminal damage, they will 
face charges of violating a federal court order that was issued late last 
week," Fessenden said. "They'll be turned over to the U.S. marshal's office for 
violating a federal court order. And we will charge them ourselves with 
trespass and criminal damages."

WAVE OF HELP; SURFERS COALITION SEEKS TO TURN TIDE AGAINST POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 It was a historic meeting. Amid plates of tacos, enchiladas and rounds of 
Mexican beer, the roll was called. Among the assembled: a United Parcel Service 
truck driver who can hang 10, a T-shirt designer from Malibu who is great with 
"smackin' the wave lips," and Hawk, a self-described troublemaker from Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly your run-of-the-mill environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 But between forkfuls of frijoles, 35 men and women who came here a year ago 
formed California's first Coalition of Surfing -- an umbrella for 17 surf clubs 
more intent on fighting for environmental causes than scouting the next party. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the proceedings was a smiling Jake Grubb. As executive director of 
Surfrider Foundation, a San Clemente-based beach conservation group, Grubb 
played a key role in shaping the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the foundation prepares to celebrate its 10th anniversary in August, 
the coalition has become the foundation's chief ally in exercising a unique and 
powerful brand of environmental activism that includes beach conservation, 
lobbying on coastal issues and waging environmental legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have six people in an office in San Clemente dictating what's going 
to be done in California and the nation," Grubb said. "Our future calls for us 
getting a network of environmental watchdogs. And the only way we can do that 
is by building coalitions." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing the new coalition wave is Eugene Eudaly, 47, a Laguna Beach 
cabinetmaker and Surfrider Foundation member, who was selected to head the 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can now have our own lobby group. We think it could become a blueprint for 
beach activism that can take the Surfrider Foundation into the 21st Century," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing representatives from Oceanside to as far north as Pacifica, Surfrider 
emerged 10 years ago to oppose plans to drain a nearby creek that would have 
ruined the famed Malibu surfing beach that shares its name with the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 It began, said founder Glenn Hening, 43, to help improve what was then 
surfing's outlaw image, which placed surfers "one step above bikers." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that struck me back then," Hening said in a recent 
interview from his Oxnard home, "was that some biker organizations were doing 
Toys for Tots projects; something good for the community. And I told myself 
surfers never do anything like that. But we should." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Surfrider has 27,000 members in 21 chapters in seven coastal states 
including Hawaii, Grubb said. It has affiliates in Australia, Japan, France, 
England and Canada. It has an environmental issues team that sends experts on 
conservation, coastal law and biology to testify before Congress. It has waged 
successful court battles against major polluters. And it has begun Respect the 
Beach, a touted program that has recruited hundreds of high school students to 
test ocean waters for fecal bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfers are so blessed because of what they've been able to enjoy in the 
ocean," Hening said. "If they don't do something to maintain the ocean for 
future generations, they won't get through St. Peter's gate because Peter will 
be saying, 'You can't come in because you didn't leave anything for future 
generations.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This call to conscience has been heeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Eudaly, who is also president of the 200-member Doheny Longboard Assn., said 
Doheny surfers donated $2,500 from their dues to Surfrider. "We all share that 
sense of responsibility," he said, "that if we don't give something back, then 
who will?" 
</P>
<P>
 Can it be that a maturing process has mellowed these once, hellbent 
Californians whose main mission in life was to ride primo waves? What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "We got old," said Pierce Flynn, Surfrider's 40-year-old communications 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, 37% of the members are in their 30s and 40s. The membership supports 
about 75% of Surfrider's annual $500,000 budget; private grants and individual 
donors contribute the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of its members were weaned on surfing during the Sixties, a time of 
rollicking good fun, long boards and Dick Dale music. The old VW vans with 
psychedelic paint jobs are long gone, replaced by mini-vans with cruise 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn describes the older, mature aficionados as a new vanguard of 
eco-surfers. A look at Surfrider's membership finds many teachers, chemists, 
biologists, and lawyers -- people with families and the economic means to make 
a change. That is not all that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, many surfers would drive to the ocean and park their cars. If 
they saw an oil sheen or untreated sewage, they would surf nonetheless. 
Irritated skin and hacking coughs came with the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they are more likely to report the pollution. Not only has this approach 
been encouraged by many beach conservation groups, Surfrider has added 
environmental militancy to the mix. If polluters refuse to shape up, it could 
mean a legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am quite aware of the group," said Port Hueneme City Council member Dorill 
B. Wright, a longtime member of the California Coastal Commission. "They have 
appeared before us on many occasions, generally with helpful and constructive 
things to consider." 
</P>
<P>
 When Surfrider joined with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and won a 
major court battle two years ago, Flynn said, it prompted then-EPA 
Administrator William K. Reilly to remark: "The EPA likes surfers. We consider 
them the new indicator species." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did say that. That's true," a laughing Reilly, now a fellow at Stanford 
University, said last week. "Surfers are in the elements every day. No one is 
as intensively exposed to the elements as surfers -- air, water, pollutants and 
all the rest. They often tell us about pollution and things we don't know 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in amassing an impressive list of successes in its first 10 years, the 
foundation: 
</P>
<P>
 * Joined with the EPA in 1991 and won a $5.8-million settlement in fines -- 
the second-largest settlement under the Clean Water Act in U.S. history -- 
against two pulp mills in Humboldt County. The mills also were required to 
spend $50 million to reduce toxic discharges from their oceanfront pulp mills 
near Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 * Helped block a proposed marina that the foundation believed would have 
destroyed historic natural wetlands as well as miles of sandy coast at Bolsa 
Chica State Beach in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Campaigned to divert a major Los Angeles storm drain, which had been 
polluting beaches and forcing their closure for years, into a sewer system for 
proper treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Created a Blue Water Task Force program that includes Adopt-a-Beach, a storm 
drain stenciling program that warns the public against dumping toxics that 
spill to the ocean and recruiting students to test ocean water for pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is developing a restoration proposal for San Juan Creek in Dana Point to 
prevent continued beach closures from sewage spills during heavy rains. The 
project could become a blueprint for restoring wetlands nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brought a complaint before a state regional water quality control board 
alleging that the city of San Diego underreported a massive pipeline leak that 
spilled untreated sewage between December, 1992, and June, 1993. The city was 
fined $830,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Lacter, a spokesman for Portland-based, Louisiana-Pacific Corp. -- one 
of the companies subject to the $5.8-million settlement in Humboldt County -- 
said the corporation acquired a healthy respect for Surfrider. 
Louisiana-Pacific has stopped bleaching its pulp with chemicals laced with 
dioxins and has eliminated using any toxic chlorine, becoming the first pulp 
mill in North America to do so. The second mill involved, Simpson Paper, has 
since shut its plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were once an adversary," Lacter said. "I hope not anymore."

BREAST IMPLANT SETTLEMENT WINS PRELIMINARY OK; COURTS: JUDGE SETS DEADLINES FOR 
FILING CLAIMS. HE ALSO MANDATES THAT 75% OF THE $3.75 BILLION FUND BE SPENT ON 
WOMEN WHO WERE INJURED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A record-breaking $3.75-billion class-action breast implant settlement that 
could provide compensation to thousands of women nationwide, including many in 
California, cleared its first major hurdle Monday as a federal judge 
tentatively approved the deal and set deadlines for filing claims. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. of Birmingham, Ala., also announced 
that he was taking two steps that should make the settlement more appealing to 
women who allege that they were injured by the implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointer appointed Ann T. Cochran of Houston, a state court judge, to serve as 
the claims administrator for the settlement fund. Cochran has been the 
coordinating judge for hundreds of breast implant cases pending in Texas. She 
was praised as someone "who understands the real issues the women have to deal 
with" by Sybil N. Goldrich of Beverly Hills, co-founder of the Command Trust 
Network, a nationwide information clearinghouse for breast implant recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a strong effort to persuade women that the settlement fund will not be 
drained by excessive legal fees and other costs, Pointer decreed that at least 
75% of the money will go to women with implants. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's order on money issues puts teeth into sentiments he expressed at a 
March 11 hearing, when he said it was his goal to ensure that no more than 25% 
of the settlement pot goes for legal fees and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of several implant support groups, including some that have 
been critical of the settlement, praised Pointer's action.  
</P>
<P>
 Ralph I. Knowles Jr., an Atlanta attorney who was co-chairman of the National 
Breast Implant Plaintiffs' Coalition, called the judge's action unusual but 
wise because in cases like this there frequently is speculation that lawyers 
will be paid excessively. 
</P>
<P>
 A 75% share "is a good return if you look comparatively" at what happened in 
other mass tort cases, Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 million women received silicone gel breast implants in this country 
between 1962 and 1992, when the federal Food and Drug Administration restricted 
their use. Many of the thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide maintain that 
silicone leaked out of the implant pouch and migrated throughout women's 
bodies, causing numerous diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement contains a lengthy list of injuries for which women can be 
compensated, depending on their age and the severity of their injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Projected compensation, after reduction for administrative costs and legal 
fees, ranges from $105,000 to $1.4 million per person, according to the 
settlement notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Those amounts could be increased if more companies join the settlement, whose 
participants now include Dow Corning, Baxter Healthcare, Bristol-Myers Squibb 
and some smaller companies. Negotiations between 3M, Union Carbide and other 
companies, which could add up to $1 billion to the settlement fund, are 
scheduled to resume today.  
</P>
<P>
 "The settlement is much more desirable" for many reasons if 3M and the other 
companies participate, said Alan B. Morrison, director of Ralph Nader's Public 
Citizen Litigation Group, who earlier indicated that he might challenge the 
deal because it was inadequately funded and did not cover all the appropriate 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If 3M is not in the deal, there will be a lot more proof required in what was 
supposed to be a painless administrative procedure," because women will have to 
show that their implants came from one of the settling companies, not 3M, 
Morrison said. He also expressed concern about whether the women will have 
adequate time to make a decision on whether to join the settlement or opt out. 
</P>
<P>
 A massive public information campaign on the settlement -- including 
television, radio and newspaper advertisements -- is scheduled to start April 
18. Pointer has set up a toll-free number, (800) 887-6828, that women can call 
if they want information mailed to them. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a "current disease fund," which provides compensation for women 
who are ill, the settlement provides money for medical monitoring and removal 
of implants.  
</P>
<P>
 It also contains a mechanism for making other diseases compensable later if 
scientific evidence is developed showing a possible link between implants and 
those diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement does not require proof that a covered disease was caused by a 
breast implant. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord runs for 30 years and is designed to operate like an insurance 
policy. By signing up now, a woman who has implants could get compensation if 
she became ill later, said Elizabeth J. Cabraser, a San Francisco lawyer who 
was on the plaintiffs' negotiating committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Women with saline implants also are eligible to participate in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointer's order set a schedule for key events in the massive litigation: 
</P>
<P>
 * June 17 is the first deadline for women who do not want to participate to 
file papers opting out of the settlement, thus enabling them to pursue their 
own lawsuits. That is also the deadline for individuals desiring to file 
objections to the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 18 is the date for a hearing on the fairness of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 16 is the deadline for women with eligible diseases to file claims for 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 1 is the deadline for women to register to make claims for medical 
monitoring, to have an implant removed, or to be eligible for compensation 
later if they develop one of the covered diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The elaborate settlement still could fall apart. If it attracts more claimants 
than anticipated, the amounts individual women receive could be lowered. In 
turn, reduced payouts could prompt women to drop out. And a smaller than 
anticipated class of plaintiffs could be grounds for the defendant corporations 
to withdraw from the deal.

CLINTON PLEDGES AIR SUPPORT IN BOSNIA; BALKANS: U.N. TROOPS SCHEDULED TO ENTER 
A BESIEGED MUSLIM ENCLAVE COULD COUNT ON U.S., THE PRESIDENT SAYS. THEY WOULD 
ACT AS SHIELD AGAINST SERBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 President Clinton pledged NATO air support Monday for 800 Ukrainian 
peacekeeping troops that the United Nations is preparing to deploy in the 
besieged Muslim enclave of Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's remarks, made in Cleveland, where he attended opening day of 
the American League baseball season, came as Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, U.N. 
commander in Bosnia, scheduled a visit to Gorazde on Wednesday to pave the way 
for the arrival of the Ukrainians, whose primary mission would be to act as a 
shield against attacks by Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose will try to persuade the Serbs to let the peacekeeping troops cross their 
lines without interference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at what our options are there," Clinton said. "But it really 
depends, in part, on what the U.N. mission wants to do there. We are committed 
to providing air support to troops if they go in." 
</P>
<P>
 The authority for air support stems from Security Council resolutions calling 
on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to protect U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Bosnian news reports of a massive Serbian offensive against Gorazde, 
American and U.N. officials said they doubt the fall of the largely Muslim town 
of 65,000 is imminent. And a U.N. official reported that the shelling of 
Gorazde had subsided in the last 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 A ham radio operator in Gorazde, however, insisted that some of the front 
lines southeast of the town were "literally in flames"; neither U.N. nor U.S. 
officials provided any evidence to confirm the ham radio operator's claims. But 
fighting in the area has been heavy, and the shelling reportedly has been 
intense. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the Clinton Administration will 
consider using air power to stop the Serbs' shelling of civilian areas in 
Gorazde, just as NATO stopped the shelling of Sarajevo in February. 
</P>
<P>
 But the United States hopes to avoid any situation in which its air power 
would have the effect of supporting Bosnian government forces on the ground, in 
Gorazde or elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to enter this war on behalf of one of the belligerents," he 
said. "Our use of air power is designed to accomplish very select objectives . 
. . that are designed ultimately to advance the peace process, not to further 
the position of one of the belligerents engaged in battle on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The comments by Clinton and McCurry were not viewed as inconsistent with the 
assertion by Secretary of Defense William J. Perry on Sunday that the United 
States would not use force to save Gorazde from falling to the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the Administration is worried that intervening in Gorazde might 
encourage the Bosnian government to mount offensives elsewhere in the mistaken 
belief that it has new Western support against the Serbs, McCurry indicated 
that the Administration has warned against such attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in very close contact with the Bosnian government," he said. "I think 
they know the type of diplomacy that we are pursuing at the moment. But I think 
we do need to be conscious that those steps we take are designed to encourage 
the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 The four U.N. military observers now in Gorazde reportedly have spotted some 
Muslim military equipment within the town. The presence of such equipment, like 
the Serbian shelling, would violate year-old Security Council resolutions 
declaring Gorazde a U.N.-protected safe area. 
</P>
<P>
 Under U.N.-set conditions, the Muslims were required to withdraw all troops 
and military equipment from the safe areas, while the Serbs were ordered to 
stop their shelling.

EDUCATION; COLLEGE-BOUND STUDENTS WIN IN GEORGIA LOTTERY; CRITICS SAY 
GAME-FUNDED SCHOLARSHIPS ARE TOO GENEROUS, BUT GOV. MILLER SAYS IT'S ABOUT 
GRADES, NOT INCOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Students chat happily between classes on the sprawling North Gwinnett High 
School campus. It's spring. The school year is almost over. The uncertainty of 
the future lies ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the 248-member senior class have turned their thoughts toward college 
-- and the new state scholarship program called HOPE, or Helping Outstanding 
Pupils Educationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The most far-reaching state scholarship project in the nation, HOPE is funded 
entirely by lottery revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics say the program is too generous. Others question what will happen 
if lottery revenues fall. Still others are concerned that the lottery is played 
mostly by low-income people who can least afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eric Cochling, 18, who will leave this small town 30 miles northeast of 
Atlanta to enter the University of Georgia in the fall, said: "HOPE is allowing 
me to go to college. I come from a one-parent family. My mother couldn't really 
afford to pay very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Chris Prevatt, 18, who is headed for Georgia Tech to study chemical 
engineering, said: "HOPE is helping many students who otherwise couldn't afford 
college." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which currently benefits more than 40,000 students at Georgia's 
colleges, universities and technical schools, is the brainchild of Gov. Zell 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 1994 school year draws to a close, guidance counselors across the state 
are swamped with students seeking information on HOPE. The grants cover 
tuition, mandatory fees and a $100-per-quarter book allowance for any of the 
state's public colleges or universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Any high school senior with a B average and family income of less than 
$100,000 qualifies. College freshmen who maintain a 3.0 average and whose 
family income stays below $100,000 will be covered for all four years. HOPE 
also will give $500 to students selecting an in-state private college or 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 To critics who feel the $100,000 cap is too generous, Miller responds: "I 
don't see this as a program about income levels. It's about scholarship. It's 
about keeping good grades." 
</P>
<P>
 And HOPE pays the full tuition for students enrolled in the state's two-year 
technical colleges, regardless of grades or family income. Those who earn a 
high school equivalency degree are awarded a $500 voucher to be used for 
educational expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-one percent of lottery revenues are appropriated for education. Those 
funds are divided among the HOPE scholarships; pre-kindergarten for at-risk 
4-year-olds, which is benefiting 10,000 children; and a special equipment and 
capital needs program that is designated for onetime expenditures, such as 
computer labs for all Georgia schools. 
</P>
<P>
 And as a safeguard against declines in lottery revenues, 10% of the education 
money is deposited into a reserve fund. 
</P>
<P>
 When the lottery's first fiscal year ends June 30, projections are for total 
revenues exceeding $898 million, with at least $280 million earmarked for 
education. That would put Georgia at the top in first-year per capita lottery 
sales of $132.05, breaking Florida's record of $128 and far surpassing 
California's $32.85  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some states that lump lottery money in with the general funds, Georgia 
laws are precise about how lottery revenues are divided, deposited and 
distributed. The 31% designated for education is deposited into a Lottery for 
Education account, 50% is returned as prizes, 14% is budgeted for operating 
costs and 5% goes to lottery retailers as commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wisest thing we did in Georgia was to dedicate the lottery proceeds to 
specific areas . . . that it not be put into the general fund and frittered 
away like it is in most states," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Georgia, for example, where no lottery revenues can be used for teacher 
pay, California devoted over 90% of the $625.9 million from the 1993 lottery to 
teacher salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia's lottery met with great opposition when first proposed, but it now 
appears that a great cross-section of Georgia's citizens are playing the games. 
In a recent University of Georgia poll, almost 54% of those surveyed said that 
they had played. More than 86% reported they spend less than $5 per week on the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not just Georgians playing. With no lottery in four of the five 
bordering states, ticket sales are strong at retail outlets along the state 
lines, the Georgia Lottery Corp. said. 
</P>
<P>
 Extolling the popularity of the games, lottery spokesman Chuck Reece said: 
"Most people aren't playing the lottery because they think it's going to help 
education. . . . They're playing because they think it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochling, the North Gwinnett senior, is more philosophical. "If people are 
going to waste their money gambling, why not put it to good use?"

 President Clinton's 32-member welfare reform working group was meeting for the 
first time in three months, just weeks before the Administration's policy 
initiative was expected to be introduced in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-chairmen of the group distributed copies of a thick document, the most 
detailed version yet of the Administration's proposal for fulfilling Clinton's 
popular campaign pledge to "end welfare as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Each page of the draft was marked with the word confidential and the name of 
the member of the working group who received the document so no one could 
remove a page without its being detected. The working group was given 45 
minutes to read the draft before the copies were collected. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members bristled at the treatment, later saying that the scenario 
reflected two important dynamics of the way in which the Administration is 
crafting welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is that, although theoretically the working group is designing the 
policy, in reality only the three co-chairmen and a few others have had real 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 The second is that those in control have gone to unusual lengths to try to 
keep as much of their plan as possible away from public purview. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has repeatedly stressed its preference for an "inclusive" 
style of policy-making that builds consensus around an initiative before 
pressing for it. But some members of Congress and even some Administration 
officials say that, in designing a package to overhaul the country's health 
care system and in formulating a plan to redesign the welfare system, real 
influence is in the hands of a few. 
</P>
<P>
 While the chief designers of the Administration's initiatives may meet with 
many lawmakers and groups potentially affected by the measures, the 
participants often come away feeling that the meetings were more for show than 
substance. As a result, they feel little enthusiasm for defending the details 
of the Administration's proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ellwood, a co-chairman of the group and a widely recognized welfare 
reform expert, defended the strategy: "The principals ought to have a chance to 
think about things first before seeing it in the newspaper," he said, 
reflecting concern over inopportune leaks of information to the media. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one member of the working group disagreed: "Who made them think 
that they can do business in a vacuum and not tell the American people what 
you're planning to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ellwood argued that the working group has played a key role. "I really do 
think it has been a collaborative effort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration insiders and observers say that the most important 
decisions have been made by Ellwood; Mary Jo Bane, an assistant secretary of 
the Department of Health and Human Services; and Bruce Reed, a domestic policy 
adviser to the President. The three jointly head the group. The handful of 
large working group meetings over the last few months have not been nearly as 
important as the smaller 7:30 a.m. gatherings of selected experts that occur 
several times a week at the Department of Heath and Human Services 
headquarters, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellwood also insisted that "Congress has played a key role" in shaping the 
Administration's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Senate Finance 
Committee, and Paul Offner, an influential committee staff member, have had an 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after an article by Offner in the New Republic advocated beginning the 
reforms with the youngest and newest welfare recipients, the working group 
leaders adopted a similar stance. 
</P>
<P>
 "His article was influential," Ellwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other lawmakers said the Administration has done nothing to make them feel 
they have a stake in its plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had meetings, but they have not been substantive," said Rep. Robert T. 
Matsui (D-Sacramento), an influential member of a House Ways and Means 
subcommittee that will consider the bill. "I don't feel any loyalty to this 
piece of legislation. We'll look at it very objectively, and we'll do what we 
think needs to be done to change it or we'll pass something else." 
</P>
<P>
 The potential danger in the approach is that members of Congress will feel no 
responsibility for the plan and will be easily persuaded to abandon it for 
competing proposals, a fate that seems to have befallen the Clinton health care 
reform effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress and task force members cautioned that even if the 
co-chairmen design a terrific policy, they may not be politically astute enough 
to get it through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mary Jo and Ellwood are in way over their heads," said a working group 
member, who spoke on condition of anonymity. "They are both academics. They 
have no sense of politics, period."

 INTIFADA ARCHITECTS PREPARE TO HEAD HOME; ISRAEL: PALESTINIAN UPRISING'S 
LEADERS ARE RETURNING TO PAVE WAY FOR SELF-RULE IN OCCUPIED AREAS. SOME WERE 
EXILED SIX YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They were the architects of the intifada, the six-year Palestinian uprising in 
which these men, many middle-aged and with hints of a paunch, left their jobs 
at City Hall and their university classes and pharmacies and began handing out 
leaflets, organizing meetings, resisting the Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel said they were dangerous, put them in prison and ultimately deported 
them from their homes. For years they lived in exile. Some went back to school 
at universities in Europe or elsewhere in the Middle East. Some joined the 
staffs of Palestine Liberation Organization embassies in Algeria, Egypt, Jordan 
and Libya, or the PLO headquarters in Tunis, Tunisia, assisting the intifada 
from abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, they are going home. Israel has allowed a number of deportees to return 
to the occupied territories in recent months, including activists from the 
Islamic fundamentalist organization Hamas who sat stranded on a Lebanon 
mountainside for more than a year. A few exiled academics have trickled back 
into the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 But Israel has never readmitted the deportees of the uprising, considered too 
volatile to come home -- until today, when, as part of the Palestinian-Israeli 
peace plan under negotiation in Cairo, 46 Palestinians deported during the 
intifada will begin returning to the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than a dozen are scheduled to cross the Egyptian border at Rafah 
into the Gaza Strip at noon today. More are traversing into the West Bank from 
Jordan -- the first new citizens of the Palestinian self-rule zones being 
fashioned in Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 "It pleases me to know that I represent a danger to the occupation forces. We 
are. But they (the Israelis) are the ones forming a danger toward our children, 
our lives, our families, our land. Truly, who is the one who represents danger? 
Us or them?" asked Freij Ahmad Khairy, 46, who is one of 14 scheduled to leave 
in the first wave from Egypt on a bus this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Khairy, an engineer and activist from PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah 
faction, has not been home to the Gaza Strip in nearly six years, since his 
deportation order in April, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those leaving with him were to be Ahmed Deek, a former student at Nablus 
University, and Abdullah abu Samahdaneh, a former mathematics professor at the 
Islamic University in the Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 At his apartment in the Cairo suburb of Nasser City on Monday night, Khairy 
sat with mementos of his exile years: a filigree Tunisian bird cage acquired 
from his time at PLO headquarters in Tunis; a poster of Jerusalem's holy Dome 
of the Rock, inscribed with a single message: "The Return." 
</P>
<P>
 Khairy, who has quietly helped direct the intifada from Cairo since his 
deportation in 1988, left Israel after a swarm of Israeli officers descended on 
his home in Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip and accused him of recruiting for the 
Fatah organization, along with other unspecified charges. He became one of the 
first eight men deported during the uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of peacemaking, he is going home to a land whose future is more 
uncertain than ever. Far from welcoming the "Gaza-Jericho first" peace plan 
negotiated by the exiled PLO leadership, many Gazans have bitterly condemned it 
as too little, too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is true that some problems have occurred after the agreement of Gaza and 
Jericho, but do not expect not to have problems. Problems will be there. And it 
is true that this step is a very small step. But it is a beginning of a 
direction toward peace," Khairy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the massacre of about 30 Palestinians in Hebron more than a 
month ago -- a slaughter that turned the peace process on its ear -- the return 
of the deportees represents one of a series of quiet confidence-building steps 
the Israelis are prepared to offer to get the peace talks back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian officials say they have been assured that all Palestinian 
prisoners will be freed by the end of July. In return, Israelis hope Arafat 
will be able to deliver peace. 
</P>
<P>
 With six years in exile, Khairy said, "the foundation and basis of my life 
have been completely destroyed. My wife and children have been with me, but my 
parents were left behind. We have paid a heavy price. But I pray to God because 
if we fought, we fought so we could help our children avoid seeing what we saw. 
We fought so we could give them a life like normal children anywhere else."

MIDDAY RIOTS MARK ISRAEL'S JERICHO PULLOUT; MIDEAST: SOLDIERS ARE PELTED WITH 
DEBRIS FOR THIRD DAY AS MILITARY POST IS DISMANTLED. THEY FIRE BACK WITH TEAR 
GAS, GRENADES.

<P>
 As an army of bulldozers carved a new Israeli military border base into the 
Judean desert just outside town, and as Israeli soldiers hauled air 
conditioners and furniture from administration buildings they soon will leave 
behind, this sleepy oasis exploded Monday in a rare display of frenzy and 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 For hours, Palestinian men, women and children rained stones and bottles on 
the small police station that has been the bastion of Israel's quarter-century 
of occupation in the heart of Jericho, the town designated as the future 
capital of an autonomous Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's helmeted and heavily armed troops, their faces drawn and weary, 
responded by firing round after round of tear gas and concussion grenades and 
an occasional bullet into the adjacent municipal square. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is their way of saying goodby," Samir Fetiani, a 25-year-old 
microbiologist from Jericho, said as he met a grenade that exploded a few feet 
away with a smile. "And ours." 
</P>
<P>
 When the smoke cleared from Jericho's third straight day of midday riots, 
neither side reported serious casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 But the war-zone scene -- in a town famous for its passive resistance 
throughout Israel's 27 years of occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip -- 
underscored the dizzying array of emotion and mixed signals from Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization at a time most Palestinians here hoped would 
be their liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the many signs of accelerating withdrawal on the ground in Jericho and 
Gaza on Monday, Israeli and PLO negotiators continued to work feverishly in 
Cairo to meet a self-imposed April 13 deadline for a final agreement on 
Israel's withdrawal and Palestinian self-rule beginning in the two isolated 
corners of the occupied lands. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO officials in Jericho and Gaza said they were instructed by their 
leadership Monday to prepare for the imminent arrival -- perhaps as early as 
today -- of the first eight Palestinian police officers and up to two dozen 
future Palestinian government officials. They are senior members of PLO 
Chairman Yasser Arafat's Fatah wing and include some of the 46 Palestinian 
deportees Israel agreed on Sunday to allow home. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin declared after Monday's 
Cabinet session that "it would take a miracle" to complete and sign the final 
agreement on Palestinian autonomy by mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
 Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, a key member of the Israeli negotiating 
team, added after the Cabinet meeting that he now hopes the agreement can be 
concluded before the end of the month -- and that Arafat can visit a free 
Jericho in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin and Sarid both stressed that they believe full withdrawal could be 
completed within days of the signing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's key Cabinet adviser, Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, added 
after the weekly session that the government intends to take as many concrete 
steps as possible to show it is determined to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely we have agreed, in order to save time, that movement should be 
from both sides -- as well as allowing the Palestinian police . . . to get in," 
he said. "At the same time, we are pulling out all forces that are not required 
to safeguard the area." 
</P>
<P>
 In Gaza, that movement appeared as rapid as it did in Jericho on Monday. The 
scene there was a mirror image of the far-off town on the Jordanian border that 
Arafat has selected as his capital. Palestinians hurled stones and insults as 
Israeli police continued to dismantle entire bases in the heart of Gaza City; 
the Israelis loaded computers, crates and cabinets onto trucks bound for the 
Erez checkpoint inside Israeli territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The main prison in Gaza City, known to Palestinians as Ansar II, was abandoned 
after the last 32 Palestinian prisoners were transferred to jails inside 
Israel. Taken together, all the signs indicated the Israeli army is determined 
to meet what Israeli opinion polls have reported as a demand of the 
overwhelming majority of Israelis for months now: Pull out of Gaza and Jericho 
as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever is not absolutely necessary is being removed," said national police 
spokesman Eric Bar-Chen. "But we are still there, and we are not leaving just 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Israel and the PLO agreed to accelerate the autonomy process last week 
when they returned to bargaining in Cairo for their first discussions of the 
"Gaza-Jericho first" agreement, delayed since a Jewish settler massacred about 
30 Palestinians in Hebron's Cave of the Patriarchs on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting of the unarmed, praying Muslims by Baruch Goldstein, a 
Brooklyn-born physician, set the occupied territories afire with protest and 
rioting. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's government has made increasingly difficult concessions to draw the PLO 
back to the peace table. Among the compromises: the arrest of all known Jewish 
extremist leaders in the territories; an armed international observer force for 
Hebron, and an independent judicial inquiry into the massacre, which the 
government officially has blamed on a lone, deranged man. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before that commission Monday, a police ballistics expert 
appeared to reinforce a theory, built on earlier testimony, that Goldstein may 
not have acted alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Lior Nadivi, national police inspector, told the five-member panel that 
mystery surrounds the 115th shell casing that Israeli investigators said they 
found at the massacre site. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballistic tests, he said, proved that 109 of the shells were fired from 
Goldstein's assault rifle. Five others were traced to weapons of Israeli 
soldiers, who testified earlier that they fired toward the mosque's exits but 
did not hit anyone. "I know (the 115th) shell was not fired by any of the guns 
that I checked," Nadivi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessing the likelihood of a second gunman, Israeli army investigator Brig. 
Gen. David Agmon said he believed that theory was "possible, but not probable." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Palestinians said that years of perceived neglect by Israelis, combined 
with a bold new sense of imminent liberation, fueled the pre-departure rioting 
in Jericho and Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of me is about to panic," Saeb Erekat, the PLO's most senior official in 
Jericho, said after the riots began to subside. "But another part says: 'Don't 
panic. Get yourself together. You've got a lot to do.' "

U.S. COURT RULING QUESTIONS MILITARY POLICY ON GAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first gay members of the military to challenge the new Clinton 
Administration policy on homosexuals won a preliminary court ruling Monday that 
raises questions about the constitutionality of the "don't ask, don't tell" 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal district court judge in New York barred the government from 
investigating or discharging the six gay service members while their lawsuit is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the preliminary injunction leaves the recently adopted policy in 
effect, the wording of the 25-page decision indicated that the court has some 
misgivings about the new regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me the language of the decision shows the court has seen through this 
policy and has recognized what it's really about," said Beatrice Dohrn, legal 
director of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, one of two civil 
liberties groups representing the plaintiffs. "The judge also pierced this 
whole nonsensical characterization of the policy: that it's about conduct and 
not identity." 
</P>
<P>
 A Pentagon spokesman declined comment, saying the Defense Department had just 
received the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The new regulations, which took effect in late February, were described by the 
Administration as an easing of the military's anti-gay ban. But gay-rights 
advocates have claimed that the new policy is in some ways worse than the old. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new regulations, sexual orientation is considered a private matter 
unless manifested by homosexual conduct. But, said the ruling, "The guidelines 
go so far as to make any statement of homosexual orientation, wherever and 
whenever made . . . as proof of an intent to engage in homosexual acts." 
</P>
<P>
 The opinion, written by U.S. District Judge Eugene H. Nickerson of the Eastern 
District of New York, also said: "The message to those with such an orientation 
appears to be not to avoid private homosexual acts but to stay in the closet 
and to hide their orientation." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that there have been conflicting court rulings on the legality of the 
military's previous policy on gays, Nickerson wrote: "This court does not now 
undertake to assess the relative merits of these divergent holdings. It is 
enough to say that the allegedly new policy makes the same distinction between 
homosexuals and heterosexuals as did the prior policy." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit -- the first to directly challenge the new policy -- was filed last 
month by five men and one woman. They include two plaintiffs from California, 
Army Reserve First Lt. Kenneth Osborn, who is assigned to a support unit in 
South El Monte, and Navy Reserve Lt. Richard von Wohld, who is assigned to 
Moffett Field Naval Air Station in Northern California.

REINSTATING PRINCIPAL WHO BANNED INTERRACIAL DATING BRINGS BOYCOTT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dozens of black students boycotted classes Monday to protest the reinstatement 
of a white principal who threatened to cancel the high school prom if blacks 
and whites dated each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the boycott was student ReVonda Bowen, who filed a civil rights 
lawsuit against Hulond Humphries for allegedly telling her she was "a mistake" 
because her father is white and her mother is black. 
</P>
<P>
 The boycott was launched by civil rights groups as the 680-student Randolph 
County High School, which is about 38% black, reopened after a weeklong spring 
break. Humphries also returned after being suspended March 14. The school board 
voted, 4 to 2, Thursday to reinstate him. One white member resigned in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphries, 55, who has been principal for 25 years, declined to comment, but 
he told one newspaper reporter, "I'd like for you to leave town."

HIGH COURT DENIES FEE HIKES FOR OUT-OF-STATE GARBAGE; LAW: JUSTICES BAR AN 
OREGON STATUTE THAT SET A TWO-TIER RATE SYSTEM. A RULING IS ALSO EXPECTED ON 
CONSUMER SUIT OVER FREQUENT-FLIER PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a new setback for states trying to stem the flow of trash across their 
borders, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that government officials may not 
charge higher fees for dumping out-of-state garbage in their landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-2 decision strikes down an Oregon law that set a $3.10 per ton disposal 
fee for out-of-state solid waste and an 85-cent fee for waste generated in 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's opinion strongly reaffirms its view that states may not 
discriminate against the interstate shipment of goods, even if those "goods" 
consist of garbage. Doing so is the type of "economic protectionism" barred by 
the Constitution, the justices said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, the court announced that it would rule on whether consumers can 
sue airlines under state laws for changing the terms of frequent-flier 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers representing 4 million frequent fliers have sued American Airlines 
under an Illinois consumer fraud law contending that the carrier cannot 
unilaterally change its rules. They challenged American's new policy of 
limiting the number of seats available to holders of free tickets and 
increasing the number of "black-out days." 
</P>
<P>
 The Illinois Supreme Court last year ruled that the suit can proceed because 
fliers who join the program have entered into an implied contract that one side 
cannot "change retroactively." 
</P>
<P>
 But in their appeal to the high court, the airlines said that suit -- as well 
as others like it -- is preempted by the federal Airline Deregulation Act. That 
measure bars states from enforcing laws "relating to rates, routes and 
services" provided by the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The case (American Airlines vs. Wolens, 93-1286) to be heard in the fall 
likely will get wide attention because the major carriers have announced a 
series of rule changes in their frequent-flier programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The garbage case focuses on the conflict between the Constitution's protection 
for interstate commerce and a state's effort to protect its scarce landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Americans have shown an impressive ability to produce more 
trash. In 1990, the nation generated 196 million tons of municipal solid waste, 
nearly 50% more than in 1975. By the end of this decade, the annual total will 
reach 222 million tons, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Supreme Court has steadfastly barred states from trying to stop trash 
flow at their borders. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1978 case involving trash moving from Philadelphia to New Jersey, the 
Supreme Court first ruled that trash is a commodity that states cannot keep out 
through strict regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, states have tried to impose fees to accomplish the same purpose 
but without success. Two years ago, the justices struck down an Alabama law 
that set a $72 per ton fee on shipments of hazardous waste crossing into the 
state.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the opinion in that case appeared to leave open the possibility that 
a state could set differing fees if it could show that it was more costly to 
dispose of waste from elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 Seizing on that theory, Oregon lawyers justified their differing fees by 
arguing that the state's taxpayers subsidize the cost of recycling and the 
development of landfills and therefore deserve lower fees for disposing of 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday's ruling rejected that approach too. "The fact remains that the 
differential charge favors shippers of Oregon waste over their counterparts 
handling waste generated in other states," Justice Clarence Thomas wrote for 
the court. "In making that geographic distinction, the surcharge patently 
discriminates against interstate commerce" and is therefore unconstitutional, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana is the only other state which has recently tried to impose higher 
charges on shipments of out-of-state trash. California does not have such a 
statute, according to lawyers in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Dissenting in the case (Oregon Waste Systems vs. Oregon, 93-70) were Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Harry A. Blackmun. A consistent 
defender of states' rights, Rehnquist said that the court should not limit a 
state's authority to protect a "clean and healthy environment." 
</P>
<P>
 While the court has now made clear that states cannot restrict private haulers 
from shipping trash into their jurisdictions, it is not clear whether the same 
principle applies in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the justices heard arguments on whether a suburban New York town 
can require all trash collected within its borders to be deposited at a 
city-owned trash collection facility. Such ordinances have become common in 
East Coast cities that have invested heavily in building trash-burning plants. 
However, the haulers say that the Constitution forbids all laws to bar the 
interstate shipments of goods, regardless of whether the flow is into the state 
or out of it. A ruling in the case (C&A Carbone vs. Clarkstown, 92-1402) is 
pending.

DEFECT SEARCH FORCES SHUTTLE LAUNCH DELAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Endeavour's Earth-mapping mission was delayed Monday hours after the countdown 
began to allow NASA time to check for defects that could lead to a shuttle 
engine shutdown or an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The countdown clocks began ticking late Monday morning toward a Thursday 
liftoff.But by late afternoon, the launch had been bumped to Friday so 
technicians could check the oxidizer pump of each main engine for bad parts. 
</P>
<P>
 If an inspection today finds anything suspicious or inconclusive, a more 
detailed check will be made, delaying liftoff by about another week, NASA 
spokesman Bruce Buckingham said. Replacing a pump or the entire engine would 
take several weeks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A routine inspection of an oxidizer pre-burner pump in California late last 
week uncovered a defective metal strip in a pressurization line, NASA 
spokeswoman June Malone said. One of the 11 small strips that direct the flow 
of liquid oxygen through the pump was pointed instead of rounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers fear the pointed shape could cause the strip to crack and send metal 
chips into the pump, which could cause a main engine shutdown or possibly an 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Endeavour will carry the most sophisticated radar equipment ever built for 
environmental monitoring from space. 
</P>
<P>
 The $366-million instruments will scan rocks in Death Valley, forests in North 
Carolina and Michigan, waterways in Oklahoma and environmentally sensitive 
sites elsewhere in the world so scientists can learn more about changes in 
Earth's ecology.

CLINTON'S DAY TURNS INTO A REAL BALL; VACATION: HE ATTENDS THE OPENING GAME AT 
CLEVELAND'S NEW BASEBALL STADIUM. THEN HE SEES ARKANSAS WIN THE NCAA BASKETBALL 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton, stretching his spring vacation for one last day, played out 
a sports fan's fantasy Monday by attending opening day at Cleveland's new 
baseball stadium, then flying on to Charlotte, N.C., to see his beloved 
Arkansas Razorbacks win the NCAA basketball championship, 76-72. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who makes no pretense of objectivity when it comes to Arkansas 
basketball, could be seen during the game hooting vigorously and nervously 
watching the seesaw action. 
</P>
<P>
 The President returns to a full schedule of health care events and other 
matters today, but Monday was devoted to presidential sports-watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day Clinton, sporting an obsolete but politically correct 
Indians cap, threw out the ceremonial first pitch to start the first game of 
the season between the Indians and the Seattle Mariners at Cleveland's Jacobs 
Field. He lobbed the ball the full 60 feet 6 inches across home plate, where it 
was fielded by Indians catcher Sandy Alomar. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton knew his pitch had a loopy beginning but he was determined that the 
ball make the full trip to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started high," the President said. "The only thing you can't do is put it 
in the dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Former President George Bush, a starting first baseman on his Yale University 
baseball team, suffered the humiliation of bouncing one to the plate on opening 
day in Baltimore in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 While the President performed the obligatory rite of spring in Cleveland, 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, an ardent Chicago Cubs fan, threw the first 
pitch for the home opener between the Cubs and the New York Mets at Wrigley 
Field. Mrs. Clinton, wearing a blue Cubs blazer and baseball cap, threw an 
overhand toss from the stadium seats that landed in the glove of Cubs catcher 
Rick Wilkins who stood 15 to 20 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in an obvious effort to avoid offending anyone -- except, perhaps, 
Indian fans -- wore a nylon Indians warm-up jacket and a blue and red cap 
marked with a simple block C emblem. Neither article of clothing bore the 
politically incorrect but locally revered Indians logo, the grinning Chief 
Wahoo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians dropped the chief for two years in the mid-1970s in deference to 
the sensibilities of Native Americans, but restored their historic mascot in 
1977 and he has appeared on their uniforms and caps ever since. It is one of 
the most popular sports logos in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton walked through the tunnel to the field, some of the Indians players 
razzed him by shouting, "Let's go, Duke!" -- referring to Arkansas' opponent in 
the basketball title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Indians general manager John Hart said that the presidential visit was 
"outstanding for us in Cleveland." He said that the new field is a symbol of 
the economic renaissance of Cleveland and that Clinton's presence in the 
heavily Democratic city was "really special." 
</P>
<P>
 But Alomar, the all-star catcher, said that he had not voted for Clinton, 
whose economic program includes sharply higher taxes for the wealthy -- 
including millionaire ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't vote for nobody that takes my money," said Alomar, who recently 
signed a three-year, $7.6-million contract with the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's sports odyssey drew a larger than usual contingent of senior White 
House staff. Accompanying the President to Cleveland and Charlotte were Red Sox 
fanatic and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, political consultants James 
Carville and Paul Begala, senior adviser and former Clevelander George 
Stephanopoulos, and White House Chief of Administration David Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Before stepping into the sports spotlight Monday, the Clintons began their day 
with the annual egg roll for children on the White House lawn. Some 27,000 
youngsters participated in the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 30,000 speckled eggs provided for the occasion bore a silhouette 
of the White House and the signatures of the President and Mrs. Clinton.

CLINTON OKS WELFARE PLAN THAT PHASES IN TIME LIMIT; REFORM: ONLY YOUNGER 
RECIPIENTS WOULD INITIALLY BE SUBJECT TO THE MEASURE. THEY WOULD HAVE TO EXIT 
THE ROLLS AND GET A JOB AFTER TWO YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has approved a plan to phase in his welfare reform proposal 
by initially requiring only younger welfare recipients to accept work after two 
years on the rolls, senior Administration officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration is still sharply arguing on how to structure its 
welfare plan beyond that core program, as new estimates for the cost of the 
reforms range from $28 billion to $58 billion over 10 years, Administration 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's highly unlikely that the most expensive version will be chosen," 
one Administration official said. "We've presented the options. The President 
has to make these decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 The less-expensive estimates include less child care for the working poor, 
less money to states to try out various welfare experiments and no provisions 
to make it easier for two-parent families to join the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The core promise concerning work is in the bank, and the question is how much 
more can we afford," another knowledgeable official said. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, the Administration has struggled to find offsetting cuts or taxes 
to fund its welfare plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost every funding idea that it has floated has drawn intense internal 
and external opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many officials have been arguing that the Administration will 
have to scale back some of the more expensive and less essential options 
considered by the panel that assembled the recommendations.  
</P>
<P>
 The new 10-year calculations are likely to strengthen the voices of those 
within the Administration arguing for the most limited plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under elements of the proposal the President has approved, the two-year time 
limit on welfare recipients initially will apply only to young recipients -- 
probably those born in 1972 or later. As the population ages, the number of 
recipients subject to the time limit will grow annually -- thus increasing the 
government's cost for providing job training, child care and, in some 
instances, public employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has repeatedly stressed that rival proposals designed by 
Republicans in the Senate and House also call for spending substantial 
additional sums to help people move off welfare.

NOLAN BEGINS SENTENCE AT PRISON CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Assemblyman Pat Nolan on Monday surrendered to authorities at a federal 
prison camp east of Oakland to start serving a 33-month sentence on political 
corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan reported at 12:25 p.m. to the minimum security work camp at Dublin, 
where he will be assigned a job, likely in landscaping or maintenance, said 
prison spokeswoman Janice Killian. 
</P>
<P>
 Killian said the 43-year-old former lawmaker would share a renovated barracks 
with three inmates at the prison, which is located on an Army base. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, a federal grand jury accused the onetime GOP Assembly leader from 
Glendale of using his office as a racketeering enterprise to solicit a series 
of bribes from individuals seeking his backing on legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 After initially declaring his innocence, Nolan in February resigned from 
office and pleaded guilty. Nolan said he changed his mind because he feared 
that a jury trial conviction could mean a longer sentence away from his wife 
and three children. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dublin, Nolan joined three others convicted in a long-running federal probe 
of political corruption, Killian said. Also serving sentences at the facility 
are former lobbyist Clayton R. Jackson, onetime Coastal Commissioner Mark L. 
Nathanson and former Assembly aide Tyrone Netters.

SENATE PANEL PASSES MEASURE TO REPEAL 'PRISONERS BILL OF RIGHTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Backed by prison officials and correctional officers, a state Senate committee 
Monday approved a bill repealing the "prisoners bill of rights" that grants 
inmates several privileges, including conjugal visits and the right to receive 
hard-core pornographic and racist writings. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill by Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside) would give inmates only the 
rights guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. They still could have family visits 
and receive mail, but authorities could limit access to some magazines and 
prohibit private visits between husbands and wives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature passed the "prisoners bill of rights" in 1975. It was a high 
point in the prisoners rights movement of the 1960s and early 1970s. The 
statute, which is part of the state Penal Code, gives prisoners the right to 
marry, bring civil lawsuits, make wills and create powers of attorney. Presley 
said his bill is not intended to remove those rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections Director James Gomez said the statute needs to be changed. "It's 
fundamentally flawed," he said. "There ought to be a prisoners bill of 
responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The statute allows inmates to sell "all written and artistic material" they 
produce. But Gomez said prisoners have used the statute to produce pornographic 
material within the prison walls and sell it outside the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Gomez and other supporters of the bill say prisoners should not 
be allowed to receive pornographic and racist writings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez said that if the section is repealed, wardens could impose stricter 
grooming standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley's bill passed on a 7-1 vote, with Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) 
dissenting. It has several more hurdles in the Legislature. A similar bill 
supported by Gov. Pete Wilson and being pushed by Assemblyman Dean Andal 
(R-Stockton) is expected to be taken up in an Assembly committee today. Andal 
and Presley are running against one another for a seat on the State Board of 
Equalization.

TREASURE TROVE OF FOSSILS FOUND IN GOBI DESERT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists have discovered a dramatic fossil trove in Mongolia's Gobi Desert, 
including some unknown meat-eating dinosaurs and several dinosaur "nurseries" 
with extremely well-preserved eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding represents the best-preserved assemblage of backboned animals ever 
found from the Cretaceous period, 130 million to 65 million years ago, the 
American Museum of Natural History said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fossils will be "extraordinarily important" for understanding the 
evolutionary changes from dinosaurs to birds and in shedding light on the early 
days of mammals, said Michael J. Novacek of the museum, one of the expedition's 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In just 10 days last July, researchers discovered nearly 100 dinosaur fossils, 
175 fossil lizards and skulls and skeletons of 147 very rare mammals, the 
museum said Monday in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The fossils, collected from a square-mile site at Ukhaa Tolgod, are thought to 
be about 80 million years old.

REPORT IS CRITICAL OF BERNSON USE OF FUNDS; GOVERNMENT: AUDIT BY CITY ETHICS 
STAFF FINDS $158,000 IN QUESTIONABLE EXPENDITURES. COUNCILMAN BLAMES PROBLEM ON 
CONFUSION CREATED BY EMBEZZLEMENT BY A FORMER BOOKKEEPER. 
</P>

<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson used campaign funds to make more than 
$158,000 in questionable expenditures, including tens of thousands of dollars 
spent for foreign travel and expensive dinners, according to a highly critical 
audit released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit by the staff of the city Ethics Commission also could not find 
checks, receipts or other supporting documents to verify how at least another 
$700,000 in campaign funds was spent by two of seven campaign committees 
controlled by Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and the treasurer failed in your duty to exercise reasonable diligence" 
in preparing accurate and complete campaign finance disclosure reports, the 
auditors concluded in a rebuke aimed at Bernson, who has represented the 
northwest San Fernando Valley since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are being reported to the Ethics Commission enforcement staff, to 
the city attorney's office and to the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission, all of which have responsibilities for enforcing campaign finance 
reform laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Avila, deputy director of the Ethics Commission, refused to speculate 
on what those agencies might do with the information. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making no recommendation about what they should do, only providing them 
with our findings of facts," Avila said. "It's up to those agencies to 
determine if there's been violations of law." 
</P>
<P>
 State and local campaign finance reform laws require accurate disclosure of 
contributions and expenditures and adherence to certain record-keeping 
standards, and prohibit funds from being spent for the personal, and in some 
instances political, benefit of the candidate.  
</P>
<P>
 City law requires routine audits of candidates' finance committees.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bernson and his staff complained that the audit findings largely 
ignored their explanations for many of the questionable expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 They blamed many of the financial gaps and fiscal confusion on the fact that 
Bernson's political bookkeeper embezzled $126,000 from three of his committees 
and then destroyed records to cover up the theft. They also criticized the 
Ethics Commission for not giving Bernson more time to respond to the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been biased, hostile and antagonistic because I won't knuckle under 
to (Benjamin) Bycel (executive director of the Ethics Commission) and his 
dictatorial tactics," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 45 days to respond to an audit that took them two years to do," said 
Grieg Smith, Bernson's chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings of this latest round of audits covered some ground previously 
explored by a state attorney general's investigation that cleared Bernson of 
using campaign funds for personal benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bernson acknowledged that the attorney general's investigation did 
not cover three of the committees audited by the Ethics Commission that were 
found to have problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith acknowledged that he and Bernson were unable to completely reply to the 
auditors findings regarding the two committees Bernson used to finance his 1991 
reelection campaign because of a lack of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Bernson's claims that many of the problems can be traced to the 
embezzlement, the auditors noted that two committees were formed after that 
case had ended. "Furthermore, for the committees which were embezzled, auditors 
found no discernible improvement in the committee's record-keeping after the 
embezzlement activity ceased," they added. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Toni Lee Corpuel, a former bookkeeper for the accounting firm Bernson 
used, was sentenced to a year in jail after being convicted of embezzling more 
than $126,000 from Bernson's committees. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors' report concluded that five of the seven committees they examined 
"did not substantially comply" with city and state campaign finance and 
reporting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the key findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * The audit of the Bernson Political Action Committee found that of the 
$521,475 spent, only $11,225 was spent to support other candidates or ballot 
measures. Political action committees, while not bound by any obligation to do 
so, are generally established by candidates to finance other candidates or 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
 * The audit found $126,537 in expenditures by the Bernson PAC that were not 
readily explained in its campaign disclosure reports as meeting a governmental, 
legislative or political purpose, as required by law. The audit cited the brief 
explanations later offered by Bernson for each of the 82 questioned 
expenditures involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these expenditures were for meals or trips, including travel to Rome, 
China and Hawaii to meet with emergency operations personnel in those areas and 
to Israel, according to Bernson. Some of the trips were made with Bernson's 
wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $8,079 in air-fare costs to China, including the cost of 
one staff member, Bernson also charged this committee $106.45 for a "tux for 
China trip" and $105.97 to buy a "luggage carrying case for governmental 
related travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson also tapped this account to pay $141.67 to "repair VCR used in 
recording TV programs about councilman or legislative activities." 
</P>
<P>
 * Another audit noted that it could not determine if $30,905 spent by 
Bernson's officeholder committee was related to a legislative or governmental 
purpose, as required by law. Many of the questioned expenditures reported by 
this committee were for gifts and tickets to sporting events given to Bernson's 
staff, City Hall personnel or constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 In his official response to the audit, Bernson identified 30 of the 69 
questioned expenditures as politically related although the Ethics Commission 
said money from such committees cannot be legally spent on such activities. In 
eight instances, Bernson offered no explanation for the expenditures, including 
ones for $2,680 at the Hollywood Bowl and $2,917 at Northridge Hill Liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 * The audit of Bernson's two 1991 reelection committees concluded that the 
committee received $15,912 from 30 people or companies who gave more than the 
$500-per-person limit allowed under the city law.

BRISENO ALTERS TESTIMONY; LAWSUIT: OFFICER NOW BELIEVES THAT RODNEY KING WAS 
STRUCK ON AN ARM INSTEAD OF THE HEAD. NEW ACCOUNT IS BASED ON AN ENHANCED 
VIDEOTAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Theodore J. Briseno, the suspended Los Angeles police officer whose testimony 
helped convict two fellow officers of beating Rodney G. King, changed his story 
on the witness stand Monday, saying he now believes that baton blows directed 
at King missed his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno said he altered his testimony after viewing an enhanced videotape of 
the March 3, 1991, beating. The tape was prepared by prosecutors for last 
year's federal trial in which two officers, Laurence M. Powell and Stacey C. 
Koon, were convicted of violating King's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno did not take the stand in the federal trial, but a videotape of his 
testimony during an earlier state trial was considered crucial to the civil 
rights case. 
</P>
<P>
 During his testimony Monday, Briseno said he now believes that many of the 
baton blows struck King in the arm, rather than above the shoulder, as he 
originally believed. Blows to the head are forbidden by the Police Department 
because they can be fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Stone, who represents Powell, one of the officers being sued 
by King, asked Briseno to explain the change in his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "In looking at the enhancement, does it appear you were wrong?" Stone asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Briseno said. "The video clearly shows where the blows landed." 
</P>
<P>
 "And where was that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The arms," Briseno replied. "The right arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno said he first saw the enhanced video at a lawyer's office during the 
federal civil rights trial last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 John Burris, one of King's attorneys, challenged Briseno's memory, asking why 
he stuck with his original story during a police administrative hearing in 
September, even though he already had seen the enhanced tape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you trying to tell us your perceptions may have been changed, but you 
gave testimony contrary to those perceptions?" Burris asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is correct," Briseno said, adding that he has not finished his testimony 
before the continuing Board of Rights hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The board hearing is being conducted under oath by an administrative panel to 
determine if Briseno should keep his job. Briseno, 40, was acquitted of 
criminal charges of assault and civil rights violations in the state and 
federal trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the court Monday, Burris charged that Briseno changed his testimony 
because he is being sued and because he is trying to make amends to Powell and 
Koon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a self-motive to minimize Mr. King's damages," Burris said. "And Mr. 
Briseno has been held in disfavor with other officers. This was a way to bridge 
that gap." 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorneys have asked for $9.5 million to settle the lawsuit that names 
the city and 15 present and former officers, including Briseno, Powell, Koon 
and Timothy E. Wind, who was acquitted in the state and federal trials. The 
city has conceded liability in the case, offering to settle for $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The civil trial is being held in two phases, the first to determine how much 
King will be compensated for his injuries and the second to determine whether 
punitive damages will be levied against those named in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquittal of the four accused officers in the 1992 state trial sparked 
three days of rioting. As a result of their later civil rights convictions, 
Powell and Koon are serving 30-month sentences in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In other testimony Monday, King's mother, Odessa King, testified that she saw 
her son in a hospital after the beating and asked what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said . . . 'Those white boys really beat me, Ma,' " she recalled. "I told 
Rodney, 'Look, just leave race out of this. I'm getting you out of here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorneys claim that their client initially refused to say the beating 
was racially motivated because his mother advised him not to. Last week, King 
testified that the police who beat him used racial epithets. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kelley, one of King's bodyguards, testified that King is afraid to 
venture out in public and that he suffers from flashbacks and nightmares 
because of the beating.

LYNWOOD MARKET SHOOTING TESTS OPEN-MINDEDNESS OF COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Inside, grocer Michael Kim was struggling to keep his store open. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the tiny Lynwood market -- where a box of cookies led to the shooting 
of a 14-year-old -- customers and neighbors were struggling Monday to keep 
their minds open. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager was wounded after he allegedly stole the cookies and ran from 
the store Saturday afternoon. The shopkeeper said he fired when the boy seemed 
to reach menacingly for something in his waistband as a nearby friend drew a 
knife. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, a threat against his life caused Kim to close early. He was 
bleary-eyed and nervous when he reopened Charles Market on Monday morning. 
Neighbors along Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard were pondering what will 
happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too much shooting, but you have to protect yourself," said a resident 
of an apartment next door. 
</P>
<P>
 People should not be too quick to jump to conclusions, said Daniel Velez, a 
13-year-old who described himself as a friend of both the wounded boy and the 
shopkeeper -- and as an eyewitness to the end of Saturday's drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know the law. We can't judge what happened," Daniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was standing in front of the store when Kim raced up in his car with the 
wounded teen-ager inside. The grocer had loaded the boy into the auto and 
driven back to the market to call paramedics after the shooting three blocks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel said he was watching as the grocer lay the boy in the store's doorway, 
placing the youngster's hands beneath his head as he called for help. A bullet 
wound was visible on the boy's upper left chest, he said, but there was little 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, unidentified by authorities because of his age, was known to Daniel 
as "Cuate" -- Spanish slang for twin -- because he has a twin brother. Daniel 
and the teen-ager sometimes sparred against each other at the Megaton boxing 
gym across the street from the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to get out of gangs by boxing," Daniel said of the youngster. 
"He is a pretty good guy." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kim is "a pretty nice guy" too, Daniel quickly added. "When we don't have 
enough money to pay for it, he gives cookies and Gatorade to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably got nervous. You know how people can act when they get nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 A few steps away, Robert Hinojos, 31, was sipping on a soft drink he had 
purchased in Kim's store. He agreed that the shopkeeper seemed nervous at the 
time of the shooting. Hinojos said he knows because he was at Norton Avenue and 
Long Beach Boulevard when the shooting occurred as the boy and a friend ran by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a car turn real quick and then he put the gun out and said: 'Hold it!' 
" Hinojos recalled Monday. "He pulled out a gun and they turned and ran. . . . 
I heard five or six shots. The little kids were trying to run for their lives 
after they saw his gun." 
</P>
<P>
 But the tattooed, soft-spoken Hinojos -- who described himself as a former 
gang member -- disputed Kim's contention that one of the boys had a knife. "It 
was no self defense. He should have tried to chase them." 
</P>
<P>
 Others in Lynwood were willing to give Kim the benefit of a doubt, however.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to protect yourself. As long as he's protecting his place, it's all 
right to shoot," said Maria Ochoa, 37, who has lived nearby for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy who used to own the store shot into the air when he was robbed," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 (California law says any person can take the life of someone who is trying to 
commit murder or any other felony, including breaking into a home or trying to 
commit "great bodily harm." However, in each of these situations a citizen must 
also have what the law calls "a sufficiency of fear" that his life is in danger 
-- not simply that his property will be damaged. He can take action if the 
circumstances are dangerous enough "to excite the fears of a reasonable 
person.") 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, who purchased the market 11 months ago, said Monday he was "too tired" to 
comment on the shooting after staying up all night worrying about the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies -- who arrested the wounded teen-ager on 
a charge of felony strong-armed robbery -- have not decided whether they will 
recommend that Kim be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kim complained that the news media has blown the shooting out of 
proportion by injecting his ethnicity into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "That they're making such a big thing about the fact that I'm a Korean, I 
consider an extreme case of racial discrimination against Koreans," Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in Los Angeles' large Korean-American community agreed with him Monday. 
Many of them are still angry over the news coverage of the 1991 killing of 
15-year-old African American Latasha Harlins by Korean American grocer Soon Ja 
Du. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case should be seen as a simple dispute between a merchant and a 
customer where a shoplifting occurred" and the incident escalated, said Edward 
Chang, an assistant professor of ethnic studies at UC Riverside and a longtime 
leader in Los Angeles' Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood officials sought Monday to downplay any racial overtones to the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a race relations task force is being reactivated as a result of the 
incident.

JUDGE TO FACE BATTERY CHARGES AGAINST LAWYER; COURTS: WORKERS' COMPENSATION 
JURIST DENIES DETAINING AND FONDLING AN ATTORNEY. HE CLAIMS THE CASE IS A SETUP 
BECAUSE OF HIS RULINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A veteran state workers' compensation judge surrendered Monday to face felony 
charges of false imprisonment and sexual battery after a lawyer told 
authorities he forcibly kissed and fondled her in his Van Nuys chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Stanley S. Feinstein, 61 -- who denies the charges -- went to the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys station with his lawyer Monday morning, 
after learning that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. Feinstein was 
booked and released on $15,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, of Chatsworth, is scheduled to be arraigned April 25 on one felony 
count each of sexual battery by restraint and false imprisonment by violence, 
which could bring maximum prison terms of three and four years respectively, 
according to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge has been put on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an 
internal investigation by the Division of Workers' Compensation, a San 
Francisco-based state agency that oversees the appeals board, agency spokesman 
Richard Stephens said. He will not be allowed to hear cases, Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, Feinstein said the charges are false, 
politically motivated and the result of one of the many controversial and 
emotionally charged workers' compensation cases he has handled during more than 
two decades on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am innocent. I was set up. I will fight this to the end," Feinstein said. 
"I have 25 years of distinguished service and am respected by my colleagues. 
And it is really a shame that they use this to destroy my career." 
</P>
<P>
 A 40-year-old lawyer told police that when she visited the judge March 28 to 
discuss a legal matter, he prevented her from leaving by pushing her up against 
a wall, then grabbed her breast and kissed her, according to Lt. Richard 
Blankenship, head of detectives at the LAPD's Van Nuys Division, which 
investigated the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "He touched her under her clothing in a sexual manner," Blankenship said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman went to police later that day and filed a complaint. According to 
sources close to the investigation, she later went back to visit the judge to 
confront him. In that talk, Feinstein confirmed what had happened in a way that 
could be used as evidence against him, according to sources close to the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Blankenship and officials in the district attorney's office would not comment 
on what evidence has been gathered against the judge. "We did work to 
substantiate the allegations the victim made and were successful in doing 
that," Blankenship said. "We presented the evidence to the district attorney 
and they filed." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein offered no reason why the lawyer might have made such a complaint, 
but said her law firm has done business before him in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the sexual battery allegations could have been instigated by 
powerful lawyers angry at him for decisions he has made against people falsely 
claiming to have been injured in workers' compensation cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are using me to send a message," Feinstein said. "The message is: If you 
don't do what we want in the workers' compensation system, we will find you, 
and we will get you. There has been a history of attacks against workers' 
compensation judges." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why this lawyer would file a complaint, Feinstein said: "You have to go 
into their minds and find out why they are doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said news of his arrest has brought him support from judges and 
lawyers who work in the vast state building in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said that the evidence against Feinstein is strong, and that the 
case has no political overtones. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the complaint, Feinstein unlawfully touched the victim while she 
was illegally restrained "for the purpose of sexual arousal, sexual 
gratification and sexual abuse." Also, according to the complaint, Feinstein 
violated the victim's personal liberty "by violence, menace, fraud and deceit." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman also filed a complaint with the presiding judge of the workers' 
compensation system, Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the victim complained to (Feinstein's) superiors, and since this is a 
serious allegation, we began our own investigation," Stephens said. He added 
that the division was investigating the judge's background. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Feinstein received a "well qualified" rating from the State Bar Assn. 
as a judge when he ran unsuccessfully for a Superior Court position.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ABDUCTION, 
BEATING CHARGES AGAINST 2 DEPUTIES DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charges were dismissed Monday against two Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies accused of abducting a man, taking him to a deserted area and beating 
him.  
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge James Bascue dismissed the charges against deputies 
Albert Verduzco, 38, and Bobby Rodriguez, 29.The judge found that the 
prosecution had not presented sufficient evidence to convict the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is the legal equivalent of an acquittal, which means Verduzco and 
Rodriguez cannot be retried. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles sheriff's deputies were charged with assault with a 
deadly weapon and assault under color of authority for allegedly beating Albert 
Morales on Nov. 23, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales testified that the deputies "abducted" him after they responded to a 
possible domestic disturbance call at a home on Olympic Boulevard and saw a 
suspect drive away. He testified that he was walking toward the house as the 
suspect pulled away when the deputies grabbed him, put him in their patrol car 
and began chasing the suspect's car. 
</P>
<P>
 During the chase, Morales said, the deputies told him that if he escaped, 
"they were going to take me and beat me up themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 Morales said the deputies took him to a deserted area and beat him with their 
batons for about 30 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales alleged that after the beating, the deputies gave him the telephone 
number for the East Los Angeles sheriff's station and asked him to call if he 
found out anything about the suspect. Verduzco and Rodriguez maintained that 
they never beat Morales.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 4 HELD IN 
RAPE DURING HOME INVASION ROBBERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men and one 17-year-old have been arrested on suspicion of raping a 
13-year-old girl during a home invasion robbery in Diamond Bar last week, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers spotted a stolen van connected with the robbery 
about 11:30 p.m. Sunday and followed it to a residence in the 3000 block of 
West Van Buren Street.Sheriff's Deputy George Ducoulombier said the officers 
arrested the four who were in the van: Clint Jacob, 18, Gilbert Galvez, 23, 
Owen Lino, 20, and a 17-year-old juvenile, all of Los Angeles. They are being 
held in lieu of $50,000 bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1:30 a.m. last Friday, three armed men ransacked a home on Shaded Wood 
Lane in Diamond Bar, tying up the family and raping the girl. All three escaped 
by abandoning their vehicles and fleeing on foot after pursuit by sheriff's 
deputies.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: 4 AGREE TO PLEAD GUILTY 
TO MAKING FALSE CLAIMS FOR QUAKE RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first fraud convictions related to the hundreds of millions of dollars 
being doled out for earthquake relief, four people have agreed to plead guilty 
to falsely claiming to have lived in the Northridge apartment building where 16 
people died, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the four sought aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency by 
telephoning an agency assistance line and giving their address as the 
Northridge Meadows apartment building on Reseda Boulevard, where the collapse 
caused the greatest concentration of casualties during the Jan. 17 quake, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleading guilty in U.S. District Court to a single count of making a false 
claim to a government agency were Daniel Richards, 42, of Hollywood; Denise 
Jones, 35, of Carson, and Miguel Cordero, 34, of Van Nuys. Mary Mitchell, 27, 
of Paramount has agreed to enter a guilty plea Wednesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four cases are the first fraud prosecutions arising out of the 
half-million applications for assistance related to the quake, but officials 
said as many as 10 more arrests are expected within a week or so. FEMA has sent 
out checks for more than $600 million to cover temporary housing costs and 
minor repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the prosecutions, U.S. Atty. Nora M. Manella urged anyone who has 
filed false aid claims to "take stock of their situation and consider 
withdrawing their claims or returning the money they have improperly received." 
</P>
<P>
 A multi-agency task force plans to announce another round of prosecutions this 
week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials got a break that led to the first four arrests when a mail 
carrier noticed that checks were arriving addressed to people with unfamiliar 
names. He contacted his supervisor and the anti-fraud task force became 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Cordero claimed in his FEMA application that he lived in the 
apartment where mechanic Pil Soon Lee and his 14-year-old son were crushed to 
death; Richards said he lived in the apartment where a 52-year-old man died. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordero, Jones and Mitchell all received $2,300 checks. Richards did not 
receive any money but repeated the claim that he had lived at the Northridge 
Meadows complex when he was contacted by investigating agents posing as relief 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Federal Public Defender Anthony Eaglin, who represented Cordero, 
confirmed that his client had pleaded guilty but declined further comment. 
Cordero is to be sentenced May 16. Public defenders representing the other two 
who pleaded guilty did not return telephone calls. Richards is to be sentenced 
May 2 and Jones on June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Each faces a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine and 
three years probation. RICHARD LEE COLVIN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; RAPPER, 2 
OTHERS ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL FOR MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge ruled Monday that gangsta rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg and two other men 
must stand trial for murder in the August, 1993, death of an Ethiopian 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Paul G. Flynn rejected a defense request for dismissal of 
a murder indictment against the rapper, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, and 
the two others in the death of Philip Woldermariam, 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense argued that a grand jury ignored testimony by two of 
Woldermariam's friends that they hid Woldermariam's gun before police arrived. 
One friend testified that he saw Woldermariam reach for the gun before Broadus' 
bodyguard, McKinley Lee, 23, shot him, the lawyers noted. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Flynn said the defense had raised serious issues. But in his 
ruling, he said it was reasonable for the grand jury to conclude that there was 
sufficient evidence to proceed with a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that is needed is some evidence to support the indictment," his ruling 
said. "Whether the defendants acted in self-defense, and if so, whether their 
conduct was justified . . . are issues which must be decided by" a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Ed Nison contends that the shooting was the result of a 
gang confrontation at a Westside park. Lee, Broadus and Shawn Abrams, 22, 
allegedly hunted down Woldermariam in a vehicle that Broadus was driving after 
an earlier confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men, all of whom deny they are gang members, remain free on $1 
million bail each.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CITY OF COMMERCE; 
COUNSELOR CRITICALLY INJURED BY 2 YOUTHS IN ESCAPE TRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A counselor at a City of Commerce juvenile detention facility was clinging to 
life Monday after he was attacked with a metal table leg by a pair of teen-aged 
boys who were trying to escape, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Garcia, 58, of Los Angeles was taken to County-USC Medical Center in 
extremely critical condition after the early morning attack at the Dorothy 
Kirby Juvenile Detention Center on South McDonnell Avenue, Sheriff's Deputy 
Diane Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said Garcia suffered severe head injuries and was on life-support 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they are minors, authorities withheld the identities of the two 
youths, ages 16 and 17. Hecht said both had been detained for suspected 
burglary and handgun possession, and one was facing potential arson charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy said the two were captured in a railroad yard adjacent to the hall 
shortly after their escape. They denied having attacked the man, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths were held briefly at the East Los Angeles sheriff's station but 
were moved to Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall, where they are being held on

STUDENT ARRESTED IN BEATING, MULTIPLE RAPE OF EX-GIRLFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Pierce College student faces rape charges for allegedly holding 
his ex-girlfriend against her will for three days, raping her repeatedly and 
beating her so severely with a pipe that patches of her skin came off, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lim of Woodland Hills was arrested at a supermarket Sunday night after 
he started hitting the woman in front of witnesses, Los Angeles Police Lt. 
George Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several onlookers subdued Lim and held him for police, Rock said. The 
23-year-old woman was taken to a hospital, where it was discovered that she was 
severely bruised from the waist down. 
</P>
<P>
 "The injuries are very serious," Rock said. "Her skin actually was beaten 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Lim was ordered held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the woman accompanied Lim to his apartment in the 5500 block 
of Owensmouth Avenue late last week. 
</P>
<P>
 There, police said, Lim held her against her will and subjected her to 
repeated beatings and sexual attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the woman arrived here from South Korea about a month ago.

VOTE DELAYED ON RESTRUCTURING SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Board of Education members complained Monday that they have not 
been given enough information to make sound decisions about the district's 
massive restructuring plan and postponed a final vote on the issue until May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan by Supt.Sid Thompson calls for the giant district to be transformed 
from a centrally operated bureaucracy into self-governing clusters of high 
schools and their feeder campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 But several board members, who were slated to discuss specific cluster 
configurations Monday, said they do not have a big picture understanding on how 
the plan would unfold -- a concern that is also stirring confusion among many 
parents and schools staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many questions and we are getting piecemeal answers," said 
school board President Leticia Quezada. "In terms of reaching conclusions on 
the overall issues, we don't have enough information." 
</P>
<P>
 School board members ordered Thompson to draft a detailed report clearly 
describing the purpose and role of the cluster configurations and a new parent 
services unit that will be formed. Thompson was also told to figure out how 
much money it would cost to launch the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A full report will be presented to the board on April 18. Final decisions on 
the restructuring will be made on May 2.

MOTHER DEFENDS HER SON; VIOLENCE: SHE SAYS RAYMOND BUTLER, ACCUSED IN THE FATAL 
CARJACKING OF TWO JAPANESE STUDENTS, IS TROUBLED BUT INNOCENT. SHE BELIEVES 
'THE SYSTEM' HAS FAILED HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As he headed for the courtroom last week, Raymond Oscar Butler, who is accused 
of killing two young students from Japan, had only one comment for reporters: 
"Go easy on my parents, all right?" 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, his mother said she was not surprised that her 18-year-old 
son was concerned about his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Butler, 41, described her son as a young man who gladly helps care for 
his brother's infant daughters and said he did not commit the murders, which 
have attracted international attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son is innocent," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said "the system" had failed her son, who she said has suffered from 
suicidal tendencies, alcohol addiction, learning disabilities and asthma. The 
Los Angeles County Probation Department, school officials and medical personnel 
who have dealt with Raymond Butler said they could not comment on his 
background because of confidentiality laws.  
</P>
<P>
 The picture that emerges from his mother's description is that of a nearly 
illiterate family that found tensions in its mixed ethnic identity -- Raymond 
Butler is of white, Mexican and black descent -- and was ill-equipped to deal 
with Raymond's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Butler, who lives in the Rancho San Pedro public housing project, says 
she does not understand all the attention focused on the death of the two 
students. "You don't know how many times there are bullets flying here. I 
raised my kids in it. Nobody is protecting us.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Of course), it's a big thing when (any) child is murdered, but why use my 
son as an example when kids get killed all over?" 
</P>
<P>
 She said her son often baby-sat for the infant daughters of the brother with 
whom he was living in San Pedro, not far from her home. "He would bathe his 
niece and make formula and change diapers," said Butler. "He was better than 
any woman." 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said her son suffered emotional problems. When he was 17, he 
tried to commit suicide by drinking two bottles of liquor, she said. He was 
committed to a psychiatric hospital for 72 hours, and then discharged.  
</P>
<P>
 "I said he needs more than 72 hours. At the hospital I begged them to keep him 
there," Butler said. She does not know why her son tried to commit suicide, 
Butler said. After the incident, she said he did not get psychiatric 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 There appears to be some tension over ethnic identity in the family, neighbors 
said. Raymond Butler's mother is of white and Mexican descent and his father is 
black.  
</P>
<P>
 Donna Butler said she told her son, "I don't want you with black girls. 
They're constantly fighting and having all these babies and I don't like that." 
But Butler insisted, "I'm not prejudiced -- I (was) married to a black man."  
</P>
<P>
 Her son harbored no ill feelings toward Asians, his mother said. "I have never 
heard Raymond say bad things about . . . Japanese or Orientals."  
</P>
<P>
 But Raymond's mixed background caused him problems, she said: "The blacks were 
against him, the Mexicans were against him, the whites were against him."  
</P>
<P>
 Butler said her son suffered from asthma and has had to take steroids and 
other medications since childhood. He sometimes has to use a machine to aid his 
breathing at home as often as four times a day, she said. She added that the 
medications he was taking and food allergies caused behavioral problems as he 
was growing up, as did his inability to play actively with other children. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never had (physical education) in junior high or high school. (He wasn't) 
allowed to ride bikes or skateboards, but he'd sneak off and do it and get 
sick."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Butler said that her son reads at perhaps a sixth-grade level. She and 
her son's father, she said, have only rudimentary reading skills.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler said that because she is unable to read effectively, she feels lost in 
the legal system, as she has in the past in trying to deal with her son's 
health and educational problems. "I don't know how to read or write. I don't 
know where to begin."  
</P>
<P>
 Butler said that although she and Raymond's father, Charles Butler, 61, are 
divorced, he has always been in close contact with his sons. Charles Butler, a 
former security guard, is now on disability. Donna Butler says she does not 
work because of health problems but collects Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her son dropped out of San Pedro High School and later attended 
Angel's Gate continuation school, but later dropped out there, too. After 
serving jail time for burglary, she said, he was not allowed to go back to the 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 Although police say he is a gang member, Donna Butler said he is not. She also 
says that although he pleaded no contest to burglary last year, he was not 
guilty. Butler said that the evening the students were shot, her son dropped by 
her apartment with his sister-in-law and niece and a young female friend.  
</P>
<P>
 From Sunday through Wednesday after the March 25 shooting, he spent much of 
each day at the Kaiser Carson Medical Office Building in a substance abuse 
rehabilitation program, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, when police pulled over her car and arrested her son, Butler 
said she did not know what it was for.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to keep tabs on my child. I wanted to help him," she said. "The 
system didn't work right."

FEDERAL COURT ORDERS RELEASE OF MAN IMPRISONED FOR MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court in San Francisco on Monday ordered the release of a 
Compton man who has been imprisoned for nearly eight years on a second-degree 
murder conviction, saying there are strong signs he is innocent and clear 
evidence that he received incompetent legal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confronted here with that rare case" in which a defendant seeking 
review of a guilty verdict "has demonstrated a substantial possibility of 
actual innocence," the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said in a unanimous 
decision stemming from a 1985 shooting that led to the imprisonment of Sheldon 
Sanders, now 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's decision follows two trials and a lengthy appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders' brother, Xavier, who had a lengthy criminal history, confessed 
immediately after the incident to his mother and a lawyer that he had shot 
Norman Gregory. The attorney advised him not to testify. The first trial ended 
in a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sanders family then hired a new attorney, Philip Jefferson. Sanders' 
mother told him that her other son, Xavier, had confessed to her and was 
willing to talk to Jefferson. But the attorney declined to interview Xavier 
about what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson "evidenced a Gargantuan indifference to the interests of his client 
and clearly prejudiced his client's defense" by failing to investigate or 
introduce evidence on the strongest possible defense -- that someone else 
committed the crime, the decision stated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jefferson also failed to hire a private investigator to interview witnesses 
and gather evidence from the scene; failed to hire a ballistics expert . . . 
and failed to familiarize himself with crime scene photos and other physical 
evidence," the decision said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon Sanders was convicted at the second trial and sentenced to 17 years to 
life in prison. Neither jury was told of Xavier Sander's confession. 
</P>
<P>
 Some time after the second trial, Jefferson was disbarred for a long record of 
"demonstrating complete indifference to his legal and ethical duties to the 
great detriment of his clients," according to a state Bar decision quoted in 
Monday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, a state appeals court upheld the conviction, saying Sanders had 
failed to prove he had been incompetently represented, a decision criticized by 
dissenting Justice Earl Johnson as putting expediency before justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's dissent was "very convincing," according to the 9th Circuit decision 
by appellate Judges Stephen Reinhardt and Thomas G. Nelson and Frank A. 
Kaufman, a Maryland federal trial judge sitting by designation. Their decision 
reverses a ruling by a Los Angeles federal district judge who rejected Sanders' 
federal habeas corpus petition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice Johnson should be commended for his courageous dissent which was a 
precursor to today's ruling," said Santa Monica attorney Rowan K. Klein, who 
prepared the federal appeal for Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled for Sheldon Sanders," Klein said. "A court has finally 
recognized that it is inexcusable for a trial attorney not to pursue a 
confession by a third party, even if the third party is the defendant's 
brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said it could take weeks or months for his client to be released on 
bail, pending a decision by the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
on whether to retry him. He also noted that the district attorney could charge 
Xavier Sanders with the July 11, 1985, murder of Gregory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the second trial, the Sanders family fired Jefferson and retained a 
third attorney, Leslie Abramson, one of the Los Angeles area's most prominent 
criminal lawyers. In a state appeal, Abramson said Jefferson told her he 
"didn't see any reason to get Xavier involved" and felt that he was 
"representing the family." A Los Angeles Superior Court judge spurned that 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein then took over the case. At a later state court hearing, Klein 
introduced Xavier's tape-recorded confession that he shot Gregory. Xavier 
testified that he walked up to the Gregory house with a rifle, but he did not 
admit firing it. 
</P>
<P>
 A state court judge rejected Klein's claim that Sheldon Sanders had been 
incompetently represented by Jefferson. The ruling was upheld by a state 
appeals court, and the California Supreme Court declined to review the case, 
setting the stage for the federal appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the district attorney's office indicated that officials would 
have to review the case before deciding whether to seek a retrial. Joseph P. 
Furman, a deputy California attorney general, said that office was considering 
whether to seek a rehearing of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9th Circuit ruling may affect other defendants, in particular Jesus Avila, 
22, who was convicted of attempted murder and whose case has startling 
parallels to that of the Sanders brothers. "I'm very optimistic about Jesus' 
chances," said Barry Levin, one of his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Sheldon Sanders, Avila was accused of a crime, even though his brother 
admitted that he had committed the offense. The Avila case also raises 
questions about whether he was competently represented. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila's lawyers assert that his case appears to present even more compelling 
arguments for a rehearing because when Xavier Sanders testified in his 
brother's appeal, he invoked the 5th Amendment, declining to give evidence that 
might incriminate himself. By contrast, Jesus Avila's brother, Ernesto, 
testified that he had fired the shots in the incident for which Jesus was 
charged with attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our case is much stronger in that Ernesto came to the hearing and testified," 
Levin said. However, Furman said that there are "some serious differences" 
between the two cases, chief among them the fact that Sanders' attorney, 
Jefferson, had a long history of poorly representing clients. That was not the 
case with Avila.

FREEWAY QUAKE REPAIR TO COST $500 MILLION LESS; RECOVERY: CALTRANS ASKS TO 
SPEND LEFTOVER FEDERAL AID ON BRIDGE STRENGTHENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 State transportation officials Monday lowered -- by about $500 million -- 
their estimate of the cost of rebuilding the Los Angeles area's 
earthquake-damaged freeways and asked federal officials for permission to spend 
$160 million of leftover relief funds on strengthening bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels made the request at a Los Angeles 
hearing while sitting next to Federal Highway Administrator Rodney Slater, 
whose approval is required. Slater agreed to consider the request but noted 
that Congress has already approved "the largest disaster relief package in the 
history of the nation" for California. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing on the earthquake recovery effort, chaired by U.S. Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-Calif.), came as the number of requests for government assistance 
reached 500,411. 
</P>
<P>
 While Caltrans was asking to spend relief funds on retrofitting freeways, 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) grilled state transportation officials 
regarding their use of earthquake aid to send out a brochure that he claimed 
looked "like a reelection piece." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-page brochure features a front-page article describing Caltrans' 
"Herculean effort" to restore Los Angeles' freeway system. Inside are articles 
offering tips on how to avoid traffic delays. Caltrans spent $292,000 of 
federal disaster funds to send out 3 million of the brochures.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is some real good information on one of the four pages," Katz griped. 
"The other three seem to be promoting what a great job Caltrans is doing, what 
a great job the governor is doing. . . . I really wonder if that is the best 
use of the money given the fact we've got bridges we need to retrofit." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom McCarthy, an aide to the Caltrans district director in Los Angeles, said 
the agency has received "nothing but compliments" on the brochure. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the government's response "the largest single disaster relief 
operation in the nation's history," James L. Witt, director of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, said, "We are providing victims and their 
communities with assistance faster than ever before in FEMA's history." 
</P>
<P>
 He said more than than 1,000 inspectors have examined more than 331,000 homes 
for damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans originally put the cost of repairing freeways and establishing 
alternative forms of transportation at about $1 billion. But the revised 
estimate puts the cost at about $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "Caltrans engineers have determined that repairs can be made to several 
damaged bridges and overpasses which were originally slated for full demolition 
and replacement," explained Dean R. Dunphy, California's secretary of business, 
transportation and housing.

RITES FRIDAY FOR JUSTICE HENRY MOORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held Friday for Justice Henry T. Moore Jr., a 
member of the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana who died last week 
after a long battle with leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, 61, was known as a legal scholar who inspired his colleagues and 
friends by continuing to work up until the time of his death.Those who knew 
Moore said he was driven by his love for the law and his special interest in 
child welfare and probate law. 
</P>
<P>
 He is credited with rulings that ensure that children's best interests are 
given primary attention by the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's wife, Lynda, and his three children ask that donations to the cancer 
center and oncology ward at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange be made in lieu of 
flowers, said William R. Ball, staff attorney at the appellate court. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's memorial service will be at 1 p.m. at Pacific View Memorial Park, 
3500 Pacific View Drive, Newport Beach.

COLUMN LEFT/ DONELLA MEADOWS: WE ALREADY NUMBER TOO MANY; EMOTIONAL OR PRUDISH 
PUBLIC RESPONSES ARE IMPEDING URGENTLY NEEDED, FACT-BASED TALK ABOUT CURBING 
GLOBAL POPULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONELLA MEADOWS, Donella H. Meadows is an adjunct professor of environmental 
studies at Dartmouth College. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As nations gear up for a world population conference in Cairo in September, a 
Cornell professor has given them something to talk about. He says that the 
number of human beings, currently 5.6 billion and rising, really should be 
about 2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The professor, David Pimentel, is not a crackpot, and he did not make his 
statement quietly. He put it forth with press-release fanfare at the annual 
meeting of the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science -- the largest, 
most media-attended gathering of U.S. scientists. He backs his claim with a 
number-crunching paper that will appear soon in a journal called Population and 
Environment. Rush Limbaugh has already ridiculed him. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that there should be fewer of us is bound to trigger emotional 
reactions. Before we jump into those reactions, let me summarize what Pimentel 
says. He looks at global endowments of land, water and energy and recognizes 
not only that they are limited and diminishing given the way we are managing 
them, but that they are interdependent. We could cultivate more land but only 
by using more water. We could get energy from the sun, but only by using more 
land. The land could give higher yields, but only with more energy. Because he 
accounts for these interdependences, Pimentel comes up with lower supportable 
population estimates than those who look at one resource at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 At present we need about 100 million more acres of cropland each year just to 
feed that year's additional population. Instead, we degrade and abandon 25 
million acres a year. Assuming we stop abusing land and assuming we want to 
provide a good diet for everyone, it would be possible, says Pimentel, to feed 
a global population of 3 billion. If we also use land to provide renewable 
energy -- as we will have to someday -- and if everyone used roughly half as 
much energy as Americans now do, there would be enough productive land for a 
world population of 1 billion to 2 billion. By this reasoning, the United 
States, with a current population of 260 million, could support about 200 
million sustainably and well. Pimentel is trying to calculate an optimal 
population, not a maximal one. "Does human society want 10 billion to 15 
billion humans living in poverty and malnourishment or 1 billion to 2 billion 
living with abundant resources and a quality environment?" he asks.  
</P>
<P>
 He envisions not a sudden population reduction, but one that happens over a 
century, by greatly reducing birth rates. "Granted, a drastic demographic 
adjustment to 1 billion to 2 billion humans will cause serious social, economic 
and political problems, but to continue rapid population growth to 12 billion 
or more will result in more severe social, economic and political conflicts 
plus catastrophic public health and environmental problems." Pimentel says that 
his proposition has produced virtually no scientific criticism. To the 
contrary, he is receiving letters saying, in effect: "His numbers may not be 
exact, but they're in the right direction. But I wouldn't dare say that in 
public." Why not? Because of the emotional reactions.

 You can't tell me what to do in my bedroom. You can't tell me to give up what 
I have earned, inherited or extracted from the Earth or from other people. The 
whole argument is Malthusian nonsense. With new technology we will make food 
out of air and fuel out of seawater. We can have 40 billion people all living 
like Donald Trump. I refuse to talk about the future until women are 
compensated for the 10,000 years of patriarchal oppression. Or until the poor 
are released from the prison of their poverty. Or until the rich renounce their 
greed and wastefulness. The scientific community quietly approves, but publicly 
ducks, a proposition raised by a responsible scientist in a scientific forum, 
and leaves him to the mercies of a rabble-rousing radio host. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians plan a world population conference that will not ask the most 
obvious question: How many of us can be supported at what standard of living? 
We bury the idea that there may be too many of us because we are afraid to talk 
about it. We would have to talk about sex, sharing, power, greed, freedom and 
responsibility. Though most of us can imagine a tolerant, equitable world with 
fewer people and more resources, though we yearn to live in such a world, or at 
least to prepare it for our children, we will not do the first thing necessary 
to bring it about: talk about it, seriously, with civility and compassion and 
determined fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 David Pimentel has dared to talk about it. He deserves more than silent 
approval and public ridicule. He has served humanity and nature far more by 
raising the tough questions than anyone does by wishing those questions would 
go away.

P-51 MUSTANG KILLS COW, CALF IN CHINO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A World War II plane taking off from Chino Airport on Monday sputtered and 
crashed into a dairy corral, shearing off a row of eucalyptus trees and killing 
a cow and a calf before coming to rest in a heap of manure, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chino Valley Fire Department spokesman said there were no human injuries in 
the crash of the P-51 Mustang other than a minor wound to the pride of the 
pilot, Bob Martin, 50, of Prescott, Ariz., who told paramedics he was "not too 
fond of landing in a pile of (manure)."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A PRUDENT LOOK BEFORE LEAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge made the right call in ordering Santa Ana to supply more details about 
residents who are likely to be displaced by the city's ambitious and often 
delayed plan to widen a long stretch of Bristol Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Robert A. Knox told the city last month that it must 
provide him with the number of people likely to be uprooted and their incomes. 
City officials also must demonstrate that decent housing exists for all those 
displaced before the $355-million project can go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning for the widening of Bristol Street began nearly eight years ago, but 
lawsuits have delayed the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month the city unsuccessfully tried to persuade Knox to give it the 
go-ahead. Officials provided a list of available housing, including some that 
benefits from federal subsidies, and argued that there would be sufficient 
affordable housing available to those displaced. That is a dubious assertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is not noted for its affordable housing. Santa Ana officials 
wisely recognized that several years ago, when they joined forces with 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton to study how to develop single-room-occupancy 
units. That is bare-bones housing, costing from about $200 monthly to more than 
$300, depending on subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 A good plan resulted, but SRO housing has been slow to sprout in Orange 
County. A planned Santa Ana SRO has been delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city argued in this case that there is affordable housing for 
evicted tenants, it has claimed elsewhere that the city has too many 
overcrowded apartments. That is inconsistent. One reason for overcrowding is 
rents so high that residents have to take in roommates to lessen the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's city attorney correctly said the documentation ordered by Knox 
will cost the city time and money. But it can give officials a clear picture of 
the problem of affordable housing in their city. It would be even more 
beneficial if it spurs the city to both hunt down all available government aid 
for new housing and again urge private developers to build more.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: A JAPANESE TELLS WHAT HE LIKES ABOUT U.S.; TRAGEDY: IN 
WAKE OF THE SLAYING OF TWO COLLEGE STUDENTS, AN EXECUTIVE AND LONGTIME RESIDENT 
FOCUSES ON NATION'S DIVERSITY, CREATIVITY, GENEROSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAKASHI (TACHI) KIUCHI, Takashi (Tachi) Kiuchi is the chairman and CEO of 
Mitsubishi Electric America in Orange County. He has recently written a guide 
for Japanese businessmen and their families living in America. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The senseless slaying of two foreign college students is a terrible tragedy. I 
feel extreme sympathy for the families and friends of the young men. But I'm 
also very saddened by the damage done to the image of America in the eyes of my 
countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
 It is interesting that there is no word in Japanese for "carjacking" . . . or 
"drive-by shooting," or "home invasion," These terms do not exist in a 
population marked by homogeneity, courtesy and cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those traits are not necessarily signs of virtue -- but necessity. Imagine, if 
you can, half the population of the U.S., living in an area only the size of 
California. People in that situation must foster and maintain unusually high 
standards of social responsibility. Just so, the Japanese conform and control 
their behavior, generation after generation. And when someone steps out of 
bounds, it is often hidden to protect the social balance. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Japan's attention is drawn so intently to the recent deaths of 
those two young students. The brutal and random nature of the crime is 
inconceivable. But at the same time, it is darkly fascinating to examine and 
ponder. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing this, the Japanese press exploited the story and drove their readers 
to a frenzy. Many are now pointing fingers of blame and questioning the 
morality and safety of American society. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, all this media attention does not cause people to believe that the 
crime was racially motivated. Unfortunately, some of the 200,000-plus Japanese 
citizens living in this country will retreat farther into their enclaves. 
Others who are considering a visit will be more fearful than is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Those overreactions are regrettable, but perhaps the current mood will lead to 
a closer examination of why we are here. If so, I believe people will see 
clearly that there are many more good things than bad about America. 
</P>
<P>
 This is my third time living in the United States, and each was because I 
wanted to come -- risks and all! I've spent a total of 15 years here because I 
appreciate the positive attributes of this country, instead of focusing an the 
negatives. 
</P>
<P>
 When I think of why I love this country so much, I always think of a visit to 
Coney Island in New York when I was a young man. I rode the famous Cyclone 
roller coaster, and the thrill and excitement captured the essence of my new 
home: Unbound freedom, challenges, new experiences. I clearly remember 
thinking, while at the top of the Cyclone, "This is America! Fantastic!" 
</P>
<P>
 I still have those feelings today, but I have also developed a more mature 
assessment of American virtues. 
</P>
<P>
 One I admire most is its cultural diversity. I'm convinced that, of all 
nations, America has the highest level of creativity and drive. This is because 
so many talented people have been attracted here from all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 At one of our research labs we have collected some of the most brilliant minds 
in computer science from places like Hungary, Israel, India, France, China and 
Germany. It's very rewarding for me to see their unique perspectives and 
abilities applied to common goals. 
</P>
<P>
 I also have a great respect for the community spirit of America. And what a 
splendid paradox that is. On one hand, Americans are driven to join 
organizations and give their time and money to many good causes -- while on the 
other, they hold on firmly to their individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, Kyoko, and I are supporters of the Los Angeles Mission where we have 
opportunities to help serve food for the homeless. We are constantly amazed at 
the many interesting people we meet among the poor and unfortunate. No matter 
what their condition, they often reflect a bearing that comes from a secure 
sense of individual freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some abuses, as reflected in the crime statistics, but most 
Americans use their freedom in many charitable ways that reveal an equal sense 
of responsibility. They are the most giving people in the whole world -- and 
Japan has been a big beneficiary of that. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire postwar history of Japan has been shaped by American generosity. 
</P>
<P>
 My first job in the U.S. was in 1959. I was a trainee assigned to 
Westinghouse, and I will never forget how those friends helped our company in 
so many ways. We Japanese would not be anywhere near our current standard of 
living if it were not for American assistance and guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the people of Japan also saw news coverage of the kindness and sincere 
sympathy the people had for the slain students. I hope they saw the tears, the 
many flowers laid at the site of the crime by total strangers. That's the 
America I know. 
</P>
<P>
 Excitement, diversity, freedom, kindness and generosity. Those are some of the 
reasons I have been attracted to America. Those are the kind of things Japanese 
should remember when they consider visiting here. The roller coaster ride is 
not without its potential dangers, but the wonderful experiences and good 
friends you meet far outweigh the risks.

RENEWED SELLING SPREE CLOBBERS BOND MARKET; INTEREST RATES: ANALYSTS WONDER 
WHAT IT WILL TAKE TO LURE BUYERS BACK INTO MARKET, AS SECURITIES CONTINUE TO 
PLUMMET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Another wave of selling swept the bond market Monday, sending long-term yields 
to 15-month highs and raising fears of even higher rates ahead, as the badly 
pummeled market searches desperately for buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds, which had rocketed from 7.08% last 
Thursday to 7.26% on Friday on news of a surge in March employment, zoomed to 
7.40% by Monday's close -- its highest since 7.47% on Jan. 13, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood among bond traders and analysts around the country was one of stunned 
disbelief, as many of them wondered aloud what it would take to lure buyers 
back to fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, many pros fear a new round of selling today, as millions of bond mutual 
fund investors see the biggest one-day losses in years in their fund shares. 
Fund prices Monday reflected not only Monday's trading but also accumulated 
losses from Friday's slump in bond values. Mutual funds did not officially 
trade Friday, even though bonds were traded among some investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the sharpest selloffs I've ever experienced," said Gerald 
Guild, a veteran bond trader at Advest Group in New York, reflecting on the 
market's ongoing massacre. Potential buyers, he said, "have their hands in 
their pockets," and most refuse to step up and bid for bonds of any type. As 
bond prices drop, their yields soar. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three months ago, the T-bond yield was at 6.35%, and most bond traders 
did not expect that yield to hit even 7% until later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rebounding economy and rising inflation fears began to drive yields up 
in January. That turnaround has become violent over the past month, as massive 
numbers of speculators who expected yields to slide in 1994 have attempted to 
sell bonds all at once -- only to find few takers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, some bond traders had hoped that the stock market would plummet 
Monday morning, and that selling stock investors would reinvest in bonds, 
helping to pull yields lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Dow industrial average held its loss to 42.61 points Monday, closing 
at 3,593.35, even as bond yields surged. "A lot of bond managers thought the 
stock market would bail us out, but it didn't happen," said David Rosenberg, 
manager of the Oppenheimer U.S. Government Trust bond fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond traders' gloom was worsened by the market's inability to key off any good 
news. A plunge in most commodities Monday, which should have lessened inflation 
worries and allowed interest rates to fall back, failed to help bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau index of key commodities traded at a two-month 
low of 225.32 before closing off 1.65 points, or 0.7%, at 226.02. 
</P>
<P>
 While gold led commodities' slide, falling $5.50 to $386.30 an ounce, bond 
investors paid more attention to the continuing rebound in crude oil prices. 
Oil futures jumped $1 to a two-month high of $15.79 a barrel on the New York 
Merc. Reports of unrest in Algeria helped spur the gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market also was fixated on an afternoon report from the Center for 
International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University. The Center's 
inflation index rose to 107.1 in March from 106.7 in February, refueling fears 
that prices of goods and services are rising with the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 That report overshadowed the National Assn. of Purchasing Management's monthly 
business survey, which showed that while the economy continued to expand in 
March, its pace cooled somewhat. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond traders say the reluctance of buyers to come forward in part reflects 
uncertainty about the strength of the economy and the potential for higher 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also say that the speed with which interest rates have risen this 
year has surprised so many investors that they are too afraid to take a chance 
and buy bonds -- because the risk appears too great that yields will simply 
continue to rise in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, Wall Street brokerages are increasingly unwilling to buy bonds from 
mutual funds and other sellers, because the brokers have already lost so much 
money on the bonds still in their inventories. 
</P>
<P>
 One fund manager said that in soliciting bond bids from five brokerages 
Monday, two said outright that they wouldn't even name a price for the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 What is unclear now is whether bond mutual funds have adequate cash on hand to 
meet further potential redemptions by conservative shareholders, more of whom 
may decide they are losing too much of their principal as market interest rates 
rise and older fixed-rate bonds plunge in value. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term bond fund shares lost 1.5% to 2.5% of their value Monday. Some of 
the funds have lost as much as 10% since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest concern I have is that (other) funds still don't have enough 
cash" to meet exit requests, said one fund manager. If that's the case, rising 
redemptions could force fund managers to dump more bonds in the market, 
potentially sending interest rates even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point buyers will return to the market, analysts say, but most have 
become unwilling to project how high yields will have to go in the interim. It 
didn't help Monday that well-known Wall Street economist Henry Kaufman 
suggested that bond yields might eventually reach 9% or 10%, though he said 
there would be a rally before that. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. stocks finished broadly lower once again, though up from their worst 
levels of the day, as investors reacted to surging interest rates and to 
growing fears that stocks have entered a bear market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Standard & Poor's 500 index slumped 6.85 points, or 1.5%, to 438.92. The 
Nasdaq composite of mostly smaller stocks tumbled 16.05 points, or 2.2%, to 
727.41. The S&P now is off 8.9% from its peak; the Nasdaq index is off 9.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing issues swamped winners 21 to 4 on the Big Board, on heavy volume of 344 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 * Latin American stocks dove, reflecting Wall Street's woes and rising 
interest rates. In Mexico City, the Bolsa index plummeted 144.89 points, or 6%, 
to 2,265.49. Argentina's market was off 8.4% and Brazil's key index lost 10.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 * MAIN STORY: A1 Big Losses in Bond Funds 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of bond mutual funds posted some of their largest one-day losses in

GRUMMAN STOCKHOLDERS SIT PRETTY AS NORTHROP GETS NEW LEASE ON LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN SLOAN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To understand why Northrop Corp. emerged the "winner" in the battle for 
control of Grumman Corp., you have to understand the difference between wanting 
something and having to have it. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Marietta Corp., the giant defense contractor that has made some recent 
big acquisitions, wanted Grumman. But Northrop, which had missed out on some 
recent big deals, felt that it had to have Grumman. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it got Grumman -- but has to pay almost $300 million more than Martin 
Marietta was willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, of course, the U.S. defense industry is shrinking, as the defense 
budget drops with the end of the Cold War. Martin having made several large 
acquisitions of other defense businesses, is big enough to stay in the game. 
Northrop, by contrast, was at the point where it had to buy something sizable, 
or risk getting gobbled up. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the difference between what Martin was willing to pay and what 
Northrop was really willing to pay is almost shocking. 
</P>
<P>
 The takeover battle began four weeks ago when Martin and Grumman announced 
that Grumman had agreed to Martin's $55 a share, or about $1.87 billion, offer. 
Martin was unwilling to raise its price, even after Northrop surfaced with a 
$60 offer and ultimately prevailed over the weekend with a bid of $62, or about 
$2.1 billion. (That offer isn't to be confused with Northrop's previous $62 
offer, which expired last week.) 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop was willing to pay substantially more than $62 a share. According to 
Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Northrop would have paid $66 for 
Grumman if Martin had bid $64 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to what it's paying Grumman shareholders, Northrop is in effect 
also paying the $50 million "breakup fee" that Grumman has paid Martin for 
canceling the $55-a-share deal. That fee, which Grumman agreed to pay if 
someone topped Martin's offer and bought Grumman, works out to about $1.50 per 
Grumman share. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of the $62 price and the breakup fee mean that Northrop will 
pay $290 million more for Grumman than Martin Marietta was willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 If you do the same exercise with the $66 price that Northrop was willing to 
pay, Northrop's cost (including the fee) would have been $425 million above 
what Martin was willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Northrop nor Martin Marietta would say anything substantive about 
these different valuations on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time that Northrop has broken up a Martin deal, snatching a 
property away. The other time was about two years ago, when Northrop was part 
of a group that broke up a deal that Martin and its partner, Lockheed Corp., 
had made for LTV Aerospace. LTV was in bankruptcy at the time, and Aerospace 
creditors were so upset by Martin's price that they managed to get a bidding 
contest started. Martin was unwilling to raise its bid much, and lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop says its piece of LTV Aerospace has been very profitable, and that 
it's been a terrific deal. Whether Grumman will be a terrific deal remains to 
be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 If Grumman's projections of its future profits are accurate, Northrop will do 
OK, even at a cost of $63.50 a share. But Martin contends those projections are 
too high. Obviously, Northrop's analysis of Grumman's value gives more weight 
to these projections than Martin's does. That's the only way to justify what 
Northrop is paying. 
</P>
<P>
 The real winners of this takeover battle are Grumman's shareholders. A month 
ago, they owned a $40 stock. Now, they've got a $62 cash offer that should be 
completed before the month is out. You can argue that the holders would have 
gotten more than $62 if the Grumman board had bargained better. But considering 
that Martin refused to bid more than $55, Grumman holders should feel lucky to 
get $62. What would Grumman's board have done if Northrop had cut its offer to 
$58? Taken Martin's $55 offer? Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop stockholders have to wonder. Before this deal, Northrop was an 
attractive takeover target. But after buying Grumman for $290 million more than 
the price at which Martin valued Grumman, Northrop will be saddled with a 
fairly heavy debt burden. That makes Northrop a much less appealing takeover 
candidate, despite the wishful Wall Street thinking about Martin taking over 
the Northrop-Grumman combination sometime in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 So Northrop has made the deal it felt it had to have. That was the easy part. 
Now, for the hard part: making the deal work. 
</P>

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: TV COMMERCIAL FEATURING GAY COUPLE CREATES A 
MADISON AVENUE UPROAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A groundbreaking television commercial that depicts two gay men buying 
furniture is stirring passionate reactions from detractors and supporters -- 
and causing the kind of commotion seldom seen on Madison Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, furniture retailer Ikea began airing an ad in several East Coast 
markets that shows two clearly identifiable gay men shopping for a dining room 
table at an Ikea store. It is the first time gays have been openly portrayed in 
a mainstream TV spot. Ikea has since been swamped with hundreds of phone calls 
and letters -- some applauding the company, but many others demanding that the 
ad be axed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the spot -- which has not been broadcast on the West Coast -- won't be 
yanked. "It will continue to air over the next year," said Peter Connolly, 
director of marketing for Ikea's Philadelphia-based East Coast division. A few 
East Coast Ikea stores have been targeted by angry protesters who have jammed 
phone lines since last week. One store in Hicksville, N.Y., was briefly 
evacuated last week after a bomb scare. No bomb was found. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the homosexual relationship between the two men in the Ikea ad, 
who talk about how buying the dining room table together shows their commitment 
to each other. If it becomes clear to other major marketers that Ikea's 
business is not harmed -- and perhaps even helped -- by the ad, it could 
profoundly affect the way major advertisers speak to gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one small step for Madison Avenue, but it is one giant leap for the gay 
community," said Fred Danzig, editor of the trade magazine Advertising Age. 
"There has never been anything like this before." 
</P>
<P>
 Danzig expects that advertisers from airlines to financial services may 
eventually follow Ikea's lead and feature identifiable gays in TV ad campaigns. 
Until now, only a handful of major advertisers have acknowledged the gay 
lifestyle in ads -- but almost exclusively in print campaigns, where the impact 
is usually far more subdued. 
</P>
<P>
 Firms like Benetton, Banana Republic and Calvin Klein have all used gay 
imagery in ads placed in mainstream publications. At the same time, more than a 
dozen major advertisers -- including American Express and Apple Computer -- 
have gay-targeted ads running in popular gay and lesbian publications. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ikea ad depicts "an aspect of gay life that people never see: our daily 
lives," said Ellen Carton, executive director of the New York chapter of the 
Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. Instead of showing gays and 
lesbians marching at gay rights rallies or suffering from AIDS, the Ikea ad 
"humanizes us," she said. "The importance of that cannot be overstated." 
</P>
<P>
 But a storm of protest is rising on the right. "Openly promoting homosexuality 
will upset America's mainstream and cost the company business," said Robert 
Knight, director of cultural studies at the Family Research Council, a 
conservative, Washington-based think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate image experts say that provocative portrayals seen on television 
screens or at the movies can elicit unusually strong reactions from the public 
because these images are so often much larger -- if not more realistic -- than 
on the printed page. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, actor Tom Hanks won the best actor Oscar for his portrayal of an 
AIDS-infected attorney fired from his job in the film "Philadelphia." A recent 
episode of the TV show "Roseanne" drew record ratings when it showed a lesbian 
-- played by Mariel Hemingway -- kissing Roseanne Arnold in a lesbian bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why has the ad industry waited so long?" posed Donny Deutsch, chief executive 
of Deutsch Inc., the New York agency that created the Ikea ad. "It's simple: 
You have a lot of advertisers afraid of backlash." 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisers quietly fear that by trying to appeal to gays and lesbians so 
publicly, they may antagonize their core markets. Even Ikea officials concede 
that the company has no plans to air its latest TV spot on the West Coast until 
the company establishes more of a customer base here. Ikea opened its first 
West Coast store just three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the 1990s emerge as the decade of niche marketing, a growing number of 
advertisers are expected to increasingly target gays, who, most surveys show, 
often enjoy higher disposable household income levels than many other consumer 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Niche marketing is the way of life in America," said Eugene Secunda, 
marketing professor at Adelphi University in Garden City, N.Y. "But a number of 
other gay-oriented ads will soon hit the airwaves, and there may very well be a 
backlash from the gay community itself." Indeed, there are some gays who 
seriously question the motives behind the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It smacks of tokenism," said Jeff Yarbrough, editor-in-chief of the Advocate, 
a national gay and lesbian magazine. "If the intent of the ad has been to 
garner media attention, well, it's done a brilliant job of that. But I wonder, 
what are their real motives? What is Ikea's corporate policy on gays?" 
</P>
<P>
 The company has no detailed corporate policy on gays and lesbians -- nor for 
that matter does it know how many of its customers are gay, said East Coast 
marketing chief Connolly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to promote a certain lifestyle or make a statement," 
Connolly said. "This is just part of our overall strategy to try to speak 
directly to all kinds of customers." Ikea is also airing other spots, including 
one featuring a divorced woman and another with a retired couple. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad with the two gay men "could cost us some customers," Connolly said. 
"But it shows Ikea is for everyone. This will make us a stronger company."

COPING WITH TRAGEDY; DISNEY PRESIDENT'S DEATH LEAVES HUGE VOID AT COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 At 9:30 a.m. on Monday, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner and 
President Frank G. Wells were to have met to formalize Wells' new, seven-year 
contract, which Eisner planned to present to Disney's directors on April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday night, during dinner at his son's home, Eisner got a call from a 
Disney pilot who had overheard emergency radio transmissions. Wells, 62, had 
been killed in a helicopter crash in a remote Nevada canyon while returning 
from a skiing expedition. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing his business partner of 10 years has left Eisner with a huge personal 
and professional void. The two men sat about 15 feet apart from each other at 
work, an arrangement that dated back to their first day on the job in 1984, 
when Eisner insisted that he needed a few feet of space so he could talk 
privately with his wife on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner ran nearly every decision past Wells. When he thought of designing 
Disney's new headquarters building so that the Seven Dwarfs would appear to be 
holding it up, Wells readily agreed to it, knowing, as Eisner did, that the 
1937 film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" once propped up the company 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you work together with somebody 15 feet away for 10 years, you know each 
other well. He was the most incredibly selfless executive without any other 
agenda than what was good for the Disney Company," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, there was no word on Disney's plan for replacing Wells, but the 
Burbank-based company said Eisner, 52, will assume Wells' duties and take on 
his title of president. 
</P>
<P>
 The company added that there will be no change to any previously announced 
plan or project. Eisner indicated that he would work more closely with the 
heads of Disney's units. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts credited Wells with helping to build a deep and talented management 
team. "It was a very rare kind of intelligence that you don't find in many 
companies. . . (but) the Walt Disney Co. has tremendous management depth so 
it's not like they will be in any turmoil," said Harold Vogel, an analyst for 
Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One executive described Wells as "the voice of calm fiscal responsibility 
here," while another called him a unique problem solver who will be difficult 
to replace. Indeed, one of Wells' first tasks was to settle strike at 
Disneyland that began the day after he and Eisner were named to their posts in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner said that even though Wells had the reputation of being involved mostly 
in business affairs, rather than creative ones, his role was much broader than 
people realize. 
</P>
<P>
 It included "expanding the number of motion pictures we made to quality 
architecture, to naming the hockey team the Mighty Ducks," which was another 
Eisner idea that Wells supported. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eisner: "He was a lawyer who wanted to make the deal, not not make the 
deal. He was a closer. He encouraged excellence in whatever he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Other executives cited Wells' intangible contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The long-term impact will be great. He is as much a spiritual part of that 
company as anyone else,' said 20th Century Fox President Bill Mechanic, 
Disney's former president of international theatrical and worldwide video. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood in the hallways at the Walt Disney Co. is "one of unbearable 
sadness," one executive said. Wells' death came less than a month after another 
senior Disney executive, Kevin Hyson, executive vice president of theatrical 
marketing, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
 A tearful David Hoberman, president of the studio's Touchstone and Disney 
Pictures banners, could say only: "As soon as I start talking about Frank, I 
start crying. . . . He was a great man." 
</P>
<P>
 Another top Disney official said: "I'm just numb. . . . It's just very quiet 
here. People are in shock; there's not a lot of noise in the halls." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Vice Chairman Roy E. Disney, who had been friends with Wells since 
their days at Pomona College and helped to push Wells for the Disney post, said 
Wells was "so bright and quick that once in a while he could be difficult to 
talk to, because he was always three steps ahead of you in conversation. By the 
time you got to B he was on to E. He'd get bored. . . . It disconcerted people, 
including me, at times." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Disney said, as serious as he was, Wells also had a terrific 
sense of humor. The last time he saw Wells socially, at a dinner the night 
before Disney's annual board meeting in Florida on Feb. 22, Roy Disney recalled 
that Wells "decided to read a list of the 10 worst possible questions which 
could be read at the meeting ( a la David Letterman). Then he expanded it to 
14. . . . He had a great sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Mechanic said that Wells' calming influence on younger workers will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He continually lectured me to be more gentlemanly and more collegial. He 
thought it was as much a measure of how someone should be judged as their 
actual accomplishments," Mechanic said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Wells was instrumental in the decisions to manage more 
aggressively the considerable Disney assets that many felt were not properly 
exploited -- bolstering the theme park operations and the merchandising of 
Disney characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legacy of Mr. Wells is that he was able to put into place a variety of 
operations systems and a very bottom-line-oriented business ethic, which is 
completely embedded in Disney today. The management teams will continue to 
operate," said analyst Christopher P. Dixon of Paine-Webber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney said funeral arrangements were pending for Wells, who is survived by 
his wife, Luanne, and sons Kevin and Briant. Investigators from the Federal 
Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board were to 
begin an investigation at the crash site, a canyon about 25 miles southeast of 
Elko, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney shares eased 37.5 cents Monday, to $41.625 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, as the overall stock market continued to slide.

</P>
<P>
 The death of Walt Disney Co. President Frank G. Wells marks the end of a 
management partnership that oversaw one of the most successful turnarounds in 
American business history. Wells and Chief Executive Michael D. Eisner took a 
moribund theme park and film studio and transformed it into one of the nation's 
biggest and most profitable corporations -- the envy of boardrooms around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the nearly 10-year stewardship of the Eisner and Wells, Disney has seen 
its revenues soar to $8.5 billion from $1.5 billion and its stock value jump 
1,500%. Revenues at its theme parks tripled, consumer products jumped 13-fold, 
and its film studio increased 15 times. The major highlights of the 
Eisner-Wells management regime include: 
</P>
<P>
 THEME PARK EXPANSION Although usually thought of as an film company, the theme 
parks are in fact the financial engine behind Disney. Revenue totaled $3.4 
billion last year and operating income was $747 million. Euro Disney has been 
buffeted by the cultural resistance and the worldwide recession, but that has 
not stopped Disney from spreading its net further. Next up on the drawing 
boards is an American history theme park in northern Viginia. 
</P>
<P>
 FILM AND TELEVISION While the other Hollywood studios are looking for ways to 
get onto the information superhighway, Disney has remained faithful to the core 
business of producing theatrical films and TV shows. The studio releases more 
than 50 movies annually, and is the second largest supplier of TV programming. 
Revenue totaled $3.7 billion last year and operating income jumped 22% to $622 
million. Under the Eisner-Wells regime, Disney also launched the Disney 
Channel, now the fastest-growing pay cable TV channel in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 CONSUMER PRODUCTS Disney licenses everything, from T-shirts to tableware. The 
Disney Store retail chain has mushroomed from 37 stores in 1989 to 239 in 1993 
while revenues totaled $1.4 billion.

NATIONWIDE TRUCKING STRIKE APPROACHES; NEGOTIATIONS STALLED; LABOR: COMPANIES 
SCRAMBLE FOR REPLACEMENT FREIGHT HAULERS. A TEAMSTERS WALKOUT COULD START AS 
EARLY AS WEDNESDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The growing threat of a nationwide truckers' strike this week found companies 
preparing Monday for a possible disruption in freight shipments as contract 
talks between the Teamsters and trucking firms remained stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 A strike would leave companies with few viable alternatives if the major 
trucking companies were completely shut down, industry observers said. If 
successful, a strike could tie up shipments of a wide range of consumer goods 
to stores, as well as idle some factories with low inventories. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between the Teamsters and Trucking Management Inc., which represents 23 
large trucking firms in labor negotiations, broke down last week after the 
union rejected a proposal that it said would throw members out of work and 
dramatically lower starting pay. No further negotiations have been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The heads of Teamster locals are scheduled to meet today in Washington, D.C., 
to finalize plans for the strike, which union officials said could begin as 
soon as 12:01 a.m. Wednesday if no settlement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a strike and if all 23 (firms) are shut down, there would not be 
enough capacity in the United States to handle that much freight," said Douglas 
Rockell, a trucking industry analyst at Merrill Lynch Research. "It would be 
fairly nasty." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies and consumers depend on firms like CF Motor Freight, Roadway Express 
and Yellow Freight for moving everything from coffee makers to auto parts. The 
23 firms control about half of the country's mid-size shipments, which are 
those between 500 and 10,000 pounds. Most of the firms, however, are not 
involved in perishable food shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 A strike would leave many companies scrambling for space on board the fleets 
of numerous but much smaller non-union carriers. Companies like United Parcel 
Service, which usually handle loads of 500 pounds or less, as well as trucking 
firms that routinely transport more than 10,000 pounds, could also pick up some 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are watching the situation closely," said Rhea Feldman, a spokeswoman for 
Hewlett-Packard, the Palo Alto-based computer maker, which would switch its 
shipments to carriers unaffected by the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Even companies that depend on non-unionized trucking firms are concerned about 
the strike. "We would certainly experience some impact because of the increased 
demand on the carriers we use," said Kathy Blackburn, a spokeswoman for Mervyns 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of a strike comes at a pivotal time for both the unionized trucking 
firms and the Teamsters. The trucking companies say they need more flexibility 
in work rules and pay scales to deal with the growth of lower-cost, non-union 
firms.  
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters say the trucking companies are seeking too drastic concessions 
of their drivers and dockworkers, 91% of whom last month authorized the union 
to call a strike if contract talks failed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the lower starting pay, the union is upset by employer 
proposals to cut full-time jobs by adding lower-paid part-time workers, to ship 
more freight by railroad without safeguarding the jobs of drivers affected by 
the change and to eliminate the union's right to strike over deadlocked 
grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract talks come at a time when the 1.4-million-member Teamsters union 
is crippled by internal warfare, which could complicate its efforts to wage an 
effective strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Carey, voted in as the Teamsters president in 1991 on a pledge to reform 
the corruption-plagued union, increasingly is being challenged by opponents, 
including many tied to the organization's old-guard leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a dues increase pushed by Carey to replenish the union's nearly 
depleted strike fund was rejected, 3 to 1. In February, many Teamsters at 
United Parcel Service defied Carey's call to join a strike against that company 
and reported to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Some key figures in the Teamsters, however, said the rift within the union 
would be bridged in this case by the opposition among the rank-and-file to 
concessions sought by trucking companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been at odds with Carey on a number of issues, but on this issue, I 
agree with him." said Chuck Mack, an official with the Western regional 
conference of the Teamsters. "There are times for politics but not when the 
members' livelihoods, and the security of their families (are at stake), and 
that's what we have now."

MANUFACTURING RISES IN MARCH, BUT WINTER'S TORRID PACE SLOWS; ECONOMY: 
PURCHASING MANAGERS REPORT ORDERS IMPROVED FOLLOWING BAD WEATHER IN EAST AND 
NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 American manufacturing expanded for the seventh straight month in March, 
although the rate of growth slowed from February's levels, according to a 
survey of corporate purchasing managers released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly assessment by the National Assn. of Purchasing Management 
substantiated other evidence that the U.S. economy is strengthening. But it 
indicated that the torrid pace of the winter months has cooled. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said its index of manufacturing activity rose to 56.7% from 56.6% in 
February. A reading above 50% indicates that the manufacturing economy is 
expanding, while a reading below 50 indicates it is shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a very strong month of production in March," said Robert J. Bretz, 
chairman of the association's business community and purchasing director at 
Pitney Bowes Inc. "New (manufacturing) orders continued to expand, but the rate 
of growth seems to be leveling off in new orders and backlog of orders," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasing managers' survey is widely followed because it offers some of 
the freshest information on the economy's health. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said 14 of 20 industries surveyed reported an improvement in March 
as many businesses recovered from the disruptions caused by harsh winter 
weather and the California earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Braverman, chief economist at DKB Securities Corp., said the report was 
"consistent with the view that the economy had picked up and is now showing 
some signs of tiring. It's holding its gains overall, but it doesn't suggest 
any forward momentum, particularly now that we're out of the time zone where we 
can blame bad weather." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices, a key indicator of inflation, continued to rise in March, but at a 
more subdued rate than in February. The association's price index fell to 64.2% 
in March, from 67% in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock and bond prices have fallen sharply the past few months as the Federal 
Reserve has raised short-term interest rates in response to inflation worries 
spurred by a rise in commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rate of growth that we had over the fourth quarter and the first month in 
this quarter just can't be sustained," Bretz said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that as the pace of the recovery slows, a decline in demand for goods 
should ease the upward pressure on prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably should see some increases here or there, but overall we should 
start to see some slowing in price increases." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey indicated that economic growth would continue. New orders to 
manufacturers, a harbinger of future production levels, rose at about the same 
high rate as in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchasing managers report also said: 
</P>
<P>
 * Inventories declined in March to the lowest level since December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * After ending a 57-month slide in February, employment resumed a decline in 
March as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * Production surged higher in March, after falling in February because of 
weather-related problems. 
</P>

 Broker Hit with $300,000 Verdict: A Los Angeles Superior Court jury added a 
$200,000 punitive judgment to $100,000 previously awarded for damages against a 
West Covina insurance broker found to have sold worthless auto policies to City 
Garment Carriers, a small Los Angeles trucking firm. The jury found broker John 
Brittain and his Brittain Co. agency liable for fraud in the 1990 sale to City 
Garment of a policy issued by Southern Continental Insurance Co. Ltd., an 
unlicensed, Caribbean-based insurer that failed and left hundreds of California 
customers in the lurch. Brittain's lawyer called the verdict unfair and said he 
was considering an appeal.

REVCO DRUGSTORES TO DOUBLE IN SIZE BY BUYING HOOK-SUPERX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Revco D.S. Inc. agreed to buy Hook-SupeRx Inc. for $13.75 a share, or about 
$600 million, creating what would be the country's second-largest retail 
drugstore chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase, expected to close in early summer, comes less than two years 
after Revco emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings and ensures the 
company a major position in the rapidly consolidating retail drug industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding the 1,200 stores run by Cincinnati-based Hook-SupeRx would double 
Revco's total to almost 2,400. Geographically, Twinsburg, Ohio-based Revco will 
expand to 22 states from the nine eastern states where it now operates. 
</P>
<P>
 In markets that overlap, the Hook-SupeRx stores will give Revco a broader base 
from which to battle its biggest competitor, Rite-Aid Corp., the largest U.S. 
drug retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good match," said Phil Muldoon, analyst with McDonald & Co. in 
Cleveland. "There's not that much overlap in terms of market." 
</P>
<P>
 The per-share price being paid for Hook-SupeRx is 50% above its closing stock 
price Thursday, and news of the acquisition pushed up the share price almost 
40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hook shares jumped $3.675 to $12.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, Revco's 
shares eased 67.5 cents $15.75. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction is subject to Revco raising as much as $175 million through 
the sale of senior subordinated debentures. 
</P>
<P>
 Revco's planned purchase of Hook-SupeRx is the latest consolidation among 
retail drug chains. Last week, Kmart Corp. completed the sale of its PayLess 
Drug Store chain to TCH Corp., the owner of Thrifty Drug Stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hook-SupeRx transaction will bolster Revco's annual revenue to about $4.7 
billion, more than double the $2.2 billion it reported for the fiscal year 
ended May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, one company that has nearly $5 billion in sales has a lot more 
wherewithal," Muldoon said. Revco said its strategy is both to increase market 
penetration in the nine states where it already operates and to push into new 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hook's, SupeRx and Brooks stores are similar to ours in size, average volume 
and merchandise," said D. Dwayne Hoven, Revco president and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholders who own about 49% of Hook-SupeRx shares outstanding agreed to 
vote in favor of the transaction, which also includes assumption of 
Hook-SupeRx's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment group includes Goldman, Sachs & Co., Kroger Co. and Hook-SupeRx 
management. Hook-SupeRx, formed in 1986, acquired most of Kroger's retail drug 
store business.

 GE Appeals to Kemper Shareholders: General Electric Co.'s finance unit started 
its proxy fight with Kemper Corp., criticizing the company while making a 
$2.1-billion offer for the insurance, asset management and brokerage firm. The 
proxy, filed with the SEC, had been expected since GE Capital Corp. said last 
month it would seek four of the 13 seats on Kemper's board to further its 
effort to gain control of the company by paying $55 a share.GE said it was 
asking shareholders to back its board candidates at Kemper's annual meeting May 
11. The letter to Kemper shareholders said Kemper's stock has "under performed" 
comparable companies, that Kemper's asset management business "lagged the 
industry's growth" and its insurance unit is "hobbled by poor quality" of real 
estate investments and low credit ratings.

GENERAL MILLS WILL CUT PRICES; MARKETING: THE CEREAL MAKER DROPS COUPONS IN 
FAVOR OF REDUCING PRICES ON SOME OF ITS MOST POPULAR BRANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 General Mills said it will reduce prices of some of its top-selling cereal 
brands, including Cheerios and Wheaties, by 30 cents to 70 cents a package, 
deciding it's cheaper to give consumers a lower price directly than through 
coupons and other promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 The cereal price cuts are effective May 2, and General Mills hopes to cut out 
$175 million of promotional costs. Combined with earlier reductions, the new 
discounts reduce prices on brands that account for 46% of the Minneapolis-based 
company's share of the cereal market. "We feel this is a better way of getting 
savings to the consumers," company President Steve Sanger said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The company told analysts it expects the lower cereal prices to reduce fiscal 
fourth quarter earnings by 5 cents to 10 cents a share. The price cuts average 
about 11% for the affected cereals, and come within months of other market 
leaders raising their prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanger said the effect on General Mills' market share should be neutral, but 
he said the company's profitability will rise. "A 50-cent coupon costs General 
Mills 75 cents or more to make. A 50-cent price discount costs 50 cents," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without naming competitors, Sanger criticized the high level of promotions 
and, in particular, the use of coupons, by others in the cereal market. "That 
increase in promotional spending has been so damaging and wasteful," he said. 
"It really isn't producing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 General Mills has a 29% share of the $8.7 billion market, while Kellogg has 
about 44%. General Mills, which has other food lines and also owns restaurant 
chains, had 1993 sales of $8.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Products affected by the announcement today include Cheerios, Honey Nut 
Cheerios, Wheaties, Whole Grain Total, Golden Grahams, Lucky Charms and Trix. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanger said the number of coupons printed each year has risen to 25 billion, 
an increase of 6 billion coupons in the past two years, but consumers aren't 
cashing in any more of them than they did two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 General Mills got a mixed response from analysts about its actions. Some 
worried that Kellogg Co., the market leader, will continue to spend heavily on 
promotions, possibly costing General Mills some of its market share. 
</P>
<P>
 But others like the company's attack on coupons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a lot of sense," said analyst Michael Mauboussin of CS First Boston. 
"They're getting at the inefficiencies of the market."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; EXPERIMENTAL GARDEN BRINGS LIFE TO SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fragile green life that had sprouted through the topsoil during spring 
break was found by students of George Washington Elementary School Monday on a 
small patch of land once used for kick ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more fun," said Ricky Eacret, a fifth-grader who does not miss 
the section of playground asphalt torn up last year. He and other students 
speak proudly of their Environmental Science Park, a project set up by the 
Alliance for Children's Trust Foundation in Toluca Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long term, foundation Executive Director Chris Chesney hopes to 
transplant the pride sown in Burbank to inner-city schools from New York City 
to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that is stopping us is money," said Chesney. The foundation 
developed the project intending to target schools with either a high percentage 
of at-risk children or those affected by noise, air and other pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank garden was tilled from a former river wash whose sand and hard 
soil had been covered with pavement for 50 years. Groundbreaking was last June, 
and it took time, topsoil, compost and elbow grease to turn the land green. The 
vegetables peeping up this week were planted about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind the park is to connect what the students learn in school in 
art, math, music, science, history and geography into the hands-on experience 
of working the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers of the park are planning one section that will be used to grow crops 
on mounds -- instead of in rows -- as Native Americans did, as well as a 
mini-amphitheater where guest lectures can be held. 
</P>
<P>
 A project demonstrating the uses of solar energy is also planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Atkins, a fifth-grader who helped water the vegetable patch on Monday, 
said she had been worried about the plants during the spring break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was wondering if they would survive," Atkins said. But the garlic, 
cucumber, lettuce, spinach and radishes in the bed were flourishing. Another 
section planted with herbs had not done as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like sunflowers," said Christine Firkins, another student, adding that 
she enjoyed the single, potted sunflower growing in the middle of one patch. 
</P>
<P>
 Chesney said that students often run up to her as she crosses the playground 
to the park, asking if they can help. Special classes are held in the garden 
twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really are proud of this," Chesney said. "They all want to help, and it 
seems like they all know what do to." ED BOND

<P>
 A North Hollywood man convicted of repeatedly raping a woman while he was on 
parole in another sex case was sentenced Monday to 78 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Vernon Jones, 27, was convicted of 12 felony counts in the Sept. 11 
assault of a 23-year-old woman near Magnolia and Cahuenga boulevards in North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jones confronted the woman, who was walking alone to a store to purchase 
cigarettes just after midnight, she attempted to defend herself with a rock, 
according to testimony at the trial. But Jones disarmed her and used the rock 
to beat her. The woman testified that Jones also choked her. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the course of the next four hours, he terrorized her," Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Kathleen M. Cady wrote in a sentencing memorandum. "He raped her at least 
three times and sodomized her at least three times." 
</P>
<P>
 In sentencing Jones, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Sandy Kriegler said he used 
"a high degree of cruelty." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was on parole after being convicted in 1988 of assault with the intent 
to commit rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was arrested four days after the attack, when the victim saw him walking 
down a street. -- THOM MROZEK

 Newcomer Arthur Kay has the largest campaign fund of the eight candidates for 
San Fernando City Council, reporting $36,720 in contributions received, 
according to the most recent financial disclosure statements for the upcoming 
April 12 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay's fund -- $34,000 of which comes from his own law firm -- amounts to about 
$6 for every registered voter in the city. 
</P>

 Incumbent Doude Wysbeek has the second largest war chest, with $22,899, and 
newcomer Raul Godinez had the third largest campaign fund, with $9,024. Dan

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: CITY MAY CHANGE SEISMIC STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled today to consider altering seismic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure requires chimneys damaged in the Northridge earthquake to be fully 
rebuilt instead of patched.For example, if a portion of the top of a chimney 
fell off, the owner must rebuild the entire top portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners are not required to rebuild the entire chimney unless most of it fell 
down or there was damage to the interior portion, where fires are built. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is difficult to construct a chimney to withstand more violent 
earthquakes, it is possible to build one to minimize damage that occurs in a 
temblor, said Kerry Murford, assistant director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would also require residents to obtain permits from the city to 
rebuild walls more than four feet high. Current building code requires a permit 
for walls six feet high and taller. JENNIFER OLDHAM

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; DANCERS BEHIND STREET STYLES IN THE 
SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Creators of the body moves that spawned break-dancing and influenced such 
superstars as Michael Jackson gathered in Woodland Hills on Monday to film a 
documentary on the evolution of street dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Legends of the 1970s underground dance scene -- such as Don Campbell, who is 
credited by many with developing the move known as "locking" -- sat in front of 
a video camera to talk about how they were hitting the dance floor with 
innovative steps long before the 1983 movie "Flashdance." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Guzman-Sanchez, a member of the recording group Rhythm Tribe and a 
dancer himself from Reseda, said he wrote the one-hour documentary "to fill in 
that missing puzzle piece in pop culture" between 1970 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman-Sanchez said he hopes that the film, titled "The Master Underground 
Dancers of the Forgotten Era: Documentary of a Hard-Core Lifestyle" will air on 
public television. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Solomon, whose dance moniker was Poppin' Pete, said during the taping 
session that he appeared in Michael Jackson's video "Beat It" and even taught 
the superstar a few steps. 
</P>
<P>
 The man at the beginning of street dancing's evolutionary chain, some say, is 
Campbell, a shy, 43-year-old former high school track athlete who started 
dancing just for fun, moving with his buddies to music from a jukebox at Los 
Angeles Trade Technical College. 
</P>
<P>
 In clumsy attempts to move to the "Funky Chicken" in the early 1970s, Campbell 
would point to people laughing at him, slip and pretend nothing happened, and 
freeze his arms into what became known as a "lock." Soon, he was dancing on the 
television program "Soul Train." 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman-Sanchez, 35, said he was inspired to imitate Campbell after seeing the 
older dancer on television. The teen-age Guzman-Sanchez and his friends 
followed Campbell's steps and expanded on them by freezing the arms into a 
"break" and moving the body in a constant flow. 
</P>
<P>
 New York kids added gymnastic steps and head spins to the dance moves, which 
later became known as break-dancing and was popularized in movies and videos 
during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 That mainstreaming, Sanchez said, hurt street dancing more than it helped. "It 
reduced it to a novelty where every little kid had a Nike suit on and a piece 
of cardboard in the front lawn." VIVIEN LOU CHEN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DISTRICT TO STUDY SCHOOL'S BIG SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Intrigued by news that the San Fernando Valley's first charter school will end 
the year with a projected $1.2-million surplus, Los Angeles Unified School 
District officials said Monday they will send two auditors to the Pacoima 
school to see just how the feat was accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the district's budget office are reviewing the Vaughn Next 
Century Learning Center's budget today to determine whether the cash-strapped 
district can benefit from any of the cost-saving measures used by the 
1,150-student school. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that can be replicated, hallelujah," said district Supt. Sidney A. 
Thompson. "We need to see how she got there and what she did to get there -- 
$1.2 million is a lot of money."  
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1992 state Charter Schools Act, up to 10 schools in any district and 
100 in the state can achieve charter status. The schools continue to receive 
public funds, but are free from state laws and regulations on how to use the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn -- considered the most financially daring of 33 operating charter 
schools in the state -- took charge of its budget matters when it opened as a 
charter school last July, including hiring and paying its own teachers and 
buying its own liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn Principal Yvonne Chan said the school saved about one-fourth of its 
$4.5-million budget this year by cutting administrative costs and raising 
student and teacher attendance rates, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said she hopes the district will use Vaughn's experience as proof of the 
power of local decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they can learn is what it really costs to properly run a school -- that 
there's hope for us," she said. "And that we have the resources to turn things 
around." SUSAN BYRNES

<P>
 The junior auxiliary of the Assistance League of Fullerton will hold its 15th 
annual "Taste of the Town" fund-raiser Sunday at the Brea Mall to raise money 
for needy children who cannot afford dental care. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will take place from 7 to 10 p.m. More than 800 people are expected 
to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 local restaurants, including Ye Olde Wood Ship of Fullerton, Bella 
Caffe of Brea and Portofino's of La Habra, will provide samples of their 
specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is $40, which covers "all the food, beer and wine you can consume," 
event officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the event will benefit the Junior Auxiliary Dental Health 
Program, which pays for dental treatment for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was started in 1970, and more than 100 children received free 
dental services through the junior auxiliary last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The event's dress code will be cocktail attire. 
</P>

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: EXPRESS BUS STOP IS MADE PERMANENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Commuter Express bus service between the new Sylmar/San Fernando Metrolink 
station and Los Angeles International Airport and El Segundo will be offered on 
a permanent basis, according to Los Angeles Department of Transportation 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter Express Route 574, which had been running from Mission Hills to El 
Segundo since 1990, was extended to Sylmar on an emergency basis following the 
Northridge earthquake.It is being continued permanently because there is a 
sizable demand for the stop, according to department spokesman Philip Aker. 
</P>
<P>
 "People said that the Metrolink station was the perfect place for a bus stop," 
Aker said. "We're taking advantage of a multi-link station." 
</P>
<P>
 Buses, which carry the logo LADOT, leave the Sylmar/San Fernando station at 
12219 N. 1st St. every half-hour from 5:20 to 7:10 a.m., and return every 
half-hour from 3:30 to 6 p.m. Fares are $2.30 each way. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel time from Sylmar to El Segundo on the commuter buses is about 90 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to linking northeast San Fernando Valley residents with LAX/El 
Segundo, Route 574 allows people to transfer in Encino and connect with similar 
routes serving the Valley, such as Commuter Express 573, which provides service 
to Westwood/Century City or Commuter Express 549, which serves the Burbank 
Media District, Glendale and Pasadena. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SKIT GETS MESSAGE ACROSS TO STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA ANN WILLIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Breathalyzer says you have a blood alcohol level of .02," the deputy 
sheriff said to a high school student he'd pulled over for erratic driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't the legal limit .08?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You obviously aren't aware of the new law." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the student, he was performing a skit for 500 of his peers at 
Calabasas High School. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of students re-enacted a scene of drinking, driving and being pulled 
over by police in a schoolwide assembly to teach them about new 1994 traffic 
laws for minors. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called zero tolerance law, which went into effect in January, prohibits 
minors from driving with any alcohol in their systems. Under the law, anyone 
under 21 caught driving after drinking will have his license suspended for a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The re-enactments went over well with the students, who said they preferred 
learning from their peers rather than being lectured to by adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made it fun," said Mike Straney, freshman class president. "They used 
people we relate to and not just adults that would tell us, 'You do this 
because we're telling you to.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Several students said the skits reinforced their beliefs about the dangers of 
drinking and driving. Wendi Zevin, 16, learned of the law last month when she 
received information about it along with her license in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like Jason Honigberg, a senior, said he was unaware of the law until 
he saw the skit. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies from the Lost Hills Juvenile Intervention Team answered questions 
after the role playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students seemed surprised to learn that they are bound by the same laws 
if they drive while under the influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The students erupted into applause when one questioned the officers on the 
efficacy of breaking up parties and sending home kids who had been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we break up a party, we're not telling you to get in your cars and drive 
away," Rohrbach said. "There are other ways to get yourselves home." TERESA ANN 
WILLIS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; NATURAL-GAS STATION MAY BE OPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Las Virgenes Municipal Water District may open one of the few filling 
stations for natural-gas vehicles as part of its plan to expand its fleet of 
clean-burning cars and vans. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the question of whether to become a full public outlet is still up 
for discussion, the district already uses its natural-gas compressor at near 
capacity, to power its two vans and a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 The utility is considering joining forces with Southern California Gas Co. to 
buy a larger compressor, said gas company spokesman Wayne Tanaka. Southern 
California Gas now operates the only public filling station in Van Nuys for the 
small but growing number of natural-gas vehicles in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we need a bigger unit," said Roger Huff, water distribution 
superintendent at Las Virgenes. "But we're not sure how big we want to go. We 
are budgeting each year to get as many natural-gas vehicles as is feasible." 
</P>
<P>
 Like electric cars, vehicles that run on natural gas cannot travel as far as 
traditional gasoline-powered ones because natural gas requires more storage 
capacity than liquid fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 But natural gas burns about 90% cleaner than gasoline, resulting in less smog 
and better-maintained engines. Otherwise, natural-gas and gasoline motors are 
quite similar, Tanaka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural-gas vehicles also are cheaper and have more power than those powered 
by electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Those factors, as well as news that Las Virgenes may buy a larger compressor, 
helped sway officials at the city of Calabasas to reconsider the planned 
purchase of an electric car in favor of a natural gas one. Their recommendation 
will be considered by the City Council Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the council will go for the natural-gas idea," said City Manager 
Charles Cate. "The state of the art is changing so rapidly with electric 
vehicles that I'm not sure we want to get into that right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cate said the city may opt for a natural-gas pickup or van, which would cost 
between $15,000 and $23,000. KURT PITZER

BERNARDI'S CONDITION IMPROVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHAU LAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi's condition was upgraded 
from serious to satisfactory Monday after he collapsed during Easter services, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ailing 82-year-old musician-turned-politician remained at Holy Cross 
Medical Center in Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "His condition has improved," said a hospital spokeswoman. She said the former 
councilman, who represented the east San Fernando Valley, and his family 
requested that no additional information be released. 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Francis Weber of San Fernando Mission, where Bernardi attended Easter 
services, said he visited him Sunday night. "He was very upbeat," Weber said. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Bernardi was admitted to a Panorama City hospital for treatment 
of an illness, which friends and former colleagues said then was an unspecified 
prostate problem. While he was in the hospital, Bernardi suffered a heart 
attack and was treated in the cardiac-care unit. 
</P>
<P>
 In earlier interviews with The Times, former colleagues and friends said 
Bernardi appeared sickly since October, when his wife of 60 years, Lucille, 
died after a bout with Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi, the longest-serving council member, has been the city's fiercest 
opponent of community redevelopment programs, which he views as wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Redevelopment Agency in February paid $5,000 in fees to give 
Bernardi a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, according to a CRA spokeswoman, 
even though it was the kind of project Bernardi had persistently opposed. (In 
the 1930s, he played the alto saxophone for such Big Band leaders as Benny 
Goodman, Tommy Dorsey and Bob Crosby before turning to politics.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi was elected to the City Council in 1960 and retired last June.

PIERCE STUDENT FACES RAPE, BEATING CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER and KAY HWANGBO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Pierce College student faces rape charges for allegedly holding 
his ex-girlfriend against her will for three days, raping her repeatedly and 
beating her so severely with a pipe that patches of her skin came off, 
authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lim of Woodland Hills was arrested about 8 p.m. Sunday night near a 
Vons market at Ventura and Topanga Canyon boulevards, after he allegedly 
started hitting the woman in front of witnesses, according to Lt. George Rock 
of the Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Several onlookers subdued Lim and held him for police officers, who arrested 
him on suspicion of felony spousal beating and rape, Rock said. The 23-year-old 
woman, who was not married to Lim but had lived briefly with him at his Warner 
Center Apartments unit, told police she had moved out because of physical 
abuse, Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
 When authorities took the woman to a local hospital so she could be examined, 
they said, they found that she was severely bruised from the waist down, and 
that she had been beaten by something resembling a metal pipe so harshly that 
muscle tissue was visible in many places. 
</P>
<P>
 "One veteran sergeant at the scene said it was the most severe beating he had 
witnessed in 20 years of police work," Rock said. "The injuries are very 
serious. Her skin actually was beaten off by whatever object she was beaten 
with. You are talking about raw skin tissue." 
</P>
<P>
 Because detectives believed Lim's parents to be wealthy enough to post 
significant bail, they took the unusual step of asking a judge to deny him bail 
pending a hearing. The judge agreed, and Lim was ordered held pending 
arraignment, scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we know is that we were informed that the suspect comes from a wealthy, 
influential family," Rock said. "Because of that we asked for a bail deviation, 
due to the severity and multitude of the crimes, and the apparent ability of 
the family to bail the suspect out." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the woman had been living apart from Lim but had accompanied 
him back to the apartment in the 5500 block of Owensmouth Avenue late last 
week. There, police said, Lim held her against her will and subjected her to 
repeated beatings and rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the woman arrived from Korea a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities refused to disclose at which hospital the woman was being treated, 
but said she was undergoing treatment for severe bruising. Detective Harry 
Hollywood, who is investigating the case, said the woman was bruised from her 
waistline to her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "He held her for three days, during which time the suspect beat her with a 
metal pipe and sexually assaulted her," Hollywood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are continuing to investigate the case, and may ask that 
additional charges be filed against Lim, Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lim had been living at the apartment complex since August, according to 
assistant manager Sandy Gay. She said Lim had been renting a one-bedroom unit 
at $825 a month, and was a "good resident" who never caused problems other than 
paying rent 20 days late on one occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Lim was a Pierce College student and that his lease was co-signed by 
his father, Robert Y. Lim, who identified himself as a contracting specialist 
for the U. S. Army, stationed in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody's reported any unusual goings-on here," Gay said. "If it was something 
violent, it would be easy to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of Lim's also said he was surprised by the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a nice guy. I'm kind of surprised," said Sung J. Lim, 18, a Tarzana 
resident who said he attended classes with Lim. The two are not related. 
</P>
<P>
 Sung Lim said he used to get together with Lim about twice a week but that he 
had not seen him for the past month or two. The friend said that Lim, who 
drives a Mitsubishi sports car, enjoyed participating in sports, working out in 
the apartment gym and relaxing with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seriously don't think he was the type with a temper at all," Sung Lim said. 
"He was the quiet type."

GEM DEALERS FEUD IN COURT OVER ALLEGED RUBY THEFT; TRIAL: THE FOUR MEN ACCUSED 
SAY THE DISPUTE IS A MISUNDERSTANDING. COMPLEX CASE OFFERS INSIGHT INTO HOW 
BUSINESS IS DONE AT THE JEWELRY MART.

<P>
 A trial pitting Los Angeles jewelry dealers against each other began Monday, 
with one side claiming a rare Burmese ruby was stolen and the other arguing the 
whole thing is a misunderstanding that should not have landed in criminal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prosecutors, when four men accused in the theft of the 6.76-carat 
gemstone conspired to receive stolen property, they also violated the system of 
trust that drives the Downtown jewelry mart. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was breakdown of trust caused by these defendants," said Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Eduards Abele. 
</P>
<P>
 That charge is laughable, the defense attorneys say. They portray their 
clients as law-abiding businessmen who have succeeded in a work environment 
where a person's word alone is enough to seal a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors hearing the trial in Van Nuys Superior Court will be asked to determine 
if one man stole the ruby, which is worth as much as $1 million, and if three 
others played a role in keeping the stolen stone out of the hands of the 
rightful owner. 
</P>
<P>
 The four men -- Ali Reza Paravar, 42, of Woodland Hills; Antranik Harbouian, 
46, of Montebello; Behzad Saba, 33, of Irvine, and Rasekh Uddin Siddiqui, 51, 
of Chatsworth -- face between three and five years in state prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The strange and complicated tale began Sept. 12, 1990, when jewelry salesman 
Peter Morlock gave the pinky fingertip-sized ruby to Ron Levi on consignment. 
The written agreement they used to document the deal, the kind of documentation 
that everyone involved agrees is standard in the jewelry business, gave Levi 
two days to either return the stone or pay Morlock $527,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Morlock, representing his father's Germany-based jewelry firm, 
attempted to retrieve the ruby, Levi said he had given it to Paravar. When 
Paravar refused to return the gemstone, Morlock cried foul and complained to 
the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators did nothing at the time, said Paravar's attorney, Jerry Kaplan, 
who attributes the lack of action to an debt Levi allegedly still owed Paravar 
and two business associates. Paravar simply was holding the stone as collateral 
for the $400,000 debt, Kaplan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how the system works," Kaplan said outside court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 To prove that is how the Downtown jewelry mart operates, Kaplan said he plans 
to bring other jewelers into the courtroom to explain the consignment system 
and to tell the jury that Morlock had himself, on several occasions, kept 
consignment merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, attorneys for three of the defendants said that Levi owed a 
number of dealers money. Kaplan produced a Los Angeles Police Department report 
to document Levi's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Aug. 3, 1993, report by Detective Michael Woodings, 
investigations by the LAPD and the FBI "revealed that Ron Levi had been 
involved in numerous such thefts of consigned gems and was prosecuted 
federally." Kaplan said Levi had previously been charged but is now at large. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan also said Monday that soon after the stone disappeared, Morlock did 
meet with Paravar but that he did not have the money to pay for the ruby. He 
said police refused to file charges at the time, saying the dispute was a civil 
rather than a criminal matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbouian, Saba and Siddiqui are accused of receiving stolen property. During 
his opening statement to the six men and six women jurors, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Abele said that the trio had arranged a meeting between Morlock and Paravar, in 
which the original owner was to pay $360,000 to get the ruby back. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim actually negotiated to buy back his own ruby," Abele said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morlock had no intention of paying for his own property, and the July 16, 
1993, meeting turned out to be a sting operation in which police helicopters 
and nearly two dozen law-enforcement officials swooped in to arrest the four 
men. 
</P>
<P>
 Summing up the drama of the scene for jurors, Abele said: "Defendant Paravar 
is caught red-handed with the same ruby that was stolen three years earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Morlock's company currently is trying to sell the ruby, which it co-owns with 
the insurance firm Lloyd's of London, which paid out $250,000 for the loss of 
the stone before its recovery. The stone is now being held in Germany, by 
Morlock's father's company. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Victor Salerno, who represents Harbouian and was the only 
defense counsel to make an opening statement Monday, described prosecutors' 
statements as mere "insinuations." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting to what is sure to be the central issue of the case, Salerno said the 
question is not whether the four men were involved with the ruby, but whether a 
theft occurred.

4 PLEAD GUILTY TO MAKING FALSE FEMA CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first fraud convictions related to the hundreds of millions of dollars 
being doled out for earthquake relief, four people have agreed to plead guilty 
to falsely claiming to have lived in the Northridge apartment building in which 
16 people died, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 All sought aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency by telephoning an 
assistance line and giving their address as the Northridge Meadows apartment 
building on Reseda Boulevard, where the stunning failure of the first floor 
caused the greatest concentration of casualties from the Jan. 17 earthquake, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleading guilty in U.S. District Court to a single count of making a false 
claim to a government agency were Daniel Richards, 42, of Hollywood; Denise 
Jones, 35, of Carson, and Miguel Cordero, 34, of Van Nuys. Mary Mitchell, 27, 
of Paramount has agreed to enter a guilty plea on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The four cases represent the first fraud prosecutions arising out of the 
half-million applications for assistance related to the quake, but officials 
said that as many as 10 additional arrests are expected later this week or 
early next week by a multi-agency anti-fraud task force. FEMA has sent out 
checks for more than $600 million to cover temporary housing costs and minor 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the prosecutions, U.S. Atty. Nora M. Manella urged anyone who has 
filed false aid claims to "take stock of their situation and consider 
withdrawing their claims or returning the money they have improperly received." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the quake, FEMA sent checks for as much as $3,400 to people in 
heavily damaged areas of the city prior to sending inspectors to verify the 
damage. Some of those checks have been returned but others received by people 
who were not eligible have yet to be recovered, the U.S. Attorney's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA spokesman Phil Cogan said some fraud occurs in every disaster and that 
the agency tries, through computer checks and inspections, to pursue those who 
should not have received money. "Generally, it's a very small percentage and . 
. . most of the assistance goes to people who need it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials got a lucky break that led to the first four arrests when an 
alert mail carrier noticed that checks were arriving addressed to people with 
unfamiliar names. He contacted his supervisor and the anti-fraud task force 
became involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Cordero claimed in his FEMA application that he lived in the 
apartment where mechanic Pil Soon Lee and his 14-year-old son were crushed to 
death. Richards said he lived in an apartment where a 52-year-old man died. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordero, Jones and Mitchell each received $2,300 checks. Richards did not 
receive money but repeated the claim that he had lived at Northridge Meadows 
when contacted by investigating agents posing as relief workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Federal Public Defender Anthony Eaglin, who represented Cordero, 
confirmed that his client had pleaded guilty but declined further comment. 
Cordero, who remains jailed in lieu of $15,000 bail, will be sentenced May 16 
by U.S. District Judge Harry Hupp. Richards, who is in custody, is to be 
sentenced May 2. Sentencing for Jones, who is free on bond, is set for June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Each faces a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment, a $250,000 fine and 
three years probation.

SUPERMARKET ROBBER CONVICTED OF MURDER IN VAN NUYS CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pacoima man found guilty of participating in eight supermarket robberies was 
also convicted Monday of murder in the death of a soft drink salesman who was 
gunned down during a holdup. 
</P>
<P>
 A Van Nuys Superior Court jury convicted Jose Santillan, 20, in the murder of 
Robert Ward Jr., even though prosecutors conceded Santillan was not the gunman. 
The man who actually pulled the trigger and another accomplice are still wanted 
by authorities, who say the suspects have probably fled to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel on Friday convicted Santillan on 17 counts of robbery. When one juror 
was excused last week, the new panel reconvened Monday to convict Santillan on 
the murder and three additional robbery charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Santillan was convicted in Ward's slaying under California's "felony murder 
rule," a law which makes participants in a felony -- in Santillan's case, it 
was a robbery -- liable for the murder of anyone who dies during the commission 
of that crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a perfect example of why we have the felony murder rule," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels. "When you go into a supermarket to do an armed 
robbery, chances are someone's going to get killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Santillan faces a mandatory prison term of 25 years to life for Ward's murder 
when he is sentenced April 21. Additionally, Judge Sandy Kriegler can add up to 
40 years for the robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward was talking on the phone with his fiance -- apparently unaware that a 
robbery was underway -- when a gunman walked up to him and pulled the trigger. 
The slaying occurred during an early morning robbery Oct. 19, 1992, at the 
Ralph's supermarket at Sherman Way and Woodman Avenue in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Santillan was found guilty of participating in eight robberies at seven 
stores. The Ralphs where Ward was gunned down was robbed twice in a two-week 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no physical evidence to link Santillan to any of the robberies, but 
during the trial two people who were in the store when Ward was killed 
positively identified Santillan as one of the two robbers. Another witness said 
he saw Santillan in the parking lot moments after the shooting.

VALLEY INTERVIEW: LEE LOOKING FORWARD TO CHALLENGES AS PIERCE COLLEGE PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 13 years as president of Valley College in Van Nuys, Mary Lee recently 
was named acting president of Pierce College in Woodland Hills effective 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lee replaces Pierce President Lowell Erickson, who is taking a one-year 
leave of absence before perhaps returning to teaching, she will inherit a 
campus facing an estimated $1.5-million budget deficit this year and declining 
enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, 55, a Chatsworth resident who gained a reputation at Valley College as an 
efficient and hard-charging administrator, hopes to bring those qualities to 
bear at Pierce. Both colleges are in the nine-campus Los Angeles Community 
College District. Lee was interviewed by staff writer John Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You've been president at Valley College for 13 years. Your new job 
at Pierce College will last at least two years, but with no guarantee you will 
be able to stay beyond that. Why accept that kind of change?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There are several reasons. First, I enjoy a good challenge. Pierce is 
$1.5 million in deficit for this year. They are currently fourth in enrollment 
of the nine colleges. The development of the campus, not in a building sense, 
has such potential to be a unique place for the community to visit. The people 
at Pierce are doing an outstanding job in their particular areas. What Pierce 
needs is for all of their talents to be packaged and sold to the community. 
That hasn't been done. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What kind of approach will you bring to Pierce and what can people expect 
from you.  
</P>
<P>
 A. I will talk with people. I will listen. But I also will expect that 
whatever group talks with me will have its homework done. First I'm working on 
enrollment and the budget deficit. I appreciate people who are not yes people, 
because if I have a person who always says yes to me, then one of us doesn't 
need to be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Shortly after the announcement you were moving to Pierce, you went there 
and spent about two hours walking around the campus. In terms of potential for 
the institution, what did you see?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I saw greater potential for utilizing the college for the community. For 
example, walking through the orange groves, the blossoms were out and it was 
absolutely beautiful. To put a jogging track around the horticultural area 
would be wonderful. I would like to see the chain-link fence that circles the 
campus and makes it look very unwelcome disappear and have a 50-foot setback 
with trees and plantings like industry does so when you drive by Pierce 
College, you are attracted to the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. For a college president, you have been involved in some rather unusual 
activities. You went to truck driving school and got a commercial license and 
you're going to law school now. What drives someone who's already a college 
president to do those kinds of things?  
</P>
<P>
 A. First of all, you have to have outside activities in order to keep your 
mind clear to do your work. If anyone lives a job 24 hours a day, that person 
is going to burn out. I have always been interested in doing things I didn't 
know about. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. You've worked in the district in various capacities since 1977. What kind 
of places were community colleges then?  
</P>
<P>
 A. In the late 1970s, community colleges had it made. There were no budget 
problems. The budget was increased relatively 10% every year. There were no 
problems with how many people you hired. Enrollments were high. Students were 
coming to the colleges, so there was no need to recruit. They could offer 
anything they wanted to, and the budget was there from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Proposition 13 came in 1978. The whole political scene changed from a 
local-tax-based system to more of a state system. As the budgets declined and 
students disappeared, community colleges had to realize that they had to 
recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So how different, better or worse, is today's environment than when you 
came into the system?  
</P>
<P>
 A. When community colleges were being created in this state, the programs were 
new. Every program had new equipment; the faculty were new, and it was a great 
time. Now you have the same faculty close to retirement, and there is very 
little money for equipment replacement or new equipment. To create a new 
program, it is very difficult because the cost is so high for equipment and 
(because of) the difficulty of finding trained personnel. So I think program 
renewal is one of the greatest difficulties we have today. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. There have been indications in recent days that the state's economy is 
beginning to turn around. Yet the budget process in Sacramento is focusing on 
non-higher education things such as prison construction. How are community 
colleges likely to fare financially over the next three to five years?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I think the budget will continue to be tight for community colleges. The 
funds for community colleges are not going to catch up in a hurry. And in order 
to convince the Legislature and the governor that community colleges need those 
funds, community colleges are going to have to make sure that students are 
reaching their educational objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Traditionally, community colleges have had a number of designated roles: 
transferring students to four-year universities, vocational education and basic 
skills instruction. Are there likely to be any structural changes in that 
approach in the coming years?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Until the state's master plan is changed, transfer education and 
occupational education remain the primary missions of the community colleges. 
Continuing education, counseling, English as a second language and basic skills 
-- those are also missions, but not the primary missions. One of the 
misconceptions about community colleges is that they are two-year transfer 
institutions. Many students come to the community colleges assuming that's what 
they want to do. But they really end up doing something else. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. There is a lot of discussion about programs and classes being offered that 
are obsolete by subject or have equipment and facilities that are obsolete. Yet 
the district meanwhile is not able to offer enough basic math, English and 
other core classes. Is that a problem at Valley and at Pierce, throughout the 
district, or even on a broader basis?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I believe it's a problem probably in almost any community college, some 
more and some less. We have programs that have very low average class sizes; 
the instructors are close to retirement; the equipment is outdated, and the 
students who are in the program are there not to reach an educational objective 
but for their own interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Community colleges can't afford that kind of program any more. We need to 
offer programs that are beneficial to business and industry that allow students 
to get the skills to go out into the workplace today, and at the same time give 
them the basic skills in math and English. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So what does that say about the future of traditional vocational education 
offerings in the community college setting?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I believe traditional vocational offerings will eventually disappear. 
Community colleges will need to work more closely with business and industry, 
use the equipment in business and industry and relate more to on-the-job 
training for the student in conjunction with the more academic courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Can you outline your plans for what needs to happen with the agriculture 
operation and the farm at Pierce College?  
</P>
<P>
 A. The farm is a unique asset that Pierce College has. It's underutilized. The 
farm used to attract 6,000 elementary school children per year. That's 
recruitment for future students. Many people come onto the farm. However, those 
people really are not given any information on Pierce College and why Pierce 
College is there. It's not enough to get people onto the campus for a swap meet 
or any other kind of activity without giving people brochures and information 
about the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Could you see a day when the farm and the agricultural program would cease 
to exist?  
</P>
<P>
 A. I would not like to see it cease to exist. And while I'm president, I will 
do what I can to make sure the farm is utilized for instructional programs and 
for the community, and as a recruitment device.

WOMAN TESTIFIES AGAINST MAN CHARGED IN MULTIPLE RAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A North Hollywood woman testified Monday that she was repeatedly raped in her 
apartment by a man she saw the next day when he was arrested for sexually 
assaulting a woman who lived next door. 
</P>
<P>
 From a witness stand in Van Nuys Superior Court, the woman, now 44, identified 
Scott Daniel Artamenko as her assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial began Monday for Artamenko, 24, who is charged with 19 counts stemming 
from June 30 and July 1 attacks on two women in the adjoining apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 If Artamenko is convicted, he could be sentenced to more than 100 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The first victim testified that she was startled awake at 3 a.m. by a man who 
had climbed atop her and then proceeded to rape her. The man escaped after 
telling the woman that he had been watching her and knew she had a boyfriend. 
She reported the rape to police. 
</P>
<P>
 On the following night, the first victim was again awakened, this time by 
"blood-curdling screams . . . like she had never heard before," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Steven J. Ipsen, the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 She immediately called police, who banged on the door where the screams were 
heard, Ipsen said in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring the knocks and the second victim's claim that her boyfriend had 
arrived, Artamenko continued to rape the woman, according to the prosecutor. 
The 30-year-old woman was able to free herself and run out of her apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Artamenko was arrested after a brief struggle with officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the second woman's apartment, investigators found pants that they 
believe were worn by the rapist. Inside a pocket was a set of keys stolen from 
the first woman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Artamenko also told the second woman that he had been watching her and knew 
when she came and went from her apartment, Ipsen said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; POLICE SAY MAN POINTED GUN AT OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles police officer shot at but missed a man the officer said pointed 
a gun at him at an apartment complex in North Hollywood, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 9:15 p.m. Sunday when officers arrived at the 
complex in the 11900 block of Valerio Street in response to a complaint that 
two groups of men living there were fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Campirano, 20, ran and appeared to point a gun at Officer Luis Torres, 
who was chasing him, said Sgt. Robert Ontiveros of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's North Hollywood Division. Torres fired one shot from his 
9-millimeter pistol at Campirano but missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Campirano was arrested half a block away by other officers. Police said they 
retraced his path but could not find the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Campirano was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon against a 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested were Cory Webb, 26, on suspicion of shooting at Campirano, and 
Roger Coleman, 23, on suspicion of being a convicted felon in possession of a 
firearm, Ontiveros said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FBI ARRESTS MAN AFTER ALLEGED THREAT TO BOMB 
AIR FORCE BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 FBI agents arrested a 60-year-old man who allegedly telephoned the U. S. 
Military Academy at West Point, N.Y., to say he planned to place a bomb at 
Edwards Air Force Base, federal officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 After security guards were alerted by the call, they stopped Glen Harmon Baker 
of Tehachapi, when he tried to drive onto the base on March 27 with a liquid he 
claimed was nitroglycerin, said Gary G. Auer, an FBI supervisor. Air Force 
explosives experts later determined that the liquid was harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents took Baker to the Antelope Valley Medical Center in Lancaster for a 
mental evaluation, Auer said. Agents arrested Baker at the hospital Friday on a 
warrant charging him with using interstate telephone lines to threaten someone 
with injury. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing in Los Angeles before U. S. Magistrate Judge Elgin Edwards, Baker 
pleaded not guilty and agreed to have his case transferred to a Fresno federal 
court. That court has jurisdiction over Tehachapi, where the threatening phone 
call allegedly originated. 
</P>
<P>
 The extortion charge stems from a call Baker allegedly made to the military 
academy. During the call, he identified himself and said he was taking a bomb 
to Edwards to harm a base security guard, whom he also identified by name, Auer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators determined that a security guard with that name worked at the 
base, and base police were alerted. Baker was stopped at an entrance to 
Edwards, and inside his vehicle security officers found a loaded ammunition 
magazine for an M-16 rifle, but no rifle, Auer said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also found several bottles of a clear liquid that Baker said was 
nitroglycerin. Auer said it was uncertain why Baker sought to harm a base 
security officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker was awaiting transfer to a federal detention center in Fresno, where the 
U. S. Attorney's office is expected to seek an indictment within 10 days. If 
convicted, he faces up to five years in federal prison and a $1,000 fine, Auer 
said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BUSINESSMAN'S OPERATIONS PLACED IN 
RECEIVERSHIP; COURTS: MONTHLY PAYMENTS WERE ALLEGEDLY DEMANDED FROM UNWITTING 
INVESTORS AFTER A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER WAS ISSUED. 
</P>

<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge Monday placed in receivership the 
operations of a Westside businessman who allegedly had continued to collect 
$50,000 each month from unwitting investors who bought Antelope Valley property 
that was virtually worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Redman and nine co-defendants -- all named in a civil suit filed Jan. 
31 that seeks at least $3.5 million in victim restitution -- have continued to 
demand monthly payments from at least 227 alleged victims. They allegedly did 
that even after Judge Robert O'Brien issued a temporary restraining order to 
halt operations, according to a statement issued by the Los Angeles city 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the judge signed a preliminary injunction to replace the temporary 
restraining order, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, O'Brien appointed receiver Donald W. Henry to oversee the 
defendant's business affairs. Henry will be responsible for protecting the 
defendant's assets, and identifying monies that may have been illegally spent 
by one of three companies that Redman owned, the release said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office had requested receivership in late February after 
discovering that the money collections were continuing and that the defendants 
had spent $3 million from the allegedly illegal sale of more than 400 parcels 
of land in the Antelope Valley. City Atty. James Hahn referred to Redman's 
operation as a "classic Western land swindle." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hahn's office, Redman, 65, of Beverly Hills, and his associates 
used ads that ran on Spanish-language TV to prey on "a population that was 
vulnerable, people who don't speak English." 
</P>
<P>
 Redman and his associates operated offices in the 11400 block of Santa Monica 
Boulevard under the names Marshall Redman & Associates, Redman Investment Co., 
and Del Sol Properties Inc. Prosecutors allege that those companies preyed on 
mostly Latino investors who thought that they were purchasing developed land 
parcels in northern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the properties they purchased are worthless desert land in areas 
where zoning laws prohibit development. In some cases, the parcels turned out 
to be located in Kern and San Bernardino counties, and in other instances, the 
same parcels were sold to more than one investor, the release said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PUENTE HILLS LANDFILL 
WINS ITS COURT FIGHT TO KEEP OPERATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending uncertainty over the fate of the Puente Hills Landfill, a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge has reaffirmed a decision to let it continue accepting 
trash until environmental lawsuits brought by its opponents are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent ruling by Judge Diane L. Wayne allows the Sanitation Districts of 
Los Angeles County to continue operations at the county's second-biggest 
landfill and represents a setback for opponents -- a homeowners group, a local 
school district and developer R. R. & C. Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, Judge Wayne does not want to shut this landfill down . . . so we're 
filing a writ of appeal," said Jeffrey D. Dintzer, an attorney for the Hacienda 
Heights Home Improvement Assn. and Hacienda La Puente Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents had hoped Wayne would close the landfill at least temporarily after 
ruling in February that the permit issued by the County Board of Supervisors in 
August, 1993, was invalid.  
</P>
<P>
 Wayne, however, agreed with Sanitation Districts officials that shutting down 
Puente Hills would cause a major disruption to refuse collection countywide and 
could leave trash in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dintzer said there is plenty of excess landfill space in the county to 
accommodate the trash normally taken to Puente Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's ruling surprised some who thought her previous decisions pointed to 
the certain closure of the landfill, situated at the junction of the San 
Gabriel River (605) and Pomona (60) freeways. The site takes in more than 
12,000 tons of trash daily from 60 cities in the San Gabriel Valley and the 
southeastern portion of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the judge ruled that an environmental study on expanding the 
landfill was inadequate. Specifically, she questioned its analysis of the 
effects on ground-water quality as well as the lack of detail provided on a 
proposed recycling and waste-by-rail facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Wayne invalidated the permit for the landfill because of the 
inadequacy of the environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation officials want to expand the landfill to within 1,750 feet of homes 
to extend its life to 2003. But Wayne's latest ruling allows dumping only in 
the existing landfill and not in the proposed expansion area that has been 
challenged. As such, the existing landfill will reach capacity next year, 
according to sanitation officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill can stay open while the facility's operators correct inadequacies 
with extra studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The districts made a move toward doing that last month when its board approved 
new detailed reports on ground-water effects and decided to separate the 
recycling and waste-by-rail project from the landfill expansion in order to 
reduce delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation Districts officials said Wayne would have to approve the division 
and review the studies before they ask county supervisors for a new permit as 
early as May. RICHARD WINTON

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; LESSONS ON AIDS GET GOOD MARKS; EDUCATION: 
PROGRAM WAS ONCE THOUGHT TOO GRAPHIC FOR ELEMENTARY CHILDREN, BUT SURVEY OF 
PARENTS SHOWS MOST APPROVE OF MATERIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A controversial AIDS education program presented to groups of parents and 
their children in March by the Sulphur Springs School District satisfied most 
participants despite earlier fears that it was too graphic for children, 
according to a survey released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the 71 residents who completed the survey said the program didn't 
provide an opportunity to talk more about AIDS with their children in the 
future, and only three residents felt the material was inappropriate for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program should be mandatory for all kids in the school," wrote one 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appreciate your willingness to address a very difficult (and) demanding 
subject," wrote another parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees are expected to review the surveys at their regular meeting Wednesday 
night and decide whether to offer the voluntary instruction in future years. 
</P>
<P>
 Information was presented in three meetings, with parents attending alongside 
their children and the AIDS information modified for each grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 A registered nurse, a college health science professor, a local AIDS expert 
and an assistant superintendent conducted the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest turnout was for the kindergarten-through-second-grade session, 
with about 125 people attending. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 people attended the sessions for third- and fourth-graders and fifth- 
and sixth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Two AIDS presentations in January prefaced the program and featured more 
explicit information for parents only. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal was to get parents to talk to their children about these things," 
said Marc Winger, assistant superintendent of instructional services. 
</P>
<P>
 At the March meetings, the youngest children were told about the importance of 
good health and hygiene habits, asked if they had heard about AIDS and 
reassured they couldn't catch the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message they heard was they couldn't get it; it's not something a small 
kid can get," Winger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children in the third and fourth grades learned that AIDS was an attack on the 
immune system and involved bodily fluids. Those in fifth and sixth grades were 
told about transmission of the disease, without specific examples, and that the 
only definite method of prevention is abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no talk of condoms or other ways to safeguard against the disease 
while participating in high-risk behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are sixth-graders. They shouldn't be messing around with drugs or sex," 
said Winger. "Abstinence is the only message we want them to get out of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite overall satisfaction with the program, a few parents were concerned 
about telling the youngest group they couldn't catch AIDS. Others disagreed 
whether too much or too little information was presented. 
</P>
<P>
 "The content might not (have) needed to be in such detail at this age level," 
said a parent at the third- and fourth-grade session. "Some of the parents' 
questions should have been at the parent-only meeting."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WATER CO. HEARING TO BE TELEVISED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A March 23 public hearing on the proposed sale of the Santa Clarita Water Co. 
to the Castaic Lake Water Agency will be televised this month so that residents 
can hear from both supporters and detractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Castaic Lake Water Agency and officials from the city of Santa Clarita 
have both voiced interest in buying the local water company.Officials from the 
Santa Clarita Water Co. have said they favor being purchased by the Castaic 
water agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between the water agency and water company, which serves nearly 20,000 
of the 50,000 water connections in the valley, are ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Castaic agency wants to buy the company, in part to settle a 1991 lawsuit 
over the allocation of state water and to move forward with a water management 
plan for the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager George Caravalho, however, contends a possible conflict of 
interest may exist if a wholesale water supplier such as Castaic becomes a 
water retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which included presentations by officials and supporters and 
opponents, will air on public access channel 27 in Valencia and channel 16 in 
Canyon Country on April 13 and 15 at 7:30 p.m., and April 19 and 22 at 8 p.m.

PERSONAL HEALTH; MEASURING OUT A CUPPA CAFFEINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN O. RYAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guess which hot beverage contains the most caffeine per serving: 
</P>
<P>
 A. Cappuccino 
</P>
<P>
 B. Espresso 
</P>
<P>
 C. Brewed coffee 
</P>
<P>
 D. Tea 
</P>
<P>
 E. Hot chocolate 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise! The amount of caffeine in espresso and cappuccino is about the same 
-- if not less -- than in a regularly brewed cup of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Mayo Clinic Health Letter, espresso and cappuccino are 
usually made from arabica beans, as opposed to the robusta beans common in 
regularly brewed coffee. This means the stronger coffee taste does not signify 
more caffeine. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how the choices stack up in milligrams of caffeine based on a normal 
restaurant serving: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cappuccino (five-ounce serving): 90-120 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
 * Espresso (two-ounce serving): 90-120 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brewed coffee (five-ounce serving): 90-140 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brewed tea (five-ounce serving): 35-50 milligrams. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hot chocolate (five-ounce serving): 1-2 milligrams. KATHLEEN O. RYAN

 A SEINE EXISTENCE; LIFESTYLES: ABANDONING HIS APARTMENT FOR A BOAT GAVE MORT 
ROSENBLUM A FRESH VIEW OF PARIS -- AND SERVED AS FODDER FOR HIS NEW BOOK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mort Rosenblum emerged from the hold of his bateau on a fine spring morning, 
wiping grease from his hands and taking in the mesmerizing view of the Eiffel 
Tower. 
</P>
<P>
 He stood on the deck barefoot, hair askew, dressed in a T-shirt and ripped, 
paint-splotched jeans. A fine picture, indeed, for the boatloads of tourists 
passing every few minutes, producing swells on the Seine that gently rocked 
Rosenblum's home. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're like an orangutan in a zoo here," he says later, with a shrug. "After 
a while, you don't even see the tourists." 
</P>
<P>
 Right in the heart of one of the most beautiful cities in the world, just 
steps from the Grand Palais and the Place de la Concorde, this 50-year-old 
American has discovered a tranquil paradise aboard a 54-foot boat docked on the 
bank of the Seine. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a whole different Paris," says Rosenblum, a Tucson-born journalist 
and Paris resident for 17 years. "Every minute, it's different -- from the rosy 
dawn, when all I can hear are the ducks quacking, to sunset, when the pastel 
colors of Paris appear. It's like having a country place." 
</P>
<P>
 This onetime landlubber's love affair with the Seine is the subject of "The 
Secret Life of the Seine," a sentimental portrait of France's most important 
river and of the people -- such as Rosenblum -- who live on it and beside it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secret Life" is a departure for the author, an Associated Press special 
correspondent whose seven previous books have concerned rather weightier 
subjects, from African economic development to the French abortion pill to the 
quality of foreign news reporting. But this time he's pushing into territory 
that is closer to, well, home. And, he says, "this is the first time I've had 
this much fun writing a book." 
</P>
<P>
 This book, like most of his others, was written on the boat he fondly and 
respectfully calls La Vieille , the Old Lady. To be more specific, it was 
written below deck, in the rocking main cabin that shines with his latest coat 
of varnish. 
</P>
<P>
 Sipping coffee on Rosenblum's deck, looking up at the Eiffel Tower and the 
golden statues atop the Alexander III bridge, watching the dark waters of the 
Seine race past, it's hard not to fall head over heels for the lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, at the axis of a metropolitan area of 8 million people, is a Paris few 
Parisians could imagine, an intoxicating combination of breathtaking beauty and 
solitude. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a habitation fantasy that "is a long way downstream from shabby," as 
Doonesbury creator Garry Trudeau observes on the book jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 When Rosenblum moved onto the boat in 1987, after 10 years of Parisian 
apartment life, he discovered "a whole different Paris," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as if I'd never seen Paris before. I had no clue. You can walk by this 
three times a day and not begin to imagine how lovely it is. Here is a Paris 
where you actually like Parisians." 
</P>
<P>
 Therein lies a problem, though. Another habitation fantasy book, Peter Mayle's 
wildly successful "A Year in Provence," sent hordes of tourists into that 
bucolic region of France, ruining the very serenity the book promised. It is 
said that Mayle's book, his sequel and a British television program based on 
them have been so successful that the author is no longer welcome in some 
quarters in Provence. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar thoughts occurred to Rosenblum's neighbors when he told them that he 
was writing a book. "Be sure to tell them about floods and leaks," he was urged 
by one neighbor, identified only as Philippe in the book. (One has to walk 
across Philippe's boat to get to Rosenblum's.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Boat people are not wildly hospitable," Rosenblum admits. Like those animals 
in the zoo, they know they are on display, he says, "but it is unhealthy to get 
too close." 
</P>
<P>
 Just to be safe, Rosenblum identifies his boat in the book only by its La 
Vieille nickname, rather than by the legal name printed on the boat's bow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighbors would probably sink my boat if my book brought a bunch of 
people here," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, people who live on the Seine belong to a small fraternity with a 
limited membership. Only about 50 boats are licensed to be moored in 
Rosenblum's neck of the Seine, and there isn't room for more. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, as Rosenblum's neighbor suggested, life on the river has its ups and 
downs. When the river floods, as it did during Christmas last year, boat 
dwellers put on waders, hoist briefcases above their heads and walk carefully 
through the racing current to a rowboat, which they then must take to get home. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface, this life looks great, I know," says Rosenblum, who shares 
the boat with a companion, Jeannette, to whom he has dedicated the book. "A 
romantic, carefree existence. And in a lot of ways it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you also can be sipping wine on the deck and all of a sudden hear a crash 
because a log has run into your boat. And then you spend the next two hours on 
your belly with a flashlight, trying to dislodge the log." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Seine may be, as Rosenblum says, "a separate arrondissement of the 
spirit," it also is, again in his words, "a time-eating lesson in uniqueness." 
</P>
<P>
 La Vieille began its life on water at the turn of the century, as an admiral's 
craft in the British Royal Navy. The boat, which has three small rooms plus a 
tiny kitchen and bath, is powered by engines similar to those that propel 
London's taxis. As with all aging boats, leaks and repair work are constants. 
And it can be hugely expensive if one is careless or even just unlucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the life is often privileged, boat dwellers pay for it," Rosenblum says. 
</P>
<P>
 Boat dwellers do stick together, even if they aren't exactly friends. 
Rosenblum remembers how he arrived home after particularly heavy rains one 
evening to find several neighbors, total strangers, standing hip-deep in the 
rushing Seine, gripping the lines of La Vieille. They had been there for three 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had it not been for them, my boat would have been toothpicks," Rosenblum 
says. "You're like blood brothers here. It's something from the caveman age. 
You depend on each other for survival." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he bought his boat, Rosenblum considered himself a "desert person," 
with few handyman skills. Now he loves the water and owns a closetful of power 
tools that he knows how to use. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the corny part," he says, "but you get in touch with the real world 
here. Weather reports mean something to me now. A rain might mean I won't be 
able to get to my boat. And a stiff wind might mean my deck chairs are going to 
blow off. You get to know water up close." 
</P>
<P>
 The freedom of a boat dweller's life may be the most intoxicating part of all. 
"In 10 minutes," he said the other day, leaning on the teak wheel, "I could 
untie the moorings, and we go all the way to the Black Sea. All I've got to do 
is turn on the engine. That you can't do in an apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 Like any good seaman, Rosenblum has fallen in love with the 15-foot deep river 
on which his home floats. He knows its boats and many of its captains. For his 
book, he traced the river's ancient history and tracked the river itself, 
beginning with its first clear trickle near Dijon to the point, 482 miles 
later, where it disgorges into the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two millennia ago, the Seine was like chicken soup," he says. "Anything that 
was wrong with you, you drank water from the Seine to cure it." 
</P>
<P>
 That certainly has changed. The level of bacteria in the Seine is 100 times 
higher than the European safety standard, and it contains 57 varieties of 
dangerous pollutants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you fall in, you might dissolve," Rosenblum says, only half-joking. He had 
a cat that took a dive one night and recovered only after a two-week regimen of 
antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ecological health of the Seine is the last thing on a boat dweller's 
mind when the tour vessels have called it a day and the Eiffel Tower's lights 
are doused. All that's left then are the whispers of the river water and the 
people who live on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "On summer nights here," Rosenblum says dreamily, "sometimes you just forget 
to go to bed."

 In another watercolor, a brooding chef Claude Sigal scatters chives over a 
plate of pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sigal was at the Picnic, but I think he's moved," Kachigian says. "He made a 
great lobster ravioli." 
</P>
<P>
 Kachigian, 33, speaks with the earnest intensity of a man hoping to make a 
match on "Love Connection." His dark brows bounce with excitement as he 
provides a running commentary about the chefs he has painted after trips into 
the kitchens of some of Southern California's most exclusive restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming court artist to restaurant royalty was not quite what Kachigian had 
in mind when he graduated from San Diego State University in 1983 with a degree 
in economics and took a job as a stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) being a stockbroker just wasn't fun," he says. "It just wasn't exciting 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The more unhappy he became, the more he started sketching. He had picked up 
the knack as a kid but never pursued it. And he kept listening to an inner 
voice that told him artists never succeed -- at least not while they're alive. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1991, Kachigian's job had become unbearable; his marriage was 
disintegrating, and he turned to a counselor for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when it all came out," he says. "I always wanted to be an artist, so 
I'm doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kachigian exited the marriage, quit the brokerage firm and took a job as a 
pharmaceutical salesman to support himself while learning his new trade. He 
took art classes but found the exercises boring, he says: 
</P>
<P>
 "I became frustrated with painting bones and things that were basically dead. 
So one day I came home and I opened up Julia Child's cookbook, and I decided to 
paint her with some of her food." 
</P>
<P>
 He turned next to an illustrated restaurant guide, looking for interesting 
faces and fascinating menu items. But the posed photos were just not exciting 
enough. He began taking his own camera into kitchens, trying to capture the 
controlled chaos that swirled about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredible to see the energy in the kitchen of a hot restaurant," he 
says. "That's the energy I wanted to capture in them at work." 
</P>
<P>
 After a few stabs at merely copying the photos, Kachigian veered in the 
direction of the Impressionists, becoming less concerned with accuracy than 
mood. Some of his portraits take on psychedelic tones: blond hair becomes a 
flaming red; black eyeglass frames emerge in neon green. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a cartoon quality to them," Kachigian says, "but to me, that's just 
more expressive, it's more fun." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he doesn't know how critics will respond to his unorthodox style, but 
says he's heartened by the reactions of those he has painted: "The chefs I've 
done just love the idea. I'm beginning to feel a real kinship with these guys. 
I think of them as artists, too." 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing each piece, Kachigian takes it to Joan Kleihauer, his former 
teacher at Barnsdall Art Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he first came here, he didn't even know how to use water colors," 
Kleihauer says, "but he listens and he grows. I think he's working at a 
professional level right now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In three years, Kachigian has accumulated 18 portraits and is angling for a 
charity art show. He thinks he's found a potential sponsor -- restaurant 
supplier S.E. Rykoff & Co. -- after carting one painting down to its corporate 
offices a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The work features Campanile chef Mark Peel with several Rykoff spice 
containers in the crook of his arm. A company spokesman says they are "in 
discussions" about the idea, but there are no firm plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Kachigian says he's had several offers from his subjects to purchase the 
paintings, but he's intent on keeping the portraits together, at least until 
they can be shown as a group. After that, he's planning a series on African 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 But not quite yet. 
</P>
<P>
 As his portfolio grows, Kachigian finds himself invited into more and more 
kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 And he admits that he's not above accepting free samples: "It's been just 
amazing food. Sometimes I think the picture turns out better when I get a free 
meal." 
</P>
<P>
 The chefs don't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his stuff is great," says Lisa Stalvey, chef at the trendy Bambu 
restaurant in Malibu. "When he first approached me about (a portrait), he 
showed me some of the others he's done. I know these guys and he really 
captured their personalities very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Kachigian considers the portrait of Stalvey, crumbling butter into a sauce 
pan, a favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is hot , she has a neat place," he says. "She fed me a very nice Chilean 
sea bass with sesame seeds."

DOCTORS' DILEMMA; PHYSICIANS ATTENDING EXECUTIONS? INCREASINGLY, MANY ARE 
WRESTLING WITH THEIR CONSCIENCES -- AND SAYING NO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it was over, the convicted murderer lay lifeless, an intravenous line 
still plugged into his vein. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes after William Andrews succumbed to the poisonous concoction 
injected into his arm, Dr. Robert Jones performed a task from which, he said, 
he would never quite recover: He entered the chamber of death, checked the 
condemned man's vital signs and confirmed that he was, in fact, dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical director for the Utah State Prison system did not witness the 
July, 1992, execution. But his limited role so troubled him that he decided 
never again to have anything to do with a state-ordered killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was much more stressful, much more disconcerting than I thought it would 
be," Jones says. "I literally slept for a whole day afterward, and I thought, 
'That's an experience in life that you don't want to have to go through again.' 
. . . Physicians usually try to preserve life, not end it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a prison doctor, Jones sits at the uncomfortable intersection of medicine 
and criminal justice. His dilemma highlights an ethical debate that is raging 
in the medical community: Should doctors, who take the Hippocratic oath not to 
harm their patients, take part in carrying out the death penalty? When state 
laws and regulations require physicians to be present at executions -- as in 
California, where doctors watch the heart monitor that charts the prisoner's 
final moments in the gas chamber -- should the physician comply? 
</P>
<P>
 Long a controversial subject, this issue has attracted renewed attention since 
1990, when Illinois lawmakers voted to protect the privacy of three physicians 
who assisted in the lethal injection of an inmate by starting an intravenous 
line. Now, an unlikely alliance of physicians groups and death-penalty foes is 
pressing state legislators across the country to eliminate laws that call upon 
doctors to participate in executions. 
</P>
<P>
 Four groups -- the American College of Physicians, Physicians for Human 
Rights, Human Rights Watch and the National Coalition to Abolish the Death 
Penalty -- made the recommendation recently in the report "Breach of Trust." 
Their nationwide survey found that, despite an ethics ban by the American 
Medical Assn., doctors play a variety of roles in executions -- including 
acting as witnesses and rendering advice to executioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet some prison officials, so accustomed to having doctors on hand, say the 
aid of physicians is a must. Says Don Lindsey, a spokesman at the California 
State Prison at San Quentin where there have been two executions in the past 
two years: "How can you certify that it's all over if the doctor is not there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Many medical ethicists, as well as the AMA, have concluded that doctors should 
have no role in executions other than to arrive afterward to certify that an 
inmate is dead. (The AMA shies away from the word pronouncing , which implies 
that the physician is standing by waiting for the inmate to die.) But others, 
including Jones, the Utah physician, say that even certifying death can pose a 
quandary. They would prefer that the body be taken to a morgue, where a coroner 
could make the certification. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, what if the inmate isn't dead when the doctor comes in, as was 
the case in Alabama in 1989, when convicted rapist and murderer Horace Franklin 
Dunkins was discovered still breathing in the electric chair? Doctors had to 
tell the executioner that the job wasn't done. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is deeply problematic," says Gregg Bloche, a doctor and lawyer who 
teaches medical ethics at Georgetown University. "If the doctor comes out and 
says, 'No, the person is not dead,' then the executioner administers another 
jolt and finishes the killing. I think that puts the doctor very close to the 
killing itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, doctors became involved in executions to ensure that the 
procedures were humane. During the French Revolution, for instance, Dr. Joseph 
Guillotin promoted the neck-severing device that now bears his name because he 
believed that it was less painful than other methods. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, many states have passed laws requiring the presence of 
doctors, theorizing that with dispassionate medical experts on hand, condemned 
prisoners would not suffer unnecessarily. Of the 36 states that have 
death-penalty statutes, 28 require physicians to be present. Five more have 
laws saying doctors may be present. (The issue is not as pressing in the 
federal prison system. Although federal law permits executions, the last one 
was in 1963.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are an estimated 1,500 doctors working in state prisons nationwide, 
according to the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, but this 
debate does not apply to them alone. Because many prison doctors refuse to 
become involved in executions, some states have been forced to contract with 
outside doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But what constitutes involvement? 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, administering lethal drugs or flipping the switch on an electric 
chair is involvement -- and is prohibited by the AMA. Also prohibited are 
starting IV lines or inspecting veins to prepare for lethal injection; reading 
a heart monitor or tracking vital signs during an execution; attending as a 
physician witness, and rendering technical advice to executioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors who engage in such activities risk sanction from state licensing 
boards, although experts know of no one who has been so disciplined. The 
"Breach of Trust" report urges state boards to take strong action against 
doctors who violate the ethics ban; because of this threat, the identity of 
doctors present at executions is often a closely held secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at this as a bedrock ethical issue for physicians," says Dr. M. Roy 
Schwarz, senior vice president of the AMA, "and we don't think there is any 
compromise on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, the issues are complex. For instance, despite the AMA policy 
regarding heart monitors, Schwarz says, "that's kind of a gray zone." 
</P>
<P>
 The role of psychiatrists is also controversial and has not been addressed by 
the AMA. At issue is whether it is acceptable for forensic psychiatrists to 
determine if an inmate is mentally competent to be executed. And if the inmate 
is not competent, should the psychiatrist prescribe drugs to make him so? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For doctors who must choose between state laws and personal ethics, the 
decision can be agonizing. Dr. Dan Cashman is one who knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Cashman was the chief medical examiner at San Quentin during the much 
publicized April, 1992, execution of convicted murderer Robert Alton Harris. He 
refused to become involved. Instead, two unnamed prison doctors watched the 
heart monitor attached to Harris and later took his vital signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of his colleagues, Cashman believes that it would have ruined his 
credibility with people he treats -- the inmates -- to be present at an 
execution. "The state has decided, in its wisdom, that it will proceed with 
these procedures in dealing with criminals," Cashman says, "and as a medical 
provider, it just doesn't fit with my goal of having humane treatment of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 His decision, he says, was not without consequences. After the execution, he 
felt he had lost credibility with the warden. His proposals for improving 
treatment were not greeted as enthusiastically as they had been, and he wound 
up leaving San Quentin to become chief medical director of the California Youth 
Authority. There, he does not have to grapple with such sticky matters; 
juveniles cannot be sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Cashman is not the first doctor at San Quentin to have the death penalty 
collide with his career. In the mid-1980s, Dr. Kim Marie Thorburn applied to 
become the prison's chief medical officer. Although she was the top-ranked 
physician on the state's civil service exam, she says she didn't get the job 
after she told the warden that she wouldn't participate in executions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others who do get involved, even in a limited way, often wrestle with their 
consciences for years. In January, 1993, Dr. Donald T. Reay, Seattle's chief 
medical examiner, found himself trapped in a legal debate over whether hanging 
constituted cruel and unusual punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue was the fate of Westley Allan Dodd, who was to be hanged that month. 
Reay is an expert on hanging; he has reviewed more than 400 cases, all of them 
suicides or homicides (with the exception of Dodd) during his 20-year career. 
While the courts weighed the matter, state lawyers turned to Reay for an 
explanation of what happens when someone is hanged. 
</P>
<P>
 As a death penalty opponent, Reay considered refusing to talk, but decided 
that he had an obligation to share his knowledge. Although he was careful to 
keep the conversation focused on hanging in general, refusing to answer such 
questions as how much rope was optimal, he was required to review military 
procedures for execution by hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was uncomfortable," he says, "because it was clear to me that what I was 
trying to (say) was going to be used probably in some other fashion. I did not 
want to get into this position of advising them in any way how to kill 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
 The courts approved the hanging, and a doctor was present. But it was not 
Reay; he refused to go.

HEALTHWATCH; PATIENT GROWS HAIR -- AND ANOTHER PROBLEM 
</P>

 What if every day were a bad hair day? That apparently is the case for a 
39-year-old woman thought to be the first documented victim of "acquired 
uncombable hair" -- not to be confused with congenital uncombable hair 
syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, in a letter to the American 
Medical Assn.'s Archives of Dermatology, outlined what they called the first 
documented case in which the condition was acquired, rather than inherited. The 
Cleveland-area woman developed the condition (also known as pili trianguli et 
canaliculi ) after being treated for hair loss with spironolactone, a diuretic 
sometimes used to increase potassium in the body. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news was that she did lose less hair and grow more. The bad news was, 
it looked awful and was too tangled to comb. 
</P>
<P>
 People with pili trianguli et canaliculi have dry, coarse blond or light brown 
hair that stands straight out from the head and looks wildly disordered, 
although it is not brittle. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who has had the condition for about two years, was taken off the 
diuretic and treated with steroids. But so far her hair has not improved. 
Conditioners haven't helped either.

 Panic Situations: A recent study on panic attacks conducted for the National 
Institute of Mental Health found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * 7% of Americans have suffered panic attacks sometime in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1% of respondents suffer from the more severe panic disorder -- where 
sudden, fearful spells that occur for no reason can be mistaken for a heart 
attack or other life-threatening medical situation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Panic attacks plague twice as many women as men. 
</P>
<P>
 * The lower the level of formal education, the higher the likelihood of having 
a panic attack.

<P>
 * Dry skin is the most common cause of itchiness.

<P>
 * The legs tend to be the first area to dry up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dry skin is more common in the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moisturizers work best when applied directly after bathing.

 Treating Angina: Unstable angina, a disease that can be a precursor to a heart 
attack and sends 500,000 Americans a year to the hospital, is often 
inappropriately treated, a new government report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some patients are overtreated, which causes undue expense; others are 
undertreated. 
</P>
<P>
 Angina occurs when arteries that carry oxygen to the heart are partially 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 If the blockages are small and the symptoms little more than fleeting pain 
after exertion, doctors call it stable angina. When the blockages are larger 
and symptoms occur when the individual is resting or even asleep, it is termed 
unstable angina. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidelines from the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research and the 
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute propose that exercise stress tests and 
electrocardiograms be used before resorting to more invasive diagnostic 
methods, such as cardiac catheterization or angiography. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines also recommend first calling an ambulance and then your doctor 
if chest pain lasts longer than 20 minutes; pain accompanies weakness, nausea 
or fainting; pain is not helped by three nitroglycerin tablets; it is the worst 
pain you've ever had.

DOW DROPS 42, BUT THERE'S NO PANIC SELLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following the perverse logic of Wall Street, where good news for the economy 
is often bad news for the market, stock and bond prices continued to tumble 
Monday, with the bellwether Dow Jones industrial average falling 42 points to 
its lowest close since last November. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panic selling some observers -- including top White House officials -- 
had feared would follow the long holiday weekend did not materialize. The Dow 
industrials plunged more than 80 points in early trading Monday, but prices 
recovered as some investors and brokers saw buying opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of them was San Clemente resident Doug Candler, who described himself 
as a medium-size investor. Candler said he is standing pat on his current 
stocks and taking advantage of the drop in prices to convert some bonds into 
stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he sees no intrinsic weakness in the economy or the nation -- and 
therefore no reason to dump his stock portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're OK," he said. "We have been through this many times before, 
even (during the market's drop in) 1987, and we all came out fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach investment banker Russell Diehl said his phone always rings off 
the hook during a falling market "with calls from friends and clients wanting 
to know if this is the time to bolt. That's the question of the day." 
</P>
<P>
 His advice? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are trading" on speculative stocks "there is probably no reason to be 
in the market these days, but if you are investing (for the long run), then 
bolting will only rack up transaction costs" paid to brokers for each buy or 
sell order. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County-based companies fared no worse than any others in Monday's 
market, as 66 of the 100 largest publicly traded companies in the county saw 
their stock values drop while 18 saw stock prices rise -- generally on word of 
pending mergers or other deals beneficial to the specific company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen no great panic," said Costa Mesa broker Jeffrey Kilpatrick. "I've 
had more people calling to ask about opportunities for buying than trying to 
sell." 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks have been falling for several weeks on concerns that strong economic 
growth will rekindle inflation, and a glowing employment report on Friday, when 
the stock market was closed, sent shivers down the spines of many on Wall 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation is the bugaboo of Federal Reserve policy-makers, who want to extend 
the recovery by keeping wages and prices under tight control. Indeed, the Fed 
is widely expected to raise interest rates further to head off inflation. At 
the same time, high interest rates are traditionally the enemy of the stock 
market, which competes with interest-bearing instruments for investors' 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials, led by National Economic Council Chairman 
Robert E. Rubin, spent the weekend trying to calm investors. That may have 
helped temper the decline in the stock market, which analysts said held up well 
under the circumstances, although declining issues beat out advances 2,108 to 
371. The Dow closed at 3,593.35 amid heavy trading of 342 million shares on the 
New York Stock Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
 The same could not be said for the bond market, however. Prices for 30-year 
U.S. Treasury bonds plummeted $18.13 per $1,000, sending the yield, or 
effective interest rate, up to 7.40% from 7.25% -- the highest rate since 
January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton on Monday said interest rates -- nudged up twice by the Fed 
in the last two months, in part with the intention of bursting the stock 
market's bubble -- already were too high and had provoked an "overreaction" in 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton has no direct control over the independent governors of the 
Federal Reserve Board, let alone investors, and many market watchers expect 
continued declines in both stocks and bonds, albeit nothing as drastic as the 
October, 1987, market crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been such a severe three-day decline that we'll probably get a rally 
sometime this week," said Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson, 
Lufkin & Jenrette, a New York brokerage. "But it's not at all assured that this 
is the low." 
</P>
<P>
 In many respects, the recent market declines are a logical reaction to a long 
run-up in share prices -- a "correction" in the parlance of Wall Street. Over 
the last several years, investors large and small have poured into the stock 
and bond markets, searching for higher returns at a time of low interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, many of those investors have found themselves overextended just 
when interest rates are going up. 
</P>
<P>
 The current market troubles began in February when the Federal Reserve nudged 
interest rates up slightly -- a move that now appears mainly to have produced 
expectations of a further hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Large investment funds for wealthy investors, known as hedge funds, in many 
cases sustained big losses by betting against rising rates -- bets largely 
placed with borrowed funds -- and they're now being forced to sell, driving 
prices down further. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, many other investors -- including small investors in mutual funds 
and individual stocks and bonds -- are sitting tight; they are not necessarily 
getting out of stocks and bonds, but they are not getting in any deeper. Thus 
there are few buyers of any description, a situation traders referred to as a 
lack of "liquidity" in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the small guys to the big guys, the investment community has too much 
exposure to risk," said Kevin Logan, chief U.S. economist for Swiss Bank Corp. 
"Everyone looks at the situation and says, 'I shouldn't buy any more at this 
level; I don't know how high the Fed is going to lift rates.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the same, recent innovations in financial services -- notably the emergence 
of financial instruments known as derivatives, which allow professionals to 
pursue complex, computer-aided trading strategies across many markets at once 
-- have rendered markets far more volatile. Price changes that might once have 
taken weeks to happen now occur in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with these uncertainties, there is little evidence that mutual fund 
investors, many of whom have grown accustomed to fat returns, are abandoning 
the market. Wall Street is hoping that remains the case, because wholesale 
redemptions of mutual fund assets could drive the market much lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But uncertainty and volatility are likely to reign for some time, and analysts 
will have to struggle to explain seemingly dramatic market activity. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, for example, many market participants were shocked by the steep 
decline in bonds, which were traded on Friday and had already fallen 
dramatically in response to the strong employment data. 
</P>
<P>
 Some attributed the fall-off to comments from the widely followed economist 
Henry Kaufman, who predicted that long-term bond yields could hit 9% to 10% 
before reaching the peak of the current cycle, though he said he expects a 
rally in bond prices in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman also said stock prices should not fall far in the near term because of 
strong underlying fundamentals, but that stocks remain vulnerable in the long 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "It is highly unlikely that the setback in stock and bond prices in the 
United States will truncate the current economic expansion," Kaufman said. 
"This is because financial rehabilitation has gone a long way in improving the 
financial health of all key sectors of the U.S. economy." 
</P>

O.C. WOMAN TURNS TRAGEDY INTO CRUSADE; ACTIVISM: AFTER THE MURDERS OF HER SON 
AND BROTHER, COLLENE CAMPBELL CHAMPIONS VICTIMS' RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a tender moment shared between brother and sister, one that Collene 
Campbell fondly remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother Mickey told me, 'Sis, I'm telling you honey. You're going to make 
history and become the first female mayor of San Juan Capistrano.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fate, like some giant hand hovering above Campbell's life, would do strange 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother, millionaire racing promoter Mickey Thompson, and his wife were 
murdered outside their home. It only added to Campbell's emotional toll. Six 
years earlier, in 1982, her son Scott, 27, had been strangled. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, Campbell did indeed become the city's first female mayor -- one 
with a special mission. She is a person who displays her emotions proudly and, 
as founder of Memories of Victims Everywhere (MOVE), is a forceful voice for 
victims' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell gave gripping testimony last month at Gov. Pete Wilson's crime summit 
in Los Angeles. A week ago, she told a South Orange County crime symposium that 
MOVE is launching a campaign to oust "soft-on-crime" state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep hearing so much about the rights of the criminals," Campbell said. 
"We don't worry enough about the victims. And here we have new bills in 
Sacramento all the time that talk about giving inmates conjugal visits and 
giving them the right to sue while in prison." 
</P>
<P>
 She has joined with Wilson, who on Monday said that the 1975 law known as the 
Inmates Bill of Rights -- which guarantees prisoners the right to marry, 
inherit property and file lawsuits -- should be repealed. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent murder of two Japanese exchange students in San Pedro that drew 
international headlines has intensified Campbell's quest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enough! . . . We're against legislators who say they're against crime but are 
game-playing and never vote for major anti-crime bills," Campbell said, adding 
that MOVE will target the state Assembly's powerful Public Safety Committee, 
where some anti-crime bills have stalled. 
</P>
<P>
 A staunch Republican, Campbell is heavily promoted by local Republican 
politicians, including those who embrace her victims'-rights agenda and have 
sought her endorsement for their election brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 With MOVE, Campbell said she plans fund-raisers to help pay for such 
activities as sending victims and their relatives to Sacramento to testify 
during legislative hearings and campaign against certain lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Democrats say Campbell is simply out to exploit crime as a partisan 
issue. It is something she hotly denies: "If anybody thinks it's fun to talk 
about their murdered loved ones, they haven't been there yet," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a tough-minded and well-connected politician, a businesswoman who, 
until last week, was chairman of the board for the Anaheim-based Mickey 
Thompson Entertainment Group, her brother's successful corporation that 
promotes supercross and stadium off-road racing. The job was turned over to her 
nephew, Danny Thompson, her brother's 45-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't care what political party you come from," said Orange County 
Municipal Judge Pamela Iles, a friend and political ally. "If you are 
supporting the rights of victims in the criminal justice system, she'll support 
you. If not, you're not going to like what she can do to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Through Campbell's persuasion, Iles said she has stopped officiating at prison 
weddings. Iles noted that convicted murderer Charles (Tex) Watson, a follower 
of Charles Manson in he 1969 Tate-LaBianca murders, has married and fathered 
three children while in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Collene that I worried about the mental health of the inmate, and her 
response was rather blunt. She said, 'Who cares if they're healthy!' " 
</P>
<P>
 MOVE has set its sights on Assemblymen Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) and Bob 
Epple (D-Cerritos), whom Campbell described as "appearing to be tough on crime 
when they're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Peifer, a spokeswoman for Epple, said Epple supported Assembly Republican 
Bill Jones' "three strikes and you're out" bill during three separate votes 
before it was signed into law by Gov. Pete Wilson two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 George Urch, Umberg's chief aide, said Campbell was taking unfair shots at a 
former federal prosecutor who has pressed drug cases and who had introduced his 
own "three strikes and you're out" bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramona Ripston, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of 
Southern California in Los Angeles, said she believes victim advocates can be 
more effective fighting to put more police officers on the streets than 
lobbying against conjugal visits for inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would agree that victims of crime traditionally are the forgotten people in 
the criminal justice system and should be treated humanely," Ripston said. 
"However, in terms of fighting against inmates' rights, most of those are 
already covered by the federal Constitution and federal law." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell "can help wipe out the state's Inmates Bill of Rights, but nothing 
much will change because the federal laws cover those, so it's just 
grandstanding," Ripston added. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no dispute, political or otherwise, that Campbell has been dealt a 
tough hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "MOVE was founded while we stood at the graveside of my brother," Campbell 
said. "That was some five years ago. The group was established not as a 
political forum but to push for stricter laws and making criminals commit less 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 John W. Ben, South Orange County Chambers of Commerce vice president, invited 
Campbell to speak at the recent crime symposium after hearing her talk at a 
Republican Party meeting in Burlingame this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "She struck me as a woman who never knew about politics because she gave such 
a sincere talk," Ben said. "When I heard that speech I said to myself, 'God, we 
have to have her.' I was struck by how much hurt one family can take." 
</P>
<P>
 How Campbell has dealt with both tragedies in her life shows who Collene 
Campbell is. 
</P>
<P>
 When her son died, she said she thought of suicide. "I could join him, I 
thought, and this isn't so uncommon from what I've learned from other mothers 
who have lost their children. I could have become a bitter person, too, angry 
at the world." 
</P>
<P>
 But she chose life and dedicated herself to helping other survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Her emotional well is not dry. Nor is it deep. "I can put up a real good 
front. I've become quite good at that. And, you know what? No one said life is 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish there was a pill I could take to let me tell my story without me 
having to cry or get emotional. . . . " she said. "I don't think you ever do 
get over it. I think when you end up in a position like this, where someone is 
murdered, it's very different than a normal death." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Thompson and his wife, Trudy, were gunned down March 18, 1988. Police 
said two young men lurking outside their home in Bradbury in the San Gabriel 
Valley shot them to death and fled on 10-speed bicycles. No suspects have been 
arrested, and no motive has been revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Life wasn't always so grim. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, my first remembrance of my brother," Campbell said, "is that he 
took my mother's old washing machine motor out to build a Go-Kart." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother would go on to hold numerous land speed records, including 
including one at Bonneville Salt Flats, "where Mickey hit 406 miles an hour 
using four Pontiac engines -- one for each wheel." 
</P>
<P>
 She worked for her brother for 18 years, handling Thompson's public relations 
and promotions and serving as advertising producer in a world of fast cars and 
off-road racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, 61, grew up in Alhambra, where her father, Marion Thompson, was 
chief of detectives. She met Gary, her husband of 42 years, when they both were 
in the second grade. The Campbells have a daughter, Shelly, 37 and three 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not only my sweetie, but my best friend," she said of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Campbell had his own ad agency but joined the Thompson family team and 
helped with marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mickey Thompson met his wife, Trudy, while on a water ski trip, the 
foursome grew close. Thompson's racing activities took them all over the 
nation, to Parker, Ariz., for the Parker 500, to the Baja 1,000 and to 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, 12 years ago, the Campbells' son, Scott, was strangled and his body 
thrown from a small airplane at 2,000 feet a mile off Santa Catalina Island. 
With the Campbells' help, their son's two killers were finally convicted five 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
 To their disappointment, they learned that their son had planned a trip to 
North Dakota to sell cocaine the day he disappeared. They also discovered the 
intended buyer was a federal drug agency informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that Scott Campbell's killers, Larry Cowell and Donald 
DiMascio, would never have been arrested had it not been for the Campbells. 
They gathered evidence that led to Cowell's arrest, and Collene Campbell 
telephoned the informant and convinced him to fly to Orange County from North 
Dakota and help police trap Cowell and DiMascio into confessing. They also paid 
the informant's travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got involved with a guy who apparently had made an offer for him to bring 
back some drugs," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so hard," Campbell said. "You lose this child who you worship and then 
you go to court and listen to defense attorneys and all the dirty things they 
bring up about your son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most victims' relatives just can't step forward," she said. "It's sacrificing 
too much. It's too painful, they can't afford it or it's too embarrassing. You 
know, I didn't ask for this education. But I have it and a tremendous amount of 
knowledge and information that hopefully it will save others from being where I 
am."

STRAWBERRY TO GET ALCOHOL, DRUG TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry, on the verge of being released after failing to show for up 
for Sunday's game, told Dodger officials Monday that he has a drug and alcohol 
problem and will enter a substance abuse treatment center today. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional meeting in Los Angeles, Strawberry asked the Dodgers for help 
in seeking treatment, and the Dodgers responded positively, said Bob Shapiro, 
Strawberry's attorney. Strawberry was placed on the disabled list on the eve of 
the 1994 season opener today at Dodger Stadium. His future with the team 
remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl will not be playing opening day, he will be in a drug treatment 
center," Shapiro said. "He is taking this as seriously as anyone I have ever 
had. He has apologized to (Dodger executive vice president) Fred Claire and 
asked Fred to apologize to (Manager) Tommy Lasorda for disappointing the team, 
but he knows deep in his heart the stress was too much. He has not had the 
proper outlet for release and has relied on alcohol and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's disclosure came as he was about to be released. The Dodgers have 
tired of his controversial distractions.  
</P>
<P>
 The latest incident came Sunday when Strawberry was missing for nearly 24 
hours, skipping the team's afternoon game against the Angels at Anaheim Stadium 
that ended the exhibition season. Claire and some of Strawberry's teammates 
spent much of the day trying to find him. But when Claire located Strawberry 
about 8 p.m. Sunday night, he said Strawberry's excuse for his absence was 
unacceptable. What Strawberry told Claire is not known. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say we were close to (releasing him)," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that even with Strawberry's disclosure, the club could have released 
him. But after meeting with Shapiro, Strawberry and his wife, Charisse, Claire 
changed course.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the reaction was sadness and surprise," Claire said. "Darryl was very 
downcast. I mean, this wasn't an easy thing for him to acknowledge and say but 
frankly I was glad that he did. If that is the issue, then it has to be faced. 
I was glad that he stepped forward." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time in Strawberry's 11-year career that he has entered a 
treatment center, but Claire said he believes this is the first time for drug 
abuse. In February of 1990, as a member of the New York Mets, Strawberry was 
treated at the Smithers Center for alcohol abuse.  
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said Strawberry was unavailable for comment because he was en route to 
an undisclosed treatment center. The specific nature of the problem also was 
not discussed.  
</P>
<P>
 Claire said Strawberry, 32, would continue to be paid barring "anything 
unforeseen." Strawberry signed a five-year, $20.3-million contract with the 
team before the 1991 season. The Dodgers owe him $8 million for the final two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire also said he would not speculate on whether Strawberry would play for 
the Dodgers again, saying only that he and team owner Peter O'Malley want to 
support the Dodger slugger.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to prejudge all that," Claire said. "The future is uncertain, 
but as in the case with Steve Howe, we did give our support and we will be 
consistent in that." 
</P>
<P>
 Howe, a former Dodger left-handed relief pitcher, was suspended for substance 
abuse three times in his five seasons with the team before he was released in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 For Strawberry, who spent most of the last two seasons sidelined with a back 
injury, it was a sudden end to what had appeared to be a promising season. His 
only productive season with the Dodgers was his first -- 1991 -- when he hit 28 
home runs and had 99 runs batted in. Since then, he has played in only 75 games 
and hit a total of 10 home runs.  
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's lower back started bothering him during the 1992 season, and in 
September, he had surgery for a herniated disk. He tried unsuccessfully to come 
back last season. By June, he was out for the season.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Strawberry continued to have troubles off the field. Last 
September, he was arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend, whom he has 
since married. The charge was later dropped.  
</P>
<P>
 After a season in which Strawberry was criticized for disregarding rules 
concerning his physical rehabilitation, Claire had enough, and started offering 
to trade his former superstar to other teams. At one point Claire put him on 
the waiver wire, making him available to any team for $20,000, plus his 
remaining contract. No team responded. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, Strawberry appeared to be strong both emotionally and physically. 
He was often the first one in the clubhouse in the morning and one of the last 
to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry was switched from right field to left to ease the stress on his 
back, and at the plate he began to show signs of renewed power. Lasorda put him 
back in the cleanup spot, batting behind Mike Piazza and ahead of Eric Karros, 
an imposing combination for pitchers. But Shapiro said the stress of trying to 
come back was too much for Strawberry. During Friday night's game against the 
Angels at Dodger Stadium, Strawberry was booed by the fans after he misplayed a 
ball in the field, allowing a run to score. 
</P>
<P>
 KABC-TV reported that several people said Strawberry was at an Anaheim 
nightclub from about 10:30 p.m. Saturday until closing time at 2 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is about a mile from Anaheim Stadium, where Strawberry had played in 
the Dodgers' 5-2 loss to the Angels on Saturday night. He homered in his final 
at-bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Hong, who owns the nightclub, confirmed to the Associated Press the 
television station's report that Strawberry was drinking alcohol, but said 
Strawberry did not cause a disturbance and was signing autographs and 
socializing with other patrons.

AUDIT QUESTIONS BERNSON'S USE OF CAMPAIGN FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson used campaign funds to make more than 
$158,000 in questionable expenditures, including tens of thousands of dollars 
spent for foreign travel and expensive dinners, according to a highly critical 
audit released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, by the staff of the city Ethics Commission, also could not find 
checks, receipts or other supporting documents to verify how at least another 
$700,000 in campaign funds was spent by two of seven campaign committees 
controlled by Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 "You and the treasurer failed in your duty to exercise reasonable diligence" 
in preparing accurate and complete campaign finance disclosure reports, the 
auditors concluded in a rebuke aimed at Bernson, who has represented the 
northwest San Fernando Valley since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are being reported to the Ethics Commission enforcement staff, to 
the city attorney's office and to the state Fair Political Practices 
Commission, all of which have responsibilities for enforcing the city or state 
campaign finance reform laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Avila, deputy director of the Ethics Commission, refused to speculate 
on what those agencies might do with the information. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making no recommendation about what they should do, only providing them 
with our findings of facts," Avila said. "It's up to those agencies to 
determine if there's been violations of law." 
</P>
<P>
 State and local campaign finance reform laws require accurate disclosure of 
contributions and expenditures and adherence to certain record-keeping 
standards. Those laws also prohibit funds from being spent for the personal, 
and in some instances political, benefit of the candidate.  
</P>
<P>
 City law requires routine audits of candidates' finance committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bernson and his staff complained that the audit findings largely 
ignored their explanations for many of the expenditures called questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 They blamed many of the financial gaps and fiscal confusion on the fact that a 
Bernson political bookkeeper embezzled $126,000 from at least two of his 
committees and then destroyed records to cover up the theft. They also 
criticized the Ethics Commission for not giving Bernson more time to respond to 
the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been biased, hostile and antagonistic because I won't knuckle under 
to (Benjamin) Bycel (executive director of the Ethics Commission) and his 
dictatorial tactics," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 45 days to respond to an audit that took them two years to do," added 
Grieg Smith, Bernson's chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings of this latest round of audits covered some ground previously 
explored by a state attorney general investigation that eventually cleared 
Bernson of misusing campaign funds for personal benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bernson himself acknowledged that the attorney general's 
investigation did not cover three of the committees audited by the Ethics 
Commission that were found to have problems. "I don't think the attorney 
general covered the 1991 committees or the officeholder committee (in 1991)," 
Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith acknowledged that he and Bernson were unable to completely reply to the 
auditors' findings regarding the two committees Bernson used to finance his 
1991 reelection campaign because of lack of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1991 reports were the big ones we couldn't get to," Smith said. "We just 
didn't have time." Candidates normally get 30 days to reply to an audit. Smith 
said he had sought a 90-day extension but only got a 15-day extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, despite Bernson's claims that many of the problems can be traced to 
the embezzlement, the auditors noted that two of the committees were formed 
after that case had ended. "Furthermore, for the committees which were 
embezzled, auditors found no discernible improvement in the committee's 
record-keeping after the embezzlement activity ceased," they added. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Toni Lee Corpuel, a former bookkeeper for the accounting firm Bernson 
used, was sentenced to a year in jail after being convicted of embezzling more 
than $126,000 from Bernson's committees. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit report concluded that five of the seven committees they examined 
"did not substantially comply" with city and state campaign finance and 
reporting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the key findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * The audit of the Bernson Political Action Committee found that of the 
$521,475.92 spent by this committee, only $11,225 was spent to support other 
candidates or ballot measures. Political action committees, while not bound by 
any special obligation to do so, are generally established by candidates to 
finance other candidates or causes. 
</P>
<P>
 * The audit found $126,537.29 in expenditures by the Bernson PAC that were not 
readily explained in its campaign disclosure reports as meeting a governmental, 
legislative or political purpose, as required by law. The audit, however, cited 
the brief explanations subsequently offered by Bernson for each of the 82 
questioned expenditures involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these expenditures were for meals or trips, including travel to Rome, 
China and Hawaii, to meet with emergency operations personnel in those areas, 
and to Israel, according to Bernson. Some of the trips were made with Bernson's 
wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $8,079 in air fare costs to China, including the cost of 
one staff member, Bernson also charged this committee $106.45 for a "tux for 
China trip" and $105.97 to buy a "luggage carrying case for governmental 
related travel." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson also tapped this account to pay $141.67 to "repair VCR used in 
recording TV programs about Councilman or legislative activities." 
</P>
<P>
 * Another audit noted that it could not determine if $30,905.74 spent by 
Bernson's officeholder committee was related to a legislative or governmental 
purpose, as required by law. Many of the questioned expenditures reported by 
this committee were for gifts and tickets to sporting events given to Bernson's 
staff, City Hall personnel or constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 In his official response to the audit, Bernson identified 30 of the 69 
questioned expenditures as politically related, although the Ethics Commission 
said money from such committees can not be legally spent on such activities. In 
eight instances, Bernson offered no explanation for the expenditures, including 
payments of $2,680 at the Hollywood Bowl and $2,917.93 at Northridge Hill 
Liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 * The audit of Bernson's two 1991 reelection committees concluded that the 
committee received $15,912 from 30 people or companies who gave more than the 
$500-per-person limit allowed under the city law.

$3.7-BILLION BREAST IMPLANT SETTLEMENT WINS TENTATIVE OK; COURTS: FEDERAL JUDGE 
SETS DEADLINES FOR FILING CLAIMS UNDER RECORD-BREAKING, CLASS-ACTION ACCORD. IT 
WOULD COMPENSATE THOUSANDS OF WOMEN WHO CLAIM INJURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A record-breaking $3.75-billion class-action breast implant settlement that 
could provide compensation to thousands of women nationwide, including many in 
California, cleared its first major hurdle Monday as a federal judge 
tentatively approved the deal and set deadlines for filing claims. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr. of Birmingham, Ala., also announced 
that he was taking two steps that should make the settlement more appealing to 
women who allege that they were injured by the implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointer appointed Ann T. Cochran of Houston, a state court judge, to serve as 
the claims administrator for the settlement fund. Cochran has been the 
coordinating judge for hundreds of breast implant cases pending in Texas. She 
was praised as someone "who understands the real issues the women have to deal 
with" by Sybil N. Goldrich of Beverly Hills, co-founder of the Command Trust 
Network, a nationwide information clearinghouse for breast implant recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a strong effort to persuade women that the settlement fund will not be 
drained by excessive legal fees and other costs, Pointer decreed that at least 
75% of the money will go to women with implants. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's order on money issues puts teeth into sentiments he expressed at a 
March 11 hearing, when he said it was his goal to ensure that no more than 25% 
of the settlement pot goes for legal fees and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of several implant support groups, including some that have 
been critical of the settlement, praised Pointer's action.  
</P>
<P>
 Ralph I. Knowles Jr., an Atlanta attorney who was co-chairman of the National 
Breast Implant Plaintiffs' Coalition, called the judge's action unusual but 
wise because in cases like this there frequently is speculation that lawyers 
will be paid excessively. 
</P>
<P>
 A 75% share "is a good return if you look comparatively" at what happened in 
other mass tort cases, Knowles said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1 million women received silicone gel breast implants in this country 
between 1962 and 1992, when the federal Food and Drug Administration restricted 
their use. Many of the thousands of lawsuits filed nationwide maintain that 
silicone leaked out of the implant pouch and migrated throughout women's 
bodies, causing numerous diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement contains a lengthy list of injuries for which women can be 
compensated, depending on their age and the severity of their injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Projected compensation, after reduction for administrative costs and legal 
fees, ranges from $105,000 to $1.4 million per person, according to the 
settlement notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Those amounts could be increased if more companies join the settlement, whose 
participants now include Dow Corning, Baxter Healthcare, Bristol-Myers Squibb 
and some smaller companies. Negotiations between 3M, Union Carbide and other 
companies, which could add up to $1 billion to the settlement fund, are 
scheduled to resume today.  
</P>
<P>
 "The settlement is much more desirable" for many reasons if 3M and the other 
companies participate, said Alan B. Morrison, director of Ralph Nader's Public 
Citizen Litigation Group, who earlier indicated that he might challenge the 
deal because it was inadequately funded and did not cover all the appropriate 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If 3M is not in the deal, there will be a lot more proof required in what was 
supposed to be a painless administrative procedure," because women will have to 
show that their implants came from one of the settling companies, not 3M, 
Morrison said. He also expressed concern about whether the women will have 
adequate time to make a decision on whether to join the settlement or opt out. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney John Michael Restaino, whose law firm represents 464 women, most from 
Orange County, in silicone breast implant cases, said the June 1 deadline 
doesn't give women enough time to consult with lawyers and physicians. He said 
the firm's lawyers currently are "putting in 16-hour days" trying to advise 
clients on the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point in time it is getting more difficult (for the women) to find 
doctors or lawyers to handle their cases," Restaino said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the diseases that are reimbursable in the settlement can be 
most readily diagnosed by rheumatologists, "rheumatologists experienced with 
silicone gel implant problems are booked" because of the June 1 deadline, 
Restaino said. "If you call today they won't see you until maybe mid-June." 
</P>
<P>
 A massive public information campaign on the settlement -- including 
television, radio and newspaper advertisements -- is scheduled to start April 
18. Pointer has set up a toll-free number, (800) 887-6828, that women can call 
if they want information mailed to them. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a "current disease fund," which provides compensation for women 
who are ill, the settlement provides money for medical monitoring and removal 
of implants.  
</P>
<P>
 The settlement does not require proof that a covered disease was caused by a 
breast implant. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord runs for 30 years and is designed to operate like an insurance 
policy. By signing up now, a woman who has implants could get compensation if 
she became ill later, said Elizabeth J. Cabraser, a San Francisco lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Women with saline implants also are eligible to participate in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointer's order set a schedule for key events in the massive litigation: 
</P>
<P>
 * June 17 is the first deadline for women who do not want to participate to 
file papers opting out of the settlement, thus enabling them to pursue their 
own lawsuits. That is also the deadline for individuals desiring to file 
objections to the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 18 is the date for a hearing on the fairness of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 16 is the deadline for women with eligible diseases to file claims for 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 1 is the deadline for women to register to make claims for medical 
monitoring, to have an implant removed, or to be eligible for compensation 
later if they develop one of the covered diseases.

COPING WITH TRAGEDY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At 9:30 a.m. on Monday, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner and 
President Frank G. Wells were to have met to formalize Wells' new, seven-year 
contract, which Eisner planned to present to Disney's directors on April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday night, during dinner at his son's home, Eisner got a call from a 
Disney pilot who had overheard emergency radio transmissions. Wells, 62, had 
been killed in a helicopter crash in a remote Nevada canyon while returning 
from a skiing expedition. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing his business partner of 10 years has left Eisner with a huge personal 
and professional void. The two men sat about 15 feet apart from each other at 
work, an arrangement that dated back to their first day on the job in 1984, 
when Eisner insisted that he needed a few feet of space so he could talk 
privately with his wife on the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner ran nearly every decision past Wells. When he thought of designing 
Disney's new headquarters building so that the Seven Dwarfs would appear to be 
holding it up, Wells readily agreed to it, knowing, as Eisner did, that the 
1937 film "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" once propped up the company 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you work together with somebody 15 feet away for 10 years, you know each 
other well. He was the most incredibly selfless executive without any other 
agenda than what was good for the Disney Company," Eisner said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, there was no word on Disney's plan for replacing Wells, but the 
Burbank-based company said Eisner, 52, will assume Wells' duties and take on 
his title of president. The company added that there will be no change to any 
previously announced plan or project, including the proposed $3-billion 
Disneyland Resort theme park project under consideration in Anaheim. Eisner 
indicated that he would work more closely with the heads of Disney's units. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts credited Wells with helping to build a deep and talented management 
team. "It was a very rare kind of intelligence that you don't find in many 
companies . . . (but) the Walt Disney Co. has tremendous management depth so 
it's not like they will be in any turmoil," said Harold Vogel, an analyst for 
Merrill Lynch in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One executive described Wells as "the voice of calm fiscal responsibility 
here," while another called him a unique problem solver who will be difficult 
to replace. Indeed, one of Wells' first tasks was to settle a strike at 
Disneyland that began the day after he and Eisner were named to their posts in 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner said that even though Wells had the reputation of being involved mostly 
in business affairs, rather than creative ones, his role was much broader than 
people realize. 
</P>
<P>
 It included "expanding the number of motion pictures we made to quality 
architecture, to naming the hockey team the Mighty Ducks," which was another 
Eisner idea that Wells supported. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eisner: "He was a lawyer who wanted to make the deal, not not make the 
deal. He was a closer. He encouraged excellence in whatever he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Other executives cited Wells' intangible contributions. "The long-term impact 
will be great. He is as much a spiritual part of that company as anyone else." 
said 20th Century Fox President Bill Mechanic, Disney's former president of 
international theatrical and worldwide video. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood in the hallways at the Walt Disney Co. is "one of unbearable 
sadness," one executive said. Wells' death came less than a month after another 
senior Disney executive, Kevin Hyson, executive vice president of theatrical 
marketing, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
 A tearful David Hoberman, president of the studio's Touchstone and Disney 
Pictures banners, could say only: "As soon as I start talking about Frank, I 
start crying. . . . He was a great man." 
</P>
<P>
 Another top Disney official said: "I'm just numb. . . . It's just very quiet 
here. People are in shock; there's not a lot of noise in the halls." 
</P>
<P>
 The flag flew at half-staff Monday over the town hall on Disneyland's Main 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney Vice Chairman Roy E. Disney, who had been friends with Wells since 
their days at Pomona College and helped to push Wells for the Disney post, said 
Wells was "so bright and quick that once in a while he could be difficult to 
talk to, because he was always three steps ahead of you in conversation. By the 
time you got to B he was on to E. He'd get bored. . . . It disconcerted people, 
including me, at times." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Disney, the founder's nephew, said as serious as he was, Wells 
also had a terrific sense of humor. The last time he saw Wells socially, at a 
dinner the night before Disney's annual board meeting in Florida on Feb. 22, 
Roy Disney recalled that Wells "decided to read a list of the 10 worst possible 
questions which could be read at the meeting ( a la David Letterman). Then he 
expanded it to 14. . . . He had a great sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Mechanic said that Wells' calming influence on younger workers will be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He continually lectured me to be more gentlemanly and more collegial. He 
thought it was as much a measure of how someone should be judged as their 
actual accomplishments," Mechanic said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning, Wells was instrumental in the decisions to manage more 
aggressively the considerable Disney assets that many felt were not properly 
exploited -- bolstering the theme park operations and the merchandising of 
Disney characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legacy of Mr. Wells is that he was able to put into place a variety of 
operations systems and a very bottom-line-oriented business ethic, which is 
completely embedded in Disney today. The management teams will continue to 
operate," said analyst Christopher P. Dixon of Paine-Webber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He was seen occasionally in Orange County, both for social engagements and 
business. He sometimes was called in to cope with special problems, such as a 
few years ago when he met with an Anaheim strawberry farmer at the Disneyland 
Hotel to try to persuade him to sell his property to Disney. The farmer left 
unswayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today the city of Anaheim has lost a dear friend, and we extend our sincere 
sympathy to his family in this time of mourning," Anaheim City Manager James D. 
Ruth said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co. said funeral arrangements were pending for Wells, who is 
survived by his wife, Luanne, and sons Kevin and Briant. Investigators from the 
Federal Aviation Administration and the National Transportation Safety Board 
were to begin an investigation at the crash site, a canyon about 25 miles 
southeast of Elko, Nev.

MALAYSIA CONGLOMERATE WILL ACQUIRE 20% OF COSTA MESA-BASED STM; TECHNOLOGY: THE 
DEAL, PART OF THE ONGOING GLOBALIZATION OF O.C.'S BUSINESS COMMUNITY, WILL PUMP 
$7 MILLION CASH INTO FIRM'S COFFERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Pursuing an international expansion program, Satellite Technology Management 
Inc. said Monday that a major Malaysian conglomerate intends to acquire 20% of 
its stock and that the two companies will form an Asian joint venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Strohman, STM's senior vice president, said the agreement calls for a 
subsidiary of Malaysian-based conglomerate Berjaya Group Berhad to acquire 
approximately 20% of STM's common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, part of the ongoing globalization of the Orange County business 
community, will pump $7 million cash into STM's coffers and add a sixth 
position, held by a Berjaya representative, to the Costa Mesa company's board 
of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the deal pumped up STM's stock in an otherwise falling market Monday. 
The company's common shares closed up $1.25 at $7.50 on the Nasdaq market for a 
20% gain for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 STM, which makes satellite communications equipment and software, will form an 
Asia/Pacific joint venture in equal partnership with Berjaya Group to provide 
satellite communications services and products for that region. 
</P>
<P>
 Berjaya is a large resort, hotel and gaming center developer and operator 
headquartered in Kuala Lumpur. The company has properties throughout Malaysia 
and in Hong Kong, Mauritius, Fiji and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Emil Youssefzadeh, STM president and chief executive, said the Berjaya 
investment will provide the company with capital to expand "as strategic 
opportunities arise." 
</P>
<P>
 In February, STM signed an agreement with a subsidiary of Spain's national 
telephone company to develop and market worldwide telecommunications services 
using STM's products. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish company, Telefonica de Espana S.A., operates numerous satellite 
networks as an international carrier, has interests in telephone companies 
outside of Spain and is a founding shareholder in the Intelsat-K 
telecommunications satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with Berjaya, said Strohman, furthers STM's plans to become a 
major player in the growing Asian and Pacific markets. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the stock purchase and joint venture agreement grew out of a 
relationship that began when Berjaya approached STM last year as a possible 
vendor to provide telecommunications equipment for some of the Malaysian 
company's properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the nearly 1.4 million STM shares Berjaya will acquire under the agreement, 
half -- equal to a 10% stake -- will be sold directly by STM for $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Berjaya will acquire another 560,000 shares, equal to an 8% stake, from two of 
STM's outside investors for nearly $5.1 million, or $9.10 a share, and will 
purchase an additional 140,000 shares, or 2% of the company's stock, on the 
open market. 
</P>
<P>
 While the deal will create a new company in Malaysia, it isn't expected to add 
to STM's domestic work force of 165 employees at facilities in Costa Mesa and 
San Diego.

CPC NAMES PRESIDENT OF KEY PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES DIVISION; MENTAL HEALTH: KAY 
E. SEIM WILL HEAD A COMPANY UNIT THAT HAS 38 HOSPITALS IN 17 STATES AND PUERTO 
RICO.

 Kay E. Seim has been promoted to president in charge of U.S. psychiatric 
facilities for Community Psychiatric Centers. 
</P>
<P>
 She previously served as executive vice president of the same division. 
</P>
<P>
 Seim, 47, has spent the past six months managing the division's newly 
consolidated structure and management team. She will now focus on making the 
system more responsive to the standards of managed care, which often seek 
patient care within a shorter period of time. Seim will also oversee the 
division's new product development and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Seim's division spans 38 hospitals in 17 states and Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 "This promotion recognizes Kay Seim's invaluable contribution to the 
reorganization and revitalization of CPC's U.S. psychiatric operations," 
Richard L. Conte, chairman and chief executive officer, said in a prepared 
statement. He also said Seim has helped turn around the company's California 
hospital operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Seim, who was not available Monday for comment, assumed control of the 
company's psychiatric hospital division in September, 1993. Before that, she 
was an executive vice president with overall responsibility for 15 California 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 She came to Community Psychiatric from Ramsay Health Care Inc., where she was 
the senior vice president and chief operating officer in charge of 17 
psychiatric and chemical dependency hospitals nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Seim had previously spent 20 years with CPC, moving up through the ranks from 
hospital-level management positions to a regional vice president post 
overseeing seven facilities in seven Northwest states. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Kirkland, Wash., Seim earned her bachelor's degree from Central 
Washington University, majoring in psychology and business administration. She 
has a master's degree from Seattle University, with a concentration in 
counseling psychology.

BUILDER PLANS 158 HOMES IN DANA POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kaufman & Broad, California's largest home builder, has agreed to buy 158 
ocean-view housing lots in Orange County from Monarch Partnership Inc. to build 
single-family homes in Monarch Hills priced from $260,000 to $370,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, which is expected to close escrow in two weeks, Kaufman & 
Broad will buy the Dana Point lots for an undisclosed amount from the San Diego 
developer, said Roland Osgood, president of Kaufman & Broad's Orange County 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Johnson, a partner with the Meyers Group, a real estate consulting firm 
in Newport Beach, estimated that each of the lots -- located near Niguel Road 
and Camino Del Avion -- would sell for about $100,000, putting the purchase 
price at about $16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes will be built in parts of what was known as the Marquesa and 
Corniche developments, where San Diego builder R. B. McComic Inc. erected about 
60 homes in the late 1980s, but was forced by financial pressures to stop 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we weren't able to finish is, our construction lender was taken 
over by the Resolution Trust Corp.," said R.B. McComic, chairman of Monarch 
Partnership Inc., which has developed more than 1,000 homes in San Diego. He 
said he spoke with 15 potential buyers and had offers from nine. He said K&B 
offered the highest bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman & Broad will complete the housing community, which will be renamed 
"California Cortina." 
</P>
<P>
 Known for its affordable entry-level housing, Kaufman & Broad will make these 
homes part of its more upscale Orange County housing, Osgood said. "If we find 
the right property in Orange County, we will do high-end," he said. "This is a 
very attractive piece of property, with ocean views. It's a gated community." 
</P>
<P>
 On April 6, the Dana Point Planning Commission is scheduled to vote on whether 
to approve Kaufman & Broad's application to amend the original planning design 
for the housing units in Monarch Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to build units a little bit different in design, not higher 
density," said Greg Pfost, assistant planner for the city of Dana Point, who 
said some of the current residents have expressed concern about completion of 
the project by Kaufman & Broad. Residents are concerned about the smaller size 
of the proposed homes, the quality of materials to be used and lower property 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, David Jacobson, senior vice president with Sares-Regis Group of Irvine, 
which has built a a 325-unit condominium project in Monarch Hills, hailed the 
arrival of Kaufman & Broad. Of the estimated 150 units currently for sale, 102 
have been purchased, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is outstanding news," Jacobson said. "Kaufman & Broad is known for their 
marketing techniques. They will bring in a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate land purchase, Kaufman & Broad recently closed escrow on the 
purchase of 18 acres for the construction of 144 duplex homes in a neighborhood 
called California Tesoro in Rancho Santa Margarita near the golf course. These 
are the first duplexes to be built in that master-planned community, according 
to Diane Gaynor, spokeswoman for the planned community. The land purchase price 
was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 'These homes will be close to the town center and will be in a very attractive 
price range for younger families," Osgood said. "In my opinion this works 
better than clustered housing, because there is more privacy. We think this 
will be very successful."

UNITED CALIFORNIA SAVINGS TO MERGE WITH CENFED; BANKING: THE ANAHEIM-BASED 
THRIFT'S DIRECTORS WILL RECEIVE THE BULK OF $7-MILLION MINIMUM PURCHASE PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Money-losing United California Savings Bank has agreed to merge into CenFed 
Financial Corp. of Pasadena in a $7-million stock-and-cash deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Directors of the ailing thrift, which has lost more than $20 million in the 
past five years, own 80% of its stock and will receive the bulk of the 
$7-million minimum purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 That price includes $1 million in cash, $6 million worth of CenFed stock once 
the merger is completed and an unspecified additional amount of CenFed stock 
upon sale of United California Savings' $321-million mortgage portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal ends United California's reign as one of Orange County's oldest 
independently owned thrifts, but will keep the United California Savings name 
alive. The savings and loan was founded in 1921 as Anaheim Building & Loan 
Assn. CenFed plans to operate its eight branches in Orange and Riverside 
counties as a separate division under the United California Savings Bank name. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no plans to move United California Savings' directors, including 
chairman and majority owner Larry Ulvestad, into positions with CenFed, said 
Steven P. Neiffer, a CenFed vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Neiffer said CenFed plans to keep all of the United California Savings branch 
office employees but only "a few" of the Anaheim-based thrift's corporate 
staff. United California Savings has 147 employees, but the breakdown of 
corporate and branch employees was not available Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition requires approval of state and federal regulators, among other 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulvestad -- who was asked by federal regulators to step down as president and 
chief executive -- was the third member of his family to hold the top operating 
position. The others were his mother, Dorothy Ulvestad, and grandfather, Fritz 
Yungbluth. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Feb. 28, United California Savings' branches had combined assets of $458 
million and deposits of $416 million. 
</P>
<P>
 CenFed, founded in 1927, had $1.5 billion in assets as of Dec. 31. The 
company's thrift subsidiary, CenFed Bank, has 18 offices, including two in 
Orange County -- one in Cypress and one in Placentia.

 RGC, the Newport Beach home builder, said Monday it has teamed up with one of 
South Korea's largest home-building firms to build a community of single-family 
homes in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed the "East Meets West" alliance, the international partnership is with 
K. Young Homes Inc. of Los Angeles, a subsidiary of Kunyoung, one of Korea's 
largest publicly traded construction firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the primary reasons for this alliance is capital; it's a substantial 
sum they're putting in," said E. James Murar, chairman of RGC, though he would 
not say how much. "We always think there are things that can be learned by how 
they do things." The alliance expects to build at least 400 homes on 23 acres 
it purchased in the Los Abanicos neighborhood in Rancho Santa Margarita's town 
center, Murar said. The high density, single-family homes will be priced under 
$130,000.

DOWNEY SAVINGS CHIEF ABRUPTLY RETIRES; BANKING: ROBERT L. KEMPER HAD PLANNED TO 
LEAVE IN JUNE. HE IS CREDITED WITH STABILIZING THE THRIFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert L. Kemper, who helped to stabilize and redirect Downey Savings & Loan, 
abruptly moved his retirement up three months and has left his positions as 
director and chief executive, the thrift said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper was replaced by an interim team consisting of Donald E. Royer, the 
thrift's general counsel, and Thomas E. Prince, its chief financial officer. A 
search has been underway for a permanent replacement since November when Kemper 
announced that he would retire June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey said it hoped to find a replacement soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper's early departure caught employees off-guard. He appeared at a company 
awards banquet Thursday to congratulate employees and gave no indication of his 
imminent departure. His last day in the office was Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two weeks ago, Kemper, 65, said in an interview that he planned to stay 
until his contract ran out at the end of June. He said then that he planned to 
return to the Santa Barbara area, where other family members live. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper was brought on board in the fall of 1991 after regulators pressured 
Downey's two co-founders into turning over operating control to a new group of 
leaders. Downey was considered a well-run thrift, but its management structure 
was outdated and its relations with regulators was tense. Kemper, a former 
Wells Fargo vice chairman, was well-liked by thrift regulators and steadied the 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 He also reorganized top management, bringing in a number of new faces, and 
refocused the thrift toward generating more home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, Downey hired Lehman Bros., a New York investment banker, to study a 
"range of strategic alternatives" -- including a sale of the thrift -- for 
improving operations and bolstering shareholder value. But directors decided in 
November to take the thrift off the block and initiate plans to remain 
independent and instead boost its size. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemper, who said in November he would retire in mid-1994 -- helped to steer 
the thrift along its new course with an aggressive home loan campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 With 52 branches mainly in Southern California, consistent earnings and $3.5 
billion in loans and other assets, Downey has been one of the industry's more 
respected thrift operations.

PROPERTY VALUES: U. S. INVESTIGATING FRAUD IN EARTHQUAKE AID PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ron Galperin 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of the federal government have been focused on doling out aid to 
earthquake victims for the past two months. Now there is growing attention to 
some of the fraud and abuse that have accompanied this whole disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fraud is happening where the Jan. 17 earthquake hit hardest -- in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 A special fraud hot line has been receiving 40 to 60 calls daily naming 
individuals and businesses that may be taking advantage of the various quake 
aid programs by either asking more than they are entitled to or making outright 
false statements in applications for aid from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Small Business 
Administration and others, government officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have hundreds of reports in the Valley and other parts of Los Angeles that 
we are investigating," said George B. Newhouse Jr., deputy chief of the 
government fraud section of the U. S. attorney's office in downtown Los 
Angeles. "We have reason to believe there are a substantial number of fraud 
cases. We are swimming in a mountain of paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Newhouse is part of the Federal Earthquake Fraud Task Force that now includes 
FEMA, HUD, SBA, Department of Commerce, U. S. Army, Department of 
Transportation, FBI, Secret Service, U. S. attorney's office, Department of 
Agriculture and U. S. Postal Service. All the investigating has only yielded a 
handful of arrests so far, Newhouse conceded. And the vast majority of fraud 
cases will never be prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only interested in the most egregious cases," Newhouse said. "If there 
is any justification for a claim, or if the aid applicant was just stretching 
the truth, those are not the cases we are going after -- we would be 
overwhelmed." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, defendants can plea bargain, pay penalties or be put on 
probation. Few people will ever serve any actual jail time, Newhouse said. "We 
can't possibly do something about it all." 
</P>
<P>
 In early March, three people were arrested by federal agents for claiming FEMA 
disaster assistance benefits by falsely stating that they lived at the 
Northridge Meadows Apartments where 16 people died. In fact, the trio did not 
live there, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A businessman was arrested in connection with submitting a $1.5-million loan 
application to the SBA. He allegedly submitted false financial documents to 
greatly inflate his income and ability to repay the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 There seems to be a lot more fraud than these few cases would suggest, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of mine in Woodland Hills said that when a contractor came to give an 
estimate on repairs to his house, which is riddled with earthquake cracks, the 
contractor first asked if he wanted an inflated estimate for his insurance 
company or "a real" work estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been saying all sorts of things to get more money," said Carol, a 
Reseda resident who prefers that her last name not be used. "Everyone is trying 
to do everything to get as much out of the earthquake as possible. I believe 
there was a lot of exaggeration." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol said she knows of people who claimed that they lost antiques when all 
they lost was some old junk. "People are getting (inflated) receipts for more 
money than they are actually spending," she said. "The result is that people 
aren't just fixing their homes, they are improving their homes with government 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be very difficult to determine if people actually are making repairs 
with money they get from the government," said Nora M. Manella, a U. S. 
attorney in Los Angeles. "It is going to be impossible to weed out every fraud 
claim." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be more arrests in the future, Manella said. If convicted, a person 
can be sentenced to five years in federal prison for making false statements in 
applying for federal aid -- even if the government never disburses any funds to 
the defendant. "FEMA's motto is that they are offering help to the needy, not 
the greedy," Manella said. "The U. S. attorney's office is here for the 
greedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only small businesses but individuals who have suffered earthquake damage 
can apply for Small Business Administration loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In cases of SBA loan fraud, "many of the prosecutions won't come up until 
there has been a default on a loan one or two years from now," said Deborah 
Jones, special agent in charge of the SBA's office of inspector general in 
Glendale. The agency has only now begun to cross-check some of its loan 
applications with tax returns filed with the Internal Revenue Service. There is 
no way to catch all the misstatements that are sure to be part of the 
overwhelming 100,000 applications for disaster assistance from residents, plus 
another 20,000 from businesses that have been filed in the first two months 
after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA is investigating 11 earthquake-related fraud cases for possible 
prosecution, Jones said. "Some people are claiming damage that never occurred," 
she said. But, those cases "on a smaller scale, we wouldn't be interested in 
prosecuting it." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are providing disaster assistance, there will always be people who 
will take advantage of the situation," said Frank Curran, FEMA's acting 
assistant inspector general for investigations in Washington. Curran repeated 
what other federal officials have been saying: "We're interested in the most 
egregious cases of wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 If it's a non-egregious case, but still one where somebody has "lied" about 
their financial needs, the case could be referred to a government agency for 
review, possibly to recoup the funds or just to stop any money being paid out 
to that individual. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy of going after the worst cases may be sensible. But plenty of 
small-scale fraud -- adding up to millions, and maybe billions, of dollars -- 
will go unchecked. The phone number to call and report fraud and abuse related 
to applications for federal and state aid is (800) 323-8603.

 Moviegoing took a dive on the Easter Sunday weekend and only one of the five 
new films attracted good, if not booming, business. That was "Major League II," 
from Warner Bros., starring Charlie Sheen.Opening to sluggish response were 
"Clifford," in seventh place, and "Thumbelina," in eighth. The other two 
debuting films didn't make the Top 10: The star-laden "The House of the 
Spirits" grossed $1.7 million and ranked 11th, and "Jimmy Hollywood," a film by 
Barry Levinson, took in only $1.5 million for 14th place.

3 WOUNDED IN SHOOTING AT VIETNAMESE CAFE; VIOLENCE: ATTACK BY THREE GUNMEN WHO 
FIRE INTO A GARDEN GROVE RESTAURANT IS THIRD SUCH INCIDENT IN COUNTY IN JUST 
OVER A WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A third shooting in just over a week at Vietnamese cafes left one person 
critically wounded Monday and two others hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7 p.m., three men with handguns approached the Cafe Truc Mai in the 
10500 block of Westminster Avenue, Sgt. Jack Ray said. One gunman ordered a 
customer inside to step outside. When he did, a short argument followed, 
witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men with guns then began shooting into the restaurant, and customers 
may have returned fire, Ray said. The gunmen ran. Police found 12 shell casings 
in the area and numerous bullet holes in the cafe's windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a man was critically wounded in the head. Another man was shot in 
the foot, and a woman was shot in the hand. All were hospitalized.  
</P>
<P>
 Police had not released the names of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 As investigators searched the dimly lit cafe with flashlights, three customers 
who appeared to be in their late teens sat in front of the cafe waiting for 
police to interview them. Nine people, including the manager, were in the cafe 
when the shooting began, Ray said. All were questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the Van Restaurant next door, which had not yet opened, said his 
cooks were preparing food when they heard popping sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was firecrackers," said the owner, who did not want to give his 
name. The Cafe Truc Mai, he added, is not a trouble spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first shooting there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they did not know if the shooting was gang-related, and that both 
the customers and management were hesitant and fearful of providing 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighborhood resident, who did not give his name, said gunfire is normally 
heard only on weekends but has increased over the past several years. "It's 
just getting worse and worse around here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen were described as age 20 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, an off-duty security guard from Los Angeles shot and killed one 
man and wounded another in apparent self-defense after he was assaulted by a 
group of people in a crowded cafe in the 9600 block of Bolsa Avenue in 
Westminster. Police said the cafe, Pho Tien Canh, had a history of disorderly 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinh Van Chu, 37, of Garden Grove died of his injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The security guard, who called police after the shooting, was not held or 
cited. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 27, two men walked into another crowded Vietnamese restaurant, the 
Cafe Mozart in Westminster, just before midnight, shot Le Quan Nguyen, 20, of 
Garden Grove to death and wounded three other people. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made in what police said was a gang-related incident. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 20, 1993, a shooting at the Gai Hoi Cafe in Fountain Valley, across 
the street from Westminster, left one man dead and two others wounded. Police 
arrested a 27-year-old Garden Grove man. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray could not explain why there had been such a rash of shootings at cafes.

'1 STRIKE' BILL ON SEX OFFENSES STALLS IN SENATE; LEGISLATURE: PANEL FINDS BILL 
MANDATING LIFE SENTENCES FOR RAPISTS, CHILD MOLESTERS TOO BROAD. BERGESON GETS 
MORE TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A key state Senate committee gave an Orange County lawmaker's "one strike" 
bill for sex offenders a testy reception Monday and threatened to water it 
down, but then put off a decision until later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first test for the measure, the Senate Judiciary Committee delayed a 
vote after state Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) asked that she be 
allowed to rework the bill in hopes of assuaging concerns of committee members. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson's bill, which she is carrying for Gov. Pete Wilson and has been 
dubbed "one strike and you're in for life," would require that rapists and 
child molesters spend life in prison without the possibility of parole after a 
single offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the Judiciary Committee argued that the bill was too broad 
and suggested that it be killed or softened by incorporating language from a 
competing measure carried by Assemblyman Bob Epple (D-Cerritos). Epple's 
measure would apply a life sentence without parole only when rape was committed 
during a kidnaping or residential burglary, plus either a weapon was used or a 
victim suffered great bodily harm. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with that fate, Bergeson asked the committee for more time, saying that 
the language in Epple's bill would undermine her measure's efforts to combat 
child molestation. The committee agreed, and asked Bergeson to work with Epple 
to fashion a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to delay action came after several rape victims told the 
committee their stories and pleaded for changes in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too late to help me, but not too late to help others," said one woman 
who was raped and tortured by her husband after she filed for divorce. Another 
woman, who still is grappling with the aftermath of a 1988 rape, said, "It may 
seem harsh to be putting someone in prison for a life sentence, but I and other 
victims of this crime will be serving life sentences." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson, meanwhile, noted that 250 rapists are released from state prison 
each month and said her bill is necessary to ensure perpetrators of sex crimes 
are "not given a chance to commit those crimes again." 
</P>
<P>
 But those arguments did little to sway the Democrat-dominated panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This measure is overly broad," said Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward). "This is 
an understandable emotional reaction to our trauma, but it's not good law." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics contend sentences for rape already are severe enough, noting that 
under existing law felons convicted for sex crimes routinely serve consecutive 
prison sentences for each conviction, with additional counts adding to their 
time behind bars. Rapists currently can be punished with a sentence of up to 
eight years for a single count, with additional time for more counts. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have suggested that the threat of life sentences for child molesters 
could have a chilling effect on families that might otherwise report a problem 
in their midst. Moreover, some say that life sentences for crimes such as date 
rape would be too severe. 
</P>
<P>
 Some also suggested that proponents of the bill have exaggerated the incidence 
of rapists repeating their crimes. A 15-year study completed in 1988 by the 
state Department of Justice found that one of five convicted sex offenders were 
arrested again for rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer said those findings tend to undermine arguments about repeat rapists. 
</P>
<P>
 "If four of five offenders don't re-offend, but you're willing to put them all 
away to get at the one in five, I don't know that that's justice," Lockyer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also predicted Bergeson's bill, combined with the recently approved "three 
strikes" measure for repeat felons, would put too great a strain on state 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bankrupting the state with all of these good intentions," Lockyer said.

FOR ONCE, LASORDA IS MUM; SMILING WAX FIGURE OF DODGERS MANAGER BOARDS FLIGHT 
FOR FLORIDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Tommy Lasorda, manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, drew more than the usual 
amount of stares as he was whisked through John Wayne Airport early Monday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, wearing his Dodger Blue uniform and sporting a suntan, looked pretty 
stiff. Even though he was smiling, he didn't say a word. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't because the Dodgers had just lost three games in a row to the 
California Angels in the Freeway Series. It wasn't because he was mad at Darryl 
Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Tommy Lasorda just wasn't himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was Lasorda's wax likeness that captured looks of surprise and 
delight as the figure was carted through the airport for a Delta Air Lines 
flight to Orlando, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The wax figure, created by Buena Park's Movieland Wax Museum, will be 
displayed at Dodgertown in Vero Beach, Fla., the spring training site for the 
Los Angeles baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the wax sculpture will return to the Southland to be part of an 
exhibit at Dodger Stadium that will include other ball players, said Mark 
Edwards, Movieland's general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Other "Dodger greats" will be molded into wax works of art for the stadium 
exhibit, said Edwards, who added that a wax sculpture of former Dodger pitcher 
Fernando Valenzuela has already been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dodgers spokeswoman said an unveiling ceremony of the Lasorda figure will be 
held in either late June or July at the stadium before a game. 
</P>
<P>
 At John Wayne Airport, jokes were flying like fastballs as airline passengers 
commented on the girth of Lasorda's wax figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's pretty slim -- is he still taking Slim-Fast?" mused Linda Hosokawa of 
Huntington Beach, referring to Lasorda's TV commercial pitching the diet plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosokawa, who was heading for a ski trip to Colorado, added: "I was wondering 
if he was ever going to move. He stayed smiling the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 Delta flight attendant Priscilla Hill joked as startled passengers walked by 
the Lasorda figure, which had an airline boarding pass in hand, to take their 
seats for the 8:35 a.m. flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's so happy and cheery so early in the morning," Hill laughed. "It's a 
pleasure to serve him!" 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards explained that the wax figure was being flown to Florida first-class 
for fear that its head might be damaged if it was shipped any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "A slight jar and it could ruin six months of artwork," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said that Lasorda's deep blue eyes were made of glass and are very 
fragile. He said that each strand of real human gray hair was placed on the 
head one hair at a time. "That process takes a month," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards added that the head was placed on a bendable upper torso so it could 
travel like a real person. 
</P>
<P>
 The wax body, however, was carefully packed in a crate and was shipped with 
the flight's other baggage. But Edwards did tote on board the wax hands in a 
cardboard box and the arms in a plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda hasn't seen his wax likeness, but after the public's first glimpse 
Monday, bystanders agreed that it will be a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Marguerite Kanaga, 69, of Costa Mesa, who was on her way to a family reunion 
in Topeka, Kan., said, "It's a very good likeness. I think he's a great guy -- 
and I think he'll enjoy seeing himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hardly wait to call back home and tell (family members) I flew with 
Tommy Lasorda."

REGIONAL EARNINGS: HOUSE OF FABRICS REPORTS SHARP DECLINE IN PROFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House of Fabrics Inc., a Sherman Oaks-based chain of fabric stores, said its 
fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell sharply from a year earlier, partly because 
of $1 million in expenses due to the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For the quarter ended Jan. 31, the company earned $212,000, down from $2.21 
million in the same period a year earlier.Revenue in the latest quarter 
declined 6%, to $147.6 million from $157.7 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's operating profit in the latest quarter was $4.12 million, but it 
incurred $3.1 million in interest expenses. Plus, the company was hurt by the 
earthquake, which damaged corporate headquarters and a number of its retail 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 For its fiscal year ended Jan. 31, House of Fabrics reported a loss of $29.5 
million, contrasted with a profit of $5.2 million in its previous fiscal year. 
The loss included a charge of $12.9 million for restructuring. Revenue in the 
latest fiscal year totaled $546.7 million, down slightly from $557.5 million a 
year earlier. The company said its bank debt and inventory were down and that 
it would continue to close unproductive stores.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: OROAMERICA REPORTS 71% PROFIT BOOST FOR QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OroAmerica Inc., a Burbank manufacturer and distributor of jewelry, said its 
fiscal fourth-quarter profit surged 71%, to $3.41 million from $2 million in 
the same quarter a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 For the three months ended Jan. 28, the company's revenue increased 3%, to 
$62.3 million from $60.5 million. The company attributed the strong earnings 
results to increased business with big retailers, such as Wal-Mart, and getting 
a better handle on its costs. 
</P>
<P>
 For its fiscal year ended Jan. 28, OroAmerica's profit doubled, to $8.2 
million from $4.02 million a year earlier. Revenue in the latest fiscal year 
totaled $203.4 million, up 16% from $176.1 million in its previous fiscal year.

 Benton Oil & Gas Loses $4.83 Million in 1993Benton Oil & Gas Co., an Oxnard 
energy concern, reported large losses for its fourth quarter and all of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's loss in the three months ended Dec. 31 totaled $2.14 million, 
compared to a $1.18-million loss a year earlier. Its quarterly revenue rose 8%, 
to $2.16 million from $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the year, Benton lost $4.83 million, while revenue fell 9%, to $7.81 
million. In 1992, the company lost $2.91 million on $8.63 million in revenue. 
It said the decrease in revenue was primarily due to lower domestic oil and gas 
production. It also noted that in 1993 domestic oil prices declined by about 
5%.

FOR SOME CONTRACTORS, BOOM EXPECTED AFTER QUAKE HAS BEEN BUST; CONSTRUCTION: 
PLENTY OF VALLEY BUILDINGS STILL NEED REPAIRS AND SOME FIRMS ARE DOING MORE 
BUSINESS. BUT INCREASED POST-DISASTER ACTIVITY DOESN'T ADD UP TO INSTANT CASH 
FOR ALL. 
</P>

 Small repair and construction firms in the San Fernando Valley expected their 
businesses to pick up from a flow of insurance and aid money for earthquake 
repairs. But most contractors say they are still waiting for the hoped-for boom 
to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done 50 (estimates), I've got a stack of them this high," said Rick 
Koester, an Agua Dulce general contractor, jamming his hand at eye level in the 
air. And contracts? "I've gotten five or so since the earthquake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koester, whose company, Lorick Construction, employs seven people, looked busy 
installing rebar in a Northridge ditch last week. But the block wall he was 
building turned out to belong to his parents -- Koester was doing them a good 
turn while waiting for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating to me because I'm out there spinning my wheels, running 
around trying to give competitive estimates," said Jeff Steele, owner of 
Reseda-based Artisan Concrete. "I would love to get to work."  
</P>
<P>
 Steele, who has a dozen employees, said that since the quake, his revenues are 
even with last year. But he expects his profit will be slightly lower than last 
year due to an unusually high number of estimates he makes on potential jobs 
that don't yield contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Steele said, about half of his estimates result in jobs, but lately 
he seems to get hired only about 10% of the time. The situation is all the more 
disappointing given the 80-hour weeks he's put in since January, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Zinke, executive officer of the Greater Los Angeles/Ventura chapter of the 
Building Industry Assn., said post-quake boomlet for repair businesses is far 
from a given. So much so, in fact, that the chapter recently offered a seminar 
to members on how to avoid going broke in the wake of a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to lose money," Zinke explained. "For a long time we've had an 
estimating boom and not a lot of jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Zinke's cautious view seems jarringly at odds with appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour the suburban neighborhoods of the north Valley these days, and you will 
lose count of damaged buildings in need of fixing. Chimneys swathed in plastic, 
boarded-up windows and piles of crumbled masonry dot every block. Each morning, 
the Ventura Freeway is jammed with cement trucks and mud-caked pickups creeping 
into the Valley, and by mid-morning, you can hear jackhammers echoing through 
residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, for some companies this has led to new business. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, there's Doug's U-Rent, a Woodland Hills company that rents all 
types of construction equipment to contractors. Manager John Newland said his 
revenues are up about 60% from the same time last year. And over the past week, 
the company's six employees have been busier than ever, he said. "Right off the 
bat we sent off all our generators. . . . Then it was jackhammers and 
compressors. It's been steady ever since," said Newland. 
</P>
<P>
 But increased activity following a disaster does not necessarily translate 
into instant cash for all construction businesses, said David Craven, marketing 
and sales director for the south Florida-based construction company 
Brookman-Fels. In the year after Hurricane Andrew, Brookman-Fels barely managed 
to break even, Craven said. Many smaller companies went under. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons? Small companies that boosted payrolls in anticipation of more 
work found it hard to sustain themselves through long waits for federal aid and 
insurance money, he said. Those that gave free estimates quickly found 
themselves overwhelmed by doing estimates and not repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Builders in the San Francisco area tell a similar story following the 1989 
Loma Prieta quake. "People who were counting on this big boom for business were 
sorely disappointed," said Gary Hambly, chief executive officer of the Building 
Industry Assn. of Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction companies here give a similar litany of post-disaster 
frustrations -- material shortages, long waits, lots of a small jobs and few 
big ones. But some say that doesn't fully explain a disappointing lack of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Noma, manager of Abraham Painting of Northridge, said she is perplexed 
that revenues now are about equal with the same time last year. The company has 
done about 50 quake-related estimates, but has only landed a handful of 
contracts, she said. Howard Frank, owner of Chatsworth-based Rent a Bin, a 
company that rents storage containers to homes and businesses, reports no 
significant rise in revenues compared to the same time last year -- just the 
usual spring cleaning rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone tells me the same thing -- they are being held up by insurance 
adjusters, claim checks, FEMA, the SBA," said Chuck Ganssle, owner of All-State 
Concrete Block Co. Inc. in Reseda. Ganssle, who has five employees, said his 
revenues have not increased since before the earthquake, and his expenses may 
be slightly higher because of all the free estimates he has done. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that insurance checks, Federal Emergency Management 
Agency aid and federal Small Business Administration loans are still in the 
pipeline for many homeowners. But that may not be the whole story. State Farm 
Insurance spokesman Tom Cordova said his company has already settled about 60% 
of projected earthquake-related claims, and the SBA said it has issued more 
than 4,000 checks. 
</P>
<P>
 What may also play a role in the delay is a certain coyness about repairs from 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Clem Phillips, for example, seems content to live with his crumbled block wall 
at his Northridge home for a while. He has taken several repair bids, but they 
are all high, he said. Maybe he will hire somebody this summer, he mused, maybe 
not. As for his cracked plaster inside, he'll probably fix that himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Quiroga, owner of Mike's Roofing Service of Van Nuys, said he is taken 
aback by the lack of urgency he detects in some would-be customers. "People say 
they are not going to do anything until summer," he said. "Even with the heavy 
rains, even with plastic on their roof." Quiroga's business saw no increase in 
revenue right after the quake, but in the last week or so, demand has 
increased. He now estimates revenues are up 20% over the same time last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite frustrations, local small repair businesses may be well positioned to 
take advantage of any boom that comes. Few contractors have done much hiring, 
relying instead on overtime to do the jobs on hand. And newcomers are not 
swarming into the repair business. Applications for licensing examinations for 
contractors in every category are down. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, there are signs that the repair business may be turning a 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Building permits issued by the city of Los Angeles have surged. More permits 
were issued in March than in January and February combined. The estimated value 
of those building projects is expected to hit $238.6 million, of which about 
$71 million is directly related to earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 March's surge isn't big enough to be called a turnaround, because for the 
first three months of the year there has been only slight increase in the value 
of construction jobs compared to the same time last year, according to Los 
Angeles city building officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But some contractors see plenty of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are not doing well, it's your problem. . . . There's more work than 
the local contractors can handle," said Complete Concrete owner Josh Peaslee, 
who runs his five-year-old contracting business with five employees out of his 
Tarzana home. 
</P>
<P>
 Peaslee said he has been working from 4:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. almost every day 
since the quake, and his revenues so far this year have jumped by half compared 
to last year. True, a lot of his work is giving estimates, and a smaller 
percentage of those than usual lead to jobs. But he is still landing more 
contracts than before quake, and he's certain that number will grow in coming 
months. So certain, in fact, that he and his wife are making plans to buy a new 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyndol James, owner of Simi Valley-based Cave Man Masonry, is so confident 
about his business that his wife recently quit her salaried job to stay home 
with their 5-month-old baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt about it," he said. "There's another two years of work out 
there."

CHEROKEE BANKING ON NEW LEADER FOR TURN-AROUND; CLOTHING: JOE ELLES, FORMERLY 
THE NO. 2 EXECUTIVE AT LEE APPAREL, HAS PARED DOWN THE LINE AND IS USING HIS 
CONTACTS TO WIN BACK MAJOR RETAILERS. BUT WHETHER CUSTOMERS BUY CHEROKEE'S NEW 
LOOK WILL NOT BE KNOWN UNTIL THE FALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Cherokee Inc. emerged from its bankruptcy reorganization in May, nothing 
has been quite the same at the women's clothing and shoe company. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess? jeans co-founder Georges Marciano and Saudi Arabian businessman 
Abdullah Taha Bakhsh have swooped up Cherokee's stock. Cherokee Apparel, the 
company's main division, is now being run by a team of former Lee Apparel 
executives. Even Cherokee's 20-year-old Indian head logo is history. 
</P>
<P>
 But will any of this turn the company's fortunes around? 
</P>
<P>
 That will be seen this summer when Cherokee, based in Sunland, tests its 
revived back-to-basics fashion strategy under Joe Elles, a 12-year veteran of 
Lee Apparel. 
</P>
<P>
 Since becoming president of Cherokee Apparel in September, Elles has discarded 
Cherokee's scattered array of clothing, including all of its dressy outfits and 
combination wear. Cherokee's new fall lineup, which will be shipped in May, 
instead focuses on a much-narrower line of jeans, casual pants and shirts for 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, they didn't stand for anything and they had everything," said 
Elles, 39. Before coming to Cherokee, Elles was Lee's vice president and 
general manager, the No. 2 post at the $1-billion jeans company. 
</P>
<P>
 Elles, known as a high-charging salesman, has used his industry connections to 
win back business for Cherokee from retailers such as Carter Hawley Hale 
Stores, operator of the Broadway chain. Carter Hawley and other big retailers 
had dropped Cherokee in recent years because of Cherokee's financial troubles 
and what they described as its lack of focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Hawley says it is now impressed with Cherokee's new system to replenish 
inventory of key pants on a weekly basis. Previously, Elles said, it took 
Cherokee as many as 12 weeks to restock store racks. 
</P>
<P>
 Broadway is just the sort of moderately priced department store in which Elles 
wants to position Cherokee. So he is curtailing business at discount stores and 
doing less with retailers such as Mervyn's, which at one time accounted for 25% 
of Cherokee Apparel's sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Elles is also cutting Cherokee's retail pants prices by $4 to $8 a pair. Elles 
dumped the Indian head logo because, he said, it added no value to the product, 
replacing it with more informative labels, which stress fit and fabric. And he 
plans to launch a $7-million ad campaign later this year, double last year's ad 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can get (customers) to try it on," Elles said, "we think they'll buy it 
because of the fit." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's a big if. Department stores are entrenched with a few big brands 
along with a clutter of private labels and also-rans. In women's jeans, for 
example, Elles is up against Lee, which dominates with almost 20% of that 
market, compared with 1% for Cherokee. In the casual pants market for women, J. 
C. Penney's private label is No. 1, followed by Levis' popular Dockers brand 
and then Cherokee. Cherokee Apparel also sells tops, but three-quarters of its 
business is in pants and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this time, the stores in America could get rid of half of the brands, and 
there'd still be enough to cover everybody," said Harry Bernard, a partner at 
Colton Bernard, an apparel consultant in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard says Cherokee has a well-recognized name and has built a good-size 
volume. He adds that Elles "is a hell of a salesman." But Cherokee has much to 
overcome, Bernard said. "The image of Cherokee was that it was everywhere. It 
was not a confined product, and it didn't have a specific niche." 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't focused. They were bottoms one time, tops one time. They had 
major distribution problems," said Bryant Phillips, general merchandising 
manager of Belk / Leggett, a Charlotte, N. C.-based retailer that operates 250 
department stores in the Southeast. Belk / Leggett dropped Cherokee two years 
ago, but Phillips said he liked what he has seen of the new Cherokee and is 
considering taking the brand back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We relied on the same thing for too long and the consumer rejected it," said 
Cary Cooper, who has been Cherokee's chief financial officer since 1988 and is 
one of the few executives who survived the shakeout at Cherokee. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Cherokee Inc.'s sales peaked at $237 million in its fiscal year that ended 
May, 1991, but sank to $157 million in the year that ended May, 1993. About 75% 
of Cherokee's sales have been from its apparel division; the rest have come 
from sales of shoes, licensing fees and specialty finishing work. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding Cherokee's problems was its massive debt and interest expenses, 
incurred in a $174-million leveraged buyout in 1989. The heavy debts forced 
Cherokee to file Chapter 11 protection in April, 1993. When the company emerged 
from bankruptcy court the following month, its $190-million debt and 
obligations were pared in half in a swap deal that gave creditors controlling 
interest in Cherokee's common stock. Shortly after, Robert Margolis, who led 
Cherokee's leveraged buyout, resigned as chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolis, who helped start Cherokee Apparel in 1983, also helped recruit 
Elles. Elles had risen through the ranks at Lee and, as the No. 2 man at Lee 
from 1991 to 1993, helped turn around the company by reassigning executives and 
pushing for more ads aimed at such events as the Super Bowl. By all accounts, 
Elles had a bright future at Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone I counseled with told me I shouldn't go," said Elles, who spends his 
weekends in Wisconsin, where his family still lives. "But I decided to because 
I thought Cherokee's brand franchise was still healthy . . . and the chance to 
be president, and to turn a company around. That was a great challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Elles came to Cherokee on a two-year contract that includes stock options if 
the company succeeds. To help him, Elles has hired half a dozen executives from 
Lee to run Cherokee's sales operations, and he has brought in designers from 
fashion names such as Liz Claiborne. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elles says his goal is to make Cherokee profitable in its next fiscal year 
ending in May, 1995. But it won't be easy. For the six months that ended Nov. 
27, its latest reporting period, Cherokee posted a loss of $4.6 million on 
sales of $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Elles hopes to boost revenue with products such as jeans, which Cherokee had 
never gotten heavily into before. Elles says Cherokee's pants will cost 10% 
less than Lee's and 25% less than Levis'. "We'll have the best value in the 
marketplace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But rivals say growth for Cherokee is anything but certain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to gain market share in such a competitive field," said 
Marcia Griffith, vice president of consumer product development at Lee Apparel, 
based in Merriam, Kan. Griffith said she had not seen Cherokee's fall lineup, 
but added: "It takes all the right pieces," including the right marketing and 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you try to fit someone new in, you have to knock someone out. And that's 
not easy," said Phillips, the Belk / Leggett executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Cherokee has plenty of other supporters. Marciano, the former 
chairman of Guess?, owns about 20% of Cherokee's common stock, and Saudi 
Arabian businessman Bakhsh bought 12% in the fall through his investment 
company. Both men reported buying Cherokee for investment purposes, but 
Marciano's purchase stirred speculation that he will take an active role in the 
company, prompting others to give Cherokee a second look. 
</P>
<P>
 One other prominent investor who owns about 15% of Cherokee's stock is Lion 
Advisors, a Los Angeles partnership formed by financier Leon Black and other 
former bankers of leveraged-buyout specialist Drexel Burnham, once headed by 
junk-bond king Michael Milken. Lion Advisors has two representatives on 
Cherokee's seven-member board, but it declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Elles, for his part, said he believes that Marciano will remain just an 
investor. As for Lion Advisors, Elles said: "They're very astute and they're an 
asset to have."

3 OUT OF 5 LOCAL STOCKS DECLINE IN 1ST QUARTER; INVESTING: OVERALL LOSS OF 3.5% 
REFLECTS THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE AND THE RECENT REVERSAL IN THE BROAD MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three out of five stocks in the region lost ground in the first quarter, 
reflecting the effects of the Northridge earthquake and the wave of frenzied 
selling in the overall market last week. Many analysts expect the downward 
trend to continue in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The local area's stocks, which represent 102 mostly smaller companies in the 
San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Conejo valleys and Ventura County, declined by 
3.5% overall in the three months ended March 31. Like the broader market, 
stocks in interest-sensitive sectors such as savings-and-loans and 
financial-services companies fared poorly, whereas stocks of health-care and 
semiconductor concerns turned in a solid performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3.5% decline in the value of local stocks was in tandem with several 
broader measures of the stock market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average of 30 
industrial blue-chip stocks dropped 3.2%. The Nasdaq composite index, which 
includes about 4,000 stocks of mostly smaller companies, skidded 4.3%, while 
the Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 industrial stocks was down 4.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, analysts viewed the stock market decline as a correction, set in 
by concerns about rising interest rates, festering political problems at the 
White House and a growing number of foreign crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Among local stocks, especially hard-hit were insurance stocks following the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, led by home and auto insurer 20th Century Industries, whose 
stock plummeted 29%, to $19.50 at the end of the quarter from $27.38 at the 
start of the year. 20th Century, based in Woodland Hills, estimated earthquake 
claims at $325 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Even insurers that reported no earthquake losses had a fallout from the latest 
disaster. "The earthquake precipitated the fall and it just hasn't been the 
same since," said Cary Cheldin, executive vice president of Unico American, 
another property-casualty insurer in Woodland Hills. Despite increased revenue 
and earnings in recent quarters, Unico's stock closed the first quarter at 
$5.75, down 25%. "The drop doesn't reflect our performance. I think it reflects 
emotions in the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 102 local stocks, 61 posted declines in the first quarter while 34 
advanced. Seven finished unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, the big winners included health-care and technology companies. Issues 
of Health Systems International, the new holding company of Woodland 
Hills-based Health Net and QualMed of Colorado, which recently merged, surged 
56% in the quarter, to $26.25 from $16.88 a share. The merger earlier this year 
brought together two health-maintenance organizations with vastly different 
operating cultures, but it also created a huge HMO, with about 1.4 million 
members, which analysts say should benefit as the country heads toward national 
health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Other health-care stocks that did well included Summit Health, the 
Burbank-based operator of nursing-care and retirement centers, whose stock 
edged up 7% to close the quarter at $9.13 a share. Wellpoint Health Networks, 
the Woodland Hills-based managed-care provider owned by Blue Cross of 
California, initially shot up to more than $35 a share earlier in the quarter 
but then dropped when nervousness set in last week, closing the quarter at 
$31.38, about the same as it was at the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the top five local performers were semiconductor companies -- Diodes 
Inc. and Vitesse Semiconductor. Both stocks increased 39% in the last quarter. 
Diodes, a Chatsworth supplier of semiconductor rectifiers, finished at $7.50 a 
share, up from $5.38, and Camarillo-based Vitesse jumped to $5.38 from $3.88. 
Both companies reported better financial results in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more strong showings locally were turned in by With Design in Mind, a 
Chatsworth toy company, and Huntway Partners, a Valencia-based firm that 
supplies liquid asphalt to the construction industry. Shares in both companies 
-- which have been recovering nicely from severe financial problems last year 
-- doubled in value in the first quarter: Huntway to $2.75 a share and With 
Design to $2. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest loser last quarter was Citadel Holding Corp., the Glendale-based 
parent of troubled Fidelity Federal Bank. Its stock lost more than half of its 
value, dropping to $5.50 at the end of the quarter from $11.75 on Dec. 31. 
Citadel, which has been struggling with the state's miserable real estate 
market, recently reported that it lost $67 million in 1993, in contrast with a 
$2-million profit in 1992. Making matters worse, earlier this month Citadel 
said Chase Manhattan Bank, one of its creditors, had filed suit against Citadel 
to block it from restructuring its savings-and-loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors' jitters about rising interest rates was also felt by Great Western 
Financial Corp. The Chatsworth-based parent of the nation's second-largest S&L 
saw its stock price slide 19%, to $16.13 a share from $20. Similarly, issues of 
Glendale Federal declined 23%, to $5.50 from $7.13. 
</P>
<P>
 Among notable local companies that rode Wall Street's roller-coaster ride last 
quarter were Thousand Oaks-based biotechnology giant Amgen Inc., which dropped 
23% to $38.25 from $49.50 at the start of the year; Superior Industries, the 
Van Nuys-based wheel maker, down 18% to $35 from $42.75, and Players 
International, the Calabasas-based operator of riverboat casinos, down 16% to 
$20.75 from $24.75. 10 Biggest Regional Stock Winners for 1st Quarter

<P>
 International Remote Imaging Systems Inc., a Chatsworth-based manufacturer of 
clinical laboratory equipment, reported record profits and sales for its fourth 
quarter and for 1993.

 In the fourth quarter, the company's profit was $418,349, up 41% from $295,691 
for the same period a year earlier. Its revenue in the fourth quarter rose 13% 
to $2.67 million.

<P>
 Fortune Petroleum Corp., an Agoura Hills energy concern, reported larger net

 Fortune's loss in the latest quarter totaled $3.56 million, in contrast with a 
year-earlier loss of $288,000. Its quarterly revenue rose 54%, to $892,000 from

 Camera Platforms International Inc., a Valencia maker of production equipment 
for the television and movie industries, reported a $592,000 net loss for its 
fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 A year before, the company lost $608,000. Its revenue in the latest quarter 
was $1.09 million, an 81% increase from $599,000 in revenue in the final three 
months of 1992.

 For all of 1993, Camera Platforms lost $1.9 million, while its revenue 
declined 9%, to $3.5 million. In 1992, it lost $1.09 million on $3.85 million 
in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its revenue fell primarily because of lower sales of its 
Lightmaker lighting ballasts. Inventory and asset write-downs totaling about 
$600,000 contributed to its net losses, it said.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: METAL BELLOWS DIVISION SALE IN MOORPARK TO COST 120 JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 120 Ventura County jobs will be lost as a result of the sale of most of 
the Moorpark division of Metal Bellows, a producer of parts used in aerospace 
and heavy industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Metal Bellows' parent, Parker Hannifin Corp., closed a deal last week to sell 
almost all of the Moorpark operation and a sister unit in Sharon, Mass., to 
Chicago-based Senior Flexonics Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker Hannifin, based in Cleveland, is best known as a producer of industrial 
and aerospace control devices. The company said it sold the bellows division 
because it is downsizing its involvement in aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker Hannifin announced in February that it was negotiating with several 
potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the purchase were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark plant produces aerospace bellows, which control the flow of air 
through jet aircraft engines. The division also turns out specialty hoses used 
in the nuclear energy and space fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Work being done at Metal Bellows' Moorpark plant will be moved to other Senior 
Flexonics sites, including the newly acquired Sharon facility, over the next 
several months, according to a Senior Flexonics official who asked not to be 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said the Moorpark employees will be laid off as their work is 
phased out over the next several months. They will be offered severance 
benefits and out-placement assistance, the official added. "A few people will 
be offered a chance to transfer to our plants in the Midwest or the East, but I 
can't say how many will get the offer," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 One small part of the Moorpark operation that was excluded from the sale makes 
ducting products and metal assemblies. D. E. Logan, a Parker Hannifin spokesman 
in Cleveland, said he did not know how many workers are employed in the unsold 
part of the division, but said he expected that portion to be sold to another 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Flexonics is a subsidiary of Senior Engineering Group, an international 
engineering firm based in Rickmansworth, England.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: AMGEN MOVES UP TO 304TH IN 1994 FORTUNE 500 LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's only entry on the Fortune 500 list, Amgen Inc., moved up 22 
notches in the 1994 ranking of America's largest industrial corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks biotechnology concern placed 304th on this year's list, up 
from 326th in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In sales, which determine a company's ranking, Amgen reported $1.306 billion 
last year, a 24% increase over 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In other categories, the concern ranked 63rd in profits ($383.3 million), 
229th in assets ($1.765 billion) and fifth in profits as a percentage of sales 
(29.3%). 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen tops the entire list in return to investors over the past 10 years, with 
an average annual return of 45%. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, however, the company came in a dismal 410th in return to investors, 
with shareholders suffering a 29.9% loss in their stock. 
</P>
<P>
 That last point prompts Fortune to ask: "Is red-hot Amgen, tops in 10-year 
total return to investors, cooling off? Sales of Epogen, its market-leading 
kidney treatment, have begun to slow down."

DESERT DIG; U. S. BORAX STILL MINES 'WHITE GOLD,' BUT MUCH HAS CHANGED BENEATH 
THE SURFACE FOR THE COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In some ways, it's still the good old days at U.S. Borax Inc., just like when 
Ronald Reagan hosted the company's "Death Valley Days" TV show in the 1960s and 
hawked Boraxo soap. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been more than a century since U. S. Borax first mined ore from Death 
Valley and 67 years since it plumbed the depths of the Mojave Desert here in 
Boron, a tiny town 120 miles northeast of Los Angeles, to extract ore from one 
of the world's largest minable deposits of borax mineral. A few of the famous 
20-mule-team wagons are preserved at the edge of the open pit mine. The pit 
itself just keeps getting bigger -- it's over a mile from lip to lip in any 
direction and 660 feet at its deepest point, big enough to swallow 10 Rose 
Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time U. S. Borax pulls all the ore out of this mine, half a century 
from now, 20 Rose Bowls will fit inside the hole. Day after day, the company 
extracts the white crystalline ore from the ground, smashes it to powder and 
ships it around the world to producers of everything from fiberglass to 
fertilizer to laundry detergent. 
</P>
<P>
 But beneath the surface, much has changed. U. S. Borax is now headquartered in 
Valencia, and the company with an Old West heritage is run by Oxford-educated 
Brit Ian White-Thomson, and it isn't even American-owned, having been acquired 
in 1968 by London-based RTZ Corp., the world's largest mining concern. RTZ sold 
the Boraxo, Borateem and 20 Mule Team soap business in 1988 to Dial Corp. And 
while U. S. Borax still commands half of worldwide borax sales, bringing in 
$500 million in revenue annually, competition from lower-cost producers such as 
Turkey has whittled away at the company's former stranglehold on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's more U.S. Borax's job has gotten tougher the past few years because 
weak American and European economies dampened consumer spending on products 
containing borax. A slow pace of housing starts in the United States has been 
particularly damaging to borax sales because one of its biggest uses is in 
building insulation materials. 
</P>
<P>
 So U. S. Borax has to dig faster, push harder and be more resourceful than 
ever. The mule teams, of course, were long ago replaced by freight trains and 
ocean barges. The mine and plant are now computer-controlled, and run by half 
as many employees as in the early 1980s. Company scientists tinker in high-tech 
labs next to the mine and in Valencia, seeking refinements and new uses of the 
"white gold." Rather than compete on price, U. S. Borax has invested in service 
and quality improvements. It has nearly eliminated the black specks in the 
white borax powder to please customers who want the purest product possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, U. S. Borax has been a steady contributor to RTZ, helping to 
offset the sometimes wild fluctuations in RTZ's other operations. Formerly 
named Rio Tinto-Zinc, the British company also has a historied past dating to 
the 19th Century and the Rio Tinto copper mine in Spain. It now has $5 billion 
in annual sales, with operations spanning the globe, including mining for gold, 
silver, iron and zinc. RTZ's Borax production -- the vast majority of which is 
from the Boron mine -- contributed $108 million in profit to RTZ's $367 million 
in net income in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Borax is considered so reliable that it elicits yawns from financial 
analysts who follow RTZ. "It's quite big, but it's a relatively stable part of 
RTZ's business," said analyst Jack Jones at the London investment banking firm 
UBS Ltd. "That's why most people don't pay attention to it." Analyst Vahid 
Fahti at Kemper Securities Inc. in Chicago calls U. S. Borax "boring, but 
rather rewarding." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which doesn't bother White-Thomson a whit. He's learned that borax isn't a 
scintillating dinner party subject. Typically after informing someone that the 
company no longer makes soap, he said, "that's the end of the conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, White-Thomson knows he can't sit still. Not long ago, U. S. Borax "had 
a reputation for being fat," said Michael McCoy, managing editor at Chemical 
Marketing Reporter, a weekly trade newspaper. Lately, White-Thomson said, 
"we've been getting rid of the fat." 
</P>
<P>
 Total employment at U. S. Borax has been cut by more than half since 1982, 
from 2,400 to 1,100, with most of the company's workers now in Boron. Daily 
production has grown by 20% in the past decade. The company attributes that in 
part to better training. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also because U. S. Borax keeps upgrading to bigger, more efficient 
equipment. Soon, the electric shovels used to scoop up ore -- now big enough to 
dig a swimming pool in about two scoops -- will be replaced by larger ones. The 
170-ton dump trucks that carry ore from the bottom of the mine will be 
supplanted by 250-tonners. Huge storage domes were erected at Boron to assure 
customers of a constant supply. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has cut energy costs by building its own cogeneration plants and 
selling the power it does not use. It has reduced inventory expenses by storing 
supplies with its vendors, rather than on-site. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mine and adjacent processing plant, hardly a speck of borax goes to 
waste. Mounds of the stuff are dampened to prevent desert winds from stirring 
up clouds of borax dust. Catch basins and drainage ditches carry runoff water 
to huge ponds, which are allowed to evaporate so that the borax can be 
reclaimed. The plant itself functions like a giant washing machine, cleaning 
and blending the crushed ore; additional processing is done at a dockside plant 
in Wilmington, and then the borax powder is shipped around the world to the 
company's many industrial customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest group of U. S. Borax customers, fiberglass makers such as 
Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., use borax to strengthen building insulation 
materials and fiberglass auto bodies. General Electric Co. adds it to light 
tubes because of its heat-resistant qualities. Borax is used in porcelain 
enamel, test tubes and baking dishes. It helps melt metals. Plants need small 
amounts of the mineral to live and, in larger quantities, it's a herbicide. In 
cosmetics and eyedrops, borax and boric acid are antiseptics; in soap powder, 
borax acts as a bleach. 
</P>
<P>
 To expand its customer base, U. S. Borax is hoping to persuade manufacturers 
to put borax in container glass. It's encouraging a new, environmentally 
friendly process of making paper using borax. Another relatively new borax 
product that's gaining acceptance kills termites in lumber but is not toxic to 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Long term, the company plans to step up marketing to developing countries. 
Half of its sales are in the United States, and Europe is its main foreign 
market. Asia has the biggest potential for growth, although analysts warn that 
those countries could be slow to develop. But if every person in China had a 
porcelain enamel cup, White-Thomson said, "the borax industry would boom." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that reruns of old television shows are popular, U. S. Borax even hopes to 
milk more money out of "Death Valley Days" by licensing about 400 episodes to a 
broadcast or cable network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Death Valley Days" began as a radio program featuring sentimental tales of 
the Old West. In the late 1950s, it moved to television. Reagan hosted and 
sometimes acted in the show from 1962 to late 1965, invariably opening with a 
plug for the 20 Mule Team products, such as Boraxo soap and Borateem laundry 
powder. In one 1964 tear-jerker, "A Tribute to a Dog," Reagan starred as a 
good-hearted lawyer with political aspirations who represents a boy whose dog 
was killed. Reagan left the show, his last acting job, to run for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 It says something about the quiet nature of U. S. Borax's business that the 
company is still best known for the old television show. But by the time U. S. 
Borax sold the soap business six years ago, it had become a chain around the 
company's neck. The huge mining concern just wasn't set up to be an effective 
consumer products marketer, White-Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. Borax also stumbled a few years ago with an attempt to expand beyond 
borax to mining for molybdenum, a metal element used as an anti-corrosive alloy 
in steel production. After spending $100 million trying to win government 
approval over the objections of environmentalists for a molybdenum mine in 
Alaska, the company was forced to abandon its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The mining concern's roots date to 1872 with the discovery of borax in Nevada; 
borax was then used mostly in ceramics and gold processing. Mining operations 
began in Death Valley in the 1880s after, as legend has it, Aaron and Rosie 
Winters officially discovered borax there when they poured sulfuric acid and 
alcohol on some ore. As he set a match to it and watched it turn green, 
revealing the presence of borax, Winters is said to have shouted: "She burns 
green, Rosie! We're rich, by God!" 
</P>
<P>
 From 1883 to 1889, the Harmony Borax Works -- a predecessor to U. S. Borax -- 
used the 20-mule teams to haul 10-ton loads of borax across "165 miles of 
thirsty, uninhabited, largely roadless desolation," Harold O. Weight wrote in 
his book, "20 Mule Team Days in Death Valley." In Mojave, the borax was loaded 
on freight trains. Tales abounded of men dying in the heat, according to 
Weight, and the summer sun was so intense that wagons were idled from June to 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmony Borax Works closed in the late 1880s because of financial troubles, 
but the 20-mule teams became the corporate symbol for the next owner of the 
Death Valley property, Pacific Coast Borax Co., which later became U. S. Borax. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1920s, the company acquired the Boron site, where borax reserves 
were found to dwarf all others. Although borax is a ubiquitous mineral, large 
deposits are rare because it tends to dissipate in ground water. In Boron, the 
borax had been preserved between salt on the bottom and clay on the top. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Boron mine, life went unchanged for many years. Workers lived in 
company-owned housing, saw movies at a company theater and drank at a company 
saloon, but these were all swallowed by the expanding mine in 1964. Some of the 
mine workers still live in Boron, population 2,000, but many also now live in 
Lancaster, Palmdale, Tehachapi and Barstow. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Leach, a 29-year U. S. Borax veteran, and his family are throwbacks to 
earlier days at the mine. His father was a company millwright; his son now 
operates equipment in the pit. His brother and brother-in-law also work here. 
</P>
<P>
 When Leach started at U. S. Borax, most workers had relatives at the mine, and 
you had to watch what you said because the person you were talking to "might be 
somebody's mother, or sister, or brother-in-law." It was a time, he recalled, 
when "you wanted for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, most employees are trained on computers. Space shuttles pass 
overhead as they come in for landings at nearby Edwards Air Force Base. And 
Leach's son-in-law was laid off from the mine a while back, part of the 
company's belt-tightening.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: AMERIGON LANDS RIGHTS TO RADAR TECHNOLOGY FOR CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amerigon Inc. said it acquired an exclusive, worldwide license to a patented 
radar technology for cars that was developed by Lawrence Livermore National 
Laboratory. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Amerigon, based in Burbank, is a start-up company that is using aerospace and 
defense technologies to create advanced automotive components. 
</P>
<P>
 The radar technology, Amerigon said, has the potential to dramatically reduce 
the cost of radar safety products for cars. The royalty-bearing license allows 
Amerigon to incorporate the radar technology into new products, including 
back-up warning and "blind spot" warning devices for drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other products that could use the technology, Amerigon said, include one that 
will automatically adjust cruise-control systems to maintain a constant 
distance between vehicles, and an air-bag activator for side-impact collisions.

COUNTY RESIDENTS HEALTHIER THAN MOST, STATE FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County residents are healthier than most other Californians, according 
to state figures released Monday that depict the county death rate as below the 
statewide average and continuing to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the leading causes of death -- cancer and stroke -- are claiming lives 
at a much lower rate here, although the state as a whole is also seeing an 
improvement, according to the state Department of Health Services report. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Orange County ranks in the bottom half of the state's 58 counties 
for the death rate of another major killer, coronary heart disease, the ailment 
is declining here. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, deaths from accidental injuries are lower in Orange County than in 
three-fourths of the counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few negative findings: Orange County's death rate from homicides and 
motor vehicle crashes, and the incidence of AIDS and tuberculosis, are on the 
upswing. 
</P>
<P>
 These were some highlights of comparative mortality and morbidity statistics 
the state has compiled for 1990 through 1992, ranking counties by their rate of 
disease or death per 100,000 population while making statistical adjustments 
for differences in population age. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar report for 1989 through 1991 was released by the state health agency 
a year ago, with the objective of tracking the progress the state is making 
toward meeting national health goals for the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Orange County's average annual mortality rate from sickness or 
disease for 1990 through 1992 was 14,597, or 414.9 deaths per 100,000. That was 
better than the statewide average of 479.6, and below an average rate of 432.5 
for Orange County in 1989 through 1991. The state death rate also declined from 
495 per 100,000 in the earlier three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Mono County had the lowest death rate in the state, with 314 deaths per 
100,000. The worst rate was 637 in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. George Rutherford, deputy director of prevention services for the state, 
attributed California's overall strong showing partly to "very aggressive 
anti-smoking campaigns" and laws requiring the use of automobile seat belts, 
child car seats and motorcycle helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 The state report ranked the counties for major causes of death, placing 
counties with the lowest death rates at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County was in the top quartile for everything but breast cancer, 
coronary heart disease and infant mortality," noted Sheila Dumbauld, research 
manager for the planning and data analysis section of the state Department of 
Health Services.  
</P>
<P>
 She said she assumed that Orange County "does very well in most indicators 
probably because it is a wealthy county and people can afford to get health 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 However, county health officials disputed her interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks good, but I have no idea what it means," said Tom Uram, director of 
the Orange County Health Care Agency. "Like many other counties, we have 
pockets of poverty, AIDS and homelessness." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh Stallworth, Orange County's new public health officer, said the state 
report doesn't put him at ease. "Does it mean we should fold up our tents? I 
don't think so," he said. "We have AIDS and tuberculosis to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 The report showed there was an annual average of 472 new diagnosed cases of 
AIDS in 1990 through 1992, a rate of 19.1 per 100,000 population, up from an 
average of 397 new cases per year from 1989 through 1991, which is a rate of 
16.4 per 100,000 population. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a yearly average of 316 new TB cases was reported in Orange County 
from 1990 through 1992, or 12.8 cases per 100,000 population, up from 280 cases 
in 1989 through 1991, at a rate of 11.6 cases per 100,000 population. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallworth said there are other preventable deaths that he wants the county to 
address, such as the drowning of children in swimming pools that are not 
properly fenced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see cutting back on our public health programs," he said. "Just 
because we are in the top quartile of the state doesn't give me any peace or 
make me feel terribly wonderful. . . . Quite frankly it doesn't change the way 
we do business." O.C.'s Health Report Card 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's death rate ranks eighth lowest among the state's 58 counties. 
Deaths from lung cancer, breast cancer and coronary heart disease also are on 
the decline, making Orange County one of the healthiest counties in the state.

2 STUDIES FUEL ARGUMENTS FOR PROPANE VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Propane is emerging as the fuel of the future for fleets of government and 
private industry vehicles, according to officials conducting two tests done in 
Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 The tests, sanctioned by the Environmental Protection Agency, involved a 
propane-powered patrol car from the Laguna Beach Police Department and an 
Orange County Transit Authority bus powered by a diesel engine modified to burn 
propane. Although the police car had problems with stalling, the studies both 
determined that propane burns significantly cleaner than other alternative 
fuels, including natural gas and methanol, and more than two times cleaner than 
gasoline and diesel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fallout from these studies can go nationwide, as concerns about the 
environment continue to grow. And there's no reason for us to worry about fuel 
supplies. We have enough natural gas reserves in the United States to carry us 
300 years into the future," said Roger Wheeler, technical services manager for 
Mutual Propane, a Gardena-based company involved in the OCTA study. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA-sanctioned study of one bus in particular is comparing propane to 
diesel fuel. It found that propane burned cleaner than natural gas and 
significantly cleaner than diesel.  
</P>
<P>
 In a completely separate study of six buses by the OCTA, propane, compressed 
natural gas and liquefied natural gas are being compared as alternative fuels 
to diesel. The final results of that five-year study aren't known yet, but 
officials are encouraged by the results of propane use. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA has operated several dozen propane-powered vehicles for more than a 
decade, and the EPA tests bolstered the agency's decision years ago to go with 
propane as an alternative fuel, spokesman John Standiford said. About 260 OCTA 
vans and supervisors' vehicles, 25% of the total OCTA fleet, are powered by 
propane. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for six test buses that are being used in a separate five-year study of 
alternative fuels, most OCTA buses run on diesel fuel. There is not a 
propane-powered engine on the market large and powerful enough to power a bus, 
Standiford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Methanol was used early in the study but was replaced with liquefied natural 
gas when it was determined that methanol, touted as the fuel of the future in 
the 1970s, causes significant engine damage. Unburned methanol mixes with oil 
inside an engine and dilutes its lubricating quality, causing engine parts to 
rub together. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While OCTA officials are enthusiastic about the test results to date, Laguna 
Beach Police Department officials said the test of one of their cars shows some 
glitches still need to be worked out before a propane-powered engine for police 
cars can be perfected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little early to tell how successful this is going to be. We're 
experiencing some problems," Laguna Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. said. 
"We've had some of our propane-powered cars stall while responding to emergency 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, cars have sputtered and died when the engines are idling. When 
that happens, officers have to wait 15 minutes before restarting the car, 
Purcell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the line of work, clearly we cannot have cars idling and dying and then 
have to wait 15 minutes before starting the car again," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Purcell said he hoped the problems can be overcome and eventually 
police cars throughout the country will be powered by propane.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of these problems are so great that they can't be worked 
out," he said. Other cities are using propane-powered patrol cars without 
significant problems, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Laguna Beach police cruisers are propane-powered, and the city has 
received a $31,000 grant from the South Coast Air Quality Management District 
to convert 11 more cars to propane, Purcell said. Each conversion costs between 
$2,500 and $2,700, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that there are natural gas-burning engines on the market by 1996, 
OCTA officials estimate that buses powered by natural gas will cost between 
$240,000 and $260,000 each, compared to $220,000 for diesel-powered buses. 
Buses powered by liquefied natural gas and compressed natural gas are expected 
to cost about $260,000 each, while propane buses will cost about $240,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Lonyai, technical projects specialist at OCTA, said that compressed 
natural gas and liquefied natural gas are viable as alternative fuels but 
involve added costs. Compressed gas would have to be stored in massive 
high-pressure tanks, while liquefied gas must be stored at temperatures not 
exceeding minus 258 degrees Fahrenheit.  
</P>
<P>
 Another drawback to using natural gas as fuel is that it reduces the driving 
range of buses to about 300 miles per tank, compared to about 400 miles for 
diesel. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they are hopeful that a propane-burning engine large enough for 
a bus will be developed soon.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Haden, project engineer for Caterpillar in Lafayette, Ind., said the 
company is working with Lonyai and other OCTA officials to develop it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working together toward this goal for almost two years," Haden 
said. "I can't tell you when we're going to get a propane engine certified. 
There's a lot of bureaucracy involved in getting a certification." 
</P>
<P>
 Standiford said he is "encouraged by everything we've seen. We already have 
the technology to operate a small propane engine cost-effectively. There is 
still a bit of development needed to manufacture a larger engine for buses."  
</P>
<P>
 Since the federal EPA does not have regulations to certify a propane engine, 
most natural gas engines used in vehicles throughout the United States are 
certified by the California Air Resources Board, Haden said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; ODEH STATUE TO BE UNVEILED AT LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bronze statue of Alex Odeh, a prominent Palestinian American activist who 
was killed in a 1985 bomb attack, will be unveiled Sunday in front of the Main 
Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of people are expected to attend the unveiling, including Odeh's 
widow, Norma, and television and radio personality Casey Kasem, who helped 
raise $25,000 to erect the statue. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasem on Monday said that Odeh "was an extraordinary man. He was a 
philosophical poet, a man who was not afraid to speak out in the tradition of 
Henry David Thoreau, Gandhi, Cesar Chavez and Martin Luther King. He was truly 
a great leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Odeh was the West Coast regional director of the American Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee and spokesman for the Arab American community. 
Odeh would have turned 50 this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statue is important to remind people that this country has the First 
Amendment," Kasem said. "This is a country where you can say what you believe, 
(and we) all have a responsibility as citizens in this country to speak out" 
against intolerance, discrimination and prejudice, as Odeh did. 
</P>
<P>
 Local politicians including Mayor Daniel H. Young and several City Council 
members are also expected to attend. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; RESIDENTS STILL FIGHTING MANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who wants to build a mansion that would be almost 7,000 square feet and 
would have two two-car garages, a cabana, a billiard room and a pool on an 
estate-sized lot has his neighbors rankled even though they too have homes 
worth millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Q. Nicholson has been trying for a year to build his four-bedroom home 
on his 29,000-square-foot lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But his neighbors don't want one of the garages -- the detached one -- to be 
too close to the front property line, and they don't him to build tennis 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson wants to build one of the garages 30 feet from his property line. 
That requires City Council approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors fear that Nicholson, who last year proposed to build two tennis 
courts on his property, is planning to build the courts in the back yard of his 
two-story custom stucco house. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson has already changed plans for his home once, following neighbors' 
complaints that the windows of the home would afford a direct view of their 
properties, invading their privacy. He revised the plans so the home would have 
smaller windows facing his estate, which includes a 10,000-square-foot back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson also dropped plans for tennis courts after residents in the area 
last year opposed the plan because the lighting would brighten their normally 
dark neighborhood. The city does not allow street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents told the City Council recently they are afraid Nicholson will 
eventually build tennis courts in his large back yard. Nicholson did not tell 
the City Council whether he would. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, residents complained that Nicholson's proposed tennis courts, with 
400-watt lights on 22-foot-high fixtures, would illuminate the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 At last month's council meeting, area resident Charles Davis asked the City 
Council to postpone voting on Nicholson's request until neighbors study the new 
plan for the house. "This is a controversial issue," Davis said. "This is not 
something that should be an automatically rubber-stamped project." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicholson told the City Council: "I've bent over backward to redesign this 
house. . . . I don't think (the house) is anything out of the ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson, president of Nicholson Land Co. Inc., said he would talk to his 
neighbors about his plan. The council is expected to make a decision April 26.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; MOBILE HOME RENT PACT TO BE CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to stabilize rents at mobile home parks goes before the City 
Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the plan doesn't include the rent rollbacks that park tenants 
consider vital.An attorney for the renters said Monday that his clients were 
not likely to accept the pact without rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a major problem on our hands here," attorney Thomas Whaling said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 10-year lease would affect the more than 1,200 mobile home 
tenants in Lake Forest. The rent agreement could be passed as an ordinance or 
be subject to approval from both landlords and tenants in the city's four 
mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it doesn't return rents to their 1989 levels, the rollback sought by 
tenants, the proposed lease does limit rent increases to the consumer price 
index. 
</P>
<P>
 Rent hikes would be no larger than increases in the price index. Only 70% of a 
consumer price index increase of 7% or more could be passed along to tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Whaling said that mobile home renters have seen excessive increases 
in the past five years. Without rollbacks, any future space fee hikes would be 
piled on top of already excessive rents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to leave out rollbacks was made by a council subcommittee that 
has met with landlords and tenants over the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The subcommittee felt that it comes down to whether government should be 
interfering in private business concerns," said Councilwoman Ann Van Haun, who 
worked on the subcommittee. "We felt a certain empathy to the senior citizens 
(who live in the mobile home parks), but most of us felt that the council is 
dealing with this situation reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no business forcing (landlords) to do anything. However, I feel we 
have accomplished something here" with the proposed lease. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; COUNCIL TO DISCUSS BOY SCOUTS' GAY BAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council, tackling what Councilman Robert F. Gentry called one of its 
"most important public policy decisions," today will reconsider a dilemma 
involving the city's Police Explorer program and discrimination against gays. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is how the city should respond to the Boy Scouts of America's policy 
banning openly gay people from becoming members or advisers of its Explorer 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach, which has a law that prohibits discrimination against gays, also 
has a 22-year-old Police Explorer program. 
</P>
<P>
 Troubled by the conflict, Police Chief Neil J. Purcell Jr. in September 
informed the Boy Scouts that the city will not discriminate against gays. When 
the charter agreement with the Boy Scouts was up for renewal in February, 
Purcell simply resubmitted it, once again stating the city's position against 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent W. Gibbs, president of the Scouts' Orange County Council, said then that 
the city essentially agreed to abide by the Boy Scouts' rules when it filled 
out the charter agreement paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the best of our knowledge, they're conforming to all the rules and 
regulations of the Boy Scouts of America and, on that basis, we granted the 
charter to them," Gibbs said. 
</P>
<P>
 But last month, Gentry suggested that the city consider rescinding the 
agreement rather than associating with an organization that bans gays. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Gentry said his feelings have not wavered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very cut and dried for me, because we have a city-sponsored program 
operating where only certain people can participate because of who they are," 
he said. "And we just can't, as a city, allow this to happen. City-sponsored 
programs have got to be available to all residents, not just those based on 
some arbitrary characteristics." 
</P>
<P>
 With a court case pending in San Diego County on a related matter, the city 
staff is recommending that the program be allowed to continue, at least for the 
time being. 
</P>
<P>
 A report from Purcell to the council says the Orange County Council's leaders 
have indicated they would not "go out of their way to determine whether or not 
the city of Laguna Beach had any (avowed) gay members or advisers" but would 
revoke the charter if such a reality was brought to their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The report offers a list of benefits from keeping the program in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time when gangs, tagging crews, drugs and drinking, hate crimes, violent 
assaults and other activities seem to be popular with our youth due to lack of 
things to do," the report says, "it seems that the abolishment of this type of 
positive, community-oriented program couldn't have worse timing." LESLIE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; COUNCIL TO VOTE ON HEADLANDS PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will hold the first of two crucial votes tonight on a 
controversial $500-million luxury hotel and residential development proposed 
for the 121-acre peninsula above Dana Point Harbor called the Headlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's vote focuses on a land-use plan for the property that allows a 
maximum of 370 residential units, a 400-room hotel and two retail centers with 
150,000 square feet of commercial space.Included in the plan are three public 
parks totaling 24 acres and six acres of public trails and parkways. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as expected, the council approves the plan, another vote will be held 
April 12 on a legal contract for the future development of the Headlands, 
called a development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, the potential development of the Headlands -- one of 
the last undeveloped coastal parcels in Orange County -- has become the source 
of heated debate between local environmentalists who want to save the property 
as a natural resource and proponents of the project who claim it will provide 
financial assistance for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The environmentalists' outcry intensified last Feb. 1 when the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service listed the Pacific pocket mouse, which lives on the Headlands, 
on the emergency endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if the council votes to approve the plan, its opponents have promised 
to petition for a local referendum to halt the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1940s, the Headlands property has been owned by the M.H. Sherman Co. 
and Chandis Securities Co. Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the 
financial holdings of the Chandler family, is a principal stockholder of Times 
Mirror Co., which publishes the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting begins at 5:30 p.m. at City Hall, 33282 Street of the Golden 
Lantern.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; PUBLIC INTRODUCED TO CANINE OFFICER ADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's newest and youngest cop looked a little star-struck Monday as 
police officials introduced the 2-year-old German shepherd to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Ado, who was imported to Newport Beach from the Czech Republic earlier this 
year, approached well-wishers cautiously at first during a welcoming ceremony 
in front of the police station. 
</P>
<P>
 But within a few minutes, the 93-pound, caramel-and-black dog was at ease, 
running his wet tongue across the face of one man and poking his snout 
playfully at snapping cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Ado replaces Dingo, whose death last year prompted police to hold an elaborate 
funeral service complete with emotional eulogies. Dingo served on the force for 
six years and died at age 10 of complications from leg surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two months, Ado and his partner, Officer Tom Weizoerick, have 
been training. Weizoerick said a bond immediately developed between the pair. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was looking for someone to care for him," said Weizoerick, who got to know 
Ado by feeding him and taking him for walks on the beach. "He took to me right 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 The partners will work a regular patrol beat. They will cruise the streets in 
a four-wheel-drive police vehicle equipped with a special door that the officer 
can open by pressing a button on his utility belt. The device is designed to 
let the dog out of the vehicle if the officer needs help. 
</P>
<P>
 Weizoerick said he loves dogs and has long wanted to work in the police K-9 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are so loyal and truthful," he said. "I know I'd trust (Ado) more than a 
regular officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Ado is one of three police dogs in the department. They are used to sniff out 
drugs, locate suspects in large buildings and work with children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really like what the dogs bring to the department in terms of resources," 
said Police Chief Robert J. McDonell. 
</P>
<P>
 Ado cost about $6,000, including training fees. Donations from the public paid 
for the dog as well as another German shepherd, which is scheduled to join the 
department when 10-year-old Hondo retires in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their abilities are unbelievable," Weizoerick said. "They have incredible 
senses, and they work so fast." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; FIRE SERVICE TOPIC OF RESIDENTS' CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 80 residents showed up at Monday night's City Council meeting to 
voice concerns about a proposal to contract with the county for fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, the cash-strapped city asked the Orange County Fire Department for a 
cost study.That study offers options with costs ranging from $4.4 million to 
$4.7 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said using the county Fire Department could increase paramedics 
response time and homeowner fire insurance rates. And they fear the move would 
affect the city's say on fire service costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is turned over to the county, the city has completely lost control," 
resident Jerry Sigler said. "This to me is a very big issue. I think (it would 
be) a big mistake to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin O'Rourke said that Buena Park staff is preparing an updated 
cost analysis based on the county's final proposal as to how much the city 
actually could save by switching to the county for fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to see if the city can save money by regionalizing the (fire) 
service and perhaps improve service to our community," O'Rourke said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second community meeting on the topic will be held at 6 p.m. April 18 in the 
City Council chambers. The City Council isn't expected to make a decision until 
May.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; AIDS GROUP OFFERS NEW EDUCATION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Youth educators at the AIDS Response Program have developed "rubberwear" 
parties for college-aged students where safer-sex techniques and products will 
be demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs will be offered by the AIDS Response Program, run by the Garden 
Grove-based Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Richards, coordinator of youth programs, said the "rubberwear" concept, 
which involves games and prizes, like a Tupperware party, was created to make 
it more comfortable for young people to learn about safer sex. 
</P>
<P>
 People attending "rubberwear" parties will get free condoms. 
</P>
<P>
 The center developed special programs in September for people between the ages 
of 18 and 24, Richards said. More than 5,000 people have attended the classes 
at college campuses and community service events, Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that frank demonstration of safer-sex products is the way 
to protect people from AIDS and other diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 A group called Choices/Teen Awareness Inc. in Anaheim teaches about AIDS at 
public schools but advocates abstinence, not safer sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Choices director Priscilla Hurley has said she does not teach about condoms 
because she believes it weakens the abstinence message. Because condoms are not 
100% effective, it's not a good idea to teach young people to use them, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards also talked about abstinence at a recent demonstration of the 
"rubberwear" program. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obviously the best way not to get a sexually transmitted disease," she 
said, but she noted that studies show that some young people call themselves 
abstinent although they engage in sexual behavior -- including oral sex -- that 
could transmit disease. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said that people who do not prepare themselves for safer sex may end 
up having very risky sex under the influences of drugs or alcohol. WILLSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; MAN PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN MOLESTATION

<P>
 A former youth group leader pleaded not guilty Monday to charges that he 
molested four young boys at the First Evangelical Free Church, court officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Webb Blinkhorn, 29, of Placentia could face trial later this year on 
18 felony counts of lewd conduct with the four youths, who range in age from 12 
to 15, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 He faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The molestations allegedly took place in Blinkhorn's Placentia home between 
January, 1991, and July, 1993, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the boys were in Blinkhorn's youth group, which included Bible study 
programs, officials said. RENE LYNCH

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; MAN LEAPS FROM OVERPASS TO DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities were probing the apparent suicide Monday morning of a man who 
leaped from the McFadden Avenue overpass onto the San Diego Freeway, causing a 
10-mile tie-up of northbound freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 A 74-year-old Anaheim resident jumped off the overpass onto the northbound 
lanes at 7:15 a.m., dying instantly, according to city police and the county 
coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Rivas, a spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol, said that the two 
lanes next to the car-pool diamond lane were closed for about two hours and 
that "everybody was stuck in traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic returned to normal about 10 a.m., Rivas said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; TEEN-AGE SAFE RIDE PROGRAM FACES CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A program that provides free rides to teen-agers who think they have had too 
much to drink could see its funding reduced under a proposal now being 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's Safe Rides program is run by Explorer Scouts and paid for by People 
for Irvine Community Health, a nonprofit group that sponsors a variety of 
health and education program in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a tight budget, PICH might cut its funding to Safe Rides, forcing the 
teen-agers who run the program to look for new sources of money. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes as demand for rides is decreasing. Over the last four months, 
Irvine's Safe Rides program received 47 calls for service, a decrease from 
several years ago, said Barbara Allari, the vice president of PICH. 
</P>
<P>
 Allari attributed the decline to the success of anti-drunk-driving campaigns. 
She also said an increasing number of teen-agers are using designated drivers 
who stay sober when groups go out to party. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safe Rides program is in operation most Friday and Saturday nights when 
school is in session. Explorer Scouts who have gone through special training 
staff a hot line that teen-agers can call if they need rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Explorers provide rides to teen-agers in the Irvine area. But if a call comes 
in from outside the city, the Explorers can connect the caller to the Safe 
Rides hot line in their area. 
</P>
<P>
 PICH allocated about $1,150 to Safe Rides last year. The money went to pay 
mostly for phone bills and general operating expenses, Allari said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has not decided how much money will be cut from the program. "We 
want to look at the budget very closely," Allari said. "We are looking at the 
amount we spend." 
</P>
<P>
 PICH officials hope the prospect of a funding reduction will prompt Safe 
Riders leaders to look at ways of improving the program and finding new sources 
of revenue. Allari said the explorers could hold fund-raisers like car washes 
to make up for any lost money from PICH.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GROUPS BENEFIT FROM QUIET ZONE THEATRE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A theater group that performs for deaf people and those who are hard of 
hearing has given almost $5,000 to county organizations that help 
hearing-impaired people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Quiet Zone Theatre's directors voted recently to give the money to 
University High School in Irvine, Taft Elementary School in Santa Ana and Terry 
Sproul's Deaf Kids Kamp. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60 people worked to put on the nonprofit theater group's 
performances in February in Laguna Beach to raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The group sold out its three performances in Laguna Beach and one at 
University High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet Zone Theatre has performed at Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm, 
producer Joshua Vecchione said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-year-old theater recently decided to lease a 1,950-square-foot building 
in Lake Forest for storage and rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also would like to offer sign language classes and workshops at the 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is looking to perform at other locations this year, Vecchione said. 
</P>

JURY SELECTION BEGINS FOR TAY CASE DEFENDANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jury selection began Monday for a Fullerton teen-ager accused of masterminding 
the New Year's Eve, 1992, slaying of an honor roll student. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Chan, 19, faces life in prison without parole if convicted of murdering 
Stuart A. Tay, 17, of Orange, a Foothill High School student who allegedly 
befriended Chan and several other youths who had planned to commit a computer 
heist. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they believe Chan organized the fatal attack after learning 
that Tay had lied to the youths about his name and residence, raising fears 
that Tay might report them to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay was bludgeoned, had rubbing alcohol forced down his throat and had his 
mouth taped shut before he was buried in a Buena Park back yard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested and charged in the case were Abraham Acosta, 17, of Buena Park, 
and Mun Bong Kang, Kirn Young Kim, and Charles Bae Choe, all 18 and of 
Fullerton. The defendants all attended Sunny Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Choe pleaded guilty in the case and was sentenced to the California Youth 
Authority. He is expected to be the key witness against Chan and the remaining 
defendants, who will go on trial after Chan's case is completed later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Marshall Schulman declined to discuss his strategy in the 
case, although court records indicate he may focus on Chan's mental state at 
the time of the slaying. Schulman has been critical of attempts by prosecutors 
and other defense attorneys to portray his client as the alleged ringleader. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge agreed last week that a separate trial would ensure a fair hearing for 
Chan. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury selection process continued through Monday with Judge Kathleen E. 
O'Leary trying to weed out jurors whose opinions on the case may have been 
formed by pretrial media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman said he was considering asking that the trial be held in another area 
because of the extensive news coverage, but said Monday he is hopeful the court 
can find an impartial jury to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony is expected to begin Wednesday, court officials said.

HOMELESS GET REPRIEVE FROM EVICTION; RULING: APPEALS COURT ISSUES STAY 
TEMPORARILY BARRING CALTRANS FROM ORDERING RESIDENTS TO LEAVE AN ENCAMPMENT 
BENEATH A FREEWAY OVERPASS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE and LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For now, at least, the residents of "Club Homeless" can stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal in Los Angeles on Monday stayed an Orange 
County judge's ruling that had allowed Caltrans to evict a group of homeless 
from beneath a freeway overpass in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The stay effectively allows the group of about a dozen homeless men and women 
to remain in the encampment, where they had erected tents, closets and even a 
walled bathroom. Last week, they began sorting through their belongings as they 
prepared to leave the area. Some had lived there for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The state appeals court issued the stay and asked Caltrans to respond by next 
Monday. The court is expected to conduct a hearing on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what happens, the long-term prognosis for the homeless camp is not 
good, said Paul Gray, the group's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they'll be able to stay there," Gray said. "The legal question 
is what is fair in terms of moving them off the property. Does Caltrans have to 
give them a sufficient amount of time or an alternative place?" 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has suggested a number of shelters where the transients can be 
housed, but Gray said few of them have the long-term services these individuals 
will need, and none of them have a vacancy. 
</P>
<P>
 For the homeless residents themselves, Monday's court victory was mostly a 
hollow one. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp has all but disbanded because of the dispute with Caltrans, and most 
of the residents have scattered. 
</P>
<P>
 One former resident, 38-year-old Craig Fritts, said police entered the camp 
Thursday night with dogs and now he and the others are afraid to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really scared to go back," said Fritts, 38, who said he would spend $35 
from his monthly $109-welfare check to sleep in a motel room Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 He said a local Catholic church paid for him to spend the two previous nights 
in a motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that I managed to salvage is in the motel room," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said that the residents of the camp have done what they can to stay 
hidden, but Caltrans is still not satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have gotten themselves out of the way of the general public and 
found a way to survive and that doesn't seem to be any good either," Gray said. 
"Nobody likes homeless people under foot and they don't like it themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials say they are getting ready to landscape the area as part of 
a nearly $1-million highway beautification project. They also have stressed 
that the area is a health hazard to the homeless and that they are constantly 
in danger by being so close to the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Santa Ana, a cluster of homeless men are facing a similar threat 
of eviction from the fly-infested garbage dump they consider home. 
</P>
<P>
 Secluded behind piles of trash and old furniture near a cluster of 
construction supply yards, two men who identified themselves only as Bob, 35, 
Mike, 41, and Mike's two dogs and six rats, have made themselves a home, along 
with another friend. 
</P>
<P>
 About a week ago, Caltrans officials posted signs warning against "loiterers" 
who block the road, said Jere Witter, a homeless activist who works with the 
Legal Aid Society. And last Wednesday, the men say, Santa Ana police told them 
they had until today to clear out. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring construction and electric supply yards have complained of 
break-ins and stolen scrap metal and suspect the homeless men, Mike said. 
Police also told them that property owners were finding a lot of used syringes 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put the blame on the closest people, because we're homeless and we're 
right here," said Bob, who denied ever breaking into the construction yards but 
said he has watched other people do so.

O.C.-BASED PARK MAINTENANCE CHIEF INDICTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County-based maintenance chief for 11 state parks has been indicted 
along with two fellow employees in an alleged smog check scam that prosecutors 
say is unlike anything they have seen before. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside County Grand Jury delivered a 24-page felony indictment last 
week alleging that David V. Gallardo, chief of maintenance for the Orange Coast 
district of the state Department of Parks and Recreation, and department 
employees Gerald Galusha and Robert Davidson misappropriated about $5,897 in 
public funds intended to pay for smog checks for at least 50 state vehicles 
that apparently were never inspected. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment, which caps a six-month investigation by the Riverside County 
district attorney's office, the state Department of Justice and the state 
Bureau of Automotive Repair, also names four owners of two Riverside 
auto-repair shops. The indictment includes 42 felony counts against seven 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrest warrants will probably be served this week, Riverside County Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Mark McDonald said Monday, adding that he has "never seen anything" 
like the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite these recent indictments, my office's investigation is not 
necessarily over," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state employees could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, Gallardo trained Davidson in January, 1990, "in 
the practice of paying H&H Smog in Riverside for smog checks on department 
vehicles which designedly would never be performed."  
</P>
<P>
 The scam allegedly started while both Gallardo and Davidson were working for 
the Los Logos state park district in Riverside County, according to the 
indictment. The practice was allegedly later passed on to Galusha, who was 
hired in May, 1992, as the chief mechanic in the Los Logos district. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallardo was indicted on nine counts of misappropriation and one count of 
conspiracy involving about $3,165, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two employees were indicted on conspiracy counts and multiple counts 
of misappropriation involving the remaining amount of about $2,732. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobby Dale Holquin and Albert Hall, owners of H&H Smog and Tune-Up Center in 
Riverside, were indicted on conspiracy counts and multiple counts of computer 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Wright Sr. and Richard Wright Jr., owners of Rick's Classic VW Repair 
in Riverside, were indicted on conspiracy counts and multiple counts of selling 
false smog certificates.

NEW LAW IN ORANGE REQUIRES FIRE-RETARDANT ROOFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Property owners must begin complying April 21 with a new city ordinance that 
requires new roofs be made from fire-retardant materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which was unanimously approved by the City Council in March, 
was drafted in response to the October, 1993, Stagecoach fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven homes in east Orange suffered significant damage, said fire officials, 
who added that the loss would have been less if the homes had used 
fire-retardant roofing materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The new ordinance also prohibits roofing over wood shakes or wood shingles. 
The ordinance applies only to new construction and homeowners putting on new 
roofs.

MAGNOLIA SCHOOL BOARD WILL TRY TO EVICT RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The school district that owns the Los Angeles Rams' practice facility said 
Monday it will go to court this week to evict the team, hoping to have it out 
by June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magnolia School District board voted unanimously Monday night to begin 
eviction proceedings. The team's 15-year lease for the former Juliette Low 
Elementary School expired Dec. 31, and it has balked repeatedly at accepting a 
new one. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of disagreement has been the Rams' refusal to accept a clause -- 
which they had in their old lease -- that requires them to pay the $1 million 
or more it would cost to turn the facility back into a school if they move to 
another city, as they have threatened to do. They want the city -- their actual 
landlord under a complicated three-way agreement between the team, the city and 
the district -- to pick up half the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams Executive Vice President John Shaw "has been very clear that he will not 
leave without a legal push," Magnolia Supt. Paul S. Mercier said. "I'm rather 
disappointed they are making us give them the legal push." 
</P>
<P>
 Rams officials were unavailable for comment Monday night. The team has said 
that on May 3 it will exercise an escape clause in its Anaheim Stadium lease 
that would allow it to move after the 1994 season. Baltimore, St. Louis and 
other cities have reportedly made offers for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 School district attorney Richard V. Godino conceded that the Rams could use 
injunctions and other legal maneuvers to delay eviction for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then they run the risk that right in the middle of the season they'll 
have no place to practice," Godino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials said they support the district's action. The city has 
offered to pay a portion of the Rams' lease payment and pay a portion of the 
conversion if the team agrees to continue playing its games at Anaheim Stadium 
for 15 more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams have received a proposed agreement that we think is very fair and 
reasonable, and they have not even given us the courtesy of a return phone 
call," City Manager James D. Ruth said. "Everybody is very frustrated (with the 
Rams). Why should we agree to pick up their costs when they are threatening to 
leave?"

JOSH CHARLES: SUCCESS ON HIS OWN TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GRANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As his sleek black Mustang convertible races down Pacific Coast Highway, 
22-year-old actor Josh Charles takes in the strains of Ben Harper's "Welcome to 
the Cruel World" on his tape player. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Charles, the song is anything but his theme song. In fact, he 
seems sublimely unaware that he is part of Hollywood's new breed of 
up-and-coming actors, including such diverse actors as Ethan Hawke, Brendan 
Fraiser, Ben Stiller and Cuba Gooding Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling in to the parking lot of a Malibu deli, however, Charles just wants a 
bagel. "Does that come with cream cheese and tomato?," he asks the waitress. 
Wearing navy pants, black boots and a wrinkled shirt tucked in the right side 
and pulled out of the left, Charles amiably grabs the bagel and wanders outside 
into the sun. "Pretty sloppy," he announces with a wide grin, describing not 
only the cream cheese but also what he finds to be the often tortuous process 
called "the interview." 
</P>
<P>
 Painful interviews may become a necessary way of life, however. He is 
currently attracting a lot of attention for his sweet-natured performance in 
"Threesome," alongside Lara Flynn Boyle and Stephen Baldwin. Charles stars as a 
college student coming to terms with his adulthood -- and his sexuality. The 
film, which opens Friday, is a genial yet potentially controversial 
three-character study about three students who share a dormitory room and end 
up sharing each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's script hit home when the Baltimore-born actor first read it nearly 
two years ago. "I had just moved here from New York and was going through an 
experience with my friends there where we all thought we would be best friends 
for the rest of our lives," he says. "Then, suddenly, I was in L.A. and I 
wasn't talking to these people. It wasn't anybody's fault -- we just fell out 
of touch. But it put me in a very disillusioned state about friendships." 
</P>
<P>
 Making "Threesome" has made the actor re-evaluate the importance of 
friendship. "My dad said to me growing up: 'When all is said and done, if you 
can count all your true friends on one hand, you're a lucky man.' If there's 
one thing I'm learning in my life, it's that this is really true." 
</P>
<P>
 "Threesome" enforces the truism but takes it a step further. "I think, 
ultimately, the film is an exploration of friendship and sexuality," he says. 
"It's a movie about about how you have certain people in your life for certain 
reasons, some people forever, and some people not forever." 
</P>
<P>
 In the course of discovering his own sexuality, Charles' character, Eddie, 
realizes that he is in love with different aspects of both his male and female 
roommates. "There is a line in the film when Eddie says: 'I felt especially 
stricken that if Alex and Stuart would have been genetically merged into one 
person, he or she would have been the love of my life.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Charles, who is straight, says he had no qualms about taking on a gay 
character as his first big Hollywood role. Well, almost no qualms. "I'd be a 
liar if I said I didn't think about it at all," he admits. "But literally, that 
lasted about five minutes. My job is to play many different roles with all 
sorts of different backgrounds and orientations." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-star Flynn Boyle concurs. "He comes from the reality side of acting," she 
says. "He has an ability to be a real person on camera. He doesn't care what 
size his trailer is." 
</P>
<P>
 "Josh is a catalyst," adds "Threesome" producer Brad Krevoy. "He's like a 
basketball point guard: He passes, sets and scores." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in a middle-class Baltimore family, Charles is the youngest of two 
sons. "I was the clown," he recalls. "I was the one who the teachers would say: 
'Josh is so incredibly intelligent. If only he could apply himself!' Humor 
seemed to always be the way out," he admits. "Out of school, out of tense 
moments . . . anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Charles got his first break, a part in John Waters' "Hairspray," 
which was filmed in his hometown. "I had one line: 'Would you ever swim in an 
integrated swimming pool?' " A year later, "Dead Poets Society" provided his 
first significant dramatic challenge as the lovesick Knox Overstreet. "It was 
such an unbelievable experience for me to work with (director) Peter Weir in my 
second movie," he says. "The experience obviously opened many doors, but . . . 
I developed this false sense that this was what acting was supposed to be all 
of the time."  
</P>
<P>
 He puts his bagel down onto his plate. "Not every movie is going to be a Peter 
Weir film and not everyone is going to treat his cast and crew with the care 
and nurturing that Peter did." 
</P>
<P>
 With an upcoming roles in Disney's "Cyclops Baby" as well as other projects 
about to be nailed down, though, it would appear that things are slowly falling 
into place for him. Not that he would admit that. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I've learned about his business is this whole 'plan thing' -- it 
doesn't work. It does not work. What I want out of my career is just to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles gets up and walks across the street to pick up some cigarettes. "It's 
like the Tom Waits song," he says. "I'd rather be a success on my own terms 
than a failure on somebody else's."

THE DOCUMENTARY AS A WEAPON; MOVIES: 'DEFENDING OUR LIVES' WON AN OSCAR FOR A 
TRIO OF ACTIVISTS WHO WANTED TO 'DO SOMETHING' FOR BATTERED FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They had been warned. No lengthy acceptance speeches. No polemics. And no more 
than two people on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 But Margaret Lazarus, Renner Wunderlich and Stacey Kabat were unfazed. As 
veteran laborers in the vineyards of social justice, they had faced far tougher 
obstacles than the Hollywood Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Oscar winner in the short documentary category was announced, all 
three co-producers raced to the stage. Filmmakers Lazarus and Wunderlich were 
quick to express gratitude and to acknowledge the women whose stories are 
recorded in "Defending Our Lives." Then Kabat, their 30-year-old activist 
colleague, seized her moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Domestic violence is the leading cause of injury to women in the United 
States," Kabat called out, her voice near the breaking point. "Please, we need 
all your help to stop this." 
</P>
<P>
 After the ceremony, still giddy from victory -- and maybe also from jet lag -- 
Kabat freeze-framed the scene on her VCR and explained how she got up the nerve 
to ignore the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, you got 1 billion people for 10 seconds," Kabat said. "You better say 
something important." 
</P>
<P>
 The urge, once again, to say something important is what impelled Lazarus, 
Wunderlich and Kabat to join forces to produce a documentary about what Health 
and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala has called "terrorism in the home." 
</P>
<P>
 Partners in life and in work for nigh on 25 years, Lazarus and Wunderlich had 
earlier used the short documentary as a vehicle to address such topics as rape, 
women's health, gays and lesbians in the Holocaust, images of women in 
advertising, the alcohol beverage industry and nuclear war. Domestic violence, 
Wunderlich said, was yet another affront to human dignity that cried out to be 
examined on film. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that just got more and more obvious to me was that this is a 
human-rights issue of huge proportions," he said. "It's just massive, it's 
international and it's institutionally sanctioned. If anything else was 
happening on this level, we'd have the troops out." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Wunderlich and Lazarus pulled out their cameras, their notebooks, 
their editing equipment and the idealism that has guided them since they met at 
a screening of a Fellini movie. Wunderlich was a 20-ish Boston University 
student and ex-Alaska fisherman. Lazarus, a year his junior, was also studying 
at BU. As their simple goal in life, they decided to change the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how naive you are when you're 20," Lazarus said. "You think, boy, if 
you just show people the injustice, everything will be different." 
</P>
<P>
 They incorporated as Cambridge Documentary Films and kept their overhead low 
by doing their own distribution as well as production. They also lived cheaply 
in a third-floor walk-up in Cambridge, and for 17 years, said Wunderlich, "we 
just kept cranking out films" instead of having children. 
</P>
<P>
 But even after their two sons came along, driving them to a real house with a 
real yard in a real suburb, Wunderlich and Lazarus continued to confine their 
work to short documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "People's time is extremely valuable," Lazarus said. "Time is important, and 
you owe it to your audience to keep your story short. If it's really good, 
people will pay attention -- but it's got to be really good." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lazarus and Kabat met at a political demonstration just about four years 
ago, it was as if some kind of chemical connection had taken place. Their 
philosophical wires crossed, and by the time Wunderlich joined them for dinner 
that night, they were vowing to hold a "really big demonstration," as Kabat 
recalled, by making a film about domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Kabat, who in 1992 won a Reebok Human Rights Award for her work against 
domestic violence, describes herself as the daughter and granddaughter of women 
who were beaten by their husbands. But when she headed off to Bates College at 
age 18, "it wasn't acceptable" to talk about such things, not even the 
nightmares that plagued her about killing the father who told her, "Well, 
Stacey, people just have violent tempers, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 Kabat plunged herself into the study of nonviolence, her own desperate attempt 
to "transform my own experience so I didn't become violent myself." She sought 
guidance from a South African political exile, her spiritual godfather of 
sorts, and worked for a time with refugees in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to work in a battered women's shelter here seven years ago, Kabat 
was convinced that her clients were not all that different. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, wait a minute, women and children are living in the United States 
like domestic refugees," Kabat said. "They have to flee their homes, often in 
the night. They leave everything behind and then they have to hide." 
</P>
<P>
 Kabat shook her head, a gesture of amazement and despair. "And nobody talks 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kabat's rabble-rousing as a substance abuse and domestic violence counselor at 
Framingham State Prison here eventually got her barred from the facility -- but 
not before she fulfilled her agenda of "finding every single woman in that 
institution who had defended her life, because I knew it could have been me in 
there, not them." 
</P>
<P>
 Those stories form the core of the sobering film that won this year's best 
documentary short Academy Award. Three of the so-called Framingham Eight 
prisoners who are featured have won commutation of their sentences, proof in 
Kabat's view that a clemency movement for prisoners claiming the battered 
women's defense is gaining force. 
</P>
<P>
 "This film blows a hole in the prison wall and says to everyone, 'Here it is, 
here's what's happening,' " Kabat said. "It makes people realize that women are 
dying and that this is a community issue. It is affecting our families." 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar, as Wunderlich, Lazarus and Kabat fondly refer to the pair of statuettes 
they brought home from Hollywood, has helped cast "a golden glow" on the 
subject, Kabat contends. Suddenly, Washington is listening, Kabat said; policy 
makers are telephoning her, not the other way around. 
</P>
<P>
 But always they come back to the faces and the bruises and the howling 
desperation in "Defending Our Lives." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so huge," Wunderlich said. "And one little film just scratches the 
surface."

LOOK! UP ON THE SCREEN! IT'S . . . LOIS LANE?; TELEVISION: BUT THIS TIME 
AROUND, PHYLLIS COATES WILL PLAY THE REPORTER'S MOM ON 'LOIS & CLARK' SEASON 
FINALE. 
</P>

 "Lois Lane, meet Lois Lane." 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction of Teri Hatcher to Phyllis Coates should have gone that way, 
but it didn't. Instead, they met with a simple smile and an embrace on the set 
of ABC's "Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman," where Coates, who 
played Lois Lane for the first season of the old "Adventures of Superman" TV 
series, was to appear as -- you guessed it -- Lois' mom. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the season finale May 8, "The House of Luthor," in which Lois 
is betrothed -- not to the Man of Steel but to his archenemy, Lex Luthor. Ma 
Lane shows up at the wedding with one of those "you know, you can still change 
your mind" speeches. If the series is renewed, Coates will be a recurring 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son said this is a gestalt. And it is , it's kind of something going full 
circle," said Coates, a handsome blue-eyed still-petite sexagenarian whose alto 
voice is unchanged since 1951, when she received co-billing with George Reeves 
for the first 26 episodes of "The Adventures of Superman." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no wardrobe mistress and no hairdresser in those days," she laughed, 
standing outside Lex Luthor's Deco-esque balcony on the "Lois & Clark" set at 
Warner Bros. "Oh boy -- I had one suit! One suit, and a double in case I got 
egg on it! And George's dresser dressed me. My makeup man was Harry Thomas, who 
made up every monster in Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a far cry, certainly, from Hatcher's careful coiffure and the five 
changes (in this episode) of cutting-edge '90s feminine attire. But Coates' 
portrayal of Lois Lane, in other respects, wasn't such a far cry from 
Hatcher's. She was feisty and independent -- or, as "The Complete Directory of 
Prime Time Network TV Shows (1946 to Present)" by Tim Brooks and Earle Marsh 
put it: "Lois was, in fact, rather hard-nosed and aggressive when portrayed by 
Phyllis Coates, but became more sensitive and vulnerable in the latter 
characterization of Noel Neill." 
</P>
<P>
 Neill -- who played Lois for 76 episodes of the series, from 1953-57 (and in 
the 1940s serial, starring Kirk Alyn) -- is more identified with the character 
than Coates. (Coates quit the part, she said, in order to move on to other 
types of roles.) How, then, did "Lois & Clark" settle on Coates? It was 
Hatcher's doing: 
</P>
<P>
 "It came to me at about 1:30 in the morning on a Sunday night," Hatcher said, 
caught between takes. "It was during another of my regular insomniac attacks. 
My fiance has a friend who is friends with Phyllis. So I had known of her, and 
there had been suggestions that we should all meet for dinner or something. . . 
. I knew I was getting married in this script, and I didn't know if there was 
even a mother established, and that's when I woke up and thought, 'I wonder why 
my mother wouldn't be coming to the wedding, and if she is, it should be 
Phyllis Coates!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning she phoned "Lois & Clark" executive producer-creator Deborah 
Joy Levine, and the script was immediately rewritten to include Mom Lane. 
Coates, who resumed acting in the mid-1980s after her marriage of 25 years 
ended in divorce, flew to L.A. from her home in Carmel on very short notice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true I was never as identified with Lois Lane as other people have 
been," she said, clad in Mom Lane's pink wedding suit and veil. "I've done 
other things. . . . And I'm not one to live in the past. . . . I was delighted 
that Teri would think of me. When I came on the set, I said, 'Make me look like 
her mother, not like her grandmother!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Coates moved to Los Angeles from Texas at age 16 and joined one of the last 
vaudeville shows, Ken Murray's "Blackouts," in the late '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Superman," she starred in a Desilu series, "This Is Alice," did guest 
shots on shows including "The Untouchables " and "Perry Mason," then dropped 
out of the business to raise her three children. She returned to acting at the 
urging of her children, appearing in commercials, stage productions and a few 
small parts in series including "Midnight Caller." 
</P>
<P>
 She looks back on her stint as Lois -- 43 years ago -- with fondness and a 
lingering hint of the frustration that made her quit the part. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have shaped the character a little differently. I would have played 
her with a little more dimension," she said. "But in those days I couldn't even 
smile at Superman. If I even gave a knowing or suggestive look to him . . . I 
was like a horse with a bit in his mouth! But I played her tough and direct. . 
. . I had one or two attitudes and that was it. (Hatcher's) Lois is a woman of 
the '90s -- she's sexy and she gets to play comedy -- and I got to do none of 
that. It's great to see her fulfilling the role. She's the best Lois Lane, 
really, ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Coates counts herself a fan of the new show -- especially of its production 
values of which she is understandably in awe -- and especially approves of the 
"new" Jimmy Olsen (Michael Landes), declaring him "a really sensitive, 
thoughtful, perceptive young man and quite different from 'golly, gee whiz, 
jeepers' " -- referring to the trademark outbursts of Jack Larson's portrayal 
of Olsen in the old series. "That," laughed Coates, "used to drive us up the 
wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other members of the old "Superman" cast, Coates speaks warmly of the 
late Reeves, whose 1959 shooting death was ruled a suicide. Just days before 
his passing, she said, Reeves had asked her to star in a science-fiction film 
he planned to direct. "He was a very easygoing guy, very sweet guy, very 
generous, giving. George is the one who set me up for co-billing. I would never 
have thought of it. He was always off-camera for your lines. Nobody else did it 
for him. Very conscientious guy. A good friend." 
</P>
<P>
 A final question: Does she have any scenes with the new Superman (Dean Cain)? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Coates said. "In fact, I haven't even met him yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's Superman for you -- still playing coy with Lois Lane. Some things 
never change.

CBS NEWS EXEMPTS OSGOOD FROM NO-COMMERCIALS POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In order to sign Charles Osgood as the successor to Charles Kuralt as host of 
"Sunday Morning," CBS News made an exception to a longstanding policy 
prohibiting correspondents from doing commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Osgood, who will take over for Kuralt this Sunday on CBS, will continue to do 
commercials on radio for sponsors of "The Osgood Files," his commentaries that 
air four times daily on the CBS radio network. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly is an exception to CBS News policy," CBS News President Eric 
Ober acknowledged Monday. "We decided to do it because Charles Osgood was 
easily our first choice for the job. Charles Osgood is a wonderful writer, as 
Charles Kuralt is, and he has the strong knowledge of culture and the arts that 
we felt were critical to 'Sunday Morning.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to give (CBS Radio) up, I would not have been able to do 'Sunday 
Morning,' " Osgood said in an interview. Osgood, who is said to make $1 million 
as the "voice" of the CBS radio network, noted that Paul Harvey and other 
syndicated radio hosts also do commercials along with their commentaries. He 
said that he did not believe TV viewers would be confused by his roles as 
newsman and pitchman. 
</P>
<P>
 Osgood, 61, a longtime correspondent who has been called the "poet laureate" 
of CBS for his humorous poems, left CBS News two years ago to join CBS Radio. 
Although he has continued as a contributor to "CBS This Morning" and "Sunday 
Morning," CBS News maintained that he wasn't in violation of the ban on 
commercials because he was employed by the radio network, not the news 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 Ober acknowledged that it would be preferable that the host of "Sunday 
Morning" not do commercials. But he said, "There are some people whose 
credibility with viewers is very strong. I think Charles is one of those 
people, and I don't think his credibility on 'Sunday Morning' will be affected" 
by his work on CBS Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The only current on-air CBS News personality for whom an exception is made is 
Mark McEwen, the weatherman and entertainment editor of "CBS This Morning." He 
reads the promotional copy between prime-time entertainment programs on the 
CBS-TV network. 
</P>
<P>
 In taking over for Kuralt, Osgood said he does not plan major changes in the 
tone and format of the 15-year-old show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not Charlie, but I think that there are some similarities between us that 
made me seem to some people to be a logical successor to him," Osgood said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie and (former executive producer) Shad Northshield created a program 
that is like the Sunday newspapers, with sections on the arts and a leisurely 
pace," he said. "I think also that, in some ways, there is a kind of Sunday 
church-going aspect to the show for viewers in the nature pieces at the end of 
the show. I expect that style to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 As anchor, Osgood said that he may include some of his humorous verse on 
"Sunday Morning." But "it won't be 'The Osgood Files,' " he added. "I'm going 
to hold the little verses to a minimum." 
</P>
<P>
 He does plan to play the piano -- and even his banjo -- on occasion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS, meanwhile, is planning a May special about Kuralt, which will include 
some of his stories over the years along with an interview by "60 Minutes" 
correspondent Morley Safer.

 Down in the southwestern town of El Paso, a man came along wearing polka dots 
and cowboy boots. He got his diploma from Texas Western, and that was an 
unforgettable moment in his life. A few months later, in another part of Texas, 
someone shot the President of the United States. That, too, was a moment Nolan 
Richardson would never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be more. There would be a day in 1966 when his old coach and alma 
mater would take college basketball's national championship. What a sweet 
memory this was. And there would be a day more than two decades later when Rose 
and Nolan Richardson would experience the disbelief of watching their sweetest 
memory of all, their little daughter Yvonne, pass from their very eyes, stolen 
from them by leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 The things you see in this life. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the present President of the United States, stepping toward you, taking 
you in his arms, teardrops welling in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't this great?" Bill Clinton asks, pulling back. 
</P>
<P>
 Nolan Richardson, 52, dressed in blue, is standing in the middle of a wild 
University of Arkansas party inside an arena in North Carolina, pushing 
midnight on a Monday night. He is coach of college basketball's national 
champions, winner of a 76-72 game against Duke. He is watching a man who rules 
an entire nation wipe his eyes, listening to this man thanking him for the 
accomplishment, saying in kind to this man, "Thank you for the inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 A pep band is playing and swaying and singing, "Rollin', rollin', rollin' with 
Nolan," to that tune Credence Clearwater Revival and Tina Turner sang about 
rollin' on the river. At another end of the Charlotte Coliseum, a middle-aged 
woman wearing a "HOGS" brooch is atop a stepladder, snipping a cord from a 
basketball net. This is another thing Nolan Richardson never dreamed he would 
see, his wife doing that. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the evening, Rose Richardson sat in the stands with her face in her 
hands, unable to look. Arkansas was down by as many as 10 points. Her heart was 
beating as fast as the clock was ticking. Down there on the sideline, coaching 
the favored Razorbacks, was the man with whom she had shared so much. At his 
side sat "Notes" Richardson, 29, an assistant coach in charge of the 
videotaping of opponents, alias Nolan Richardson III, their son. Up among the 
fans was Notes' wife, mother of a 6-year-old boy, Nolan Richardson IV. 
</P>
<P>
 The important people of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 College basketball's coach of the hour made sure to thank every one. As soon 
as this contest was over, as soon as he knew it was real, he rattled off the 
name of everyone who had meant something to him along the way. The first 
principal who gave him a high school team to coach, back El Paso way. The man 
who hired him in Snyder, Tex., to coach at a junior college. The man who 
invited him to Tulsa to coach his first big-time team. Frank Broyles, who 
brought him to Arkansas and stood by him whenever times got tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know you want me to make a short statement, but I don't care, this is 
important to me," Richardson said, rattling off memory after memory. 
</P>
<P>
 This was his night. This was This Is Your Life, Nolan Richardson. He had 
people to mention and things to say. He is a talker, this coach is, as verbose 
as they come. Which is good, because the man has an awful lot to say. Tonight 
he had just seen two teams of basketball players give everything they had, and 
if his side didn't win, there were those out there, Richardson was convinced, 
who would say he hadn't won the big one, couldn't win the big one, wasn't one 
of the great coaches of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 When he already knew better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I already know who I am," Richardson stressed. "I don't need you to tell me. 
I don't need anyone to try to tell the world what Nolan Richardson is all 
about. Because I already know. I already feel that I'm one of the best coaches 
in the land. I don't need you to tell me that. I didn't need this to happen for 
anyone else to know that." 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling, though. He needed to feel this feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson rested his jaw on his palm, shook his head and said, "This is one 
of the greatest feelings I have ever had, from the standpoint of athletics." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when he wondered how such a feeling would come about. Coming 
out of college, Richardson had a tryout with the San Diego Chargers as a 
football player, then a tryout with the ABA's Dallas Chaparrals as a basketball 
player. But things didn't work out. So, back he went to Bowie High, back to the 
border-town dust of El Paso, to labor for 10 years of high school ball, 
teaching kids to dribble. Then three more years with a junior college team that 
won 98 of 112 games and got him a little attention. 
</P>
<P>
 And look at him now. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaching for the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton sat beside David Gergen, who was cheering for Duke, agonizing over the 
10-point lead his Arkansas guys had spotted the opponents. The President said 
later: "Oh, it was awful. I brought all the folks who work for me and went to 
Duke and a few who went to North Carolina, so we had more people for Duke in my 
little box than we did for Arkansas." 
</P>
<P>
 His heart was jumping the whole time, Clinton said. He had predicted that it 
would take 75 points against Duke's fine defense to win, and how about that, it 
turned out 76-72. It was an amazing game and one that he, too, had been waiting 
for all his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said, "I think the President's reaction was one of pride. The 
Razorbacks are his pride and joy." 
</P>
<P>
 As they are his. A day before, players from Richardson's team had praised him 
as the best coach in the game, called him the reason they were there and the 
reason they would win. People said that Duke would win and that Duke had the 
top coach in basketball. In a pig's eye, the Razorbacks said. They were the 
kids of Nolan Richardson, as tight as a family. There was such togetherness, 
such openness among them, the team's media guide listed not only the names of 
each player's parents, but their home addresses and telephone numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson loved each and every one of them, even if he joked now that his 
next order of business was to "go get my golf clubs and get the hell away from 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 He can do anything he wants to do. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this is his day.

BASEBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS FOR ANGELS, DODGERS; ANGELS ARE THINKING HOW 
WEST CAN BE WON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers takes off his glasses, gently rubs his eyes and 
stalls for time while collecting his thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a man who usually converts feelings to thoughts, and thoughts to 
words, with stunning ease. Now, he can feel the words on the back of his 
tongue, but somehow they will not come out. 
</P>
<P>
 Staring ahead, not wanting anything to break his concentration, his eyes 
glisten as he finally says: "I've waited a long time for this. This is why I 
manage. It's one thing to develop players, and go through youth movements, but 
as a manager you've got to feel you have that chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to feel in your own mind you have the club that can win that brass 
ring. Well, I've got that club now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in all my heart we can win this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, 55, is considered the Ernie Banks of baseball managers. He has been 
widely acclaimed by his peers as one of the best in the business -- none may be 
more adept at handling a pitching staff -- but has seldom been given the 
opportunity to produce a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 He gets teams that are rebuilding, ones with self-imposed salary caps. He has 
been selected as manager of the year, has 768 victories, but has not had a team 
finish higher than third since the 1981 strike season. 
</P>
<P>
 That will all change, Rodgers vows, beginning at 5 tonight when the Angels 
open their season against the Minnesota Twins at the Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been five years since Rodgers was given the players who had the 
potential to win the division title. Although he has had teams with more 
talent, never has he been in a division weaker than the new American League 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I like our chances," Rodgers says. "Seattle is the team to beat in 
our division, but they've got holes like the rest of us. They don't have a 
bullpen closer, and neither do we. They probably have a better rotation, but I 
like our lineup better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, if we didn't think we could win this division, we never would 
have made the moves we did. 
</P>
<P>
 "The days of rebuilding are over." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels were still rebuilding, they would be opening the season with 
rookie Jim Edmonds as the regular left fielder, not with a platoon of Dwight 
Smith and Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 If they were rebuilding, Kevin Flora would be their second baseman, not a 
platoon of Harold Reynolds and Rex Hudler. 
</P>
<P>
 If they were rebuilding, Brian Anderson and Russ Springer would be in the 
rotation, not John Dopson and Mark Leiter. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they were rebuilding, they never would have spent $1 million in 
guaranteed salaries to veteran relievers Craig Lefferts and Bob Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did everything we could to make this team a contender," Angel General 
Manager Bill Bavasi says. "And if we're contending late in the season and we 
need a boost, I think ownership will allow us to get that player we need." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a year ago, of course, when the Angels did nothing to enhance their 
chances. They were only two games out of first place at the All-Star break, and 
decided to stand pat. 
</P>
<P>
 They were out of the race two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel management vows that it will not happen again, and as proof they've 
spent $28.9 million on long-term contracts this spring. Perhaps it would be 
different if Chicago, Kansas City and Minnesota were still in the division. But 
they're competing against two teams -- the Mariners and the Texas Rangers -- 
that have never won a title and another, the Oakland A's, that finished last 
season with the worst record in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure if we could contend in any (other) division in baseball," Bavasi 
says, "but believe me, I know we're good enough to contend in this one. There's 
no reason to be ashamed of this team at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most important to the Angels' destiny is that they have their players 
believing they can win. No longer is there resentment toward the youth 
movement. None of the veterans want to be traded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling in here has completely changed," Angel starter Mark Langston 
says. "Last year, there was so much uncertainty, so much change, that no one 
knew what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look around here now, and there's something wrong with you if you don't 
think you can win this division. You're only talking about beating three teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, it's not that difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The only component that remains the same is the public's perception. This is a 
franchise that has failed to win the division since Reggie Jackson and Bobby 
Grich were playing in 1986. They have finished a combined 47 games out of first 
place the last two seasons, and have yet to place higher than third since '86. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after consecutive seasons of 90 or more losses, they're asking everyone 
to believe that they can win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it sounds crazy to our fans and the public," Angel shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina says, "but guys really believe in this team. Even when we had those 
two nine-game losing streaks in the spring, no one panicked. To me, that's the 
sign of a confident team. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no time for excuses anymore. We can't blame our mistakes on youth. 
You won't hear any of that this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't speak for everyone, but I'm sick of losing. It gets old. If we don't 
win this year, it's time we'd better look at ourselves in the mirror." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how the 1994 Angels stack up: PITCHING Before anyone thinks about 
playoff tickets, the Angels must come up with a pitching staff better than last 
season's. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, they had Mark Langston and Chuck Finley, and prayed for rain. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, they have Langston and Finley, and still are praying for rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dopson, who will begin the season sandwiched between Langston and Finley, has 
failed to win more than seven games in any season since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Leftwich, the No. 4 starter, has four major league victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Leiter, the No. 5 starter, was released by the Detroit Tigers three weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullpen consists of four pitchers who were released from other 
organizations and two who have never spent a full season in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels went through 27 pitchers this spring, and this is the best they 
could come up with? 
</P>
<P>
 "We had so many guys around here," Finley says, "I thought it was a Sizzler 
buffet. You didn't know who we were trying next. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no secret our bullpen had some problems this spring, so really, Mark and 
I aren't going to approach it any differently than we did last year. We've 
pretty much got to go the limit and hope guys are there to pick us up at the 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who actually were counting on Frank Tanana, 40, to make the team, 
are hoping that left-handed starter Joe Magrane returns from the disabled list 
in a month. Magrane is guaranteed $1.5 million this season, which also 
guarantees him a spot in the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullpen still is a quagmire with no one asserting himself as the stopper. 
Mike Butcher, who was expected to receive the bulk of save situations, finished 
the spring with a 14.81 earned-run average. Joe Grahe, who inherits the role, 
had a 4.70 ERA. OFFENSE The Angels' offensive potential and versatility have 
fueled most of Rodgers' optimism. They opened the season a year ago without a 
single platoon situation and absolutely no power off the bench. This year, 
Rodgers is platooning at three positions, with several veterans sitting on his 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson easily proved to be Rodgers' most pleasant surprise. He was a player 
the Angels had no interest in acquiring until late January, and now they wonder 
what they would do without him. Jackson finished the spring batting .362, with 
a team-leading six home runs and 18 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to prove anything to anybody," Jackson says, "but there was 
never a doubt in my mind that I can still play this game. I just needed the 
chance. The Angels gave me that chance, and now I plan on rewarding them for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest question will be the production from designated hitter 
Chili Davis. He drove in a career-high 112 runs with 27 homers last season, but 
had only 12 homers and 66 RBIs the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have the kind of year I had last year," Davis told his teammates the 
other day, "we'll be in the World Series. Of course, then, I'd have to retire. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way the Angels could afford me after that." DEFENSE Privately, 
there's more concern among the players about their defense than about any other 
aspect of their game. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best defensive first basemen in baseball, J.T. Snow, is at triple-A 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, the most talented second baseman in the organization, also is at 
Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Their best defensive outfielder, Jim Edmonds, is on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps their best defensive utility player, Rod Correia, is at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are sacrificing defense with their 25-man roster, but Rodgers 
wanted Spike Owen and Rex Hudler as his utility players, bypassing Correia, 
Torey Lovullo and Mike Brumley. He wanted Eduardo Perez as his first baseman, 
shipping Snow off to the minors, perhaps never to wear an Angel uniform again. 
He wanted Rex Hudler when no one else in baseball did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got guys in here who have great hearts and have great clubhouse 
makeup," Rodgers says. "We needed winners in here, guys who know how to win, 
and guys who can teach the others how to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got the kind of team a manager loves. Believe me, if we don't win this 
thing, or at least contend, I'll be the most surprised guy in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the most disappointed, too."

JIM MURRAY: OUR LITTLE MASTERS HAS BECOME A FOREIGN AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Masters used to be a venerable American institution. As American as apple 
pie, the World Series, the old millstream. Hallowed ground. As much a part of 
our heritage as Shiloh, the first few bars of "Dee-eye-ex-eye-ee!" You got all 
choked up thinking about it. It was ours. As much a part of our history as 
Tobacco Road, God's Little Acre. It was Jeeter Lester's Open. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be won regularly by guys from Texas; Long Island; Latrobe, Pa.; 
Columbus; West Virginia. Guys named Hogan, Snead, Sarazen, Palmer, Nicklaus, 
Nelson, Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 Now look at it. It's about as American as apple strudel. Sauerkraut. Let's 
have a few bars of "God Save the Queen," "Deutschland Uber Alles," "Granada!" 
Never mind "Y'all," How about "Achtung!" They should move it to Dresden. 
</P>
<P>
 If they make a movie, it should be "The Return of the Aliens." Remake "A 
Foreign Affair." The Visitors' Visa Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you realize this once uniquely American event has been won five of the last 
six times by a golfer from Europe? And seven of the last 10? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you know that only one foreigner won it the first 37 tournaments, but nine 
have won it the last 16 tournaments? 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on here? Can't anybody play this damn thing without a monocle or 
a spiked helmet or a David Niven accent anymore? What happened to Texas, 
Georgia, the Carolinas? When did we start playing second fiddle to German 
marksmen, Spanish dons, British peers of the realm? Didn't we used to beat the 
likes of these four-a-side? If they were in the tournament other years, we 
didn't even know about it. You think Nicklaus ever held up play to find out how 
some guy from Stuttgart or Santander or Wales was doing? No, he wanted to know 
what Arnold was doing. Fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began innocently enough. The Masters was conceived and established by 
Bobby Jones as a kind of conclave of friends, gentlemen golfers, largely 
amateurs but with a few selected professionals. Bobby, of course, never became 
a professional (ugh!) himself and he visualized his tournament as a 
continuation of the kind of golf played in his era when the amateur game was on 
a par with the pros and the U.S. Amateur (and the British) was at least as 
important a tournament as the Greater Greensboro Open. Bobby's tournament was 
as exclusive as a cotillion. It's a wonder they didn't play in tuxes. 
</P>
<P>
 They more or less coined the term invitational . And the earliest fields 
leaned heavily on those who didn't make a living out of the game but played 
instead for tea trays, loving cups and assorted silverware and wall plaques. 
The Walker Cup team, a collection, usually, of stockbrokers, bankers and Park 
Avenue doctors and lawyers who played an international (amateur) match against 
the Brits, were an integral part of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the flower of professional golf got invited -- the winners of such 
socially correct events as the U.S. Open, the British Open and their amateur 
counterparts. (Winners of the PGA were grudgingly accepted, but got fewer years 
in their exemptions). And they had to wipe their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, golf was hardly a way to get rich in those days. Byron Nelson won 19 
tournaments in 1945 and was leading money-winner with $63,335. Today, you get 
more than that for finishing fourth at the Doral. Hogan won 10 tournaments in 
1948, including the U.S. Open and the PGA, and got $32,112 for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masters was the first to pioneer inviting key international players. These 
were selected arbitrarily by Jones and his partner, Clifford Roberts, and they 
were not a significant factor till 1961, when the first foreigner, South 
Africa's Gary Player, won the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masters began to creep out of its category as kind of golf's version of 
the House of Lords when sportswriters on their way north from baseball's spring 
training in Florida made a practice of stopping off at Augusta to report on 
Robert Tyre Jones Esq.'s little gentlemen-only soiree. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masters became a "major." No one is quite sure how. Or why. It was not a 
difficult tournament to win. Only about eight golfers annually had the game to 
win anything but a four-ball at Wykagyl or Shinnecock. Half the players in the 
field were 2-handicappers who sold bonds for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 When Player won, it had an unsettling effect on the game. For one thing, 
television was beginning to poke its nose in, and some people -- our hero here 
included -- began to wonder about the propriety of inviting a foreign player to 
come in otherwise unqualified when some American players, to wit, 
African-Americans, could not manage to get invited. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masters replied hotly that they could get in. Just finish 16th or better 
in the U.S. Open or eighth or better in the PGA. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign players, of course, had to fit none of these qualifications and this 
was so patently unfair that, in the mid-1970s, the Masters relented and agreed 
to invite any player who won a tour tournament or finished in the top 30 on the 
preceding year's money list. 
</P>
<P>
 This broke the color barrier, but by 1978 when Player won again, it was the 
foreign invaders taking over the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, a little-known Spanish kid with the unwieldy name of Severiano 
Ballesteros was in the pack and his daring game loved the wide-open fairways 
and landing-strip greens of Augusta National. He finished ninth. But within two 
years he was winning. And the floodgates opened. He won again in '83. He was 
second in '85 and in a playoff in '87. And the Europeans, who spurned the rest 
of our tour, began to fall all over themselves to get invited to Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
 German Bernhard Langer was to win in '85 and again last year. Britain's Sandy 
Lyle won in '88. Nick Faldo won in '89 and '90, and Ian Woosnam won in 1991. 
And whom did he beat out? Not Lanny or Hale or Ben or Payne or Curtis, but Jose 
Maria Olazabal, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 The poet has said, "There is some corner of a foreign field that is forever 
England," and while he may have been thinking of Flanders, it could apply to 
Augusta. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do these tourists make the Masters their own? What is it about that little 
corner of the world that is forever England? The course record, 63, is held by 
Nick Price, a Zimbabwean. It was Brit Nick Faldo who sank the longest putt in 
Masters history, a 100-footer on the second hole in 1989. Seve Ballesteros 
holds the record for birdies, 23 and one eagle, set in 1980 and Seve is also 
the youngest ever to win the Masters, at 23, and also the youngest ever to 
participate, at 20. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true you can't pick the winner of a golf tournament. But you can pick his 
part of the world in the Masters. He may not actually wear a monocle, but you 
can make a case he will have a hyphen in his name or call the subway the 
"chubes" (as in a "chube" of toothpaste) or pronounce "schedule" as 
"shed-yool." Or he will sound like Baron Munchausen or call you "Mite." He will 
probably have no idea at all who Barry Bonds is or what team Barry Switzer 
coaches. But he'll go around making these 100-foot putts and calling a 
three-wood a "spoon" and wonder why the tournament doesn't break for tea every 
day the way they do at a proper tournament at the Royal Something-or-Other 
course off the North Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are the Hogans and the Sneads and the Nicklauses and the Palmers when we 
need them? Why did Bobby Jones do this to us? The only Arnold this fits is 
Benedict.

BASEBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS FOR ANGELS, DODGERS; IT'S TIME TO PLAY BALL AS 
DODGERS FOCUS ON '94 
</P>

<P>
 On the day the Dodgers prepared to celebrate the beginning of a new era, 
remnants of the old one resurfaced, blurring not only today's 1994 opener but a 
season that appeared full of promise. 
</P>
<P>
 When the team arrived for Monday's workout, the future of Darryl Strawberry 
hung like a dark cloud over Dodger Stadium, causing Manager Tom Lasorda to 
address the issue in an intense clubhouse team meeting while club officials 
took secret exits to avoid a crush of reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, later in the day, Strawberry, who failed to show up for the final 
exhibition game Sunday against the Angels, told club officials he has an 
alcohol and drug addiction and will enter a treatment program today. He was 
placed on the disabled list, and his future remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is likely to shadow the team in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to stay with us because that is the fair thing for Darryl, and 
everything has it's due process," Orel Hershiser said. "But it's a shame from a 
team standpoint because there are so many positive things going on in this 
locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darryl can control so much of the media attention with his presence, either 
positive or negative, that he can overshadow almost anything that can happen in 
this clubhouse -- barring a perfect game or a guy hitting for the cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "As for everything that can happen on and off the field, Darryl dictates 
what's probably going to be written on the top of the newspapers or the 
headline stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "So it is a shame, because there are so many positive things, with Chan Ho 
(Park) and Darren (Dreifort) and the resurgence of the offense and the defense, 
and Delino (DeShields). "Hopefully, it will turn around quickly. But have we 
ever let something like this die quickly?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers open the season today against the Florida Marlins with a lineup 
full of young, fresh talent and a good blend of veterans. They have two new 
coaches, former players Bill Russell and Reggie Smith, whom the players say 
helped instill a new intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 After a calm spring, the Dodgers returned to Los Angeles from Florida with a 
lineup that showed power, speed and depth everywhere except starting pitching. 
But in a crowning moment for an organization once known for its pitching depth, 
rookies Park and Dreifort made the team, becoming the first Dodgers since Sandy 
Koufax to skip the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Strawberry's absence will be felt. Although he wasn't fully back, he was 
hitting the ball hard. Moreover, even if Strawberry isn't productive, his 
presence is still important as the team's only left-handed power hitter. As the 
cleanup hitter, Strawberry was slated to bat between Mike Piazza and Eric 
Karros, helping them get better pitches to hit. The batting order is now in a 
state of flux. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not let this deny us," Lasorda said. "We have worked hard all spring 
and no one man is going to stop us. We will have nine guys out there (today) 
and they are not going to let anything distract them." 
</P>
<P>
 If this team is able to survive the distractions, they still can contend in 
the National League West, though a productive Strawberry would help in the 
effort to edge the favored San Francisco Giants. For the first time in three 
seasons, the Dodgers are hinging all their hope on Strawberry, instead 
spreading the power among Piazza, Karros, rookie right-fielder Raul Mondesi and 
a revived Tim Wallach.  
</P>
<P>
 Behind Piazza, the Dodgers hit 42 home runs in 30 spring games. Strawberry hit 
four. If there is a question about whether Piazza, the 1993 NL rookie of the 
year, is for real, consider this statistic: He hit nine home runs in 30 games, 
while averaging about six innings a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the deepest team since 1988 maybe, when we had Mickey Hatcher and Tracy 
Woodson and those guys," said Hershiser, the only player remaining from the 
Dodgers' last World Series championship team.  
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in a while, the Dodgers have a set lineup to field, with 
five of the regulars no older than 26. Four of those players were developed in 
the Dodger system -- Piazza, Karros, Mondesi and Jose Offerman. Playing left 
field in place of Strawberry will be Henry Rodriguez, 26, a left-handed hitter 
whose promise of power has yet to materialize. Mitch Webster will probably also 
play some in left, as well as Cory Snyder when he returns from the disabled 
list. Billy Ashley, who was recalled from Albuquerque on Monday, will also be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look back it feels good to be the first (farm product) after some down 
years," Karros said. "The team had a five-year plan they put in effect in 1988, 
the year I was drafted, to try and restore the minor leagues. And it is neat to 
see it come to fruition. The plan was to keep us playing together in the system 
until we got here. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . It's the first time in the three seasons that I have been with the team 
that I really think we can win, it's not just talk. This is the most optimistic 
I have been. We do have a good team, and the biggest difference is offensively, 
we are much better." 
</P>
<P>
 The team's new second baseman, DeShields, dazzled Dodger fans Friday night 
during the Freeway Series with his defensive skills, but he is equally 
effective on the basepaths. As the leadoff hitter batting ahead of Brett 
Butler, DeShields' speed can help produce runs. During the spring, Butler and 
DeShields worked on a first-to-third play -- whereby DeShields takes off from 
first base on the pitch, Butler bunts to third and DeShields winds up there.  
</P>
<P>
 DeShields has also helped shortstop Offerman, who fielded smoothly during the 
spring. Offerman returned from winter ball about 25 pounds heavier and a lot 
happier. A two-year, $2.115 million contract seemed to relax him even more. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the year that is going to tell with Offy," said Russell, the Dodgers' 
former shortstop and new bench coach. "It's his third year out and there is 
some maturity that comes along with it. If we are going to win, he has to pick 
his game up a notch and this is the year. I see a guy who is not taking the 
game for granted. It's a happy Offy this spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi, 23, was favored for the right field job when he entered spring 
training, and he did not disappoint. Even if Snyder hadn't been sidelined with 
injuries, it would be difficult for the Dodgers to keep Mondesi's power, speed 
and defensive skills on the bench. He has the best arm on the team and 
challenged runners all spring, recording seven outfield assists, a remarkable 
feat.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Lasorda's persistence that helped Mondesi at the plate. Whether a road 
game or not, Mondesi was required to hit 200 curveballs, thrown by Lasorda and 
whoever Lasorda could corral to help, every day of the spring. At one point, 
Mondesi was so sore from the extra hitting that Lasorda gave him three days 
off, but only one game off. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Dodgers' pitching that has the most question marks. The team doesn't 
have an ace starter and really wouldn't need one if the offense and defense 
continues to be strong, assuming they have five average starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Astacio has the potential to shine, but he was slowed this spring by 
cardiac tests. Ramon Martinez's velocity has returned, but he has been 
inconsistent over the spring and the last two seasons. Kevin Gross battled 
tendinitis throughout the winter and spring, but continued to throw every other 
day. Only Orel Hershiser and Tom Candiotti were able to show some consistency 
this spring. Chan Ho Park, who is a starter, will begin in the bullpen, but 
could work into the rotation quickly if the starters falter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bullpen, the Dodgers are again counting on closer Todd Worrell, who 
appears to be healthy and has been throwing hard. Jim Gott, who so ably filled 
Worrell's role last season when he was sidelined, has been ineffective in the 
spring, but pitching coach Ron Perranoski says it's a matter of Gott finding 
his timing. If he does, he is presently slated for the setup role, along with 
Roger McDowell, who also had a solid season last year and has looked good in 
the spring.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers added left-handed reliever Gary Wayne, who was released by the 
Colorado Rockies after last season. Wayne had a dismal record in the thin air 
of Mile High Stadium, but a solid road record, and he won the job outright over 
five others.  
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort, a hard-throwing reliever, is targeted as the closer of the future, 
but first he and Park need some seasoning at the major league level. It will be 
more difficult for Park then Dreifort, who has pitched in front of thousands in 
the College World Series while playing for Wichita State. But the language 
barrier for Park, who speaks little English, and the minor differences in 
baseball rules between here and South Korea will take adjustment.  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Amalfitano returns as the third base coach, Perranoski as pitching coach 
and Mark Cresse as the bullpen coach. Russell will be the bench coach and 
Smith, besides the hitting coach, will coach first base.  
</P>
<P>
 The addition of Russell and Smith seemed to make an impact on the players, who 
say they helped instill a competitive attitude. But with the distractions of 
Strawberry's situation, Lasorda will have his hands full trying to shuffle a 
lineup that was intact the entire spring. His 45-minute team meeting Monday 
seemed to go a long way in keeping his player's focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to turn your focus away from Darryl as a person and say for the 
betterment of our team we have to block this out," Hershiser said. "We have to 
go on and make the best of what we can do. That is very insensitive on the 
personal level, but it is necessary on the professional level."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S FINAL; IT'S ARKANSAS BY A HOG'S SNOUT, 76-72; 
TITLE GAME: THE RAZORBACKS FINISH ON TOP AFTER A DRAMATIC SEESAW BATTLE WITH 
DUKE FOR THE NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It will be remembered as the shot that sent Arkansas to hog heaven, the shot 
that Duke feared, the shot that sent Scotty Thurman to midcourt to scold the 
disbelieving crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget about 40 minutes of hell. For Arkansas, its 76-72 victory against Duke 
in Monday night's NCAA championship game will be linked forever to one second 
of silence. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how much time was left on the shot clock as Thurman, Arkansas' chatty 
forward, launched a three-pointer with Blue Devil defender Antonio Lang 
seemingly attached to his midsection. Only 51.7 seconds remained in the game. 
The score was tied, 70-70, and a title hung in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 So Thurman took the shot, the shot with such humble beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to get it over his hands," said Thurman. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to the amazement of Lang, he did. As a zero appeared on the shot clock 
and the horn sounded, Thurman's three-point attempt fell through the net. Lang 
and the Charlotte Coliseum crowd of 23,674, many of whom wore the colors of 
Duke, watched in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was right on him," Lang said. "I still don't know how it went in." 
</P>
<P>
 No one did. Except Thurman. Moments after making what amounted to the 
game-winning shot, Thurman stood at midcourt and delivered a short and sweet 
lecture to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're surprised about that, huh?" said Thurman, as if he never had a doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas' first NCAA basketball title didn't come easily. The Blue Devils, on 
the strength of a 13-0 second-half run, had a 10-point lead with 17 minutes to 
play. The tempo at the time -- slow, leisurely -- favored Duke. All seemed 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson called a timeout, yelled a little, kept 
his chalkboard in hiding and delivered a challenge. The Razorbacks heard. Less 
than five minutes later, the scored was tied, 52-52. 
</P>
<P>
 Back and forth the lead went. Duke would build a five-point margin, only to 
see Arkansas bully its way back in front. And when the Razorbacks surged ahead 
by five, the Blue Devils would squirm back to even, the last time at 70-70. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Thurman. And some sort of destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt like time was running out," he said. "Someone had to step up and 
take the shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Left behind in the Duke locker room were two sheets of paper on Blue Devil 
stationery. Printed in blue ink were keys to the game. Key No. 2 for the Duke 
defense: Must stay with perimeter people -- Trace the ball. Take away threes.  
</P>
<P>
 Lang stayed with Thurman, but he couldn't take away the three. When it snapped 
the net, Arkansas and Richardson had the national championship he craved. At 
last -- at least in his mind -- the Razorbacks had earned the proper respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Arkansas had earned it long before Monday. But just in case anyone 
had forgotten, Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski offered a reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to say that Arkansas is a great team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the Razorbacks were led by power forward Corliss Williamson, who 
struggled in the first half but asserted himself when it counted -- in the late 
going, when Arkansas needed him most. He finished with 23 points, eight 
rebounds, two blocks and two steals. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't exactly what Duke had hoped for. All tournament long, the Blue 
Devils had been able to shut down the opponent's leading scorer. They did it 
against Texas Southern's Theon Dotson, Michigan State's Shawn Respert, 
Marquette's Damon Key and Purdue's Glenn Robinson. But when it came time to 
stop the "Big Nasty," as his teammates call him, Duke could only do so much. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough to stay inside when the shots weren't falling," Williamson said. 
"But the coaches helped me stay focused and concentrate on what I needed to do 
inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson had lots of help. Guard Corey Beck had 15 points, but more 
importantly had 10 rebounds. Thurman scored 15 points, including the basket 
heard 'round the Ozarks. Ten -- count 'em -- 10 Razorbacks were shuffled in and 
out of the lineup all night. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was predictable enough. Grant Hill, Duke's All-America swingman, 
was hounded at every turn. Instead, the Razorbacks let the likes of Cherokee 
Parks, Marty Clark, Jeff Capel, Chris Collins and whoever else try to beat 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were very deep and they went after me," said Hill, who scored only 12 
points (5.5 below his average). Apparently, 38 minutes of Hill wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I looked up there was a guy on me," he said. "We knew that going 
in, that they were going to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing, but then doing something about it are two different things. According 
to the Duke scouting report, Hill was supposed to take the ball out at every 
opportunity. Arkansas countered by applying constant pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill had 14 rebounds, but he made only four of 11 shots, one of four 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did a good job," said Hill. "They made things difficult for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 And wonderful for Richardson, who has now won a junior college national 
championship, an NIT title and an NCAA trophy. But this one was special for 
other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 When the trophy was handed to him by Tom Butters, the NCAA selection committee 
chairman and, as fate would have it, athletic director at Duke, Richardson's 
thoughts turned elsewhere, to his daughter Yvonne, who died several years ago 
of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Richardson: "As I walked out here -- like I do every game -- I say what I 
say to her every night after a ballgame: 'Baby, we gotcha another one.' "

STRAWBERRY'S TRIALS MAKE FOR LONG DAY; BASEBALL: CLAIRE SAYS THAT THE DODGERS 
WERE INITIALLY 'VERY CLOSE' TO RELEASING THE SLUGGER, BUT ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF 
SUBSTANCE ABUSE CHANGED THAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Fred Claire, Dodger executive vice president, Darryl Strawberry's 
acknowledgment of substance abuse was the end to a long, fitful 24 hours of 
speculation, fury, sadness and, ultimately, sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Strawberry did not show up for a game against the Angels, then gave 
Claire a flimsy excuse when he was finally reached Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday began with an enraged Claire admittedly "very close" to releasing his 
$20-million player and ended with Strawberry, still a Dodger, headed for 
treatment with the Dodgers' blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday evening, less than a day before his team's season opener, Claire, his 
face moistened by the heat of television lights, looked exhausted, but 
relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone will have their thoughts about Darryl," Claire said of the 
Dodger players. "They'll obviously be anxious to know what has happened and I 
think probably feel relieved that he is going to move on to address this. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think the team will lose its focus. We don't have any excuse, we 
can't pin any fault on Darryl for what we achieve or what we don't achieve. I 
think we've got a good group of players and I think they will play very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Orel Hershiser said his initial reaction to the announcement was 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's handled himself with the utmost character and integrity throughout the 
whole spring," Hershiser said. "So this problem, if he had it through spring 
training, was very well hidden." 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser, who will start today's game against the Florida Marlins, said the 
team must move past Strawberry's troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just lost one of our parts, but it's not like we're in the middle of a 
season and Darryl has been making a huge contribution," Hershiser said. "We're 
still 0-0, with a whole season in front of us, with 25 guys ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire, who has been criticized for his ill-fated decision to sign Strawberry 
to a long-term deal before the 1991 season, had his own, loud reaction to 
Strawberry's first excuse when he was finally reached Sunday night -- complete 
disdain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me a story yesterday that just didn't seem reasonable to me," Claire 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Claire believe that his strong response to a weak explanation helped 
Strawberry come clean Monday? 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps," Claire said. "Because I don't think in any case or at any time 
we've ever looked the other way. I haven't really let Darryl look the other way 
or tried not to. . . . So he knew that I wasn't going to let him up or have him 
say something that didn't sound reasonable to me or without a full explanation 
of what it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad he's faced it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers signed Strawberry knowing his history with alcohol problems -- 
Strawberry spent time at the Smithers Center in 1990 -- but Claire said he saw 
no signs of new problems recently. 
</P>
<P>
 After two seasons spent mostly on the sideline and recent controversies 
involving tax investigations and Strawberry's callous comments about the 
Southern California wildfires, this spring had been quiet for Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's just a difficult problem and a big part of it obviously is 
denial," Claire said. "When you see Darryl playing well, performing well, in 
the clubhouse, on time, getting along with his teammates, good attitude, that's 
pretty tough to break all of that down and try to read something else into it." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire, who was careful to avoid forecasting Strawberry's future with the 
team, had the experience of dealing with Steve Howe's drug problems almost 10 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers supported Howe through difficult times, Claire said, and would 
support Strawberry now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that Steve is still playing major league baseball (with the New 
York Yankees) and that's significant," Claire said. "Because who knows how a 
case may end. To that degree, yes, I've always thought that that was successful 
because Steve is alive and well and playing major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's a happy ending." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry was placed on the 15-day disabled list, which could be extended to 
a much longer stay, and Claire was evasive when asked if Strawberry would play 
for the Dodgers again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have two issues -- you have Darryl the person and we certainly 
have not turned our backs on Darryl the person," Claire said. "And you have 
Darryl the ballplayer, and that is something we will have to evaluate." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dodger Manager Tom Lasorda before the extent of Strawberry's problem was 
known: "Do I want him on the ballclub? That's not my decision to make. He has a 
ton of talent. He's also had a lot of problems in his baseball career. It's 
sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry's attorney, Bob Shapiro, said his client told him he was driven to 
drugs to try to relieve building pressures and burdens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stress of performing, the stress of coming back and performing at the 
level that a ballplayer of his reputation is expected to do," Shapiro said. 
"There are high expectations for him every time he steps up to the plate."

FOR THE BRUINS, INTRODUCTIONS ALL AROUND; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: UCLA HAS ADDED FOUR 
NEW ASSISTANTS AS SPRING PRACTICE OPENS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No, it's not true that the students will be running the class, but there could 
be more questions than answers when UCLA opens spring football practice today 
in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive coaches might need name tags. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, Coach Terry Donahue said. "The guys I've hired are all 
experienced. That makes it easier for them to come in. . . . I think we've had 
enough time to get everybody acclimated." 
</P>
<P>
 The guys are Bob Toledo, Gary Bernardi, Mike Sherman and Norm Anderson, all 
offensive assistants brought in to replace Homer Smith, Bill Rees, Bob Palcic 
and Rick Neuheisel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difficulty for the coaches has been that Terry pretty much wanted to keep 
everything the same -- the plays and the terminology," said Toledo, the 
offensive coordinator who will call plays from the sideline this season -- 
unlike Smith, his predecessor, who preferred to work from the press box. "So 
I've tried to use a word-association game to learn it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took over as offensive coordinator at Oregon and Texas A&M, we used my 
system and they had to learn it. But this won't be a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Greater problems figure to be dealing with an injury that has already hampered 
the offense, and finding defensive replacements for those who have finished 
their eligibility or are trying their luck in the NFL draft a season early. 
</P>
<P>
 When Skip Hicks took off awkwardly on a rain-damp long-jumping board during a 
track meet on March 19, and landed even more awkwardly, tearing a ligament in 
his left knee, he took a long list of possibilities out of the UCLA attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury usually requires a nine- to 12-month rehabilitation process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before that, I considered running back probably our deepest position," 
Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had Hicks, who rushed for a team-high 563 yards and five touchdowns 
in an injury-marred freshman season, and Sharmon Shah, who rushed for 187 yards 
in a victory over Stanford before his sophomore season was shut down because of 
a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Ayers and veteran Daron Washington were also back. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hicks was the starter and the kind of back to build a running game around. 
Fortunately for the new coaches, the old passing game is back, which means 
Wayne Cook, an honorable-mention All-Pacific 10 quarterback last season, 
throwing to All-American J.J. Stokes, Kevin Jordan, Mike Nguyen and Bryan 
Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 Having an experienced quarterback to run the offense in the spring is 
something of a novelty for the Bruins. It hasn't happened since Tommy Maddox 
left school for the Denver Broncos in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've met with the quarterbacks only briefly, like, 'Hi, how are you? What's 
your major?' that sort of thing," Toledo said. "I've watched the film and I 
think we've picked up a flaw in Cook's throwing motion that we want to work on, 
and we've got to work to cut down on his fumbling. We think we can help." 
</P>
<P>
 As can Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 "With his experience running this offense, I'd be foolish not to listen to 
him," Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters is the search for replacements for four-year starter 
Craig Novitsky at left guard and Vaughn Parker at right tackle. Defensively, 
the converse is true -- the coaches are UCLA veterans, but many of the veteran 
players are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only seven defensive backs on the depth chart, Marvin Goodwin having 
decided to cast his lot with the NFL after his junior season and Tommy Bennett 
still trying to sort out legal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of linebackers, but starters Nkosi Littleton and Jamir 
Miller, an All-American as a junior and a probable NFL draft selection, have to 
be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Up front, a replacement for longtime starting tackle Matt Werner must be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaching staff, both new and old members, have scattered around the 
country, visiting the San Francisco 49ers, Phoenix Cardinals, New Orleans 
Saints, Houston Oilers and Florida State University to try to find an idea or 
two to incorporate at UCLA.

DALIS 'DISAPPOINTED,' BUT HARRICK WILL STAY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: UCLA ATHLETIC 
DIRECTOR SAYS COACH TOLD HIM: 'IT'S MY FAULT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 UCLA Athletic Director Peter Dalis said he was "deeply disappointed" with the 
Bruins' basketball season, but that there would be no serious repercussions for 
Coach Jim Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's our coach," Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalis met with Harrick and said the coach blamed himself for the way the 
Bruins closed out their 21-7 season, which ended with a 112-102 loss to Tulsa 
in the first round of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim is one of those coaches who says it was his fault," Dalis said. "He said 
'Pete, it's my fault.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins started 14-0 and were ranked No. 1, but finished the season 7-7, 
and as the No. 5-seeded team in the Midwest Regional lost to 12th-seeded Tulsa 
in the opening round. Tulsa led at one point in the first half, 46-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's anyone who is associated with UCLA who was happy with 
anything the last half of the year and in the tournament," Dalis said. "I was 
deeply disappointed. I think we all are. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of viewed the Tulsa game the same as I viewed Arizona's loss to Santa 
Clara last year and USC's loss to Fresno State (in the 1992 Freedom Bowl 
football game)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dalis characterized UCLA's season as "reasonably good." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he met with Harrick and assistant coaches Lorenzo Romar, Mark 
Gottfried and Steve Lavin for a routine postseason review. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dalis said no central theme emerged as the primary reason for UCLA's 
problems, he pointed out one drawback that he thought needed to be corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we were very sound fundamentally," said Dalis, who instructed 
the coaching staff to teach more on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll need to demonstrate they can do that," Dalis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick has won at least 20 games and taken the Bruins into the NCAA 
tournament in each of his six seasons at UCLA. He has two years remaining on 
his contract, which was extended last year.

HOW THURMAN SHOT THE SOCKS OFF DUKE; KEY PLAY: HIS THREE-POINT BASKET WITH 51.7 
SECONDS TO PLAY IS CRUCIAL TO VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Scotty Thurman was 6, he used to wad up a few pairs of socks, bend a 
hanger into a circle and fire the socks into the handmade hoop while he lay on 
the sofa in the living room of his home in Ruston, La. 
</P>
<P>
 Levell Thurman didn't mind if his son shot socks, but when Scotty's mother, 
Roma, came home, he had to pack up the living room basketball game before she 
got a look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspiration is where you find it, and Monday night in the NCAA championship 
game, Scotty Thurman might have found his from way back in his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Thurman's 22-foot three-pointer that broke a 70-70 tie with 51.7 
seconds and sent the Arkansas Razorbacks on their way to a 76-72 victory over 
Duke and their first NCAA title. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman pulled the trigger from a spot on the right wing as the shot clock 
spun down to nothing. With Antonio Lang rushing toward him, Thurman let it go 
over Lang's outstretched arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman socked it to him. 
</P>
<P>
 And so Scotty Thurman, former high school student council president, repealed 
Duke's bid to win another national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It had to be this way, he said, mainly because he's been waiting for this 
occasion since 1987, when he watched on television as Keith Smart of Indiana 
beat Syracuse in the NCAA championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my mind, it's always been there, that memory, thinking about 
it," Thurman said. "I was hoping sometime it would happen again. I was hoping 
it would be me." 
</P>
<P>
 He got his chance and he came through just like teammate Corey Beck thought he 
would. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, he is playing like a man," Beck said. "That little boy who 
came out of high school is gone. I had a lot of confidence in him. I'm glad he 
is the one that took the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Clint McDaniel, clutching the championship trophy in the locker room, said 
Thurman was something more than clutch. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the clock running down, he just steps up and rips it," McDaniel said. 
"That has to be one of the best shots of all time. Scotty is going to go down 
in history with that shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it almost didn't happen. Thurman got the ball from Dwight Stewart, who 
passed it to him from the top of the circle after muffing a pass from Beck. 
Stewart said he had intended to shoot it, but didn't after he fumbled the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been telling him 'It's gonna fall, It's gonna fall' before because he 
had sort of been struggling," Stewart said. "Then he put it up. I was just 
praying." 
</P>
<P>
 Duke would not be able to come back, which is what McDaniel expected once he 
saw Thurman's shot fall through the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started celebrating," said McDaniel, who pointed out one obvious benefit of 
winning the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to practice tomorrow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman said first he knew the time, then said he had no idea there was almost 
nothing left on the shot clock. He was only thinking about shooting, which he 
said is about the same whether you're 6 and lying on the couch shooting socks 
or 20 and trying to win the biggest prize in college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it came through the net, it had to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It had to be, all right, which is what Grant Hill said afterward with 
admiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great players make great shots," he said.

OPPONENTS CRACK, BUT MEYERS KEEPS HIS COMPOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It could have become the ugliest moment of Jason Meyers' high school tennis 
career. Instead, Meyers turned the potentially disastrous situation into 
perhaps his finest moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year during a Southern Section playoff match against Marina, a frustrated 
opponent apparently decided he couldn't beat Meyers on the court, so he began 
serving him four-letter words and disparaging remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 With an excitable crowd and a nervous coach looking on, Meyers kept his mouth 
shut and let his racket do the smack-talking for him. Meyers won the match and 
led his University team to a convincing victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say anything that day because I knew we were there to win," Meyers 
said. "I knew if I kept my composure and won, it would shut (my opponent and 
his teammates) up. I'll never forget that though." 
</P>
<P>
 University Coach Josh Davis has not forgotten the incident either, and said 
Meyers' control that day was nothing unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't crack," Davis said. "If Jason starts talking back there, we could 
have had some major problems. But he's just so well-behaved on the court. He 
remains focused on what he's trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Meyers is more focused than ever. He is undefeated in 21 singles 
sets and three doubles sets while leading University to a 8-2 record and a 6-0 
mark in the tough Sea View League. During his four years at University, Meyers' 
teams have won 36 league matches and lost only three. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge Coach Joan Willett has mixed feelings about seeing Meyers graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jason's a fine competitor," she said. "He's always been a gentleman. I always 
enjoy having my team play against him, and you can't say that for a lot of high 
school tennis players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He plays tennis out there. There's no shenanigans. I don't mind losing to a 
good competitor like Jason. But team-wise, I'll be happy to see him go." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Davis won't be as happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been such a terrific player and role model for the other kids," Davis 
said. "It really helps make this a team sport when your best player is out 
there every day working his butt off." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when Meyers doesn't really have to be out there at all. Many high 
school coaches, including Davis, give their best players the option of 
attending practice or working with their private coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he doesn't want to come to practice, he doesn't have to," Davis said. "But 
he likes to come and work with the younger kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Often players with Meyers' talent barely make matches, let alone practices. 
But Meyers, ranked in the top 15 among 18-year-olds in Southern California, 
said he has never considered playing high school tennis a chore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like team tennis," he said. "I can work with myself and the team. The 
people who don't play it are missing being a part of something. It's very 
lonely just playing for yourself all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not only lonely, Meyers says, sometimes it can get awfully boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not consumed by tennis," he said. "If I'm out there practicing and I 
don't want to play, I'll leave the court. I have other things I can do, like go 
out with friends, maybe play some basketball or listen to music." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said his other interests have probably kept him from being nationally 
ranked. While the top players in Southern California are in Miami this week for 
the Easter Bowl tournament, Meyers is at home playing high school matches 
because his ranking wasn't high enough to secure an invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 He was listed as an Easter Bowl alternate for the boys' 18 age group. But even 
if he had been invited, Meyers said he probably couldn't have afforded the trip 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I wanted to practice four hours a day and work out all the time, I could 
probably get a higher ranking," he said. "But I play tennis for fun. I have a 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Meyers has been successful enough to earn a partial scholarship to Cal 
Poly San Luis Obispo, where he will major in sports psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got this scholarship for myself and my parents," he said. "I owed them so 
much. They cared about me and spent a lot of time and money on my tennis 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 But before he leaves for college, Meyers has a few goals left to attain in 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to reach the finals of the Ojai (Valley) tournament and I'd like 
(the team) to win league again," he said. "I've improved a lot from last year. 
I'm pretty confident now." 
</P>
<P>
 An example of Meyers' improved play came last week when he beat Palos Verdes 
Peninsula's Dennis Chang, 6-0. Chang had beaten Meyers the last two years, but 
Meyers refused to let Chang get away with a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chang was serving at 40-love and Jason could have said, 'I'll serve at 5-1 
and forget about it,' " Davis said. "But Jason fought back and won the next 
five points to close it out. That says a lot about what he's brought to this 
team the last four years."

O.C. ART / CATHY CURTIS; LAGUNA MUSEUM DISMISSES MORE THAN A DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was just as amazed to hear it as you probably were. Charles Desmarais, 
director of the Laguna Art Museum for 5 1/2 years, suddenly dismissed by the 
executive committee of the museum's board of trustees? 
</P>
<P>
 After turning a sleepy, provincial museum into an institution offering 
intelligently curated, often venturesome shows of contemporary and historical 
art? How could this be? 
</P>
<P>
 It has been impossible to get a substantive answer from people close to the 
museum. Board president Teri Kennady has said only that the board wanted "more 
energy to be put in administration," and her fellow board members have 
maintained a uniform silence. 
</P>
<P>
 So what gives? 
</P>
<P>
 The major cause of board dissatisfaction seems to be the outcome of a decision 
Desmarais announced in May 1990, nearly two years after he came to the museum. 
After looking unsuccessfully for a replacement for chief curator Michael 
McManus, who had resigned in spring of 1989, Desmarais announced that he would 
take over the job himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he created a new position -- associate director, filled by 
former South Coast Repertory development director Bonnie Brittain Hall -- 
specifically to give himself more time for curating, he said. Hall was to 
assume about one-third of his administrative duties. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good. There is ample precedent for a director serving as his own 
chief curator, with or without the title. The most famous example is Sherman 
Lee, former director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, whose expertise lay in 
Chinese art. Martin Friedman, former director of the Walker Art Center in 
Minneapolis, was a renowned curator of contemporary art. Richard Koshalek, 
director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, has curated major 
architecture shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a director is not curating," Desmarais said Friday. "Being a director 
is managing the entire program. Some curator-directors in the world are both 
great curators and great directors. They're people to emulate. But I also think 
each institution has its own needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw this situation as one that required my attention to curatorial matters 
in a way that (former Newport Harbor Art Museum director) Kevin Consey didn't 
have to because . . . the museum was at a different point in its growth." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it was. The Laguna Art Museum's previous director, William Otton, had 
not provided strong artistic leadership. Although he presided over a $1.6 
million renovation of the museum, which doubled exhibition space, the art shown 
in that space consisted mostly (despite McManus' efforts) of routine Southern 
California plein-air painting and middle-of-the-road Southern California 
contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
 When Otton accepted the position of president of the Art Institute of Southern 
California in 1987, the Laguna Art Museum's board made no bones about looking 
for someone who would put the institution "on the map" in artistic circles. And 
it put its money where its mouth was. 
</P>
<P>
 Otton, who had never directed a museum before, was making an annual salary of 
about $40,000 when he left. Desmarais, an acknowledged expert in photography 
who had been director of the California Museum of Photography at UC Riverside 
for more than seven years -- where he led a $2.6 million capital fund drive -- 
was paid $88,000. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The investment paid off. In 1990, Desmarais' impact on the exhibition schedule 
(normally planned several years ahead) first became visible. His show "Why I 
Got Into TV and Other Stories: The Art of Ilene Segalove" offered a generous 
sampler of photography and video by an artist from Los Angeles who brings a 
sharp focus to the banalities of suburban life. 
</P>
<P>
 The following year, Desmarais curated the museum's first architecture show, 
"Morphosis: Making Architecture," a rather baffling and precious affair. But it 
was accompanied by an excellent lecture series -- another major stride the 
museum made under his guidance, in addition to a quantum leap in the scholarly 
content of publications. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 Desmarais hit the jackpot with his critically well received "Proof: 
Los Angeles Art and the Photograph, 1960-1980," a fresh examination of work by 
nearly 50 artists who emphasize aspects of gullibility and skepticism inherent 
in photography. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was sponsored by the well-respected Fellows of Contemporary Art and 
is traveling to other institutions, including the Friends of Photography Ansel 
Adams Center in San Francisco, the Tampa Museum of Art and the Des Moines Art 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais also organized most of the one-person shows for the South Coast 
Plaza satellite site in Costa Mesa -- most memorably, installations by Paul 
Kos, Dawn Fryling, Sono Osato and Jean Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, it does seem that this site might have been turned over more 
often to the curatorial staff, Bolton Colburn, curator of collections, and 
Susan Anderson, curator of exhibitions. Too often, their shows for the main 
museum were relegated to out-of-the-way spots, and they received little credit 
in membership calendars and press materials. 
</P>
<P>
 When Anderson did get to work on toothier material -- her 1990 "Pursuit of the 
Marvelous: Stanley William Hayter, Charles Howard and Gordon Onslow Ford" -- it 
suffered the indignity of being temporarily removed to make room for the annual 
art auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some museum supporters point out that Desmarais seemed content to bask in the 
popular embrace of "Kustom Kulture," -- the car culture show in 1993 that 
brought in a record 17,000 visitors -- without giving more than token 
acknowledgment to guest curator Craig Stecyk and co-curator Colburn. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, however, Desmarais went from strength to strength. His first-ever 
retrospective of seminal California modernist and former Dana Point resident 
John McLaughlin -- scheduled to open in October 1995 -- has been eagerly 
anticipated by the art world. As of Friday, Desmarais and the trustees had not 
discussed the future of that show, for which the museum received a $50,000 
grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Desmarais credits assistant curator Lisa Buck for her research 
contributions, the McLaughlin exhibition is firmly identified with his vision, 
so much so that key lenders might reconsider their participation if he were no 
longer associated with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The best solution, if Desmarais is appointed to either of the directorial 
positions for which he is in the running in Houston and Miami, might be to 
transfer the grant to his new institution (a tactic the NEA has permitted in 
other cases) and have the show travel to the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of grants, under Desmarais' leadership the museum did not appear to 
be faltering in the fund-raising department. Quite the contrary. (Hall resigned 
last December. Desmarais said at the time that he reassumed most of her 
administrative responsibilities.) 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's predecessor, Lynn Kirst, initiated a corporate council made up of 
donors committed to giving at least $5,000 annually. Major grants during 
Desmarais' tenure included a record $1 million from the Harry and Grace Steele 
Foundation, a $150,000 Special Artist Initiatives Grant from the NEA and a 
$75,000 award from the Institute of Museum Services, a federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steele gift was part of $1.8 million in gifts and pledges received for the 
museum's 75th-anniversary endowment fund drive, a respectable amount in a 
faltering economic climate. The deficit shrank from $450,000 in 1988 to 
$118,000 this year. And there were no layoffs or reductions in the operating 
budget (now $1.7 million) -- tactics to which the Newport Harbor Art Museum had 
to resort during the past couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais' administrative skills also involved an ability to play off one need 
against another when money was tight, always in service to the museum's key 
resources -- exhibitions and staff. At least once, the trash pickup bill went 
unpaid for a short while, and in 1991 the staff took an unpaid three-day 
furlough. But only one major exhibition ("The Transparent Thread: Asian 
Philosophy in Recent American Art," from the Hofstra Museum) was canceled for 
lack of funding. 
</P>
<P>
 It also must be remembered, as the director of another art institution 
recently remarked to me, that "artistic vision is the rare commodity" in a 
director. Although business concerns do matter, "a museum's main job is not to 
make ends meet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So what, exactly, was the problem? Desmarais said Friday that the board never 
gave him a written evaluation of his performance, and neither the board nor its 
executive committee ever formally discussed with him any problems they had with 
the way he ran the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always discussed it with one or two people, a shifting group of people," he 
said. "There was no way to know in what form (my remarks) reached the executive 
committee. That was one of the great unfairnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, an impasse between Desmarais and the board came to a head. "I 
told the board I was willing to do whatever they wanted me to do. I said I 
would spend all my time on administration and fund-raising, if that's what they 
wanted. But one thing I heard was that they wanted me to do only curatorial 
things, and they would get a financial manager." 
</P>
<P>
 Disgruntled by this turn of affairs and the "breakdown in communication" that 
helped to cause it, Desmarais said he decided to "accommodate (the trustees) 
until I moved on to something more suited to me." 
</P>
<P>
 But the trustees had the last word when they sent Desmarais' attorney a letter 
of termination (with no explanation of the cause) and a severance check for an 
amount he calls "substantial." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Museums are volatile places, rife with clashing styles and egos, and able 
directors -- whether happy or not in their current situations -- tend to have 
their sights set on working at more prestigious institutions. Laguna Beach 
certainly could not have kept Desmarais forever, even if it wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems incredible that the board did not work out some arrangement 
whereby Desmarais would stay on the job, at least for a temporary period, and 
continue to give the museum the benefit of his expertise. It's hard to 
understand why it was worth a hefty severance check to get rid of the man 
rather than work out some mutually beneficial solution that would be less 
costly to the museum in these financially difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's another consideration: The art world is a small place. Before 
summarily dismissing such a valued member of the art community, the board 
should have considered what message its action might send to potential 
candidates for the job. After all, there's plenty of competition: At least 20 
art museums in the U.S. are looking for directors. Why risk alienating the next 
Charles Desmarais?

 Nanny taxes -- The Social Security Administration must record taxes on wages 
for at least 40 quarters, which translates into 10 years, before a nanny can 
qualify to collect a retirement check. A March 28 editorial misstated the 
number of quarters during which an employer must pay taxes in order for a 
household worker to receive benefits.

 Image Entertainment Inc. -- The Times incorrectly reported March 29 the total 
amount of interest the Chatsworth laser disc distributor would save after 
voluntarily paying down some of its debt during its fiscal year that ended 
March 31. All told, those debt reductions will result in annual interest 
expense savings of $725,000 for Image Entertainment Inc.
