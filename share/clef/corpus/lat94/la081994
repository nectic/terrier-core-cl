 Bailiff -- seize that billboard! We wonder if jurors in either the O.J. 
Simpson or Heidi Fleiss trials will be allowed to dine at the Original Pantry 
Cafe on Figueroa Street. Well, maybe -- if they promise not to look across the 
street at the big billboard advertising, "NOT GUILTY JEANS." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The latest insult lobbed Southern California's way: A Money magazine survey 
indicates that the Internal Revenue Service is more suspicious of L.A. than 
most areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency audited 1.21% of L.A.'s returns in 1993, the fourth-highest figure 
among the 63 IRS regions. Orange County shouldn't smirk. It came in at No. 7. 
Las Vegas was the most heavily audited (gee, you mean you can't trust Vegas?). 
</P>
<P>
 The survey seems to be disturbing news for local taxpayers who aren't fleeing 
the area. But is it? With the publication of the magazine article, perhaps the 
IRS will figure that Angelenos are going to be more careful in filling out 
their next returns. And the agency's hounds will concentrate, instead, on the 
least-audited cities, such as No. 63 Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Or is that what the IRS expects us to think? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To the tune of "It's a Small World": A road sign in Nevada seems to indicate 
that IRS targets L.A. and Las Vegas are also close geographically, as is Salt 
Lake City.

 List of the Day: As always, the Los Angeles Downtown News' annual reader 
survey awarded some illustrious titles.  
</P>
<P>
 * Best Panhandler: "Shorty at 5th and San Pedro" outpolled "The friendly, 
lanky guy who rotates his hand around his stomach at the corner of 3rd and 
Figueroa." Also nominated: "The state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 * Local Space Mountain: Bunker Hill, which won that nickname because so little 
of its commercial office space has been rented. 
</P>
<P>
 * L.A.'s Real Mickey Mouse: Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti, City Councilwoman Rita Walters, Mayor Richard Riordan, Police Chief 
Willie Williams and Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 * Best Public Art: "Corporate Head," by Terry Allen at the Citicorp Plaza at 
7th and Figueroa streets, which is accompanied by this touching inscription by 
poet Philip Levine: 
</P>
<P>
 They said I had a head for business. They said to get ahead I had to lose my 
head. They said to be concrete and I became concrete. They said, go my son, 
multiply, divide and conquer. I did my best.  
</P>
<P>
 * Best Sports Team: L.A. Dodgers. But, of course, this survey was taken before 
the baseball strike, which has left fans feeling like butting their heads into 
concrete. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the phony words used by players but disallowed at the 1994 National 
Scrabble Championships at the Universal Hilton Hotel included ag, cooie, 
epeeing, eupniae, grrr, ghie, hogwire, isocaine, jeepy, jiviest, joup, kav, 
mauver, ouguiyas, outruin, overtaut, pfuis, smat, yuh and zoons. We still think 
something has gone hogwire with baseball.

WHEN HARD TIMES COME AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sweet, mournful melody that was the theme for Ken Burns' public television 
series "The Civil War" struck most hearers as period music. But it was in fact 
an original composition, "Ashokan Farewell," written by violinist and composer 
Jay Ungar. The period effect arose from the fact that Ungar wrote uncannily in 
the manner of the great Stephen Foster, who died in 1864. 
</P>
<P>
 One of several happy consequences of Burns' series has been a quiet Stephen 
Foster revival. Baritone Thomas Hampton -- backed by a group including Ungar 
himself -- released "American Dreamer: Songs of Stephen Foster" in 1992 while 
"The Civil War" was being shown, and the CD has continued to sell steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the songs on that album, none has struck a deeper chord than Foster's 
"Hard Times." Perhaps in the flush 1980s few would have paused, as Foster asks 
in his opening lines, to "sup sorrow with the poor." But a decade later, when 
everybody knows somebody who has lost a job, the sorrow seems less remote: 
</P>
<P>
 While we seek mirth and beauty  
</P>
<P>
 and music light and gay,  
</P>
<P>
 There are frail forms  
</P>
<P>
 fainting at the door.  
</P>
<P>
 Though their voices are silent,  
</P>
<P>
 their pleading looks will say,  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, hard times,  
</P>
<P>
 come again no more!"  
</P>
<P>
 By contemporary standards, Foster lays it on pretty thick, but people are 
evidently willing to listen. Emmylou Harris and Bob Dylan have also recently 
revived "Hard Times." 
</P>
<P>
 What can never be said can sometimes be sung. Self-reliance is the defining 
virtue of our culture, and most of the time people are as ashamed to offer pity 
as they would be to ask for it. But Foster sings of pity without shame, and 
"Hard Times" brings the same hush into the room that "Ashokan Farewell" 
brought. 
</P>
<P>
 In all its simplicity and sentimentality, this song has the daring to open a 
space for honorable failure in the land of obligatory success. Humming along 
with its chorus, words that Foster called "the psalm, the sigh, of the weary," 
the up-against-it may hear in the heart what pride stops them from saying 
aloud: 
</P>
<P>
 Hard times, hard times,  
</P>
<P>
 come again no more.  
</P>
<P>
 Many days you have lingered  
</P>
<P>
 around my cabin door.  
</P>
<P>
 Oh, hard times, come again no more.

THE NEW THREAT THAT MUST UNITE THE WORLD; PLUTONIUM TERRORISM: INTERNATIONAL 
ACTION IS NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plutonium, named for the ancient god of the mythic underworld, is becoming a 
commodity in the real international criminal underworld. A larger threat than 
this to international security is difficult to imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 A highly radioactive element that did not so much as exist before nuclear 
technology first produced it in the 1940s, plutonium is one of the most toxic 
substances known to science. One ten-thousandth of a gram, inhaled, can cause 
cancer. A few ounces in an urban water reservoir could cause hundreds of 
thousands of deaths. And plutonium-239, an isotope of the element, is a key 
ingredient in nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Weapons-grade plutonium has hitherto been under the military control of the 
world's few nuclear powers. Nuclear non-proliferation has been a continuing 
theme in international relations not just because a nuclear attack anywhere 
would be a catastrophe but because of the terrorist potential of plutonium in 
civilian hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent arrest in Germany of Spanish and Colombian civilians on charges of 
selling black-market plutonium apparently stolen somewhere in Russia suggests 
that the terror many have warned of may be becoming a reality. Russia has 
denied that the stolen plutonium comes from its military inventory, and the 
plutonium intercepted by German security is in fact of reactor-fuel grade 
rather than high-quality weapons-grade stuff. Unfortunately, a U.S. Department 
of Energy test recently confirmed that, properly handled, even reactor-grade 
plutonium can be used to make a bomb; and for other terrorist purposes, 
reactor-grade plutonium is as lethal as weapons-grade. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests in Germany instantly became a major German-Russian incident. 
Washington has protested to Moscow. To date, incensed Russian denials have 
yielded to only tentative cooperation. All this is worrisome: Even in the 
chilliest Cold War days, international civilian terrorism was one area in which 
East-West cooperation could usually be counted on. 
</P>
<P>
 Post-Cold War leaders must cooperate at least as well as Cold War leaders did. 
There may have been a breakdown in security at nuclear power plants in Russia 
and the other post-Soviet republics. Inventory control even at military 
installations may not be all it could be. But these problems exist in some form 
wherever plutonium exists, and they must be addressed as common problems, not 
offenses by one nation against another. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary recently 
confirmed that 6,000 pounds of plutonium was unaccounted for in U.S. 
inventories. And terrorist theft of plutonium from U.S. nuclear power plants 
cannot be ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 The German public has every reason to be particularly alarmed, but Americans 
have no reason for complacency. One of the plutonium smuggling suspects 
arrested in Germany is from Colombia. Islamic terrorist groups are increasingly 
active in Latin America. The United States has a notoriously porous, resolutely 
unmilitarized southern border. Preventing the unthinkable from happening calls 
for rethinking -- in a hurry -- the relations between crime fighting and 
national defense and between national and international security. Russia, this 
time -- and for its own sake above all -- has got to be an ally rather than 
anyone's ancestral enemy. No nation stands to lose more than Russia if the gods 
of the underworld make plutonium their drug of choice.

THE NAACP AT A DIFFICULT CROSSROADS; LEADERSHIP MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO ABOUT 
BENJAMIN CHAVIS' TROUBLED TENURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. -- and the civil rights organization he leads and 
deeply loves -- is in trouble. Whether or not he did anything wrong, and he 
says he didn't, Chavis and the NAACP can't escape the fallout from a former 
employee's accusations of sexual discrimination against an organization founded 
to fight discrimination and from questions about the use of NAACP funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubts about his leadership have been exacerbated by reports of a secret 
$332,000 settlement made without the knowledge of the board of directors to a 
woman who worked a scant five weeks for the NAACP. If Chavis did nothing wrong, 
what did he have to hide? This expenditure is even more controversial because 
the NAACP currently faces a $3-million deficit and concerns about its 
bookkeeping and spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions about Chavis' judgment are not isolated. His leadership has also 
come under attack because he invited Louis Farrakhan, the black separatist 
hatemonger, to an NAACP leadership summit. His inclusion of Farrakhan disturbed 
some traditional backers of the NAACP, including an older, more conservative 
generation of black Americans who pledge allegiance to integration, part of the 
group's original mission. Farrakhan's participation also offended some Jewish 
and other white supporters who pointed out that the NAACP's founders and 
continuing benefactors include Jews and other whites. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit Chavis energized a moribund NAACP, boosted membership and 
reached out to alienated young blacks who did not feel they had reaped the 
benefits of the civil rights movement. Can he and the NAACP recover from his 
cumulative troubles? Is it not in fact time for new leadership? 
</P>
<P>
 When the board meets in Baltimore on Saturday the directors must take firm 
steps, starting at the top, to restore confidence in the nation's oldest and 
most important civil rights organization. Neither the executive director nor 
any other official can operate like a lone ranger, secretly committing hundreds 
of thousands of the organization's dollars. Such actions break faith with the 
board, the 675,000 members and the legions who fund the fight for equal rights. 
</P>
<P>
 On matters of race and equality, the National Assn. for the Advancement of 
Colored People has provided the moral conscience for this nation since its 
founding by fair-minded whites and activist blacks in 1909. Though its 
accomplishments are legend, the NAACP's work is not done. It must not be 
destroyed, and its reputation must not be put in jeopardy. If the board decides 
that Chavis must go, few will be surprised; and the decision would not be 
wrong.

TRACY GRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Aug. 6 article regarding Tracy Grimes, the disabled woman who was forced 
to leave the couple that cared for her to go to a board-and-care home, moved me 
almost to tears. That officials from the Department of Social Services would 
take a woman from those who love her and place her where her only entertainment 
is television is an outrage.How can a government treat kind, loving people like 
this and expect its citizens to retain any sense of trust in it? 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes would like to live with those who love her. She would like a room of 
her own. She would like to be near the children of the neighborhood. If Grimes 
does become homeless on Sept. 7, it will be a travesty of everything the people 
of this nation believe in. I pray that she and the ACLU win their case and end 
this great injustice.

 During my years as a bureau chief in our state's Medi-Cal program, my staff 
and I learned the need for humanity and common sense -- and using 
administrative exceptions to provide needed care. In this case, rigid adherence 
to bureaucratic rules triumphed over the care needed for Grimes.

 Who is the bureaucratic idiot who ordered Grimes removed from a home where she 
was well cared for, happy and loved? Grimes should sue the state right up to 
Gov. Wilson for this outrage. Whether the (Gabrielle and Frederick) Hanna home 
is licensed by the Department of Social Services or not, Grimes should have the 
right to live where she chooses. Home isn't where you can afford to live or 
where the state decides you should live. Home is where the heart is. Good luck, 
Tracy.

GABLER ON BASEBALL STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "The Owners: Baseball's Newest Heroes," Opinion, Aug. 7: 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations to Neal Gabler for a clever piece of writing. He 
psychoanalyzes the 45% of the public (the bad guys) who believe the players to 
be responsible for the strike, and says nothing about the 28% of the public 
(the good guys) who hold the owners responsible or the remaining 27% of the 
public (me) who don't give a hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabler's psychoanalysis of the 45% is a not-so-veiled attempt to expose his 
liberal views -- the reason the majority has sided with the owners is due to 
Reaganomics and the redistribution of wealth (plenty of which has gone to 
professional athletes, we might add) and the fact that the 45% has denounced 
the working people, be they baseball players, air traffic controllers or 
Teamsters. He lists a couple of other things but it points to the same -- the 
wealthy have tricked us all. 
</P>
<P>
 As a liberal, Mr. Gabler, you get an A-plus but as a psychologist you get an 
F-minus; the public doesn't need psychoanalysis. This baseball issue is about 
$-$-$ and more $ and we all know it. Whoever prevails, the fans -- primarily us 
working folk -- will take it right in the wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 H. F. HENSON 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gabler's analysis is eloquent and completely true, but applies poorly to 
baseball. The worship of the businessman cult that has overtaken our national 
psyche has allowed the wealthy to reap profits at the expense of labor, 
subsidized by tax revenues (to which they assiduously avoid contributing). 
However, I seriously doubt that a player making an additional mil next year 
will help to right these social wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball players are entitled to earn a large percentage of the revenue they 
generate, since they are entertainers with very unique skills, and role models 
to kids. They have achieved fantastic wealth for their efforts. In the grand 
scheme of our society's values, however, should these youngsters with no 
education earn 100 times what we pay educated professionals, who dedicate their 
lives to helping others? I don't think the public begrudges the athlete his 
salary. I simply think they are saying "enough is enough." 
</P>
<P>
 A salary cap is a good idea. It will not rob players of their humongous 
salaries. It will simply tend to keep baseball competitive and prevent ticket 
prices from rising out of reach of the ordinary fan, as they have in football 
and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not a great fan of baseball owners, who are also earning huge salaries 
for dubious contributions to society. But a strike is unjustified.  
</P>
<P>
 ERIC LEVER 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gabler missed one obvious answer to the impasse. If the players accept a cap 
on their contracts, why not demand that the owners accept a cap on their 
profits?

HEALTH CARE FOR IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a physician at the Edward Roybal Health Center in East Los Angeles, I'm 
worried about Proposition 187 because it poses a serious threat to the health 
and safety of my patients: mostly very poor, elderly immigrants from Mexico who 
suffer a variety of chronic illnesses. Simply stated, Proposition 187 puts 
their lives on the line, because without the care that we provide at Roybal 
(and other publicly supported facilities) there will be nowhere else for 
patients such as mine to go. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I'm going all-out to help defeat this evil initiative which aims to 
sacrifice my patients, purportedly in exchange for saving taxpayers maybe a few 
precious pieces of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Should any of my patients die as a consequence of 187's passage, voters will 
be unable to escape the shame and the blame -- for they are being forewarned.  
</P>
<P>
 For me, there's even more to the initiative than the struggle to save my 
patients -- as if that shouldn't suffice. Personal integrity and honor are at 
stake too. It has to do with Proposition 187's provisions that health workers 
have to participate in checking on the immigrant status of patients. It's not a 
matter of merely standing by and watching my patients' health deteriorate. I'm 
also to be both inquisitioner and executioner. 
</P>
<P>
 No way that's going to happen! Bad enough memories from a childhood in World 
War II -- of watching helplessly as a friend of Japanese descent was carried 
away to a concentration camp. This time around "I will refuse to participate in 
any mechanism designed to determine the immigration status of our patients" -- 
the pledge that I and some of my co-workers already have signed. Those of us 
traditionally engaged in life-rendering missions are not about to become agents 
of harm against the very people we serve. 
</P>
<P>
 I can only speak for myself and don't know which way the vote will go on this 
hateful initiative, but I do remember the following lesson, from the history of 
World War II, that offers some hope. Adolf Hitler had just conquered Denmark 
and had ordered all Jews to wear the star of David on their clothes to set them 
apart from other Danes. Sensing what was at stake, the king of Denmark appeared 
in public wearing the star of David. Soon everyone was following his example. 
Thus were Danish Jews saved from the inferno that Hitler had prepared for them.

MIXED COUPLES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Mixed Couples: What Are the Issues You Have to Deal With?" Voices, Aug. 8: 
</P>
<P>
 I am a Heinz-57 American of Irish/Scandinavian/French descent and my husband 
is African American. We have raised six children.The issues that have arisen 
during our 20-plus years are far outweighed by questions we have been asked 
like: "What's it like being married to a black man?" "Do these children belong 
to both of you?" "Did you meet your husband in the U.S.?" etc. I often tell 
people that love sees no color. I did not go out searching for someone black to 
marry. I fell in love with a beautiful, wonderful and caring person with whom I 
have shared many things -- from the birth of a child to the tragic death of a 
child. This man is our tower of strength, source of wisdom and always gives us 
his unconditional love. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll tell you what it's like being married to a black man. It's heartbreaking 
when we go into a restaurant and the waiter refuses to look at my husband but 
asks me instead what we want to eat. It hurts when we're standing in line at 
the grocery store and the checker smiles and speaks to everyone except my 
husband. It was agonizing when my 17-year-old son asked us to sell his 1994 
truck because he was sick of being stopped by the police and asked, "Where did 
you get this car, boy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Interracial marriages can be wonderful as well as heartbreaking. Let me offer 
this word to your readers. When you see someone who looks different than you, 
please try to do as Martin Luther King Jr. advised -- judge him by the content 
of his character instead of the color of hisskin.

COLUMN RIGHT/ JONATHAN CLARKE: CIA 'REFORMS' WILL EVISCERATE ITS USEFULNESS; 
ALDRICH AMES WILL HAVE HIS SWEETEST REVENGE IF SPYING IS MADE BUREAUCRATICALLY 
CORRECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN CLARKE, Jonathan Clarke, a member of the British diplomatic service 
for 20 years, is now at the Cato Institute in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The CIA is on course to become the world's most politically correct 
intelligence agency -- and at the same time its most ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, Walter Lippman wrote that a generation of American leaders 
had "overlearned the lessons of Munich." Judging by reform proposals unveiled 
by CIA Director R. James Woolsey last month, a new generation is about to 
overlearn the lessons of the Aldrich Ames treason case. For this feat, Ames may 
permit himself a sardonic smirk of self-congratulation even as he contemplates 
lifetime incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 Espionage is a strange business that attracts some rum customers. "My job is 
to live in the sewer," former CIA Director Robert M. Gates was fond of saying 
to impressionable guests.  
</P>
<P>
 Few of us would feel comfortable cozying up to North Korean or Libyan 
cutthroats or plunging into the company of arms merchants or drugs traffickers 
to seek out a malcontent willing to spill his grubby secrets in exchange for 
envelopes filled with used dollar bills. Yet these are typical tasks facing CIA 
field operatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the passion for bureaucratic process threatens to crowd out 
operational mission; promotion policy will reward business school skills over 
agent recruitment; ever more intrusive counterintelligence personnel scrutiny 
will eviscerate CIA cohesiveness. These reforms may produce a squeaky clean 
CIA, but don't count on it to ferret out the secrets of the nation's enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Operational vitality represents an intelligence service's life and soul. As 
far as the CIA's Directorate of Operations is concerned, this means the ability 
to recruit new agents against hard targets like Iran or plutonium smugglers. 
This is a very rare skill. Most foreign intelligence agencies recognize this by 
fixing agent recruitment ability as the primary criterion of an officer's 
promotability. 
</P>
<P>
 The Joint Security Commission which investigated the Ames case is moving in 
the opposite direction by recommending that "management accountability and high 
ethical standards" must henceforward be the main determinant of a CIA officer's 
career progress. No one would gainsay the importance of these two measures, but 
a goody-two-shoes who cannot recruit agents is worse than useless as an 
intelligence officer. It's much easier to avoid risk by staying in the office 
and practicing textbook management skills among CIA colleagues. If this now 
becomes the way to get ahead in CIA, it will be at the cost of more difficult, 
riskier tasks like penetrating Saddam Hussein's entourage or busting the Cali 
cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hand in hand with operational vigor, an intelligence service needs a strong 
sense of corporate identity, a unifying culture, to compensate for the 
decidedly offbeat nature of intelligence work, where success goes unheralded 
but failure can be punished by humiliating public ridicule. Here again, the 
Joint Security Commission misses the mark, accusing CIA of acting like an elite 
fraternity and advocating the introduction of privacy-invading personal 
disclosure requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scandal of the Ames proportion, this is an understandable 
recommendation, but its long-term application will need to be carefully 
handled. If applied with a heavy hand, there is nothing more corrosive of 
morale than constant, insensitive snooping that leads officers to feel that 
they are not trusted. Once uncorked, the genies of counterintelligence -- in 
the manner of the devils of political correctness -- will squirm their way into 
every corner of CIA life. The free spirits on whom any intelligence agency, the 
CIA included, depends for operational success will resist by quitting in 
droves. This will produce a duller, more lead-footed organization, ill-equipped 
to take on today's agile enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would argue that the CIA should be above the law, allowed to cut 
ethical corners, or divided into back-scratching male cliques. Of course it 
should not. There are also some legitimate questions about whether the CIA 
needs to continue in business. Certainly, thoroughgoing reform is necessary. 
But if shortcomings in satellite or telecommunications-derived intelligence 
mean that we still need human intelligence, then it is against the national 
interest to allow the Ames case to force changes on the CIA that will 
irretrievably hamstring its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's climate in Washington, where the instinct for the bureaucratic 
jugular is so well developed, the momentum behind these reforms may already be 
irresistible. If so, the reformers need to be aware that, in depriving the CIA 
of its ability to function as a creative, albeit unconventional agency, they 
are handing Ames his sweetest revenge.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE CRIME BILL; TERRIBLE WEAPONS, TERRIBLE VOTES; HOW CAN 
CONGRESS, COMPOSED OF GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE, POSSIBLY BE OPPOSED TO A BAN ON 
ASSAULT WEAPONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMOND LEE BROWNING, The Very Rev. Edmond Lee Browning is presiding bishop 
and primate of the 2.4-million member Episcopal Church in the United States.; 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States, I have 
visited congressional offices numerous times. Each time I have entered the 
impressive halls of the member's offices, I have, like everyone, been compelled 
to submit to a metal detector check to be sure I was not carrying any kind of 
weapon. This is a sensible practice, given the violence of so much of our 
society today, and I'm sure is appreciated by the members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is why I find it incredible that so many of these same members in the 
House voted down the omnibus crime bill because they opposed the ban on assault 
weapons. They surely know what it means to be the potential target of 
gun-crazed people. Why, then, did they vote against the ban of these terrible 
weapons, knowing that the good people who live in our nation's inner-cities do 
not have metal detectors to protect themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 I ask this question very seriously. I have been deeply impressed by the 
dedication of our congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle. They are 
good people, decent and competent. Thus, it is all the more so that I cannot 
believe that any member of Congress could oppose a ban on assault weapons. Why 
would we want any private citizen to carry such weapons? Of what possible use 
are they to a civilized society? 
</P>
<P>
 This is a deeply moral issue; it is about protecting, rather than destroying, 
the dignity of human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, people whom I respect and admire and whose company I have enjoyed, 
blocked the crime bill precisely because of this provision. 
</P>
<P>
 One member who voted this way told me last year that he has to listen to what 
people say in his district, and if I want him to support the concerns of the 
Episcopal Church, he'd better hear from some constituents who agree with me. It 
wasn't a brush-off. In fact, he wanted very much to hear from these people 
because his true sympathies lie with them. But he also must count votes. And, 
in this case, the vote count back home told him to vote against the ban, even 
though I am certain he would gladly see these weapons go. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not good enough. When a once-respectable organization like the 
National Rifle Assn. becomes a tool of the weapon makers and turns into the 
enemy of reasonableness and threatens the health of our inner-cities in order 
to turn profits, I expect the good people in the House and Senate to show them 
the door and take their purses with them. 
</P>
<P>
 If we need any more evidence for the necessity of campaign finance reform 
against special interests, we only need to look at the insanity of the vote 
against the ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say that I am an unparalleled champion of the crime bill. It is 
so complex and embraces so much that no one can like every part of it. If I had 
to cast my ballot, I would be hard-pressed to vote yes because of all the new 
death-penalty provisions. I have never felt it was in the best interests of our 
society to practice the very thing we so abhor, the taking of human life. If 
the crime bill fails because some members share my views on the death penalty 
and vote against it, I respect that. But if it fails because of opposition to 
the ban on assault weapons, then I weep for the soul of our nation. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton invited me to have breakfast with him earlier this month to 
engage in a discussion on civility and the role of religion in the public 
arena. Civility is a word beyond politeness; it is an expression that helps us 
define who we are as a nation and people. And in a civil society, there is 
clearly no place for these dreadful weapons that destroy lives and the youth of 
our land. The President is certainly agreed on this point. 
</P>
<P>
 He, too, is a very able man, big of heart and working flat-out to improve the 
quality of life in our country. I hope he doesn't back down in refusing to 
delete the assault weapons ban from the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 And I hope enough members of Congress can break the strength of the gun lobby 
and vote for peace in our most troubled communities. Hang in there, Mr. 
President! I salute you and all those good people in the Congress who know 
better, and, hopefully, will do better the next time around.

WHAT MEXICO NEEDS IS A SHARED VISION; POLITICS: GHOSTS OF THE PAST PREY ON 
VOTERS' FEARS, BUT THE HYPOTHESES ARE WRONG -- THE ROAD TO DEMOCRACY IS OPEN 
AND CLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SERGIO MUNOZ, Sergio Munoz is the editor of Nuestro Tiempo, The Times' 
weekly supplement in Spanish. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of the most competitive elections in Mexican history, voices from 
the past are playing up voters' fears, insinuating that their ballots will 
decide whether the country falls into chaos or transitions into democracy. That 
is not just simplistic; it is plain wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico has made tremendous gains toward democracy over the past decade. What 
the country needs now is to arrive at a common ground and define the rules for 
coexistence after the election, regardless of the outcome. The unexpected 
competitiveness of this election and the perception that, for the first time, 
nobody knows which of the three main candidates will win the presidency has 
actually raised hopes that, finally, Mexico is on the verge of becoming a 
full-fledged democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three presidential hopefuls, the most demonized is Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. 
Opponents warn that a victory by the Revolutionary Democratic Party candidate 
would cause massive capital flight, a severe decrease in foreign investment, a 
depletion of dollar reserves and devaluation of the peso, all resulting in the 
ungovernability of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Ernesto Zedillo, candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party 
(PRI), the opposition argues that no one believes the party can win without 
cheating, so a PRI victory would provoke intense, unmanageable civil 
disturbances and more armed rebellions in other states besides Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Action Party's candidate, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, is 
handicapped, it is said, by lacking the resources, members and experienced 
public servants to govern effectively. Most important, he would lack the 
backing of the state political apparatus that, intertwined with the PRI, has 
governed the country for decades and will remain in place regardless of who 
wins the presidential election this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these hypotheses, founded in fear, are exaggerated and, therefore, 
inaccurate. The crisis Mexico has faced since the beginning of the year is not 
the first one in its convulsed history. Nor are the Zapatistas in Chiapas and 
their leader, Subcommander Marcos, a unique phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1950s and '60s saw the precursors of Marcos, insurgents -- now largely 
forgotten outside folklore -- such as Ruben Jaramillo, Lucio Cabanas, Genaro 
Vazquez, Carmelo Cortes, and David Sarmiento. One-time peasant leaders, rural 
teachers or university students, all became guerrillas because of the prevalent 
injustice in society. All were either killed in combat or ambushed by 
government troops on presidents' orders. 
</P>
<P>
 A big difference of the Chiapas guerrilleros, of course, is their taking 
advantage of the global information age, speaking to the world via CNN from 
hidden corners of the jungle. But they are also fortunate that they had, in 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a receptive interlocutor who chose to 
engage in dialogue rather than relying on repression. 
</P>
<P>
 While this election year has seen some notorious political kidnapings, this is 
not a new phenomenon either. Among the most famous victims of the recent past: 
Julio Hirshfeld Almada, secretary of tourism under President Luis Echeverria in 
the 1970s, and Jose Guadalupe Zuno, that same president's father-in-law; U.S. 
Consul Terrence G. Leonhardy, kidnaped and released in 1973; Hugo Margain Jr., 
son of the Mexican ambassador to the United States, who was kidnaped and 
murdered in 1978. The kidnapings of business leaders Alfredo Harp Helu and 
Angel Losada earlier this year struck a nerve because they coincided with the 
Chiapas uprising and the murder of former PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. 
</P>
<P>
 But although Mexico will remain largely the same no matter who wins next 
Sunday, the country is shedding its old skin in one important respect. 
Traditional institutions such as the Catholic Church, the political parties, 
the mass media, labor unions and armed forces are not evolving as quickly as 
civil society has in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Grass-roots organizations founded in Mexico City after the 1985 earthquake 
have become activists devoted to protecting the environment and social 
renovation. The vast majority of these groups crystallized their rejection of 
the old PRI regime during the 1988 election. 
</P>
<P>
 So the impulse for a new and more democratic Mexico is well-established, and 
it comes from the bottom up. What is needed now, whoever wins the presidency, 
is for political leaders at the top to arrive at a shared vision of the country 
that can encompass the grass-roots progress of the past decade. Without a 
common vision of the future and a new sense of trust, there can be no true 
peace nor governability.

COLUMN LEFT/ ROBERT SCHEER: YOU THOUGHT THE COLD WAR WAS DEAD?; WE'RE BUSY 
DEALING WITH CHINA, VIETNAM, EVEN NORTH KOREA, BUT CUBA? NEVER! WHY IS THAT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer is a former Times national correspondent.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fidel Castro should start futzing around with the rods in his nuclear power 
plant at Cienfuegos, or hint that he's bought some of the plutonium that's 
being smuggled out of Russia. Anything to make it look like he's building a 
bomb. That way the Clinton Administration, following the example of its policy 
toward North Korea, would feel required to lift the economic embargo that has 
strangled Cuba for 33 years. Nothing else seems to work to get this 
Administration to re-evaluate a policy of isolating Cuba that made little sense 
when the Cold War was on and is simply bizarre in its aftermath.  
</P>
<P>
 How in the world can the Clinton Administration justify diplomatic recognition 
and trade with the communist nations of China, Vietnam and now North Korea 
while maintaining the trade embargo with Cuba because it's a communist country? 
Is it that the Asian reds are no longer reds, or that they have a better 
human-rights record, or pose less of a potential military threat? 
</P>
<P>
 To argue any of that would be absurd. North Korea is suddenly presented with 
diplomatic exchange, trade and billions in nuclear technology without even 
being requested to make the slightest alterations in what remains one of the 
world's most tightly repressive and bellicose regimes.  
</P>
<P>
 The opening to China, and more recently to Vietnam, was justified by reference 
to those countries being open to foreign investment. The U.S. embargo makes 
such investments on the part of American corporations, and their foreign 
subsidiaries, in Cuba illegal. Despite severe U.S. pressure, 112 joint ventures 
worth $500 million were put into place in the past three years by British, 
Italian, French and Spanish companies. U.S. Cuba policy is irrational, yet 
rarely is Clinton challenged by reporters on the obvious contradiction of 
continuing the Cold War against Cuba. We blockaded Cuba three decades ago 
because that small island was judged an outpost of Soviet power. Has Clinton 
not noticed that the Soviet Union no longer exists?  
</P>
<P>
 The sad truth is that Cubans are being denied the benefits of trade afforded 
the Chinese and Vietnamese because of a hard-line emigre claque in Miami. There 
is ample evidence that they no longer speak for many Cubans eager to aid 
relatives on the island, but they are still terrific at intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 One who is clearly intimidated is Bill Clinton. In the 1992 election, he 
supported the tightening of the trade embargo which George Bush, like Ronald 
Reagan previously, had opposed. Thanks to Clinton and the Democratic Congress, 
the embargo was tightened in brazen denial of the changed world reality. This 
action was condemned by an 88-4 vote in the United Nations. It was a stupidly 
cruel move that hurt ordinary Cubans while saving Castro the challenges of a 
more open society.  
</P>
<P>
 As Roger Fontaine, former national security aide in the Reagan Administration, 
wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1992 law is a policy of impoverishing Cubans at the behest of the most 
militant conservative groups in the emigre community. It is polarizing Cuba -- 
driving many anti-Castro Cubans back into Mr. Castro's camp . . . and enhancing 
his reputation as a fearless fighter of Yankee capitalism." 
</P>
<P>
 But let's say the policy works and we succeed in ratcheting up the misery of 
ordinary Cubans already suffering from the abrupt withdrawal of Soviet 
subsidies. Is upheaval and disarray in Cuba really in our national interest? 
Have we no memory of the Mariel boat lift? Are we really prepared to take in 
millions of more Cuban refugees when we currently imprison Haitian refugees at 
our Cuban base in Guantanamo? 
</P>
<P>
 We continue to view Castro as nothing more than an outlaw while blindly 
ignoring our nation's past crimes in his region, including numerous documented 
efforts to sabotage the Cuban economy and to assassinate Fidel. 
</P>
<P>
 His rule has been complex, filled with major achievements as in education and 
health and profound failure in civil liberty. There is no need to whitewash 
Castro any more than to continue demonizing him. But surely, if we can get 
along with the very people whom we fought in Vietnam and Korea, we can heal the 
wounds left over from the minor skirmish of the Bay of Pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton fails this test of leadership and allows the situation to 
deteriorate, the cost in the suffering attendant to internecine warfare in Cuba 
will make the upheaval of the Mariel boat lift, and the more recent Haitian 
exodus, seem like a Caribbean cruise.

MOVIE REVIEW; A 'NIGHT' OF MYSTERY, MURDER AND PASSION; THE THRILLER STARRING 
BRUCE WILLIS AND JANE MARCH IS OVERLOADED WITH TWISTS BOTH PREPOSTEROUS AND 
OBVIOUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is sad, truly sad, to have to report that "Color of Night" is a 
disappointment in almost every respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Rush, its director, is not only warmly remembered for having made "The 
Stunt Man," one of the most original American films of the past 20 years, but 
that 1980 success was followed by the kind of miserable luck that never seems 
to afflict the untalented. 
</P>
<P>
 For a variety of reasons, Rush has not had a film to call his own from that 
time to this. And while he was embroiled with "Night's" producer over final cut 
of this film, the director had to be hospitalized with a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Night's" star, Bruce Willis, has certainly proved his ability to please 
audiences when he's right for a project. But though Willis is in earnest about 
his role here, the idea of using him as a troubled and introspective New York 
psychiatrist is in its own way as dubious a piece of casting as was having Al 
Pacino play a sophisticated international Grand Prix driver in "Bobby 
Deerfield." 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true for Jane March, hardly a veteran actress but one who 
displayed an effective erotic presence in "The Lover." Her role as the 
mysterious romantic temptress in "Night" is so convoluted as to be just about 
unplayable, and it is no fun to see March drown in a storm not of her own 
making. 
</P>
<P>
 As for writers Matthew Chapman (credited with such previous illogical features 
as "Strangers Kiss" and "Consenting Adults") and Billy Ray, they have turned 
out a tepid pastiche that refers to so many Hitchcock films it's easy to lose 
count. Perhaps they should put their VCRs in the closet for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of the collaboration between all these parties is an unconvincing 
movie that is simultaneously predictable and far-fetched, not a fortunate 
combination. Very little makes any kind of sense here, and very few people will 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Willis plays Dr. Bill Capa, a Manhattan psychoanalyst, one of whose patients 
opts out of therapy in a rather violent and disturbing way. Though he knows you 
can't hide from your troubles, Dr. Bill decides to take a break and visit an 
old college pal and fellow mental-help professional Bob Moore (Scott Bakula) 
out in sunny Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The city may be sunny, but the therapy group Moore runs, which Dr. Bill sits 
in on, is not. Included among its members are an oversexed divorcee, a spoiled, 
rich-kid artist, an obsessive compulsive lawyer, a sexually confused teen-ager 
and a surly man wracked with unspecific guilt. It has a kind of over-the-top 
giddiness usually associated with skits on "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Moore gets murdered, and a quirky police investigator (Ruben Blades) 
thinks someone in the group did it, both the sessions and the movie attempt to 
get more serious. Because of his way with phrases such as "Is there anything 
else you'd like to tell us?," Dr. Bill is asked to take over the group, and 
when he's not helping those fragile egos he's trying to solve his friend's 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 As if there wasn't enough on his plate, Dr. Bill quite literally has a run-in 
with the mysterious Rose (Jane March) when her car clumsily bangs into his. 
Fascinated by her perky charm and the way she has of running out the door 
without leaving so much as a phone number after exhausting bouts of torrid sex, 
Dr. Bill wonders if this could be love. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Rush's trademark bemusement -- his fascination with what is reality and 
what isn't -- should in theory add another level to a conventional thriller, in 
practice its presence turns out to be a distraction, diluting what impact the 
film's menace can manage. 
</P>
<P>
 More troublesome is that darned script, which gets increasingly overloaded 
with twists both preposterous and obvious. By the time the solution dawns on 
Dr. Bill and the light of understanding bathes his face, everyone else in the 
theater (if there is anyone else in the theater) will have already figured it 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R for "strong sexuality, violence and language." Times 
guidelines: It includes a graphic murder and suicide and scenes of fairly 
explicit lovemaking.  
</P>

 Monty Python Salute: The Directors Guild Theatre in West Hollywood will salute 
British comedy team Monty Python's 25th anniversary with "Monty Python: Lust 
for Glory!," a five-day television and film festival beginning Sept. 9. 
Organized by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the American 
Cinematheque, the program includes salutes to both the collective and 
individual work of the six Python members -- Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry 
Gilliam, Eric Idle, Michael Palin and Terry Jones. Highlights include "Life of 
Graham," an opening night tribute to Chapman; rarely seen animated shorts by 
Gilliam; two full-length TV specials never broadcast in America; and a 12-hour 
marathon of 24 episodes of the "Flying Circus" TV series. Several Python 
members are scheduled to attend the festival.

 Taylor vs. NBC: Elizabeth Taylor is putting up a fight against an upcoming TV 
miniseries that will claim she was beaten by three of her seven husbands. The 
actress has sued NBC for $10 million to block the broadcast of the miniseries 
based on an unreleased book by C. David Heymann. Also named in the L.A. 
Superior Court complaint are producer Lester Persky, screenwriter Gerald Ayres, 
author Heymann and his publisher, the Carol Publishing Group. Taylor's lawsuit 
contends the miniseries would be an inaccurate invasion of Taylor's privacy and 
would hurt her financially.

 'Extra' Shake-Up: Less than three weeks before its Sept. 5 premiere on KNBC-TV 
Channel 4, Warner Bros. new "Entertainment Tonight"-style magazine show "Extra" 
has already had a shake-up of its on-air talent. Ben Patrick Johnson, a former 
disc jockey and commercial model, has been bumped from his post as co-host, and 
instead will serve as a senior correspondent, conducting celebrity interviews. 
Moving onto the anchor desk with co-host Arthel Neville is broadcaster Dave 
Nemeth, whose most recent post was as movie critic at Detroit's WXYZ-TV. Warner 
Bros. said the move follows a $2-million, four-week trial run, which showed "an 
excellent chemistry between Arthel and Dave." POP/ROCK

 Upcoming Releases: Rock star and environmental activist Sting will be joined 
by U2, Paul McCartney, Elton John, Paul Simon, Genesis and other as-yet-unnamed 
acts on an upcoming album to benefit the Rainforest Alliance and other 
environmental groups. Called "Earthrise," the Pyramid Records release is due in 
late September or early October. . . . Among other unusual upcoming releases: 
Raffi returns to his roots Sept. 13 with "Bananaphone," his first album release 
in seven years of studio music for young children; rappers Tag Team, 
Salt-N-Pepa and Hammer, pop group Color Me Badd and actress-singer Whoopi 
Goldberg will be joined by Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse and other Disney 
characters in "Mickey Unrapped," a Sept. 1 Belmark/Life Records release aimed 
at building a more positive image for the rap music genre; and for those who 
hung on to their old turntables, Capitol Records will release 5,000 vinyl 
copies of each of the first 17 albums by California's Beach Boys -- including 
"Little Deuce Coupe," "Surfin' U.S.A." and "Surfin' Safari" -- on Sept. 12.

 Brown's Deja Vu: Singer Bobby Brown is facing foreclosure on his 
14,000-square-foot Atlanta mansion for the second time in about a year. 
According to a legal notice advertising a Sept. 6 public auction of the home, 
Brown, who is married to pop superstar Whitney Houston, is in arrears on an 
$850,000 mortgage he took out to halt foreclosure last summer. The notice also 
cites a second mortgage for $950,000, and two Internal Revenue Service tax 
liens against the property totaling more than $1.3 million. ART

 Museum Expansion: San Diego's Mingei International Museum of World Folk Art is 
gearing up for a major expansion that will relocate the museum to a new 
41,000-square-foot space in Balboa Park by the end of 1996. The previously 
low-profile museum will leave its 6,000-square-foot gallery at La Jolla's 
University Towne Center to become the major tenant of a $6-million, city-funded 
project on the site formerly occupied by the House of Charm, which was built 
for the 1915 Pan-American Exposition. The historic building's exterior will be 
reconstructed according to the original design, and two lower levels will be 
added. The Mingei's plans call for permanent and changing exhibition space, 
education facilities, an auditorium and an audio/visual folk art reference 
library. The building's basement will be occupied by the San Diego Art 
Institute and the Globe Theatre, which will create new rehearsal space. QUICK

 Beleaguered pop star Michael Jackson apparently hasn't lost any fan support in 
Europe, where he has been voted his fifth Golden Otto Award for music by 
readers of the popular entertainment publication Bravo magazine. Jackson won 
previous Ottos in 1987-89 and 1992. . . . The L.A. City Council has formally 
approved a partnership program in which local arts groups will help run several 
struggling city arts centers, including the L.A. Photography Center and North 
Hollywood's Lankershim Arts Center. SHAUNA SNOW

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CHARLES KEEPS ON SWAYING WITH EMOTION-PACKED SONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Time unrelentingly, unforgivingly marches on, taking Ray Charles along with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 A performance by Charles, now 63, can be viewed similarly to one by Frank 
Sinatra: Here's a certified singing giant, one who has touched the hearts of 
millions, who no longer works with the zeal and power of his early, or even 
middle-career, classic recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hollywood Bowl on Wednesday, Charles revealed that though his falsetto 
wailing cries have lost some of their spine-straightening bite, and his 
guttural groans don't always raise the hair on the back of your neck, he still 
can deliver -- and how. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles offered his share of tunes with a medium tempo, such as "The Good 
Life" and "Let's Get Away From It All," and even a couple of blues. Still, slow 
and sensuous songs have long been the artist's strong suit, and at the Bowl -- 
wrapped in the lush support of a 40-piece orchestra smartly conducted by Victor 
Vanacore -- Charles made those ballads bristle with emotion and feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 The dirge-like "If You Go Away," sung as Charles, at the keyboard, rocked 
gently to one side, then the other, was done so matter-of-factly, and without 
fanfare, one felt the artist might stay in the lyrics' melancholy mood forever. 
Also direct and taken at a crawl were "It's Not Easy Bein' Green," Joe Rapozo's 
song about being comfortable with who you are, in which Charles climaxed with 
charged, open-throated tones, and Leon Russell's "A Song for You," in which the 
singer savored the words, making it seem as if he had written this romantic 
ballad. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a highlight among all these passionate numbers, it had to be 
"America the Beautiful." Charles' piano accompaniment rumbled softly under his 
words and he sang with vehemence, making yet another case for this song, as 
sung by this artist, to be the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 Etta James opened the show with her trademark blues-pop-funk, and playing to a 
huge house -- the Bowl packed in 17,979 -- drew away from the intimacy that a 
medium-size club affords her.

CLINTON AGREES TO DEEP CUTS IN CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unable to get the votes he needs from Democrats opposed to an assault-weapons 
ban, President Clinton agreed Thursday to make major spending cuts in his 
anti-crime initiative to win more Republican support for the threatened 
measure, White House and congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 After another day of intensive but largely fruitless efforts to win over a 
handful of elusive votes, Clinton summoned Democratic House and Senate leaders 
to the White House for a crisis session on the crime bill. The legislation has 
been stalled in the House for the last week because of opposition from 
Republicans and conservative Democrats opposed to its ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional sources said after the meeting that, given a choice between 
making the steep cuts Republicans favor in the bill's crime prevention programs 
or siding with approximately 40 conservative Democrats by dropping the 
assault-weapons ban, Clinton opted for more cuts beyond the $1 billion he had 
been offering to shave from the $33-billion bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sources cautioned that no deal had been cut, they said that House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and other Democratic House leaders are 
working on a proposal that would strip more than $3 billion from the bill and 
make other concessions -- but leave the assault-weapons ban intact. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate comment from House GOP leaders, who earlier in the day 
had said they would insist on cuts of at least $5.5 billion -- mostly from the 
$7.4 billion the bill provides for crime prevention programs such as midnight 
basketball leagues and after-school activities for violence-prone youths. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), the leader of a group of 11 moderate 
Republicans who voted with the Administration when opponents used a procedural 
motion to block the crime bill from coming to the House floor last week, 
indicated earlier that more of his GOP colleagues would vote for the bill if 
Clinton would accept cuts "in the $2-billion to $3-billion range." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic sources said those reductions probably would be accomplished by an 
across-the-board cut of 10% in all of the bill's prevention and law enforcement 
provisions for an overall savings of about $3.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said, some of the remaining $6.5 billion in funding for 
crime prevention initiatives likely would be turned into grants that city and 
state governments could use as they see fit -- a concession that would meet 
another Republican demand. 
</P>
<P>
 With measures on crime and health care reaching critical points in Congress, 
the White House announced that Clinton will appear at a press conference at 
10:30 a.m. PDT today to take questions from reporters on those topics and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill proposals were being refined late Thursday night and will be 
"shopped around" to lawmakers Friday in the hope that the measure can be 
brought back to the floor with enough bipartisan support to pass it by Sunday 
or Monday, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a source close to the negotiations cautioned that the proposals still 
are subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, this source said, it is by no means certain that the compromise 
would mean passage of the bill because members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus and other liberal lawmakers have threatened to turn against it if 
Clinton agrees to cuts of more than $350 million in crime prevention programs. 
Democratic leaders have been offering cuts in that range to Republicans for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not clear that we can pick up enough Republicans to compensate for the 
liberals we lose, and if we can't, then it will be back to the drawing boards," 
said another senior Democratic source, who, like everyone else associated with 
the delicate negotiations, would not speak on the record. 
</P>
<P>
 The likelihood of a liberal stampede away from the bill was confirmed earlier 
in the day by Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), who 
said that the 33 caucus members who have thus far agreed to support the bill 
would begin to "drop off" if the crime prevention programs they favor are cut 
by more than $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those members, Reps. Craig Washington (D-Tex.) and Louis Stokes 
(D-Ohio), only reluctantly agreed to support the package Thursday, bringing the 
Administration to within three votes of the 218 it needs to win the procedural 
motion that opponents had been using to block the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither lawmaker, who had opposed the bill because of its expanded death 
penalties, have officially announced their support yet, and a Democratic 
leadership aide said he fears that they may refuse now that the package is 
being changed to make it more acceptable to Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing is such a delicate balancing act that, if you do one thing to get 
this group of lawmakers, you almost automatically lose that group of lawmakers. 
Everything about this bill seems to be governed by the physical laws of equal 
and opposite reactions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the mood at the White House after the emergency strategy session 
was decidedly more upbeat than it had been just a few hours earlier, when 
frustrated Democrats were talking for the first time about the possibility that 
the crime bill would not pass at all this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to come up with a bill that meets the President's 
objectives, and I think it's going to pass," White House adviser George 
Stephanopoulos said after the meeting between Clinton, Foley, Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be concentrating more on Republicans than Democrats," another senior 
White House source added, referring to the strategy that Clinton and his 
congressional lieutenants decided to use in their last-ditch effort to save the 
bill before the House breaks next week for its already twice-delayed summer 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will still be hard and it's going to be an up-and-down ride until we get 
the votes we need," but for the first time in days the mood at the White House 
is upbeat and Clinton is hopeful that Foley can bring the bill up for a vote on 
final passage by Monday, the source added. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the House completes action on the bill, it will move immediately to the 
Senate, where it is expected to pass without difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 Although funding for things like prison construction and additional police 
officers on the streets would also be trimmed back by the cuts, the bill would 
retain such provisions as expanded death penalties for federal offenses, 
legislation to help protect the victims of spousal abuse and the so-called 
"three strikes and you're out" clause mandating sentences of life imprisonment 
for three-time convicted felons.

 FOR THE BOYS: Northridge can make history again this year. Its Little League 
team plays tonight in the Western Regional finals -- one win and it goes to the 
World Series. . . . Northridge, which sent teams to Williamsport in 1967 and 
1975, could become the first league from the region to do it three times. "I 
still have the home plate and three bases from our 1975 team," says former 
coach Barry Breen (C8).

 USHERED AWAY: While wealthy ballplayers strike against wealthy owners, others 
suffer. Take Howard Levine of Sherman Oaks. As a result of the strike (C1), 
Levine, an usher at Dodger Stadium for 23 years, is missing about $50 a game. . 
. . "I need the money, especially at the end of the summer when I don't get my 
teacher's checks," says Levine, who also coaches basketball at Grant High in 
Van Nuys.

Deborah Cooper (above), an Encino relationship therapist who gives good sound 
bites on talk shows (Valley Life! Page 9). . . . But telling others how to 
conduct their sex lives can be a dangerous business. She was almost beaten up

 HIT OR MISS: The Palomino in North Hollywood, on a mission to recapture its 
glory years, has brought back Talent Night. Amateurs try to collect some bucks, 
and maybe get discovered. . . . But don't always expect talent. "Sometimes it's 
rough," says bandleader Jeff Ross, who backs up the performers. "You just have 
to bear through it." See Valley Life! Page 3.

 CHECKBOOKS VANISH: If you have the feeling you don't know where your money is 
going these days, you might be right. Postal officials believe a ring of 
thieves in the West Valley is hijacking boxes of blank checks and then cashing 
them (B1). . . . Wells Fargo, alone, has already lost tens of thousands of 
dollars due to the scheme. Michael Arkush

 THE DEUCE, YOU SAY! The local chapter of Mothers Against Drunk Driving is 
awarding a new honor, called the Deuce Award. A plaque goes to any police 
officer who makes at least 25 drunk-driving arrests in a year's time. . . . La

 FOUR-BIT PROMO: Those selling lots at Coto de Caza want you to feel like it's 
far removed from the urban sprawl of the rest of Orange County -- but not too 
far removed. Their latest promotion: "Fifty Cents from the Rest of the World." 
Stop in the visitors information center and they'll give you two shiny quarters 
to pay the toll on the new Foothill tollway. . . . Says marketing spokesman Tom 
Martin: "The toll road has cut more than 10 minutes off the route from Coto, 
which means residents can make the drive to John Wayne Airport in 20 minutes."

at the Anaheim Hilton & Towers on Sept. 22 will be Ruth Bader Ginsburg. . . . 
"We started this group with the idea of getting more women lawyers on the

 CRUISIN' CUBS: What kind of car is this -- one drives and three people push? 
It's the first annual Cub Scout Pushcart Derby Race on Saturday morning at 
Fullerton College. . . . Some 300 youngsters will compete in their own

David Hall, one of the cub masters organizing it. "It's just going to be a good 
wholesome event for the kids."

National Park are holding a "special toasting" for the archeologists who have

FLORIDA'S PLEA FOR URGENT HELP WITH CUBANS REBUFFED; REFUGEES: THE WHITE HOUSE 
BEGINS A MAJOR REVIEW OF ACTIONS IT COULD TAKE. ADMINISTRATION LATER SAYS 
GOVERNOR'S REQUEST FOR NAVY SHIPS IS BEING CONSIDERED. 
</P>

<P>
 The Cuban refugee issue exploded onto the domestic political scene Thursday as 
the White House rebuffed an urgent plea by Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles to 
declare an emergency and the Administration began a major review to consider 
new options. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles made his appeal in a morning press conference, contending that "there 
is no question that a true emergency exists" and calling on President Clinton 
to send Navy ships and more federal dollars to help cope with the influx. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles' request received a frosty reception initially, first from Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno and later from White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, who said 
bluntly: "We've been able to handle the surge in Cuban migrants in an orderly 
fashion and we'll continue to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, however, leading Administration officials said the White 
House is considering Chiles' request seriously, and Clinton called the Florida 
governor to ask for his suggestions on how to deal with the refugee influx. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, officials of refugee aid groups in Miami expressed 
skepticism about Chiles' assessment. Ken Tota, coordinator of the U.S. Catholic 
Conference's resettlement effort here, said that the influx "looks like a 
manageable situation at this point" and that aid groups "have the capacity to 
expand" if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as the number of Cubans crossing the Florida Straits on 
small boats or rafts continued to increase, raising fears that the influx could 
escalate into a repeat of the 1980 Mariel boat lift, which sent 125,000 Cubans 
to U.S. shores over a five-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials said their vessels picked up 369 Cubans in the straits 
Thursday, after a record-breaking 537 Wednesday. Those figures are up from a 
rate of about 300 refugees a day last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's top national security policy-makers called an emergency meeting to 
review their options, with formal recommendations expected to go to the 
President today or Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the options range from increasing the number of Coast Guard 
vessels assigned to pick up Cubans to possibly sending some of the refugees to 
temporary haven camps in other countries, as has been done with Haitian 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration strategists said a series of new measures to deal with the 
situation could be announced as early as this weekend. Sending refugees to 
third-country havens could prove difficult, however, since Cubans are 
guaranteed entry into the United States under current law. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign that the Administration expects the number of refugees to grow in 
coming days, military authorities were preparing to expand facilities in South 
Florida in accordance with an emergency plan to handle the influx. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plan -- which calls for tent cities to be set up as screening 
centers at Homestead and Key West -- is supposed to take effect only after the 
inflow reaches 1,000 refugees a day, officials said the order to start 
construction already has gone out. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, officials said the Administration is planning to set up 
relocation camps at three dozen sites across the United States to process 
Cubans and send them to other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami's Little Havana neighborhood Thursday evening, refugees by the 
busload arrived from Key West at two separate facilities, where they were put 
in contact with family members and helped with settlement problems. Cuban 
Americans gathered outside one of the centers, curious to see if loved ones 
were among the new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmin Baas, 51, burst into tears of joy when she spotted a nephew and niece 
through the bus windows. "I feel so happy," she said. "At last they are out of 
Cuba and that's the best thing. They could have died there with no food." 
</P>
<P>
 Baas had left Cuba 15 years earlier with her three children and husband and 
had worried ever since about relatives left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Some refugees who arrived were dirty from their treacherous voyage across the 
Florida Straits. The crowd cheered each time a cluster of refugees emerged from 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilberto Blanco, a topographer, arrived on a 23-foot motorboat Thursday 
morning with 20 family members. "We left five houses empty in Havana," he said. 
The last month had been particularly difficult because food was scarce and 
Blanco dropped from a trim 140 to 112 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But food, he said, is not the reason he left. "The most difficult thing in 
Cuba is the way the government obstructs the lives of the people. No one can 
say what they want to say. You can't express your feelings or you will go 
immediately to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Cuban President Fidel Castro appears to have made it clear 
that he no longer will try to prevent disgruntled Cubans from fleeing to the 
United States -- a situation that has led to lines at docks in Mariel, where 
Cubans are said to be waiting for transportation to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is trying desperately to stave off another Mariel boat lift 
like the one that occurred in 1980, when 125,000 Cuban refugees sailed to U.S. 
shores. Many later were identified by authorities as having criminal records in 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 To discourage further increases in the number of small-boat and raft refugees, 
the White House is expected to announce a plan soon to bolster the capability 
of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana -- which functions as a U.S. Embassy -- 
to process traditional visa applications. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. authorities said one reason for the large number of people attempting to 
cross the straits is that U.S. law virtually guarantees resident status and 
eventual citizenship to any Cuban landing on U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Cuba has sought to impede any of its citizens who try to obtain 
traditional visas, both by harassing them and refusing them exit permits. But 
Castro more recently has criticized the United States for maintaining only 
token facilities to process visa applications in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 Under President Ronald Reagan, the United States agreed to grant visas to as 
many as 20,000 Cuban immigrants a year, but officials said only about 4,000 
were granted in 1993, partly because of the obstacles that the Castro regime 
has imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, about 6,872 Cubans have arrived in the United States by sea 
-- up from 3,656 in 1993. Many in recent days have come by homemade boats and 
even inner tubes -- a move that Coast Guard officials warn is dangerous in the 
90 miles of open sea between Cuba and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have said the main difference between the 1980 boat lift and 
today's situation is that this time Cuban Americans who are living in South 
Florida are not taking their boats to pick up relatives in Cuba -- a pattern 
that sent refugee totals soaring in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Administration has concentrated the bulk of its efforts so 
far on persuading Cuban Americans to stay home rather than set sail for Cuban 
waters. So far, it has been reasonably successful, but some officials worry 
that could change overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 In his press conference Thursday, Chiles declared that the large influx of 
Cubans was creating "an emergency situation for services and assistance," and 
he called on Clinton to invoke a federal contingency plan to provide additional 
help for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emergency is the direct responsibility of the federal government," he 
said pointedly. He called out the Florida National Guard, Marine Patrol, state 
law enforcement department and other state agencies to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles also issued a warning to Cubans, pleading with them not to "risk your 
lives on a very dangerous journey" to the United States. "The Castro government 
is clearly weakening and the day of freedom is near in Cuba," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reno -- and later Myers at the White House -- rejected Chiles' contention 
that the situation is getting out of hand. "We have been able to manage the 
increased flow . . . in an orderly way," Reno told a news conference, "and 
without disruption to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials, however, said later that, despite Myers' rejoinder, the 
Administration had not flatly rejected Chiles' request but was merely 
considering it while policy-makers are reviewing the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House officials clearly were piqued at the stridence of Chiles' 
appeal, particularly since he is a Democrat in a state whose electoral votes 
Clinton will want if he decides to run for reelection. The President did not 
carry Florida in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure what the governor's concerns are," Tota, of the U.S. Catholic 
Conference, said in an interview. "I think there's a panic that this thing will 
keep growing and growing and growing." He said Chiles' remarks were "in 
reaction to Florida's emotional response to refugees."

CUBA REFUGEES IN U.S. HOLD SPECIAL IMMIGRATION STATUS; CITIZENSHIP: THOSE 
FLEEING CASTRO ARE UNIQUE IN BEING GUARANTEED ENTRY. HAITIANS, WHOSE EXODUS IS 
SIMILAR, SAY THEY ARE VICTIMS OF DISCRIMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, about 15,000 Haitians are 
crowded into a holding camp. Picked up by U.S. warships as they tried to sail 
to America, they have no chance of entering the United States. Eventually, they 
will be sent back home. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles away, in the port city of Mariel, thousands of Cubans are lining 
the docks, waiting to sail to South Florida. They, too, will be picked up -- by 
Coast Guard cutters -- and brought to Miami, where they will be welcomed as 
legal residents. No questions will be asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony-filled image -- both groups are fleeing from oppressive regimes -- 
underscores one of the most striking disparities in U.S. immigration law: the 
favored treatment that has been afforded Cuban refugees here for the last 28 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 For a variety of Cold War-era reasons, Cubans enjoy a privilege that no others 
seeking to come to the United States can claim: guaranteed entry into this 
country and immigrant status after one year. 
</P>
<P>
 The special advantage stems from the mid-1960s, when Congress, eager to 
encourage defections from Fidel Castro's Communist regime, granted Cuban 
refugees instant status as legal residents, virtually ensuring that they would 
be able to apply for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has more than enough slots for the few thousand Cubans each year 
who apply for standard entry visas through the U.S. Interests Section in 
Havana, a kind of unofficial embassy that the United States maintains in the 
Cuban capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Cubans who come to U.S. shores by spiriting themselves out of their country by 
airplane or boat -- as most among the current wave of Cuban asylum-seekers are 
doing -- are permitted to stay for at least a year and are granted 
near-automatic immigrant status after that. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Cold War legislation delights Cuban Americans in South Florida but it 
gnaws at leaders of the area's fast-growing Haitian community, who have watched 
their own relatives in Port-au-Prince being turned away from U.S. shores and 
sent back to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian American relief groups have complained bitterly that Haitian 
asylum-seekers -- who in many cases are being subjected to political threats 
similar to those that have plagued the Cubans -- are being discriminated 
against by U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians have a point. Under current law, Haitians who are seeking asylum 
in the United States must prove that they have a well-founded fear of 
persecution in their homeland. If they merely are seeking to come here to 
better their economic plight, they are summarily rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cubans who come here by boat are admitted with no questions asked, and 
they do not have to prove that they are escaping from a repressive regime. 
Under the 1966 Cuban Adjustment Act, the government assumes that they are 
political -- rather than economic -- refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Clinton Administration is finding the law affecting 
Cubans to be an impediment in a different way: As long as the legislation 
remains in effect, it is difficult for the Administration to stem the tide by 
turning the Cubans away, as it has the Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law doesn't give us an awful lot of flexibility," one key U.S. strategist 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the disparity -- and to the Administration's overall problems in 
handling the current influx -- is that Castro himself has refused to allow U.S. 
authorities to return Cuban nationals who have been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for those sent back after the 1980 Mariel boat lift -- after protracted 
negotiations with the Castro government -- Washington has only been able to 
return one Cuban national in the 35 years that Castro has been in office. 
</P>
<P>
 What is more, Administration officials and congressional strategists alike say 
prospects that the legislation can be changed to make Cuban refugees subject to 
the same entry requirements as those from other countries appear relatively 
dim. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Haitian Americans, who have only recently begun to exercise any 
political clout in the South Florida community, the Cuban Americans have become 
a serious power -- with plenty of allies among conservatives in all parts of 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 With Castro still in office -- and his regime on the ropes because of the 
sharp deterioration in economic conditions in Cuba -- lawmakers are not likely 
to want to change the regulations, particularly with an election on tap for 
this November.

SPECTER OF MARIEL BOAT LIFT IS RAISED -- 14 YEARS LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been 14 years since 125,000 Cuban refugees fled to U.S. shores after 
President Fidel Castro permitted them to leave the port of Mariel in small 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
 They came in droves, overwhelming resettlement agencies and refugee camps. 
Castro warned then, as he does now, that Washington's policy of accepting Cuban 
immigrants while granting few visas encourages illegal efforts to leave his 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 8,000 criminals and hundreds of mentally ill refugees were among 
the 125,000 refugees who flooded into Florida and other states. About 1,100 of 
the refugees still are held in federal prisons without the right to legal 
immigrant status. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the refugees are now U.S. citizens, immigration experts said. Many 
settled in the Miami area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the criminal activity surfaced, Marielito (a term for those who came to 
the United States then) became like a bad word," said Juan Clark, a Miami 
sociologist. "Once the rotten apples were weeded out, the whole thing changed 
and today you don't hear that word much any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban Americans in Southern Florida used their own boats to help transport 
refugees in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 While President Clinton was governor of Arkansas, he called out National 
Guardsmen to deal with rioting by hundreds of Cuban refugees who were being 
held at Ft. Chafee, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Cuban criminals were held in a federal penitentiary in Atlanta, where 
they rioted and set fires in 1984, causing $1 million in damage. Six months 
after Castro agreed early in 1985 to accept repatriation of these immigrants, 
he suspended the deal in retaliation for the establishment of Radio Marti, a 
U.S. radio station broadcasting anti-Castro messages into Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 Other rioting by Cuban prisoners followed. In 1987, Cubans held in a New York 
detention center rioted and tried to escape. They were sent to the Atlanta 
prison. Later that year, when the State Department began deporting some of the 
refugees, Cuban inmates in an Oakdale, La., jail took 28 hostages and set 
fires. The next day, refugees in the Atlanta prison took 94 hostages and kept 
authorities at bay for two weeks before surrendering. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Cuban inmates rioted again at a federal penitentiary in Talladega, 
Ala.

GERMAN TOURISTS ROOM WITH A CORPSE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in five months, German tourists have unknowingly spent the 
night in a South Florida motel room that contained a rotting corpse, police 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest incident occurred Wednesday at the Venice hotel, where the manager 
found the decaying body of a man wrapped in a plastic bag and stuffed under a 
bed.Air fresheners had been placed inside the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the man had been dead for several days, but that the last guests 
who stayed in the room apparently did not know the corpse was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a German family in the room on the 15th and 16th (Monday and 
Tuesday) and they checked out," Ft. Lauderdale Police spokeswoman Sonia 
Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy was pending. Investigators said they were attempting to contact the 
man who rented the room before the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, a maid at a Travelers hotel near the Miami airport found a decaying 
female corpse under the mattress in a platform-type bed after a German guest 
complained of a foul odor in his room. 
</P>
<P>
 The German visitor was not a suspect and was allowed to return home. Police 
were still looking for the man who had occupied the room before him.

VAZGEN I, 85; ARMENIAN CHURCH LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vazgen I, patriarch of the Armenian church for nearly four decades, died 
Thursday at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a powerful man and under the Soviet regime not only saved the church 
but continually improved it," said Ludwig Khachaturyan, head of the state 
religious affairs council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armenian church, founded in 301, calls itself the oldest in the Christian 
world. It has survived centuries of occupation of the tiny country, national 
catastrophe and official atheism under the Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 It remained an important unifying influence for a nation ruled for many 
centuries from Istanbul or Moscow and a people scattered by emigration across 
five continents. 
</P>
<P>
 Vazgen was chosen as its 130th leader, or Catholicos, in 1955 when the 
Stalinist era had barely ended. He presided through 30 years of Communism, when 
religious freedom was severely restricted, before Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
reforms brought down the system and eventually the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenia's independence in 1991 was overshadowed by the continuing conflict 
with neighboring Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, in which several thousand 
people have died since 1988. Vazgen spoke out constantly for peace in Karabakh, 
campaigning among Armenians at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three weeks before Vazgen's death, President Levon Ter-Petrossian 
made him the first recipient of the Caucasus nation's new supreme honor, 
granting him the title National Hero of Armenia. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of Vazgen's death was not released, but he had been undergoing 
chemotherapy for cancer of the lymph glands. 
</P>
<P>
 The patriarch, whose original name was Levon-Karapet Palchyan, was born in 
Bucharest in 1908 and studied at the university there. He held church posts in 
Greece, Bulgaria and Romania before being chosen as Catholicos by a national 
church council in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 He traveled widely, including visits to Los Angeles. A Communion service he 
conducted in the Hollywood Bowl in 1987 attracted 9,000 followers.

ELIAS CANETTI, 89; RECLUSIVE WRITER WON 1981 NOBEL PRIZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elias Canetti, the reclusive writer and fugitive from Nazism who won the 1981 
Nobel Prize in literature, has died. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
 Canetti, a Bulgarian-born British citizen who wrote in German, died Sunday, a 
relative said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Canetti was buried Wednesday beside Irish author James Joyce. Zurich Mayor 
Josef Estermann said Canetti had expressed the wish to be buried in Zurich, a 
city he fell in love with during his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Canetti went into seclusion after being named winner of the Nobel Prize "for 
writings marked by a broad outlook, a wealth of ideas and artistic power." 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish Academy, which administers the prize, compared Canetti to Feodor 
Dostoevski and European writers of the early 20th Century whom he admired, 
including Franz Kafka. 
</P>
<P>
 Canetti began writing dramas and novels in the early 1930s, but developed a 
wide following among German readers only in 1960 with the publication of the 
first volume of his major work, "Masse und Macht" (Crowds and Power). 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare meeting with reporters in 1981, he noted that a theme common in his 
writings is "the importance of crowds in modern life, the terrifying importance 
of power which is in danger of destroying the whole earth." 
</P>
<P>
 A nightmarish novel, "Die Blendung" (The Deception), which he wrote in the 
early 1930s, was not published in Vienna until 1963. But his drama, "Die 
Hochzeit" (The Wedding), was published in 1932 and two years later he completed 
his "Komodie der Eitelkeit" (Comedy of Vanity). 
</P>
<P>
 Canetti was also a distinguished essayist, dramatist and aphorist. 
</P>
<P>
 Canetti won the Nobel Prize at a time when the Swedish Academy was using the 
prize to draw attention to local masters who were unknown to a worldwide 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Admirers of Canetti's elegant German prose believed that the award was 
overdue, but conceded that translators have had problems conveying his style 
into other languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Canetti was born July 25, 1905, in Rustchuk, Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1911, he moved with his parents to Manchester, England. On the death of his 
father two years later, he moved to Vienna, where he attended school before 
continuing his education in Zurich and Frankfurt, Germany. He returned to 
Vienna to earn a doctorate in chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the Nazi takeover of Austria, Canetti, of Spanish-Jewish descent, left 
Austria in 1938 and went to Paris and then London, where he worked as a 
free-lance writer and was granted a British passport. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he maintained homes in London and Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
 His first wife, Venetia Toubner-Calderon, died in 1963. His second wife, Hera 
Buschor, died in 1988. He had one daughter.

YESHAYAHU LEIBOWITZ; ICONOCLASTIC ISRAELI PHILOSOPHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yeshayahu Leibowitz, an iconoclastic philosopher who outraged many Israelis by 
fiercely denouncing the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip as morally 
corrupting, died here Thursday at 91. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli President Ezer Wiezman praised Leibowitz as "among the great figures 
in the lives of the Jewish people and the state of Israel in recent 
generations, a man of intellect, philosophy, humanities and literature, a 
philosopher, a teacher and a trailblazer." 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with Jewish religious law, Leibowitz was buried in a Jerusalem 
cemetery before sundown. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Latvia in 1903, Leibowitz earned doctorates in medicine, biochemistry 
and philosophy, and was a professor of biochemistry and the philosophy of 
science at Hebrew University in Jerusalem for 34 years. He lived in a tiny 
Jerusalem apartment filled with books and wrote prolifically, producing more 
than 100 books and articles in his lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Leibowitz became notorious after Israel smashed the combined Arab armies and 
captured East Jerusalem, the Golan Heights, the Sinai desert, the West Bank and 
the Gaza Strip in June, 1967, in what became known as the Six-Day War. At a 
time when most Israelis were basking in the glow of victory and many were 
romping through tours of the West Bank, Leibowitz warned in January, 1968, that 
the occupation of the territories and their inhabitants would be a curse. He 
called for Israel's immediate withdrawal from all the lands it occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Leibowitz seemed to relish the shock that his harsh public statements about 
the occupation, and other sacred cows, caused. He reveled in the role of angry 
prophet. 
</P>
<P>
 He condemned the reverence with which nationalistic Orthodox Jews and even 
secular Israelis treated such shrines as the Western Wall of the destroyed 
Jewish Temple as "idolatry." He dismissed Prime Minister Golda Meir as that 
"old, and very evil, woman." He sneered that David Ben Gurion, Israel's first 
prime minister, was "a hater of Jewish history." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his most controversial statements, Leibowitz referred to the acts of 
"Judeo-Nazis" -- Israeli soldiers -- in the occupied territories. He called 
publicly, repeatedly, for Israeli soldiers to refuse to serve in the 
territories. Despite his subversive remarks, the Army was still asking him to 
lecture to troops as late as a year before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the day he died, Leibowitz continued to write, lecture and teach. 
Although he retired from Hebrew University in 1970, he continued to teach 
courses there, and spent time in his office Wednesday before dying in his sleep 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prof. Leibowitz was for me, as he was for many others, the moral compass of 
Israel," said Avraham Burg, a member of Knesset for the Labor Party and former 
student of Leibowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always an infuriating man, with brilliant talents, encyclopedic 
knowledge," Foreign Minister Shimon Peres told Israel Army Radio. "Even his 
mistakes were brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
 And although Leibowitz's views on the territories were widely unpopular for 
many years, in 1993, with Israel and the Palestinians working toward agreement 
on limited Palestinian self-rule in the territories, Leibowitz was nominated 
for the nation's highest civilian honor, the Israel Prize, in recognition of 
his life's work. He declined the honor, however, after sparking more public 
outrage by comparing Israeli undercover soldiers operating in the territories 
to members of Hamas, the militant Islamic organization that has pledged to 
destroy Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should I be excited?" Leibowitz said of his nomination in an interview 
with The Times. "I know what I'm worth, I don't need to be admired."

TALENT NIGHT ENCORE; THE PALOMINO TRADITION THAT BEGAN IN THE 1950S IS BACK 
EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Steve Appleford writes regularly 
about music for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somehow this was an offer Jeff Ross chose not to refuse. He's spent the last 
20 years playing fine electric guitar behind an impressive roster of country 
acts that includes Rank and File, the Desert Rose Band and Kelly Willis, taking 
him to certain career heights, recording for major record labels and traveling 
on national concert tours. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when Sherry Thomas, owner of the Palomino in North Hollywood, asked him to 
spend every Thursday night at the club as bandleader for the returning Talent 
Night, he ultimately agreed. Why? After all, the level of talent at any talent 
contest is uncertain at best. But Ross remembers the old Talent Night at the 
Palomino, a rich tradition of musical highs and lows that began with the club's 
opening in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Palomino's long-running contest was discontinued two years ago, 
Ross was a regular there, dropping by after his own gigs when possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Thomas has re-established the weekly ritual at the club as part of her 
effort to restore the Palomino's role as a major venue for emerging local 
country music talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Los Angeles talent scene as far as country music goes is being totally 
overlooked," says Thomas, the widow of club co-founder Tommy Thomas. "There is 
a big gap in Los Angeles for the live local bands to have a place that's their 
home. In the old days, a lot of the acts that performed here -- a lot of them 
got discovered here and went on to bigger and better things." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross has been at it for three weeks now, and has gathered three other 
experienced session players to accompany a mixed bag of singers and players 
every Thursday. "Sometimes it's rough," says Ross, relaxing in the club shortly 
after the end of the second installment of talent contestants. "You'll get 
somebody up there who doesn't know what their doing, and they don't have 
(music) charts. You just have to bear through it. And sometimes you'll get guys 
up there that just kill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or you'll get people like from the old days that are so odd and take 
themselves so seriously that it's funny. I used to come down here and play on 
the original Talent Night, and I'd be laughing so hard I could barely play. 
These people are so comical, it's like the bearded-lady show, or the circus." 
</P>
<P>
 On the first night of the new talent contest, the first performer was a man 
who somewhat distractedly wandered onto the stage to sing a few lyrics a 
cappella, before drifting back off to polite applause. Soon after, other 
singers offered heartfelt readings of songs by Loretta Lynn and others, or 
over-amped covers of rock 'n' roll chestnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, it was a chance for aspiring vocalists to win the $100 first prize 
and perform with a professional band capable of handling virtually any country, 
pop, rock, jazz or blues curve thrown their way. "It's a great way if you don't 
have a band, because to get a band together is horrendous," says Mark Sellers, 
a singer who won a second-place award of $50 on the first night. "It takes a 
lot of time. I'm an actor, too. So this keeps me going." 
</P>
<P>
 For Peter Carlisle, who is the host for the talent show and has a country 
music radio show on Riverside's KPRO (1570 AM), Thursday night is now an 
opportunity to survey some of the emerging talent in the L.A. area. "This is a 
great place to be showcased," says Carlisle, who also helps host the Palomino's 
Tuesday night Barndance with Ronnie Mack. He remembers "just hanging out" at 
the old Talent Night. "It was really the place to be every Thursday." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlisle accepted the invitation to help guide Talent Night back, in part 
because it's one of the few talent contests that still features a live band. 
"Many of the things in town are this karaoke stuff," Carlisle says with a 
shrug. But at the famed North Hollywood honky-tonk, he says, new singers can 
instead benefit from "the fact that they're playing the Palomino, which still 
has a good name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very impressed with the quality of the talent, because at these talent 
nights you're really open to almost anything. But the people we've been getting 
have just been superb." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlisle also suggests that a contestant could impress club owner Thomas 
enough to earn a place on the entertainment calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a stepping stone," Thomas said. "Where else can somebody go and play 
with a great band like this? As it gets going, I'm sure it will happen that we 
will find some talent for other nights." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlisle said this is the second week for a number of the performers. "They're 
very talented, and as the audience builds they'll get known, and it's a good 
way to get your foot in the business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the singers on the first night was Jose Jimenez, who sang Creedence 
Clearwater Revival songs in an excited staccato, shouting the lyrics out 
machine-gun style. He's a regular at other talent nights in the San Fernando 
Valley and Los Angeles, and says he has participated in the Palomino contest 
since 1968. "The first night I walked in here, I won first place," Jiminez 
says, wide sideburns flanking his cheeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep on doing it," he adds. "I just don't stop, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 The talent show only returned this month, and with minimal advertising it 
hasn't attracted large audiences. But from the first show, several performers 
from the old days arrived with guitars and songbooks in hand, huddling at 
tables before being called to the stage. Some performed original folk songs. 
One sang old Simon & Garfunkel hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Their presence provides "a kind of connection" with the earlier talent 
contest, says Carlisle. "A lot of them have come up to me and said they've been 
coming for so many years. It's great to see them come back. Obviously, the need 
is still there, and they want to be part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 One part of the past that hasn't returned is the Palomino Riders, the old 
house band that for several years provided Talent Night's accompaniment. One 
contestant, who drove up to the club from the South Bay with his acoustic 
guitar for the contest, privately expressed disappointment the first night when 
he discovered that the Palomino Riders had not returned. Thomas says she has 
heard some concern over her decision to enlist a new back-up band, but says she 
was only seeking "new blood" for the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross says he took the gig partly because it afforded him some minutes of 
musical self-expression during the band's sets between talent contestant 
segments, while playing with musicians of his choice. "They're all great 
players," he says. Besides the club management "told me I could pretty much do 
what I want -- basically country and blues." 
</P>
<P>
 Sign-up for the talent contest is from 8 to 9 p.m. on the night of the show, 
Carlisle says, although late additions are fine -- for now. If tradition holds, 
the Palomino's Talent Night lineup should eventually grow too crowded to keep 
stretching the deadline. "But right now we're pretty loose with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, Carlisle adds: "It doesn't have to be country. It can be an 
animal act if you want." WHERE AND WHEN

ROCKABILLY TRIBUTE; PIONEERS, INCLUDING THE LATE GENE VINCENT AND EDDIE 
COCHRAN, WILL BE CELEBRATED AT THE PALOMINO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Steve Appleford writes regularly

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rocker Gene Vincent was certainly broke and near-forgotten by the time he died 
in late 1971, even if his song "Be-Bop-A-Lula" had sold about 9 million copies 
by then. Newer generations of rockabilly fans tend to ignore such paradoxes and 
concentrate instead on celebrating the legacy Vincent left behind.  
</P>
<P>
 That celebration of Vincent's music, and that of his rock 'n' roll colleague 
Eddie Cochran, re-emerges Tuesday night at the Palomino in a tribute to the 
late rockabilly pioneers. Hosted by Ronnie Mack as this week's Barndance show, 
the free concert will feature at least 16 local rockabilly acts, including Big 
Sandy & The Fly-Rite Boys, James Intveld, the Dave and Deke Combo and others, 
all performing songs by Cochran and Vincent. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were part of California rockabilly," Mack says of the style that mixed 
blues with country, ultimately creating rock 'n' roll. "Most of it came from 
Memphis and stuff, the whole Sun Records thing. Gene Vincent, Eddie Cochran and 
Ricky Nelson really brought out California rockabilly, rode motorcycles 
together and created a disturbance." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis did before them, Cochran and Vincent 
helped define the early rock 'n' roll sound. Before he was killed at 21 in a 
car crash, while touring England with Vincent in 1960, Cochran wrote and 
recorded a handful of still-influential tracks. His "Summertime Blues" was 
redone by the Who, and his "Somethin' Else" was covered by the Sex Pistols, 
among others. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Palomino, some punk-flavored psychobilly versions of Cochran and 
Vincent tunes will be played by Terror Train and by the Hyperions. And 
Harmonica player Juke Logan will probably offer his usual roaring blues 
renditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just sweats himself to death man," says Mack. "He puts his heart and soul 
in it."  
</P>
<P>
 Twice in recent years, Mack has dedicated his regular Tuesday night Barndance 
show to the rockers. "It's totally different from everything that is on MTV," 
he says. "There's nothing like this music on the radio or in videos. The 
feeling is that it tends to be a lot more fun to listen to this type of music. 
And it attracts fans of all ages." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds at the rockabilly tribute shows tend to be dominated by those younger 
than 30, in ducktails or poodle skirts, arriving in vintage cars. "There is a 
whole big audience out there that knows more about it than I do, and some of 
them are only 18 years old. They live it," says Mack. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a sound and an attitude that is really appealing. It's just really 
fun, really danceable and exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Other fans who attended the last tribute, in 1992, included such established 
rock and country artists as Marshall Crenshaw, former-Stray Cats members Brian 
Setzer and Slim Jim Phantom, and country rocker Rosie Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 Focusing on the music of Vincent and Cochran, singer and author of such hits 
as "C'mon Everybody" and "Three Steps to Heaven," is a continuing crusade for 
Mack that began when he was a youngster in Baltimore listening to old records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I was a little kid, that always was my favorite sound," he says of 
rockabilly. "Growing up in the '60s and '70s, I was always into that stuff, but 
at the time you were laughed at for being into that. Most people were into 
Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 Mack says he has plans to honor other important musical figures at the 
Barndance next month. On Sept. 6, there will be a Buddy Holly and Patsy Cline 
tribute. And the birthday of Hank Williams Sr. will be celebrated on Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the acts that we have on these shows tend to do it stripped down and 
bare, so that it has total integrity," Mack says of his guest performers. "That 
is what I think is missing so much from the country charts today. It's gotten 
too much about how big your muscles are, and can you shake your crotch around." 
</P>
<P>
 But the fans who come to the tributes at the Palomino seem to understand, says 
Mack. "We'll probably have a line outside. We always do." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: Tribute to Eddie Cochran and Gene Vincent, with performances by Big 
Sandy & The Fly-Rite Boys, James Intveld, the Dave and Deke Combo, Terror 
Train, the Hyperions, others.

ALL IN THE FAMILY; WRITER DRAWS ON REAL LIFE IN HIS PLAY ABOUT A BOY'S REUNION 
WITH HIS BIOLOGICAL FATHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 It's real life, real fun and real pain when a 10-year-old boy meets his 
biological fa ther for the first time in Travis Michael Holder's "Surprise, 
Surprise," which had its world premiere Thursday night at the Victory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "His mother and I were in 'Hello, Dolly!' together in London," explains 
Holder, 47, who is purposefully vague about where his real life and the play's 
story merge. "I was 18; she was in her mid-30s and had a husband and two kids 
in L.A." When the woman found out she was pregnant, she left the show and 
high-tailed it back home without telling Holder of her condition. It wasn't 
until a decade later that he found out, when the young boy's maternal 
grandmother spilled the secret and put the father and son in touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me grow up real fast," Holder says succinctly of his instant 
fatherhood 19 years ago. At that point, the boy's mother had been hospitalized 
six years since a major car accident (and would remain hospitalized until her 
1994 death), and the boy had a rocky relationship with the man he'd grown up 
believing was his father. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's characters include the boy David, David's grandmother Winnie, his 
"new" father Den, Den's partner Colin, and Den's friend Junie Hannah, a 
glamorous former film star. Dawn Wells plays Junie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Travis as an actor and a friend," Wells explains. "Three or four 
years ago I read the play, and was really knocked out by its humanity. I think 
it has a lot to say." So does Wells, who may forever wipe out her image of the 
squeaky-clean Mary Ann of "Gilligan's Island" with her portrayal of Junie, a 
jaded, tough-talking actress who's been through the Hollywood wringer. "The 
harder her mouth is, the tougher it is to get through, to see the colors of her 
character," says the actress. "She protects herself from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that one of Wells' co-stars is in a wheelchair is ironic, since her 
company, Wishing Wells, has a line of clothing, Quick Change, for hospitalized 
or disabled persons. It grew from her idea that "there had to be a way of 
making beautiful clothes and fabrics that are easy to get out of."

 With a resurgence of "Gilligan" mania, Wells also has a board game in the 
works based on the '60s series, and last winter launched "Mary Ann's Gilligan's 
Island Cookbook."  
</P>
<P>
 Scott Cheek, the 18-year-old disabled actor who's playing Colin, also has an 
off-stage relationship with the writer: Holder is his manager, and was by his 
hospital bedside for 13 weeks last year when a movie-set accident sent him 
through a plate-glass window, resulting in permanent spinal injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Holder had originally written the part for a 30-year-old man, but altered it 
so Cheek could do the role. "I realized what was missing from the play was what 
Scott could bring," he says. "So I rewrote it with his will and his spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seeing his courage really changed my life," says Holder, who also manages 
nine other young actors and is a reviewer for Entertainment Today. "At the time 
of Scott's accident, I was feeling sorry for myself: watching all my friends be 
much more successful, having four cancer surgeries in my 20s and 30s -- so I 
was at a real emotional ebb." Originally, he had envisioned the role of Den for 
himself as an acting showcase, but found "it was more important than about 
people seeing me act." 
</P>
<P>
 Holder, who debuted on Broadway at age 6, came west at 19, under contract at 
Paramount. His varied show-biz experiences include appearing in "Hair," booking 
acts at the Troubador, and doing three years of publicity for The Doors. In 
this play, he admits, "Hollywood gets skewered; there's a lot of jokes about it 
and the people in it. But I think it's real life-affirming." 
</P>
<P>
 Show producer Phil Wurtzel -- once Holder's acting student at Cal State San 
Bernardino -- agrees: "It's not trying to carry a torch for anything. It's just 
a day in the life." WHERE AND WHEN

THEATER REVIEW; A DRAMATIC SYMBOL LACKING POWER; 'LAST ANGRY BROWN HAT' CREATES 
THE RIGHT ATMOSPHERE BUT LACKS THE NECESSARY EMOTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Like a totem laden with mystic associations, Willie's brown beret is stored 
away in a garage chest. And, as if he were opening an ancient Aztec crypt, 
Willie opens the chest and pulls out the brown beret when his pals come by 
after their friend Frankie's funeral. Here is the symbol of the Brown Berets, 
the militant group Willie and friends led during the heyday of the late 
1960s-early '70s "Chicano Power" movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, too, is the source of the title of Alfredo Ramos' play, "The Last Angry 
Brown Hat," the first produced by Actors Alley's Aztlan Playwrights Collective 
at Actors Alley's tented space on the grounds of the Academy of Television Arts 
and Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rose Portillo's staging, though, Willie's beret doesn't contain theatrical 
power. Even though Ramos wrote his drama as an extremely traditional, 
naturalistic vehicle for memories recalled and emotions purged -- the kind of 
play they used to write when The Method ruled the roost -- he seems to want 
some kind of magic to pulsate from the beret on stage. It's a concise, 
potentially powerful symbol of everything these guys dreamed about and lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the symbol just sits there. Instead, the power must come from Portillo's 
actors, a kind of Who's Who of L.A. Chicano theater artists: Enrique Castillo 
as welding shop owner Willie, Danny De La Paz as math teacher Louie, Mike Gomez 
as TV writer Jojo and Del Zamora as chronically unemployed Rude Boy. Three are 
reviving their roles from "Brown Hat's" first staging in April, 1993, in 
Lincoln Heights (Castillo is the newcomer).  
</P>
<P>
 So, these are actors very comfortable with their roles, and very aware of the 
cultural dichotomy that animates the play: '60s youthful anger/radicalism and 
'90s adult responsibility/conformism. 
</P>
<P>
 Much is made here, for instance, of Jojo's "sell-out" job as a writer in a TV 
industry that can't produce one prime-time Latino show. Ramos, a TV writer, is 
writing close to home. We're hearing the message, ironically, just yards away 
from the TV industry's own academy.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the play, this remains a message and nothing more. "Brown 
Hat" wanders around from topic to topic; you can feel Ramos searching for 
dramatic pay-offs, but he's never quite sure how to build up to them. He tries 
to build something out of Willie's cracked notion that one of them snitched to 
the cops, who then went after the Brown Berets with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't really go anywhere, so Ramos gives each guy an emotional 
monologue. Here, we finally get to the essence of these men, but the 
one-speech-after-another format is wearying. The play doesn't work, but the 
atmosphere surrounding it works in a big way. Zamora's comic zest produced 
enough laughter Sunday to drown out a plane overhead. If only Ramos' drama 
spoke as loudly. WHERE AND WHEN

BALANCING OF STYLES; IN A BID FOR DIVERSITY, BRAND GALLERY COUNTERS A STARK, 
PHOTO-BASED EXHIBIT WITH A DISPLAY OF COMPLEX, MIXED-MEDIA ASSEMBLAGES. 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 The dramatic images -- messages presented by two artists this month at the 
Brand Art Gallery -- will confront viewers with diverse ways of seeing. There 
are Steven Peckman's large, abstract, photo-based works of stark blacks and 
whites, explosive scenes that suggest heaven and hell. But the mixed-media work 
of K. L. Wilder remains closer to earth, making pointed explorations into the 
endless complications of male-female relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 The two very different art forms have been joined in a dual exhibition as part 
of the gallery's continuing effort to present a diverse view of art to the 
local community, according to gallery director Cindy Cleary. "Part of it was 
the simplicity of his work with the complex messages of hers," she said of the 
two artists. "I thought they would blend well." 
</P>
<P>
 While much of the work on display was completed within the last year -- and in 
Wilder's case, the last few weeks -- the artists were actually scheduled more 
than two years ago, a result of the Brand's long waiting period for gallery 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wilder's newest work, created under the overall title "The Ragged Edge of 
Desire, Series II," the conceptual artist has created a series of pieces that 
at times probe her own romantic history. She has surveyed 100 men, ranging from 
a supermarket box-boy to a corporate executive, on their personal preferences 
and desires regarding women. 
</P>
<P>
 One resulting work from the survey includes "Little Black Book," which 
presents rows of the notorious little black telephone books, but with 
handwritten messages inside that lend some doubt to the old stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be really interesting to find out what men really want," 
said Wilder of the survey. "Out of the 100 men, only two wanted the blue-eyed 
blonde." She added, "They were more interested in the heart than in looks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all had a different point of view and a different story. It really 
changed my perspective of men." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the show is Wilder's series of 17 cigar boxes, each one mounted to the 
wall and containing a poem and object representing a romantic episode in her 
life. The series begins with a remembrance of an episode from age 4, and 
continues with boxes representing her "Dear John letter" episode, and a piece 
titled "Broken Engagement," which includes the necklace and butterfly pendant 
her fiance gave her. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been on the drawing boards a couple of years, while I've been working on 
the poems and ideas," said Wilder, who lives in Echo Park, and now teaches 
graphic design at Woodbury University in Burbank. "I wanted it to be very 
simple, with one simple item that you could identify with. When we go through 
emotional pain we always think it's just us. That's what I wanted to say: We 
are not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the course of my lifetime these are the men who had the greatest impact on 
my life, the men I've been in love with." 
</P>
<P>
 Peckman's 21 massive monoprints, collectively part of his "Silence" series, 
utilize the photographic process, but to dramatic painterly effect. The works 
are created with a combination of chemical light manipulations against large 
pieces of light-sensitive paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out doing photography and painting, and I wanted to find a way to 
blend the two together," said Peckman, who lives in Los Feliz. "Instead of 
taking pictures, I make pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 The large scale of the works -- ranging from 50-by-43-inches to 
95-by-50-inches -- is designed to involve the viewer physically. But the scale 
does have its drawbacks, as when Peckman had to store many of the pieces in the 
small apartment he shares with his wife, landscape painter Marina Moevs, who 
had her own paintings stored there. He says jokingly, "We're thinking of 
getting a place for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Peckman said he has always been intrigued by the "magical and mysterious" 
quality of photo-processing in the darkroom, watching an image slowly emerge 
from a blank sheet of paper. That combination of darkness and light is the 
central ingredient to his large "Silence" pieces at the Brand. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the work is about becoming," Peckman said. "All things begin and end 
in silence. The darkness is what everything comes from." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>

Wilder.

TALK SHOW 'SEX-PERT'; DEBORAH COOPER DIVIDES HER TIME BETWEEN COUCH-SIDE 
THERAPY AND TV APPEARANCES, SPECIALIZING IN SOUND BITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After two half-hour segments of cable-television sex therapy, it's on to the 
"Leeza" show to counsel the hastily married, and then a sprint through the back 
door to the "Hard Copy" studios for a discussion of O.J. Simpson's love life. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Deborah Cooper has had her TV makeup on since this morning, so 
the face needs only a touch-up at each taping. And "Leeza" sent a limo, giving 
her time to study the schedule and find out it was Danny Partridge she'd be 
counseling in front of a few million people.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some people just talk about sex," Cooper says with a made-for-television 
smile. "Others make a profession of talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper -- that's Dr. Cooper to clients and fans since she has a doctorate in 
psychology -- is the consummate confidante of sexual deviants, guest of 
"Donahue" and "Geraldo," a green-eyed blonde who one "Leeza" audience member 
swore was a movie star. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a harried and quirky combination that may have Freud turning over on his 
couch, but Cooper believes she's found the perfect practice. If only there were 
time for sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to schedule it in," she says. "Otherwise I forget." 
</P>
<P>
 The Encino resident is a talk show "sex-pert" and relationship therapist, 
called in when television producers need therapeutic expertise, glamorous looks 
and the ability to offer advice to nymphomaniacs and depressed mothers-in-law 
on the same show. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the age of sexual openness and Prozac, she is called often. 
</P>
<P>
 This recent day began with the taping of two sex-filled interviews for "The 
Dr. Deborah Cooper Show," which airs on Los Angeles public access channels. 
Then came the "Leeza" taping, where Danny Bonaduce -- once the precocious Danny 
of "Partridge Family" fame -- now a morning DJ in Chicago -- admitted to 
marrying his wife on their first date -- a blind date -- in order to get the 
morally strict Christian into bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper gave the couple -- still married four years later -- a minor scolding 
and her best wishes. Then she removed her microphone and rushed over to "Hard 
Copy" to chat about O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "The excitement, the energy," she says. "I have a blast." 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old Cooper stumbled into the mad world of mass media counseling 
and television sex talk in 1991, doing local radio shows in hopes of luring 
clients and building her private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, she figures that she spends half her average working day 
counseling clients at her Encino and Brentwood offices. The other half is spent 
less traditionally: hopping red-eye flights, making phone calls from the back 
of limousines, getting powdered and pampered like a movie star. 
</P>
<P>
 If that all sounds like just too much, Cooper will tell you it's a great way 
to make up for her first two decades of life in Maryland cow country: "Boring." 
</P>
<P>
 The distinctly postmodern career also offered her a chance to do something she 
is good at. Television and therapy strike some as being an incongruous match, 
but those who request her -- again and again -- say her strength is making the 
improbable combination appear natural. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got the look, she's got the sound bite, she's got the credentials," 
says "Leeza" producer Adora English. "We call her 'Dr. Sound Bite.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Rosenblum, a senior producer at "Sally Jessy Raphael" in New York, says 
handling sometimes fragile guests in front of millions of viewers is an art, 
and that Cooper "gets it. It would be a lot easier for me to get someone from 
New York, but . . . people open up to her. She's a good guest." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenblum pauses, chuckles, and then addresses the subject all producers get 
to eventually when evaluating Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It also doesn't hurt that she's absolutely beautiful to look at," Rosenblum 
says. "I mean, we're talking about a visual medium here." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper acknowledges, when pressed, that her looks do play a role. She also 
says that being attractive is an asset in the therapeutic sense when the 
discussion finally gets where it always seems to be going -- to sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at me and know I've had a relationship or two," she says, and 
that helps them relate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even her two marriages -- one lasting six months -- and two divorces, serve to 
lend credence to her advice, she claims. "They give me much more experience. 
They've made me a better shrink, because I've been through hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there are the critics -- many from her own field, she admits -- who 
tell her that "Sally Jessy Raphael" is not the place for counseling, and that 
addressing serious concerns between soap operas serves mainly to trivialize 
them. First, she says, "People don't like people who have made it." She also 
readily admits: "It's not real therapy. You do real therapy in your office. You 
cannot do real therapy on television." 
</P>
<P>
 What she's doing primarily, Cooper says, is educating people, giving them a 
taste of psychotherapy, making them say "ah-ha" as a light bulb of recognition 
flickers for the first time. She also says she's helping remove the stigma of 
psychological counseling and mental illness by bringing it into the open -- 
right between soaps. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the naysayers still don't like it? 
</P>
<P>
 "So what?" It's the guests, her single-session television clients, who really 
count, and "they love it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, after suffering a gentle Dr. Cooper tongue-lashing on the "Leeza" 
stage -- for marrying a woman half his age, of a different ethnic background 
and just six weeks after they met -- a man named Steve walked up to Cooper 
after the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks," he said. "Any advice?" WHERE AND WHEN

SAMPLING THE VALLEY'S ETHNIC BAKERIES; CULTURAL DELICACIES RICH IN EXOTIC 
INGREDIENTS ABOUND, FROM FILIPINO CAKES TO CUBAN PASTRIES AND LUSCIOUS VIENNESE 
DESSERTS.

<P>
 Man cannot live by bread alone. Especially in one of our colorful ethnic 
bakeries. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us have a favorite neighborhood bakery, where we treat ourselves to a 
cookie or slice of pie when we need an emotional lift. But the San Fernando 
Valley fairly abounds with exotic ethnic bakeries, places where it is possible 
to experience a totally different culture while satisfying that sudden craving. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect anything from mom and pop storefronts to larger commercial outlets in 
this genre, with a few surprises thrown in. The majority of our ethnic bakeries 
emphasize breads, but a host of others bake up specialty fare, pastries and 
novelties from countries as diverse as Armenia, the Philippines and Cuba as 
well as various points on the European compass. 
</P>
<P>
 The following short list should get you started on the bakery trail, with 
apologies to the many fine places not mentioned. Filipino 
</P>
<P>
 The delightful Dates and Nuts belongs to Leah Gonzales, a former nurse who 
hails from Cavite City on Luzon. The bakery is part of a franchise in the 
Philippines, but Gonzales and her special passion for baking make this store 
extra special. Talagang naiiba -- that's the bakery chain's Tagalog-language 
slogan. Translation: "It's really different." 
</P>
<P>
 That it is. In the Philippines, tropical ingredients such as yam, coconut and 
mango abound, so don't be surprised to find pastries and cakes using these 
flavors to the fullest. The round cassava cake ($5.50, serves six to eight) is 
made from the starchy root staple that produces tapioca. This one is sweet, 
heavy and eaten hot, with a custard-like topping. 
</P>
<P>
 How about these tiny, rich macaroons, little pastry cups filled with a sugary 
suspension that is almost pure coconut? A scrumptious-looking mango cheesecake 
or mango cream cake, both with a yellowish tinge and an ultra-creamy taste, is 
$7.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Ube cake is purple, thanks to the purple yam for which it is named. (Filipinos 
also make a delicious, purple ice cream from the ube.) Bubo pie is a standard 
on the islands, a coconut pie with a flaky outer crust and a light crumb 
topping. And Gonzales is especially proud of her sans rival, a wafer cake with 
butter cream icing and a cashew nut filling, sold in sheet form. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not all sweet stuff in here. The Spanish influence on the islands is 
responsible for breads such as pan de sal and ensaymaditas. The first is a 
salted roll for snacks and sandwiches. The second is a buttery breakfast bread. 
Snacks include lumpia Shanghai, little cylinders of meat filling inside a fresh 
egg roll skin, and crusty adobo pie, a chicken-stuffed short pastry that is 
pure Filipino. Gonzales will make you lunch too, mostly home-style noodle 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dates and Nuts, 13556 Roscoe Blvd., Panorama City, (818) 786-5100. Open 10 
a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday. Jewish 
</P>
<P>
 Solley's Woodland Hills is the newest Jewish bakery in the area, open three 
weeks. Now that the redoubtable Weby's of Studio City has closed its doors 
after a 27-year run, Solley's -- with a main branch in Sherman Oaks -- is 
poised to become the preeminent Jewish bakery in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 This newly remodeled Solley's is big and bright with lots of windows and a 
full-service deli counter and restaurant. The pastry carousel is right by the 
front door, so you can't walk in without passing an array of tortes, 
cheesecakes and other cardiological nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 I've long been a fan of the hearty, swirly black and white (pumpernickel and 
rye) bread -- chewy, seeded bread sold at $1.20 a pound. One sliced bread 
usually weighs in at nearly two pounds. The bakery section sells 13 varieties 
of bagels at 42 cents each, plus a variety of other breads. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastry lovers should try the terrific hamentash , a triangular short pastry 
filled with prune, poppy or apricot paste; rugalach , bite-sized cookies made 
from a rich cream-cheese dough; any of the mini-Bundt cakes at $1.95 each; or 
the delicious, moon-shaped black and white cookies, smeared with chocolate- and 
vanilla-flavored frosting. If you're really in the mood to do the town, try the 
cylindrical, individual-sized strawberry shortcake, wrapped in wax paper and 
dense with thick whipped cream, a bargain at $2.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Solley's, 21857 Ventura Blvd., Woodland Hills, (818) 340-0810, and 4578 Van 
Nuys Blvd., Sherman Oaks, (818) 905-5774. The Woodland Hills bakery is open 7 
a.m. to midnight Sunday through Thursday, 7 a.m. to 1 a.m. Friday and Saturday; 
in Sherman Oaks, the bakery opens at 6 a.m. Cuban 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's wonderful Porto's is bound to overwhelm anyone unfamiliar with a 
Cuban bake shop. Cubans like their pastries sweet and tropical, arrays of cakes 
made with ingredients such as mango and coconut, and rum-drenched pastries 
clotted with creams and custards. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a big, bright place with several tables, a huge open space in the 
center, a hot-food section for meat pies, sandwiches and snacks, and a long, 
colorful pastry counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin at the hot section, where house specialties such as pastel de carne and 
croquetas de jamon are on display. The first is a puff pastry filled with 
seasoned ground beef, which sells for an incredible 35 cents. The second is all 
of 50 cents, a breaded, deep-fried cylinder fashioned from ground ham, bread 
crumbs and spices. Both terrific snacks washed down with a Cuban pineapple 
soda, available at the cashier. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cookies and pastries sell for the same, unbelievably low prices. One of 
the most delicious is guava roll, short pastry shaped into a small horn that is 
filled with guava paste. The huge masareal (70 cents) is a giant cornmeal 
square big enough for three, a soft pastry cut in half, lengthwise, with 
strawberry jam in the center. Tres leche is a rich, meringue-topped milk 
pudding, served in a foil cup. And for those with a real sweet tooth, there is 
coquito en almiba, a golf ball-sized confection of shredded coconut, wrapped in 
crackly, caramelized sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Porto's Bakery, 315 N. Brand Ave., Glendale. (818) 956-5996. Monday to 
Saturday, 7:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., Sunday 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Scandinavian 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be intimidated by the giant, four-tiered wedding cakes in the window at 
Skandia, a Swedish-American bakery in Burbank. Most people stop in here for a 
cup of coffee and a slice of Swedish Princess cake, the house specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in Los Angeles could a Swedish bakery be Israeli-owned and operated, as 
this one is. Nonetheless, many breads, cakes and cookies here look and taste 
exactly as they would in a small Swedish village. That Princess cake, for 
instance, sold by the slice at $1.75, is composed of yellow sponge cake layered 
with raspberry puree and whipped cream, enrobed by a Kermit-green marzipan 
paste. The slices, incidentally, are loaf-shaped. 
</P>
<P>
 The bakery also sells loaves of dense limpa, a Swedish brown bread that gets 
much of its taste, color and density from such ingredients as molasses and 
orange peel. Among the array of cookies and cupcakes typically found in any 
suburban bakery, there are a dozen or so different types of Swedish petit fours 
-- elaborately designed, frosted affairs made with almonds, bananas, jams, 
chocolate and colored marzipans. 
</P>
<P>
 A new wrinkle here, as in most Valley bakeries, is the fine selection of 
fat-free muffins the chefs have just added. But one of my favorite pastries 
here is the chocolate-dipped almond horseshoe, a rich pastry studded with 
shaved almonds. No points from the aerobics instructor for that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Skandia Swedish-American Bakery, 347 N. Pass Ave., Burbank. (818) 761-2233. 
Open 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Saturday. Armenian 
</P>
<P>
 Walk into the wonderful Avo's Bakery at any time, and you'll see a team of 
busy workers rolling dough, mixing meat and spices and manning an enormous, 
rotating oven. They are assembling lahmajune, a crusty Armenian snack that some 
people compare to pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not pizza, of course. Lahmajune is a razor-thin, baked bread topped with 
tomato, minced meat, bell peppers, garlic and secret Armenian spices; and it is 
one of the world's truly addictive snacks. Armenians fold it up, then eat it 
like a burrito. 
</P>
<P>
 I ate mine hot out of the bakery's huge oven on my last visit, and it was 
sheer perfection. Avo's Bakery is the king of lahmajune in these parts, which 
is why the bakery has five delivery trucks moving the product to Fresno, 
Oakland and other points all over the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The business belongs to the Kabadayan family, and it doesn't stop with 
lahmajune. Many products are baked here; most of them sold in bulk and trucked 
out to retail businesses and Armenian groceries. 
</P>
<P>
 They are happy to sell to the public, though, as the sometimes long lines here 
attest. Try one of the enormous, triangular boregs, puffy, yeasty breads about 
a foot long. Fillings might be spinach, cheese or spicy cheese, and they make 
great impromptu lunches when eaten warm. The bakery sells slightly sweet sesame 
bread sticks for $1.99 a bag, also soft date cookies called khorma for $3 
(about 18 cookies.) You'll find breads such as chorag, a sweet raisin roll, and 
several other breads with long Armenian names. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't forget that lahmajune is the bakery's real drawing card, perhaps the 
Valley's best bargain snack. It sells for 75 cents apiece, $3.25 for a bag of 
eight. Wow. 
</P>
<P>
 Avo's Bakery, 6740 Reseda Blvd., Reseda. (818) 774-1032. Open 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. 
daily. Viennese 
</P>
<P>
 Viktor Benes Continental Bakery was founded by a Viennese immigrant, a fact 
that is noteworthy because of that city's long, unrivaled pastry-making 
tradition. The original bakery was and is on Third Street in Los Angeles, 
sandwiched between West Hollywood and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to miss the Valley branch, located as it is inside the sprawling 
Gelson's Market in Encino. The outlet is on the west side of the store, fronted 
by a long counter. Breads and pastries are made fresh in a kitchen just behind 
the counter, and quality control is high. You'll be waited on by a team of 
women in burgundy-colored aprons and visored hats. Feel free to ask them to 
describe some of the fancier pastries, many of which are Central European in 
origin, and may be unfamiliar to first-time visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, the luscious Vienna torte, a round, crusty latticed 
pie/cake made from thickly cut cookie dough. The filling is either apricot or 
peach, serves eight to 10, and is perfect for that mid-afternoon coffee 
klatsch. Vanilla-flavored Hungarian biscuits are hearty and dense; I slice them 
in half to make a Hapsburgian version of strawberry shortcake. Walnut squares 
are another Hungarian favorite, a top and a bottom layer of crusty dough, a 
rich, walnut puree in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The variety is impressive here, and almost everything is delicious. Great, 
heavily seeded corn rye bread sells for about $2.55 a loaf; small gugelhoffs, a 
puffy bread from France's Alsace region that is really more like a cake, $5.40. 
For fancier gatherings, how about a gorgeous, eight-inch lemon tart dotted with 
willowy clumps of meringue, or a gateau St. Honore, a puff-pastry base with 
custard and rum, topped with custard-filled pastry puffs and chocolate-flavored 
whipped cream. St. Honore is French, not Viennese. I don't hear anyone 
complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Viktor Benes Continental Pastry, 16450 Ventura Blvd., Encino. (818) 783-4844. 
Open 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily.

ENTERTAINMENT NEWS; RIDING TO SUCCESS; THE LOCALLY CONCEIVED 'BIKER MICE FROM 
MARS' SERIES IS SEEN IN MORE THAN 50 COUNTRIES. THE STARS MAKE A LIVE 
APPEARANCE SATURDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES E. FOWLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their name notwithstanding, the Biker Mice From Mars are really Valley dudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Biker Mice From Mars" is a syndicated, animated television series featuring 
three freedom-loving, crime-fighting teen-age Martian mice who chase bad guys 
on "ultra-radical" vehicles. The show, broadcast locally on KCOP-TV, Channel 
13, is seen in more than 50 countries. The show's Valley connection is a strong 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cartoons are produced in the Philippines, voice-dubbing and other 
post-production work are done in the San Fernando Valley. Also, the show's 
distribution company, Genesis Entertainment, is headquartered in Agoura Hills. 
But most important, the "Biker Mice" were conceived at Jerry's Famous Deli in 
Encino.  
</P>
<P>
 "My wife and I were having brunch, when all of a sudden about 25 Harleys 
roared up," said Rick Ungar, the show's creator and executive producer. "But 
you could see these guys were yuppies." 
</P>
<P>
 His close encounter with these white-collar, biker wanna-bes started Ungar's 
creative process, which culminated in the animated series. The motorcycles were 
the key attraction, Ungar said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Biker Mice" debuted last fall as a once-a-week syndicated series and has 
expanded to a Monday through Friday format. The show is generating home videos, 
toys and accessories, Ungar said, and he hopes to release a live-action film in 
summer 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarities between his show and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles do exist, 
Ungar admitted. But he claims that the difference is in the writing: In "Biker 
Mice," the writers take great pains to add levels of humor that appeal to 
adults as well as children, while the Turtles are strictly for kids, Ungar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Biker Mice From Mars" will make their debut live appearance at 11 a.m. 
Saturday at the Love Ride Kick-off Ceremony in Glendale. Love Ride, an annual 
motorcycle fund-raising event to benefit the Muscular Dystrophy Assn., is 
scheduled for Nov. 13. The kick-off on Saturday will open registration and 
unveil the official Love Ride 11 poster, created by rock poster artist Stanley 
Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be there, too, " Ungar said. "We will be there with Peter Fonda and a 
lot of other celebrities."  
</P>
<P>
 The Love Ride 11 Kick-Off Ceremony, featuring the Biker Mice From Mars, Peter 
Fonda, Perry King and others, 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday at Harley-Davidson of 
Glendale, 3717 San Fernando Road, Glendale. The event is open to the public and 
will also feature refreshments and live entertainment. Call (818) 246-5618.  
</P>
<P>
 DOUBLE DATING: "Guys and Dolls" is sometimes called the quintessential 
Broadway musical. And now, Valley audiences have two chances to see it. Both 
the Woodland Hills Community Theatre and the Glendale Centre Theatre are 
presenting concurrent productions of this "musical fable of Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys and Dolls," based on a Damon Runyon short story about New York lowlifes, 
has words and music by Frank Loesser and a book by Abe Burrows and Jo Swerling. 
The original 1950 Broadway production, directed by theater legend George S. 
Kaufman, won eight Tony Awards and ran for 1,200 performances. A 1955 film 
version starred Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra. The 1992 revival of the show 
is still playing on Broadway. The score includes such favorites as "Sit Down, 
You're Rockin' the Boat," "Luck Be a Lady" and "If I Were a Bell." 
</P>
<P>
 Concurrent productions in the same geographic area do not usually happen. So, 
why did it happen here? 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills first secured the rights to do the show last spring. Glendale 
had planned to produce "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers," the stage adaptation 
of the 1954 MGM film musical best remembered for its ensemble dance numbers, 
but then announced the change to "Guys and Dolls" in its July newsletter.  
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Centre Theatre co-producer David Dietlin said the switch was prompted 
by unforeseen casting problems, specifically a lack of male dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Berry, Woodland Hills Community Theatre artistic director, was diplomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised that after contacting them several times and letting them 
know we were doing 'Guys and Dolls' that they would still pick that play to 
do," Berry said. "I think they would be surprised if the situation was 
reversed." 
</P>
<P>
 Berry said he never spoke directly with Dietlin or his brother and 
co-producer, Tim Dietlin, and that they never returned his phone calls. But he 
said he did leave messages at the theater and was told that the Dietlins had 
received his messages.  
</P>
<P>
 Although there's no exclusivity rule for production rights for community 
theaters, as there is in equity shows, Berry said it's a matter of protocol and 
respect not to double up on another theater's production.  
</P>
<P>
 David Dietlin discounted the notion that Glendale Centre Theatre is treading 
on another's turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know if they were doing it or not," Dietlin said. "And they're so 
far away. We've done 'Guys and Dolls' before and it's a good strong show."  
</P>
<P>
 This is Glendale Centre Theatre's 48th season, but the first under the 
leadership of the Dietlin brothers, who have taken over the reins from their 
parents.  
</P>
<P>
 Berry said the double productions have not affected his ticket sales. "Our 
ticket sales are fine," he said. "Several performances are already sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do wish them the very best of luck for their show," he added. "I'd like 
everyone to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills Community Theatre, 22700 Sherman Way, West Hills, presents 
"Guys and Dolls" at 8 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays through Sept. 3. Also a Sunday 
matinee at 2:30 p.m. Aug. 28. Tickets are $15 general, $13 students and 
seniors. Call (818) 884-1907.  
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Centre Theatre, 324 N. Orange St., Glendale, presents "Guys and 
Dolls" at 8 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays, with matinees at 3 p.m. 
Saturdays. Ends Oct. 1. Tickets are $11.75 Wednesdays, Thursdays and matinees, 
$14.25 Fridays and Saturdays, $10.75 seniors on Wednesdays and at Saturday 
matinees. Call (818) 244-8481.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: ROMANCE IS UP THEIR ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERI COOK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flowing dresses and unique, often antique, costume jewelry may draw a younger 
crowd to center's new store. 
</P>
<P>
 Anew addition to The Alley in the Valley should lure daughters to come 
shopping with Mom, who, if she's in the know, has been shopping the alley for 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
 Tres Chique II has moved into the space at the shopping area previously 
occupied by Options, which has moved across the alley to become a part of 
Dressed Up. And if that confuses you, don't worry. Once you're in the alley, it 
will be clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Tres Chique offers a younger, romantic look, as opposed to the older, elegant 
look that Mom prefers. Owners Eydie Urbaitel and Sherry Steinberg have stocked 
their boutique for the 16-to-40 crowd, and done so reasonably and selectively. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find a large portion of the inventory devoted to the Nostalgia label in 
dresses that so many young women love -- and look great in. These romantic and 
flowing frocks are priced from $55 to $60. In many stores, the going rate is 
$75 to $80. For plus sizes, figure a bit more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Regine label is also very evident, and the price on these pieces is $59, 
not the $90 other stores charge. Matching Mommy & Me dresses from a well-known 
label generally command about $300; Steinberg & Urbaitel charge $98. 
</P>
<P>
 Lace stretch tops are hot these days, and Tres Chique II has them in about 30 
colors for $18. Slinky acetate & Lycra separates are a fashion trend; you can 
buy the two pieces for $49.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Every age goes for the wonderful, appliqued Fader T-shirts for $30 to $35 
instead of the regular price of $48. A great collection of vests is priced at 
$39 (retail $78). Sage is the predominant label. 
</P>
<P>
 A big plus at Tres Chique is their costume jewelry, on consignment from 
Shirley Wilson, who always looks for unusual pieces, antique and new. Original 
costume jewelry from the early 1900s is well priced, with brooches from $35 to 
$50. An Austrian crystal necklace, a replica of a Victorian piece, is $38. 
Lovely pins, reproductions handmade in France, are an affordable $36. The 
jewelry is a wonderful complement to the romantic mood of the apparel. And Tres 
Chique is a welcome addition to the alley. WHERE TO SHOP

GOPHER VS. NUT; IT TOOK JUICY FRUIT, HAIR AND HOWARD STERN, BUT THE CRITTER 
DINING IN THE GARDEN IS FINALLY OUT-SKUNKED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HAMMERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Maryann Hammers is a regular 
contributor to The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 My landscaper was the first to spot the evidence. "You have a gopher," he 
said, pointing to a mound of pulverized dirt in my newly planted gar den. 
"We'll have to destroy it." 
</P>
<P>
 I was horrified. "But they're so -- cute!" I protested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or else," he continued, "it'll eat all your plants, and the next time it 
rains, your hillside will end up in your living room." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I didn't want that to happen. But I couldn't kill it. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's where I'm coming from: 
</P>
<P>
 I've spent entire afternoons at the beach saving drowning ladybugs who take 
inexplicable suicide dives into the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 I once postponed a vacation to rescue an injured pigeon and deliver it to a 
veterinarian. 
</P>
<P>
 I go to grunion runs to compete with the hordes of bucket-wielding 
fish-snatchers -- except I toss the little silver swimmers to sea and cheer 
when they disappear into the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 I could go on, but you get the idea. I have to protect my reputation as a nut. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the gopher is just doing what comes naturally. He gets hungry; he 
eats. But he's breakfasting on my prized bougainvillea, so I had to figure out 
a polite way to encourage him to dine elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 I phoned the county Animal Control Department. "Do you relocate gophers?" I 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people just pour poison down their holes," said the woman who answered.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, hold on a second. I'll ask around." She put the phone down. I heard 
laughter in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, I have two solutions," she said when she returned. I grabbed a paper and 
pen. "No. 1. Put chewing gum down the hole. Juicy Fruit." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gum," I wrote. "Juicy Fruit."  
</P>
<P>
 "They eat the gum and die," she explained.  
</P>
<P>
 I crossed "gum" off my list. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 2," she said. "Ex-Lax."  
</P>
<P>
 I pondered the possibilities and decided to pass on the Ex-Lax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't there a way I can catch them -- nicely?" I asked.  
</P>
<P>
 "Try a feed store," she said. "They might have humane traps." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the feed store -- I'll call him Jed Clampett -- was a burly guy 
with a stubbly beard and broad-brimmed cowboy hat. Guffawing at my request, he 
stuck his thumbs through the red suspenders that hitched his dungarees over his 
belly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little lady," he said, still chuckling, "you can't catch gophers. They live 
underground! How you gonna get the varmint to come up and stroll into the 
trap?" 
</P>
<P>
 I gave Jed a withering glance. "To you, it's a varmint. To me, it's Alvin and 
the Chipmunks' cousin." 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, I drove to another store. I was relieved to see the clerk here was 
a sweet-looking young woman. Her flaxen hair was tied behind her head with a 
big bow -- like a halo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to catch a gopher," I said.  
</P>
<P>
 Beckoning me to follow, Angel-Face floated down the aisle. She pointed to a 
shelf stocked with skull-and-crossbones-labeled poisons, asphyxiating gases and 
steel traps that squash animals to extinction.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't want to kill it," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 She flashed a beautiful smile. "Then say 'bye bye' to your garden," she said 
winsomely. 
</P>
<P>
 I began asking everyone I encountered -- from supermarket checkers to 
apartment-dwelling friends -- if they had heard of any good rodent remedies 
lately. American ingenuity is a wonderful thing: In no time, I had accumulated 
a repertoire of guaranteed gopher getters: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Hair. Thinking it's his murdered kin, the gopher takes off in search of 
safer ground. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Irish Spring, shredded on a cheese grater. Apparently gophers don't want to 
smell like a fresh spring day. 
</P>
<P>
 3. A transistor radio, turned full blast. Gophers don't like Howard Stern any 
more than I do. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Tampons soaked in ammonia. Why ask why? 
</P>
<P>
 It became my daily routine: First I would survey the yard and mourn over the 
latest toppled plant with munched-off roots. Then I would gather scissors (to 
cut a lock of hair), fresh batteries, ammonia, soap, cheese grater and tampons. 
Finally, I would trek up the hillside and stick my arsenal down the newest 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went. Another day, another daisy. 
</P>
<P>
 I began to suspect the "friends" who came up with these stupid gopher tricks 
were diabolically sniggering at my gullibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, my neighbor -- whose yard was also pocketed with holes -- regularly 
trudged up his own hillside, muttering, "This is war!" He carried a long metal 
rod, which he used as a probe to locate gopher tunnels and insert poison. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyeing each other suspiciously, we climbed our adjoining slopes -- he, with 
his venomous dagger; I, with my cheese grater. He finally broke the ice. "I'll 
be glad to come over and poison your yard for you," he offered.  
</P>
<P>
 "No thank you," I replied haughtily. "I'm doing fine with hair and tampons." 
</P>
<P>
 Once or twice I saw the gopher, peeking from his hole, contemplating new 
destruction. He was kind of cute. I considered simply turning my yard over to 
him and making him a mascot, but I knew my homeowners association wouldn't go 
for it.  
</P>
<P>
 Then I learned about an herb called "gopher purge" that supposedly repels 
burrowing rodents. I bought a dozen spindly stalks, planting them near every 
hole I could find. After about a week, there were no new mounds or holes. The 
gopher was gone! 
</P>
<P>
 But my elation was short-lived, immediately replaced with worry. What if I 
tormented the gopher so much that he moved next door, where poison awaits him 
for dinner? I scanned my neighbor's yard -- and spotted a fresh hole. 
</P>
<P>
 I gotta get that gopher back here.

RECYCLING GOES TO MOVIES; FILM STUDIOS HAVE BEGUN A PUSH TO REUSE LUMBER. 
OFFICIALS HOPE OTHER INDUSTRIES WILL FOLLOW. 
</P>

 With a materials budget of about $125 per semester, Leonard Friedman, wood 
construction teacher at Grant High School, appreciates the value of a 2-by-4. 
"Our budget, and it keeps on getting cut, doesn't go very far when a sheet of 
sandpaper costs 50 cents," Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to a recent push to recycle lumber at movie studios, Friedman said, 
his 35 students can continue to build such required shop projects as entire 
bedrooms, offices and kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank-based Warner Bros. studios began carting the first of 20 tons of 
usable, cast-off lumber to Grant High School in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wood recycling among Hollywood studios has become a very political issue," 
said Shelley Levin Billik, Warner Bros.' recycling and environmental resources 
administrator. "With the studios' visibility, we can set examples for other 
companies." Warner Bros.' "Wood to the Schools" program delivers wood only to 
Grant High School in Van Nuys, although other area schools are invited to 
peruse the drop-off site for materials. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1991, Hollywood studios got serious about wood recycling when a 
solid-waste task force was formed by the Alliance of Motion Picture and 
Television Producers. Studios began hiring recycling consultants and sending 
them to the task force's monthly meetings to compare notes on how to reduce 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "We quickly discovered that about 40% of studio waste was wood," said Leigh 
Volkland, the alliance's vice president of public affairs. "So we naturally 
focused on that." 
</P>
<P>
 About 5% of the city of Los Angeles' 420,000 tons of wood waste produced each 
year is generated by the entertainment industry, according to the city's 
Integrated Solid Waste Management Office of the Board of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 The rush to recycle wood, however, was not entirely altruistic. All city 
municipalities are required by Assembly Bill 939 to reduce waste streams by 25% 
by 1995 and by 50% by 2000. Los Angeles negotiated agreements with major 
studios in 1991 to comply with the mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Warner Bros.' lumber reuse program was launched in 1991, the studio 
annually recovered about 600 tons of wood, but most of it was incinerated, a 
disposal method that ranks barely above using landfills, say environmentalists. 
One year later, Warner more than doubled its wood recovery rate and began 
donating 30% of its wood waste, up from 1% the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Other San Fernando Valley studios, including the Walt Disney Co. and Universal 
Pictures, have similar wood-recycling programs to help divert the 41,000 tons 
of solid waste generated by major studios each year. Disney recycles about 30% 
of its total waste stream, and Universal recycles about 25% of its cast-offs. 
Many studios now reuse sets for different projects instead of tossing the wood, 
and wood scaffolding has largely been replaced by aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
 Most studios use the services of wood recycling firms, such as El Monte-based 
Re-Sets, which picks up wood and sells most of it to pallet manufacturers. 
About 20% of the lumber is donated to civic groups, such as Habitat for 
Humanity. Since its wood retrieval effort began nearly three years ago, Re-Sets 
has recovered 10,000 tons of lumber from the studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwindling rain forests and pressure by environmental groups spurred the 
studios to also experiment with wood substitutes. Before 1991, most set walls 
were constructed of luan tropical hardwood that was routinely tossed into 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 Luan, a rain-forest product prized by studios as a cheap all-purpose wood that 
was light, flexible and smooth, replaced such heavier materials as Masonite and 
gypsum board in the early 197Os. 
</P>
<P>
 Luan is now rarely used by studios, partly because of pressure applied by 
environmentally minded actors and activists and also because the cost of luan 
has risen as logging restrictions and export charges have increased. Warner 
Bros. and Universal have eliminated use of the tropical wood, and Disney has 
slashed its luan use by 95%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This all started with just a few individuals being aware of the need to 
recycle in their own departments," Billik said. "Other companies are taking 
notice, and with the kind of volumes we buy, we can send loud messages to the 
marketplace to set a standard for recycled products."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CAST IN MUGHLAI MOLD; KHARA INDIAN OVEN SERVES FAMILIAR 
NORTH INDIAN FARE. ONE SAVING GRACE IS THE GENEROUS LUNCH BUFFET. 
</P>

<P>
 Mughlai cuisine is the name of the hearty, meat-rich cookery that predominates 
in northern India. Nearly all the Indian restaurants in our area cook in this 
style, which derives from the court cuisine of the Mogul emperors. 
</P>
<P>
 (In this style ? What am I saying? It gets to be more than a similar style -- 
something closer to a uniformity. A lot of our Indian restaurants cook so much 
alike you wonder what's the point of going to one rather than another.) 
</P>
<P>
 Khara Indian Oven, a new Punjabi-owned and -operated restaurant in Woodland 
Hills, is cast in this mold. It's in a large strip mall space that most 
recently housed Pompeii, an Italian restaurant. Before that it was a place 
called Russian House. 
</P>
<P>
 You could call this dining room comfortable, though the leather on the bar is 
worn and rough, a veteran of the restaurant wars. Indian artifacts and 
tapestries add proper mood, even if the new owners keep this place nearly as 
dark as the Russians did when they were in residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Punjab-born owner Arjan Singh Khara hails from the city of Amritsar, the 
spiritual center of India's Sikhs and home of their celebrated Golden Temple. 
Khara was food service manager at the Sikh temple in Hollywood for seven years. 
This is his first restaurant venture. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the inexperience shows. The staff is hearty and friendly, but it's 
hard to be quite so positive about what the kitchen does. The menu is virtually 
the same as those at Anarkali, India's Tandoori, Taste of India and other 
Indian restaurants in the vicinity. (If you really crave something different, 
head for Paru's in Northridge, which serves exotic south Indian meatless 
cuisine.) In other words, Khara serves familiar north Indian fare, cautious 
with the spices.  
</P>
<P>
 One saving grace at Khara Indian Oven is the lunch buffet. Many Indian 
restaurants have such buffets, and this one is incredibly generous at a mere 
$4.95. For that you get five vegetable dishes, salad, an appetizer called onion 
bhaji , tandoori chicken, a curry dish, hot naan bread from the tandoor and a 
fine, fluffy rice pilaf. The bhaji is particularly good. This round, puffy 
Indian cousin of the onion loaf you get at Tony Roma's consists of shredded 
onions covered with a thin, spicy batter of garbanzo flour and deep-fried to 
crispness. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner, I'd begin with one of the appetizers cooked in the restaurant's 
tandoor oven. Ginger kebab turns out to be chicken marinated in yogurt and 
ginger, served with a refreshing mint sauce. I like the restaurant's seekh 
kebab as well. It's like a minced lamb sausage roasted on a skewer, crumbly 
textured and pungent with onion and garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass on fish tikka , though; these skewered chunks of garlic- and 
herb-marinated mahi-mahi come from the tandoor with a tired texture. Lamb tikka 
might be even harder to swallow. Our lamb was tough and tasted pretty tired 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrees are mostly based on chicken or lamb, with a few seafoods thrown in 
for good measure. Lamb karahi is a good, if rather buttery, dish of spiced 
cubed lamb cooked in the Indian utensil called karahi , a sort of iron wok. By 
rights, chicken vindaloo should be chicken and potatoes stewed in a 
blistering-hot sauce, but even though we requested ours extra hot, the kitchen 
made it mild. 
</P>
<P>
 Chana masala is the best of the vegetable dishes -- fat, mildly spiced 
garbanzo beans in a fragrant, seductively heavy brown sauce. There are also 
passable spinach, eggplant and lentil dishes, but they lack strong flavors and 
they're spiced almost identically. This kitchen flavors most vegetables (meats, 
too) with thick, pureed sauces apparently based on a single masala (spice 
mixture) dominated by ginger, clove and cumin. It's a nice masala , but after 
just one or two of these dishes, the palate wearies. 
</P>
<P>
 The breads are unfailingly delicious, however, and you could making a meal of 
them with the restaurant's savory, carrot chutney. A simple paratha (flaky 
unleavened whole wheat bread) becomes a sophisticated treat when eaten with a 
spoonful of dark green mint chutney. Keema paratha is a hot bread, fresh from 
the tandoor, stuffed with spiced ground lamb and rubbed with butter. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even "pizza," made with a puffy naan- type crust in a pizza oven 
bought by Khara specifically for his restaurant. The kitchen will throw one 
together with cheese, chicken, lamb, even pepperoni, and embellish it with 
vegetable toppings such as onions, peppers and olives. 
</P>
<P>
 They could have named the restaurant Pompeii Indian Oven, after the last 
tenant. But then, who'd believe it? WHERE AND WHEN

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; CHRISTENSEN SAYS KNEE IS ALL RIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUTSKEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone asks James Christensen the same questions, and he can deal with them 
more easily now because of the answers. Yes, he says, his knee is all right.No, 
he says, there is no pain. Yes, he says, he is ready to go 100% all game long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not even worried about it," said Christensen of the knee injury that 
ended his 1993 season in the second game, against Nebraska. The injury was 
aggravated in spring practice, retarding recovering, but that's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not thinking about my injury at all," he said. "I've got two more seasons 
to play, and now I'm basically with my class. We've got three or four starters 
in the offensive line from my class." 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen was ahead of his class playing center when he was injured. He had 
not taken a redshirt season, unusual these days for an offensive lineman, and 
was entrenched in a position with a future. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the knee was sprained so severely that it took the rest of the season to 
recover, and when he did recover he found that Mike Flanagan had done such a 
good job that Christensen's services at center were no longer needed. 
</P>
<P>
 At left guard, though . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I had heard they were thinking about changing me," he said. "I just want to 
settle into a position, and I realized that we lost Vaughn (Parker) and Craig 
(Novitsky) to graduation and Mike was doing a good job at center. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made sense to move me to guard." EARL GUTSKEY

 Girls' Rompers Recalled Due to Hazardous Ornaments: The Consumer Product 
Safety Commission said that necklaces attached to three styles of the garments 
could cause strangulation.The necklaces, about 26 inches long with a small 
stuffed doll hanging from the end, could become snagged or twisted around a 
child's neck, the commission said. Best Wear Inc. of Los Angeles is recalling 
style numbers 84P1580 and 84P1581, labeled "Baby's 2 PCS Romper-Doll," and 
84P1065, "Baby's 3 PCS Blouse-Romper-Doll." About 1,200 of them were sold in 
Los Angeles-area stores in April. The commission advised that the necklaces be 
removed and the rompers returned for refunds.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; NEW INFLATION FEARS JOLT INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Renewed inflation fears and a weakened dollar sent bond yields soaring and 
stock prices lower Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's bellwether long bond rose to 7.48% from 7.40% on 
Wednesday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, dropped 1 1/32 
point, or $10.31 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggering the rise in long-term interest rates and the stock markets selloff 
was a Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank report on regional manufacturing 
conditions that resurrected worries of inflationary growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But particularly troubling to the financial markets was a sharp jump in the 
Philadelphia Fed's prices-paid index, from 26.4 in July to 48.4 this month. 
That was the highest reading in more than five years. Analysts said that 
figure, taken with other indicators in the report, could signal that prices are 
rising despite slow growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia survey stoked fears that the Federal Reserve's 0.5% increase 
in short-term interest rates last Tuesday will not be enough to curb inflation. 
Some analysts concluded that the central bank will have to tighten credit 
again, possibly as soon as its September Open Market Committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 While the regional Fed survey covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey 
and Delaware, many economists consider it a harbinger of broader economic 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead Briggs, head of risk trading at Deutsche Bank Government Securities, said 
the report was a catalyst for Wall Street traders to sell stocks and bonds 
purchased two days earlier, following the Fed's rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 With investors afraid of inflation eroding the value of fixed-income 
securities, the traders shed hopes that new buyers would emerge to snap up the 
bonds they bought at prices heightened in Tuesday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of active professional traders bought up the market, anticipating that 
small investors would buy because there would be no Fed action for three 
months. But they got a party all together and nobody came," Briggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term Treasury securities fell from 3/32 point to 5/32 point 
and intermediate maturities fell from 9/32 point to 19/32 point, the Telerate 
Inc. financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, foreign investors were discouraged by a plunge in the dollar 
against the Japanese yen, which reduced the value of dollar-denominated 
investments such as U.S. government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar plunged nearly 2 Japanese yen to 98.58 from 100.18 
late Wednesday. It was the dollar's lowest rate against the yen since July 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also slipped against the German mark, closing at 1.543 marks, down 
from 1.552. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.05 points to 3,755.43 
on Big Board volume of 293.67 million shares, down from Wednesday's 312.84 
million. In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancers by 
nearly 13 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The expectation of higher interest rates sent economically sensitive stocks 
lower, particularly issues of the Big Three auto makers. Ford fell 1 1/8 to 29 
1/2, Chrysler slid 1 1/8 to 47 1/4 and General Motors lost 1 1/8 to 49 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mining stocks rose as gold surged. Echo Bay rose 1/8 to 11 1/8, and Pegasus 
Gold advanced 3/4 to 14 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology issues held firm for most of the day after IBM rose sharply, but 
gave up steam near the close. The Nasdaq composite, which is heavily weighted 
in technology issues, ended 0.49 points lower at 742.17. 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM rose 1 3/8 to 66 1/4. Merrill Lynch analyst Daniel Mandresh raised his 
estimate of IBM's 1994 earnings from $4 a share to between $4 and $4.50 and 
left and "above average buy" recommendation on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * But computer stocks ended mixed. Digital rose 5/8 to 21 3/4, and 
Hewlett-Packard advanced 1/4 to 87 3/8. But Microsoft, which was up as much as 
3/8 earlier in the day, finished 3/8 weaker at 55 1/2. Apple fell 1/4 to 34 
3/4, Cisco Systems was down 1/2 at 23 1/2, and Dell Computer was down 1 1/8 at 
34 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, overseas markets were mixed. Tokyo stocks advanced, with the 
225-share Nikkei average up 38.21 points at 20,862.77. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX 
average closed down 8.73 points at 2,153.56 and London's Financial Times 
100-share average dropped 7.7 points, closing at 3,182.6. Mexico City's Bolsa 
index closed down 1.41 points at 2,698.24.

AROUND TOWN: TWO CULTURES AND ONE LANGUAGE: RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Grandpa Harvey seemed to surprise even himself, stepping lively to the strains 
of the Mexican hat dance. Other feet tapped on wheelchair footrests as Elvis 
imitator Jesus, 6, belted out "Hound Dog." 
</P>
<P>
 For a few enchanted hours, the generation gap was being narrowed, if not 
closed, the barriers of language and color broken down. Latino children from 
East L.A. had come out to play with elderly residents of the Hollenbeck Home. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a picnic with a purpose. Hollenbeck Home is in East L.A., but not of 
it. The home dates from the 1890s, when neighborhood kids were William and 
Mildred, not Manuel and Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollenbeck's residents -- most of them white and reasonably well-off -- live 
in a green 10-acre oasis a world apart from the raw urban poverty around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling approvingly at the goings-on, 99-year-old resident Mildred Hutchinson 
said: "It's good for them to know what this community is like. The people who 
live here never knew this part of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The picnic was a first for Hands Across the Generations, a project of the 
nonprofit National Family Center, which seeks to strengthen family life. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a flowery way of saying that young and old came together to eat hot 
dogs and watermelon, laugh and dance and play games. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, some of the 18 residents who ventured out preferred to watch, but others 
plunged right in. Helen Elbert, 88, was playing a flash-card game with Daniel 
Romero, 3, relishing her role of surrogate grandmother for a day. (Later, she'd 
be spotted pushing a chair in the wheelchair parade.) 
</P>
<P>
 Elbert has no grandchildren of her own: "My children all died shortly after 
they were born." 
</P>
<P>
 At a long table, seniors and youngsters worked side by side, making works of 
art from a sticky flour-and-water mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefery Lopez, 9, had Grandma Lila Hinman, 73, in tow. They'd made a love 
connection at a planning session at Hollenbeck a month before. "I don't know 
how long I'll be able to hold up as grandma," said Hinman, laughing. "It's a 
little bit more than I bargained for." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefery's family has taken her to its heart, to the movies and to the Sizzler. 
There's mother Natividad, 39, five children, seven grandchildren. Said Hinman, 
who never had children: "I didn't plan on being a great-grandmother, too. I 
didn't know she had those!" 
</P>
<P>
 "She feels bad because she doesn't have money to give us presents," Jefery 
said, "but I don't want presents. I want her to be my grandma," a stand-in for 
his real grandmother, who's in El Salvador. "I can only visit her every year. I 
can visit Grandma Lila every Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 As the temperature soared, the picnic was moved into a rec room, where the 
sounds of children at play bounced off the walls. The very thought of all that 
noise had scared some seniors away, observed Dennis Hiebert, Hollenbeck 
activities director. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30 kids were from Plaza Community Center, where low-income working Latino 
families, many headed by single mothers, get free or sliding-scale day care, as 
well as programs in prevention and treatment of child abuse and neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents jumped at the idea of the picnic, said Manuel Garcia, center 
program director. Many are immigrants and "they've left their families behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was directing everyone to form a circle of chairs. "Co mo se lla mas tu 
?" he asked, moving around the circle. They answered: Harold. Hazel. Gabriel. 
Diego. Name tags identified residents -- even those who are not real-life 
grandparents -- as "grandma" and "grandpa." 
</P>
<P>
 Out came the maracas, which speak a universal language. Shaking his maraca, 
Grandpa Harvey Hallum, 71, reckoned that this was nice, but he doesn't see 
himself taking on grandchildren: "I wouldn't know what to do with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Waltz time. To the strains of "Let Me Call You Sweetheart," Hiebert pushed and 
twirled Grandma Beverly Clines, 87, around the floor in her wheelchair, 
executing deep dips. The seniors sang along; the children watched, wide-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of connections were made here," Garcia said at day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very nice children . . . so well-mannered . . . so affectionate," Grandma 
Beverly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandma Mildred was thrilled to see so much life at Hollenbeck: "It's such a 
quiet, sedate place." 
</P>
<P>
 As a rule, Hiebert limits activities to an hour. The picnic lasted three -- 
and no one left early. "These people had fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vivian Feintech, National Family Center president, was already making plans to 
keep the connection going. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, Hiebert said, "It'll be the buzz of the place for a while." Shark in 
Gown 
</P>
<P>
 Don't let the black evening gown fool you: The lady is a pool shark. 
</P>
<P>
 We're at Gotham Hall in Santa Monica, where two top women pros are cue to cue 
in a nine-ball championship match. The winner will take home $20,000, thanks to 
Gordon's (the gin and vodka people). 
</P>
<P>
 History is being made: This is the biggest single payday ever on the women's 
circuit, the kind of money the men make. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the runners-up, dancing past the cameras, smiling, exchanging 
high-fives. There's Loree Jon (No. 1 in the world), Nikki, Vivian, Jeanette, 
Belinda, Mary, Vicki, Rose. They take seats ringside, a black-gowned cheering 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Emcee Sam Lagana is warming up the crowd for Prime Ticket, flinging free 
T-shirts, reminding everyone to hoot and holler. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the main event. The brunette from Garden Grove is Robin Bell, 38. Women's 
Professional Billiard Assn. world ranking: third. The blonde from Charlotte, 
N.C. is Ewa Mataya, 30. World ranking: eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 The action: Mataya shoots first. She's flawless for two straight games. Bell 
keeps her cool. Third game, third ball: Mataya misses. 
</P>
<P>
 For an hour, it seesaws. Bell grimaces as she pockets the cue ball. Mataya 
takes over. "Nice 'n' easy, girl," coaxes a man at the bar. Mataya bends, 
squints, misses. Bell bends, squints, misses. 
</P>
<P>
 Mataya miscues, a costly error. Bell takes over, tying things up. Suddenly, 
it's Bell 4, Mataya 3. The leader mops her neck with a towel and breathes 
deeply. Her opponent is fading: 6-3, Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridging her cue with manicured fingers, Bell makes the break, then circles 
the table, checking angles. "Take your time, girl!" yells the kibitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, only the yellow-striped nine ball stands between Bell and $20,000. A 
perfect hit! The crowd roars. She and Mataya hug, like winner and runner-up for 
Miss America. Mataya packs up her cues as Bell signs autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who needs baseball when you've got this?" beams Lagana. 
</P>
<P>
 On to the next city. For the 50 regular touring pros, it's all in a weekend's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 For hundreds of years, women have played pool. But only now are they making 
big bucks at it. Last year Bell earned $80,000 and, she says, "I go away one 
weekend a month." Three sons help her spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 This two-time world champ sort of backed into her career. As a preteen, she'd 
drop by Westminster Family Billiard Center to play pinball: "The boys were 
playing pool and I thought they might notice me." They didn't -- until she 
joined in. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, is all this huggy-kissy stuff for real? Was Mataya, who got $7,000, all 
that happy for her? And the other eight, who had to share $23,000? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes, Bell says. It's a sorority. You can't talk jump shots and spot shots 
to outsiders -- they "don't really get it."

TECHNOWATCH: WAY BEYOND DAD'S WATCH

<P>
 Dick Tracy has nothing on Seiko's new MessageWatch, a combination watch and 
pager that also gives you weather reports, Dow Jones closing prices, winning 
lottery numbers, sports scores and ski conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 As a watch, this gadget automatically sets its time 36 times a day to the U.S. 
Bureau of Standards' atomic clock in Colorado, adjusts automatically to 
different time zones, daylight-saving time and leap year, and has a light and 
an alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 With its pager function, callers can leave telephone numbers up to 16 digits, 
"Call Home" or "Call Office" messages or a coded (0 to 9) message that can be 
set up in advance. For example, you could tell your child to send a Code 3 
message to let you know he's home from school. MessageWatch also can alert its 
wearer to voice-mail and electronic-mail messages as they occur. 
</P>
<P>
 MessageWatch has a two-line screen and receives electronic signals over the FM 
airwaves rather than a cellular network, so there are hundreds of possibilities 
of data it can ultimately receive. For unlimited message capacity on 
MessageWatch, you pay $12.50 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The watch/pager/data receiver operates on a standard lithium battery that will 
last an average of 18 months with continuous use, Seiko reps say. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the road, Seiko says MessageWatch will be able to relay traffic reports 
or financial information, such as the balance in your checking account. 
</P>
<P>
 Already on the market in Seattle and Portland, Ore., MessageWatch will roll 
out in Los Angeles and several other cities in the fall, selling in major 
retail chains and consumer electronics stores. MessageWatch models cost from 
$79.95 to $199. If you can't find MessageWatch in your area, call Seiko's 
toll-free number, (800) 456-5600. Sharp Creates 10.6 Ounces of Fun 
</P>
<P>
 After introducing the "world's smallest and lightest" portable MiniDisc (MD) 
player last year, Sharp has just come out with a new pocket-size MD 
recorder/player. 
</P>
<P>
 Weighing just 10.6 ounces, the Sharp MD-M11 recorder ($799) can be used at 
home, work, outdoors or on the road. It also features a multi-editing function 
that allows users to create personalized MiniDiscs, and has a rechargeable 
lithium battery that permits 2 1/2 hours of continuous playback or about two 
hours of recording per charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Digital and analog input/output jacks let you connect the MD-M11 to your other 
audio equipment. It includes overhead-type dynamic headphones. To find a store 
in your area that carries the MD-M11, call (800) BE-SHARP. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of compact discs, there's a clever new carrying/storage case for CDs 
called Clik!Case. There are two models, storing 12 or 24 CDs (without their 
cases) in hinged trays that flip up or down so any disc can easily be selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of a bronze award in this year's Industrial Designers Society of 
America's Industrial Design Awards competition, Clik!Case is made of molded 
plastic with a snap lock to keep CDs in place. The Clik!Case CD 12 is small 
enough to fit into a purse, backpack or briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufactured by Outer Circle Products Ltd. in Chicago, Clik!Cases are 
available (CD 12 size, $10; CD 24, $15) nationwide at Wal-Mart, and selected 
Longs Drugs. If you can't find them in your area, call (800) 722-2545. LYNN

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; OF POMPOUS WASHINGTONIANS, SPIES AND GETTING THE GIRL; 
NIGHT OF THE AVENGING BLOWFISH BY JOHN WELTER , ALGONQUIN BOOKS $10.95, 304 
PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN STABINER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Welter writes a humor column for a North Carolina newspaper, which is 
what's best and worst about this endearingly weird novel. He's very good at 
what he does, which is being funny, but his event is the sprint. Problems arise 
when he has to run a half-marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Welter's hero, Doyle Coldiron, is a disaffected member of the Secret Service, 
wasting his lonely life preparing for crises that may never take place. His job 
description demands that he be the perfect gent -- which is to say, he never 
divulges anything about himself. But it's beginning to grate. Doyle wants a 
woman. Specifically, he wants Natelle, who inconveniently happens to be married 
to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 So Doyle fritters his time away planning a spook baseball game with the CIA 
and trolling for women with whom he isn't supposed to discuss anything 
meaningful. One day he wanders into the White House kitchen, where Abbas the 
chef is plotting revenge on the President for a recent insulting comment about 
White House food. This night, he's going to serve the President and his 
important guests cat-food canapes and Spam in lemon sauce -- and Doyle ignores 
the little voice of conscience that tells him to turn Abbas in. Spam isn't a 
weapon; the Secret Service doesn't have to protect the President from pressed 
luncheon meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is how Doyle ends up in Secret Service hell, protecting the diminutive 
ambassador from Indizal. And how he ends up eventually being a hero. And how, 
because of his personal heroism and a bunch of other things he never even knew 
about, he ends up getting the girl. (I'm not giving away a surprise. It's clear 
he's going to get her early on; the funny stuff comes from the process of 
acquisition.) 
</P>
<P>
 The first chapters of this clever book are not unlike good humor columns: 
They're disciplined, self-contained, philosophical and surprising; there's lots 
of funny stuff. Welter is particularly fond of nonsense collisions -- as in, 
the Secret Service prefers married men because the desire to return home to 
wife and children makes them sensible and careful in their work, but it prefers 
unmarried men because they have nothing to lose. Doyle is as full of 
well-articulated love and affection as a man can be, but it's all aimed at the 
one women he can't confess it to. The spooks want to play baseball, but they 
can't divulge, even to each other, the location of their covert athletic 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a lovely cadence to Welter's writing; after awhile you can sense the 
rhythm. But with familiarity comes repetition, and that's where Welter gets 
into trouble. We can't read Natelle's name, it seems, without being reminded of 
how much Doyle would like to spill the beans and how hard he's trying not to. 
We can't meet Doltmeer, his boss, without being reminded of -- yep -- what a 
dolt he is. Welter is a bit like the funniest guy in the crowd, who's always 
expected to entertain at parties: He might have something more substantial to 
say, but the audience is waiting for more of what works. 
</P>
<P>
 And in this case he does have bigger ideas. He sneaks enough of them in to 
make the reader wish for more, for a bigger, broader story that takes even more 
chances. He has a nicely irreverent eye for Washington pomposity, and for the 
oddball collection of characters who exist at the fringe of that world. 
</P>
<P>
 His characters are sharp and idiosyncratic -- and Doyle turns out to be much 
more than just another cynical, smart guy. Welter writes about Doyle's feelings 
for Natelle with lyric delight, and about his own rising anxiety with 
refreshing frankness. A guy who yearns for emotional commitment and admits that 
life is meaningless without it? Talk about modern fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 So let's hope that Welter writes another one that takes him just a bit further 
from his roots. He's the kind of writer -- and thinker -- you want to hear more 
from.

INK: CLARENCE THOMAS STORY TOLD TWICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; He is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fall publishing season is already shaping up as a dueling ground between 
Marlon Brando's autobiography (Random House) and the unauthorized biography of 
him by Peter Manso (Hyperion). 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, two books about the battle to seat Clarence Thomas on the 
U.S. Supreme Court three years ago also will vie for readers' attention with 
contrasting accounts of what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Resurrection," Sen. John C. Danforth, the Missouri Republican who was the 
jurist's staunchest defender during the confirmation struggle, alleges that law 
Professor Anita Hill lied to the Senate Judiciary Committee and that her 
charges of sexual harassment by Thomas were hatched to scuttle the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a review in Publishers Weekly, Danforth "describes Thomas during 
the confirmation process as a 'lost soul,' sobbing, writhing in agony on the 
floor, lying in bed in a fetal position, but ultimately pulling himself 
together through prayer, Bible reading and the support of friends and his wife, 
Ginni." 
</P>
<P>
 The Danforth book will be published by Viking in October, one month before 
Houghton Mifflin is scheduled to bring out "Strange Justice: The Selling of 
Clarence Thomas," by Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, reporters with the Wall 
Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 The publisher's fall catalogue says "Strange Justice" will lay out Thomas' 
"10-year campaign for the high court and the doubts about him that haunted the 
White House from the start," as well as how President George Bush "used the 
vast powers of his office to achieve a partisan victory, no matter what the 
cost to the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally scheduled for release in October, "Strange Justice" has been pushed 
back to Nov. 2 apparently to bolster marketing plans for what the publisher 
sees as a headline-making read. The Wall Street Journal will run a first-serial 
excerpt. First printing: a healthy 75,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Resurrection" was delayed until October because that's when the Senate is 
expected to adjourn, making Danforth available for what Viking describes as a 
big book tour. The publisher has announced a print run of 50,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama over the Thomas nomination previously was explored in "Capitol 
Games: Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill, and the Story of a Supreme Court 
Nomination" (Hyperion, 1992), written by Helen Winternitz and Timothy M. 
Phelps, and David Brock's "The Real Anita Hill" (Free Press), which was a 
national bestseller last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Resurrection" was first acquired by Free Press, which specializes in 
contemporary affairs, but Danforth followed Publisher Erwin A. Glikes when the 
latter moved to Viking's parent company, Penguin USA, to start a similar 
imprint. Glikes died unexpectedly in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill is writing her autobiography for Doubleday.

 Fitness Mag for Gay Readers: Urban Fitness is a new book that should not 
necessarily be judged by its cover, which shows a man jogging on a beach 
alongside the line, "Looking Good, Feeling Great, with our custom workout 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Is Urban Fitness honing in on Men's Health turf? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes and no, for Urban Fitness is targeting the gay and lesbian market. Turn 
the cover and there's a two-page ad for Mazda that shows a beautiful car -- and 
two beautiful women embracing in its shine. An ad seeking recruits for the Los 
Angeles Police Department shows a man in scuba gear and says, "Not All Our 
Officers Wear the Same Uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 The 136-page September/October premiere issue contains pieces on women who 
bike, in-line skating, the designer drug Ecstasy and a workout regimen designed 
to tone up pecs and the ticker. Travel and fashion, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban Fitness, a bimonthly, is based in Seattle. The number for subscriptions 
is (800) 460-0602.

 Gathered 'Round the Computer: Family PC has nothing to do with being 
politically correct. It's a new magazine for parents wanting to incorporate the 
personal computer into family life and represents the joint publishing savvy of 
the Walt Disney Co. (FamilyFun and Disney Adventures) and Ziff-Davis (PC 
Magazine). It expands on the kind of computer-befriending articles that Family 
Life also does well. 
</P>
<P>
 A back-to-school section sizes up ways that the family PC can assist young 
scholars. The September/October premiere issue also family-tests all sorts of 
hardware, giving top marks to the new Macintosh Performa 578. For 
subscriptions: (800) 413-9749.

 War on Film and in Reality: Two decades after the fall of Saigon, enough 
Vietnam-inspired celluloid has played on American screens to endow an entire 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lee Lanning's "Vietnam at the Movies," newly published in trade 
paperback by Fawcett Columbine, rates and catalogues nearly 400 flicks, from 
"Apocalypse Now" to the lesser-known "Getting Straight," the protest-on-campus 
film (1970) that starred Elliott Gould as a world-weary grad student and 
offered early performances by Candice Bergen and Harrison Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanning, who retired as a lieutenant colonel after 20 years in the Army, has 
authored other books on the Vietnam experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of War: Vintage Books has published an unusual paperback that is no 
less compelling for its dry text. "The Laws of War" lays out the international 
agreements that govern armed conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Although noting that "all is not fair in love and war," editors Chris T. 
Antoniou and W. Michael Reisman put the various accords signed at The Hague, 
Geneva and elsewhere in modern context via references to Operation Desert 
Storm, the Bosnian mess and other hostilities.

CLUB REVIEW; BAKERY LOOKS GOOD, BUT SOUND NEEDS WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "We were still washing the windows this morning, but just look at us now," 
said Ruth Price, artistic director of the Jazz Bakery, as she happily surveyed 
the opening of L.A.'s newest jazz venue Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was no arguing that the bright banners, large performance area and 
friendly, gallery-style entryway, complete with full service refreshments, have 
made the Bakery -- now in an expanded location a block away from its former 
site -- into a warm and appealing place. The colorful lobby, whose vivid hues 
were drawn from Mondrian's "Jazz," included an intriguing collection of jazz 
photographs. Plenty of free parking was available directly outside the Bakery 
as well as in an adjoining, guarded indoor parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still working on refining the sound," Price added, "but at least the 
air conditioner's working." In a preview performance on Tuesday, the automatic 
air conditioning, with great precision, had switched off at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The air was cool and comfortable for the room's official debut act, the Buddy 
DeFranco/Terry Gibbs quintet. Although the sight lines in the 215-seat 
listening area were peerless, Price was correct about the audio, which clearly 
will continue to require adjustments for the next few weeks. DeFranco's 
clarinet and Gibbs' vibes came across just fine, but the rhythm section -- 
especially Andy Simpkins' bass -- produced a murky, unfocused sound that 
bounced errantly off the high ceiling and hard, untextured walls. Price 
promised that an audio presentation that matches the clean, acoustic sound of 
the original Jazz Bakery will be a primary, and immediate, goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Listening to DeFranco and Gibbs in action was, as always, a bit like examining 
the craftsmanship in an elaborate astronomical clock. Everything was 
meticulous, well-ordered and to the point. No group that includes Gibbs can 
ever be completely predictable, and there were one or two moments -- notably a 
briskly interactive, rhythmically charged rendering of "Airmail Special" and 
ballad features by Gibbs and DeFranco -- in which the leaders' be-bop lines 
broke through the group's structured music. But there were few real surprises 
from an ensemble (Tom Rainer played piano and Gerry Gibbs was the drummer) 
whose music defines one of jazz's most classical styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, the true star of the evening was the sparkling new venue. Price 
has created a musically harmonious, much-needed location for the appearance of 
major jazz acts in the Southland. The next month will see performances by, 
among others, Dick Hyman, Joe Lovano, McCoy Tyner, Dave Frishberg and James 
Moody. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can continue to book acts like that," Price concluded, "I'll be happy to 
come out here every morning to wash the windows." 
</P>
<P>
 * Buddy DeFranco/Terry Gibbs Quintet at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., 
Culver City. (310) 271-9039. $20 admission. 8 p.m. Through Saturday.

JAZZ NOTES: SYMPOSIUM TO CELEBRATE WEST COAST JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jazz thrived in Southern California beginning in 1945, when clubs on Central 
Avenue and in Hollywood were presenting such greats as Charlie Parker, Art 
Tatum and Nat King Cole. Business stayed strong until the late '50s, when the 
number of happening clubs began to dwindle to a handful and the West Coast jazz 
scene began to dry up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," recalls Bill Holman, who was active during the '50s as a 
composer, arranger, tenor saxophonist and bandleader. "All of a sudden this 
West Coast jazz thing took off and it was a good time to be here. For a few 
years, it looked like jazz was going to go on forever," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 That robust era will be celebrated Oct. 27-30 when KLON-FM presents "Jazz West 
Coast," a four-day symposium of concerts, discussions and films at the Holiday 
Inn Crowne Plaza in Redondo Beach and at the Redondo Beach Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The formidable lineup of performers includes Gerry Mulligan, Dave Brubeck, 
Shorty Rogers, Buddy Collette, Gerald Wilson, Harold Land, Herb Geller, Charlie 
Haden, Bud Shank, Conte Candoli and Holman. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 17 concerts at the event, which is produced by KLON's Ken Poston, 
will be a look at Stan Kenton's "Innovations in Modern Music" band from 
1950-51, "Central Avenue Revisited" with Collette and Al McKibbon, and "The 
Lighthouse All-Stars Revisited." 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be more like one of the afternoon sessions at the (Lighthouse) so 
we'll use a lot of the musicians who played there, among them Jimmy Giuffre, 
Shorty (Rogers), Bud (Shank) and Conte (Candoli)," Poston says. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bash will host two premieres: saxophonist-composer Geller's 
musical "Playing Jazz," roughly based on his life; and a work by Holman for his 
orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the four-day event, priced at $250, are on sale now through KLON. 
Information: (310) 985-5566. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

people come to listen," says Jack Guiragosian, Deja Vu's manager. The 90-seat

POWER OF PAST IS PUBLIC'S OWN WORST ENEMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ** PUBLIC ENEMY; "Muse Sick N Hour Mess Age," Def Jam/PolyGram  
</P>
<P>
 With "It Takes a Nation of Millions . . . " Chuck D. and Flavor Flav brought 
to vinyl an urgency and Afrocentric intelligence that had never been captured 
before. That was 1988, and to city and suburban kids alike, a hip-hop 
revolution not only seemed promising, but necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years later, "Muse Sick" lacks PE's trademark urgency -- perhaps a symbol 
of our times -- and is haunted by Chuck's earlier poetic masterpieces, which 
cover the "white devil" terrain far more convincingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, the new album's pandemonium is interchangeable with what's on any 
other PE release. And although Chuck spends a lot of time lecturing about the 
trap of self-hate, he then takes cheap shots at gangsta-rappers on "So Watcha 
Gone Do Now?" where he likens them to "roaches" and raps: "Where I come from / 
The brothers aren't dumb." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's the paradox of "Muse Sick." As Chuck D. preaches about awareness of 
that trap, it sounds as if he's already admitting defeat -- a bleak message for 
'94. On "Live and Unplugged" Chuck answers Rodney G. King's haunting mantra, 
"Can't We All Get Along?" with "I doubt it." Sadly, the revolution never seemed 
so far away. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

RESTAURANT NOTES: HOLLYWOOD'S NEW CALLING CARD IS GRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget the gold card. The hippest thing in L.A. these days is the gray card. 
The plastic Transmedia Network card buys restaurant meals at a discount. 
</P>
<P>
 The dining card has slowly built a steady following since it was first 
introduced in New York in 1984 and in Los Angeles eight months ago. Currently, 
cardholders can cash in on discount dining at 175 Southland restaurants: 
Jackson's, Citrus, Babylon, Schatzi on Main, Mezzaluna, Monkey Bar, Vida, 
Roxbury, Tatou, to name a few. And Transmedia expects to double the amount of 
participating restaurants and expand into Orange County within six to nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how the card works: Charge a meal at any place where the Transmedia 
Network card is accepted. On your next MasterCard, Visa or Discovery bill, you 
will be charged the full amount. On the same statement, you will also receive a 
credit for 25% of the food and beverage portion. You pay tax and tip on the 
total bill. The only catch is the $50 annual fee, which is often waived through 
various marketing promotions. Currently, there are 17,000 Los Angeles-area card 
holders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We designed the card so that there would be no restrictions, no coupons, no 
negatives," says Transmedia executive Stuart Pellman. "People don't have to be 
concerned about being embarrassed using the card when out with business 
guests." 
</P>
<P>
 "I now take clients to places that accept the Transmedia card," says Jackie 
Green, who owns a Beverly Hills public relations company. "I went to Chez 
Helene last week because it was on the list." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the card is now accepted in many major U.S. cities (there are 370,000 
card holders nationwide), Green also plans to use the card when she travels. 
"It encourages you to eat out more," she says, "and the charges appear on my 
Mastercard, which is tied to frequent flyer miles." 
</P>
<P>
 Participating restaurants get cash up front from the dining card company. The 
amount depends on the size and reputation of the restaurant. For every dollar 
received from Transmedia, the owner has to pay back two, so for a $10,000 cash 
advance, the payback is $20,000. That means for every meal served to a 
Transmedia cardholder, the restaurant actually gets only half of the total food 
and drink bill. The other half is divided between Transmedia and the customer. 
After the $20,000 is paid back, the cycle starts over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it seems a bad deal for restaurants, Pellman says otherwise. For one 
thing, restaurants that are strapped for money and can't go to banks have quick 
access to cash. Also, it brings in new customers and fills empty tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the program," says Michael Eisenberg, who co-owns Thunder Roadhouse on 
Sunset along with "Hog" celebs Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper. "I'm getting at 
least 10 to 15 new people per week, and those are $60 dinners." 
</P>
<P>
 Eisenberg, who received $5,000 up front from Transmedia, used the money to buy 
an additional refrigerator. "My chef's happy because now he's got a separate 
meat walk-in," Eisenberg says. "It's like a Kosher kitchen here now, separate 
milk and separate meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Ehrli who runs Arnold Schwarzenegger's Venice restaurant, Schatzi on 
Main, was one of the first to sign up with the plan. "I was a pretty tough 
sale," he says, "but they've backed it up with some good advertising." For 
Ehrli, the issue wasn't money; it was the lure of new business for the 
neighborhood restaurant. "I feel they are going to be big in this city. Only 
last night I had someone come in and say, 'We just got our Transmedia card and 
wanted to check you out.' And they lived over in the Marina." 
</P>
<P>
 But not every restaurateur is as thrilled about the Transmedia card. According 
to Pellman, 10% of L.A. restaurants have dropped out since the card was first 
introduced.  
</P>
<P>
 Celestino Drago would prefer his customers leave home without it. The Santa 
Monica restaurateur, who began accepting the card when it was first introduced 
in Los Angeles, has notified the company that he plans to quit the program. "It 
was a good way to introduce people to my restaurant," he says, "but now there 
are too many card holders. A party of six using a Transmedia Card can kill 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Atkinson, owner of Orleans in West Los Angeles, also plans to end her 
restaurant's affiliation. "I'm losing quite a bit of money on it," she says. "I 
thought it would bring in new customers, but instead, I'm just getting people 
looking for a bargain." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of other top restaurants including Patina, Campanile, Rex il 
Ristorante, Spago, Michael's, Valentino and Chez Melange have declined to get 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kicked them out of my restaurant," says the feisty Xiomara Ardolina, who 
owns the French restaurant Xiomara in Pasadena. "What happens if one night 
every customer uses a Transmedia card?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Our study shows that doesn't happen," says Pellman. "We know customers come 
in more often. And most importantly, when a Transmedia card holder comes in, he 
is bringing in other people. Many of those people don't have a card and they 
come back."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; MEMORIES OF NOISE, LAUGHS -- AND PEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an initial, memorable visit to Gordon Biersch, I confidently drag three 
friends there for a birthday supper one hot Saturday night. What a mistake! 
</P>
<P>
 All brick and sleek wood, with a gleaming stainless steel brewery behind 
glass, this Northern Californian chain restaurant opened earlier this year in a 
courtyard of theaters, restaurants and shops called Hugus Alley -- or, 
depending on whom you talk to, Yuppie Central -- in Pasadena's Old Town. 
Indeed, if you want to see what fashions from nearby J. Crew, Banana Republic 
and A/X look like on the hoof, take a seat at Gordon Biersch -- or, more 
likely, a bench out front, where you'll wait for your beeper to buzz. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering this restaurant for the first time, I notice noise. The place seems a 
large, elaborate box of noise -- as if it were a commodity architects yearned 
to capture and increase. 
</P>
<P>
 That first night, we are seated in a small alcove where the sound does not 
reverberate with such intensity. We can relax, even talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon Biersch is a brewery restaurant and the food, one assumes, is meant to 
go with beer -- the smooth golden Export lager, the full-bodied Marzen and the 
dark unfiltered Dunkles. Barbecued chicken wings, sticky-sweet, spicy and 
cooled by a subtly sneaky hot jalapeno cream, are impossible to stop eating. A 
busy salad with garden vegetables, mozzarella and a soft, herbed flat bread 
makes up in freshness what it lacks in focus. 
</P>
<P>
 A special, blackened sea bass on cannellini beans with a fresh tomato-onion 
salsa is well-conceived, but I can't keep my fork out of my companion's lamb 
chops and minted peas. It's the peas I'm after: Absolutely fresh, odd-sized, 
crunchy and sweet, these peas are one of the best things I've eaten all summer. 
They are so good, I forget the noise and look with pity on the woman sitting 
near us who hates her dinner, and the other customers around us clamoring for 
the waiter's, the busperson's, somebody's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The service here is woefully inadequate, but minted peas widen the heart. 
Those peas also affect perspective, for shortly after, I bring a birthday 
celebration to Gordon Biersch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We are seated at a table in the thick of the clamor. Only a low glass 
partition separates us from the body-packed bar. Conversation is out. So is 
decent service. Our waitress, a big-boned woman with a raucous laugh, 
apologizes for making us wait so long . . . and laughs. In time, drinks arrive, 
as do uninspired appetizers: pale, limp calamari fritti , soggy deep-fried rock 
shrimp, a Caesar salad of whole romaine spears and large, blond, rock-hard 
croutons we assume are mere design elements -- surely the kitchen doesn't 
expect us to eat them? 
</P>
<P>
 Pappardelle with tomatoes and asparagus tastes like something you settle for 
at home when you're too lazy to go to the store. Roast chicken is moist, but 
served on a mound of dense, salty mashed potatoes with salty gravy. Sirloin 
steak ordered medium-rare is bloody, wobbly rare, and a cheeseburger ordered 
rare is decisively well-done. Where's our waitress? Sometimes, in the din, we 
think we hear that laugh. After some time, my friend with the cheeseburger 
walks up to the kitchen, where cooks agree to make him a new one. Later, our 
waitress reappears: "Oh, did you have burger trauma?" she asks . . . and 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 We head next door, to Il Fornaio, for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 One good meal, one lousy: I need a tie-breaker. This time, we sit outside -- a 
longer wait, but waiting's nothing compared to torture-by-noise. And we have a 
more present waitress . . . until she starts chatting with a friend. The food, 
however, is disastrous. Steamed mussels are strong-tasting, brackish. A special 
tamale is a husk purse of dry, crumbly masa and goat cheese. Baby back ribs 
have that good sticky-sweet sauce, but the accompanying garlic fries are small, 
soggy, refried scraps. Seared scallops on fettucine have the dullness of the 
pappardelle and the brackishness of the mussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the lower sound level, we stay for dessert. An ice cream sandwich is 
hard, rich ice cream on fragile toffee wafers. Hot "tandoori" bananas, tucked 
under ice cream, whipped cream and candied pecans, are almost as sweet as 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gordon Biersch Brewery Restaurant, 41 Hugus Alley, Pasadena, (818) 449-0052. 
Open 7 days for lunch and dinner. Beer and wine. Major credit cards accepted. 
Dinner for two, food only, $24-$65.

 With campaign '94 rhetoric mucking up the landscape, the timing of "Bob 
Roberts" coming to laser with an incisive analog soundtrack couldn't be better. 
Tim Robbins' razor-sharp 1992 political satire plays especially well on the 
small screen in a Pioneer Special Edition ($70) with a rapier-like commentary 
from writer-director-star Robbins, a tour of the cutting-room floor and scenes 
from Robbins' "Saturday Night Live" segment from which the film sprang. 
</P>
<P>
 As the charming right-wing musician who turns '60s Dylan and '30s Guthrie 
anthems inside out to seduce the press and the electorate, Robbins is in top 
form. Clearly, "Bob Roberts" is Robbins' vision of democracy and its 
gatekeepers, the journalists supposedly there to protect it, gone haywire. 
</P>
<P>
 The joy of the analog soundtrack lies in seeing how clear Robbins' vision is 
and how, as a filmmaker, he has learned to send a message without sacrificing 
any of the bite, zest and snap that good storytelling requires. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his mentor Robert Altman, for whom he became Hollywood's "Player" 
nonpareil, Robbins has learned how to operate on a shoestring. It wouldn't be 
surprising to find that he tweaked it on an MCI family and friends plan. 
</P>
<P>
 As we accompany him scene by scene through the movie, we meet the faces that 
populate the film: his accountant, who plays his wife; his young stepdaughter 
in her first screen appearance; his brother-in-law; the host of actors from his 
Actors Gang theater workshop; acting buddies who worked for scale (Peter 
Gallagher, Helen Hunt, Fred Ward, Pamela Reed, James Spader, Alan Rickman, 
Susan Sarandon). 
</P>
<P>
 In acknowledging his debt to the "SNL" appearance that grew into the film, 
Robbins reminds political cartoonists that kindness isn't their coin: 
"Satirists can't be polite. They have to be rude. They have to risk offending 
at all times." 
</P>
<P>
 The film's producers may have initially wanted a movie that was a nice little 
comic satire and didn't risk offending, but that's never what Robbins 
envisioned. "My purpose in making this film was to frighten people with what 
can happen with demagoguery -- an image-controlled society that does not 
question itself enough with a press that is not vigilant enough to control 
erratic elements of the government until after that control would be 
effective," he says. "People's lives are sacrificed because of this lack of 
control and vigilance." His words are even more effective coming over powerful 
sequences of the film itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, with his brother David, wrote the clever music that became candidate 
Bob Roberts' smooth anthems. "Bob's songs are about illusion and are false," he 
explains, and therefore he never allowed a soundtrack to be released that could 
end up promulgating the distorted message. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robbins wanted to finalize his vision with a song grounded in reality. He 
came upon a Woody Guthrie song, "I've Got to Know," and received permission 
from Guthrie's daughter, Nora, to use it as "a real cleansing, a benediction 
from the father of American folk music." Played over the end credits, it is "a 
reaffirmation of the power of good music," Robbins says, a coda that supplies 
"a song about truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The laser disc's third side, in CAV, provides a look at a good many scenes 
snipped from the final release, revealing the tough choices Robbins the 
filmmaker had to make to keep the movie from bogging down. Among them are many 
telling scenes from the "documentary" a la "This Is Spinal Tap" that frames the 
film and weaves in and out of it. These outtakes are especially gripping since 
they add information and insight to the almost-too-real Bob Roberts' biography. 
</P>
<P>
 There hasn't been a more authentic or realistic look at the political process 
since Garry Trudeau and Altman's "Tanner" hit the television screen on HBO 
(also available on laser). 
</P>
<P>
 Also part of the package are production stills from the making of the film and 
a rather gushing commentary from Gore Vidal, who played Roberts' liberal 
senatorial foil, for the informative back cover. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, this is a first-rate laser production that does full justice to an 
extraordinary film.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; MICHELLE SHOCKED DISPLAYS MATURITY AT HOUSE OF BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About seven years ago, Michelle Shocked emerged as a precocious, political 
East Texas folkie devoted to the power and purity of songs and the stories they 
can tell. After side trips into jump blues and string-band experiments, she's 
now returned to her beginnings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday at the House of Blues, she showed that she's no longer a sly kid, 
but a mature artist bearing songs full of complex, achingly personal 
narratives. The first part of the show was taken up largely by the 10 new, 
unfamiliar songs from her self-released "Kind Hearted Woman" album, which is 
only being sold at her shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans who packed the club embraced the new material, a moving song cycle of 
loss and redemption. With able aid from guitarist Fiachna O'Braonain, bassist 
Peter O'Toole (both members of Ireland's Hothouse Flowers) and drummer Cedric 
Anderson, she gave disarming, natural readings of the new material, followed by 
a frisky, generous set of audience requests. 
</P>
<P>
 As charming and intriguing a performer as she's been in the past, this finally 
seemed to be the real Shocked on stage. That doesn't mean she's settled down, 
stylistically speaking: She's currently working on a new album with New Orleans 
funk-soul master Allen Toussaint. STEVE HOCHMAN

ART REVIEW; DESTINATION UNCLEAR FOR 2 MOCA EXHIBITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everybody remembers that trip where the journey was more rewarding than the 
destination or that party where getting ready was more fun than the fete. One 
suspects this was the case with two large installations currently on view at 
the Museum of Contemporary Art. Both feel like fascinating projects, whose 
residue is somehow incomplete, like stage sets with no performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hirokazu Kosaka: In the Mood" is literally an installation based on prop 
pieces from Kosaka's performance work "Amerika Maru." Kosaka, a noted 
practitioner of the genre, was born in Japan in 1948, immigrated here at age 
10, attended L.A.'s legendary Chouinard Art Institute and later became an 
ordained Buddhist priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to this piece is a huge pile of musty pre-World War II luggage. It 
rests like a monumental sigh in a beautifully proportioned gallery. Most of the 
bags were given to the artist by Issei -- first-generation Japanese immigrants 
-- who came here, like so many others, with their dreams in shabby suitcases. 
Along one wall is a row of wooden boxes with shoulder straps and vintage sewing 
machines attached to their tops. Such humble and industrious machines were 
often the first gift Issei husbands presented their wives. We recognize the 
Singer brand but most have vanished -- Franklin, Waite, Rotary, Davis. . . . 
They recall the myriad of disappeared things once thought to be enduring. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a model of an ocean liner's hull that bears yet another sewing 
machine. It rests in a case atop spools of gaily colored ribbon. It may 
symbolize first, the serpentine celebrating a liner hoisting anchor, and then 
the sweatshop labor that immigrants were obliged to perform at the end of the 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Kosaka's work tends to the autobiographical. There are vague hints of this in 
the installation, the bittersweet pain of departure for a promised land, the 
famous Glenn Miller tune from which the piece derives its title, but what 
remains obdurately absent is some link that will put it all together. 
</P>
<P>
 Performance photographs and a poetic booklet accompanying the installation 
provide more clues. Actors wear the box-and-sewing-machine contraptions on 
their backs like parodies of Samurai arrow quivers. The men are dressed 
incongruously in kimonos and fedoras. In one image they stand in ranks before a 
huge Japanese flag. The stage is festooned with ribbon. A Spanish dancer 
performs in the foreground. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an enticing enigma, but it does not jell. The Amerika Maru is a boat that 
sailed without us. But if the presentation -- organized by MOCA curator Julie 
Lazar -- remains artistically elusive, it does make an important point about a 
new epoch where we live in a world culture rather than a national one. 
</P>
<P>
 Alighiero e Boetti's installation addresses the same theme. Boetti, who died 
this year at 54, was a key figure in the Italian branch of the Arte Povera and 
conceptual movements. His installation is titled "Alternating 1 to 100 and vice 
versa." The accompanying book -- in English, Italian and French -- is called 
"De Bouche a Oreille," which seems to be slightly fractured French for "From 
Mouth to Ear." 
</P>
<P>
 It documents a Boetti project with origins stretching back to the '70s. The 
present version involved students from 30 French art schools, 20 friends of the 
artist and 50 kilim rugs made by a team of Afghan weavers living as refugees in 
Pakistan. If nothing else, the piece is a reflection of multicultural realism. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating in a manner similar to Sol Lewitt, Boetti had friends and students 
make squared patterns by filling in blocks of a black and white grid. These 
were then woven into kilim by the Afghan craftsmen according to the artists' 
instructions. On view, the drawings are displayed in sumptuous red boxes. 
Viewers may handle them with white cotton gloves that are provided. Rugs are 
presented with ceremonial solemnity in 28 examples spread out in a particularly 
handsome and capacious gallery. All of this grand-gesture bunting has the 
unfortunate result of making everything look rather slight and causing viewers 
to wonder what all the fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
 According to both book and appearance, the project has all manner of 
interesting resonances. An essay by Adelina von Furstenberg suggests the 
project parallels a lost tale about a man seeking knowledge. A wise man says he 
will give the hero understanding if he will bring him a kilim. When he does so 
after many adventures, the wise man says the hero is now ready to receive 
understanding because he was willing to sacrifice his own desires to a larger 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally timeless are the rugs themselves. Patterns bring to mind everything 
from ancient hieroglyphics to Navajo weavings. To present-day eyes, however, 
they resemble nothing so much as enlarged computer-pixel patterns, the language 
that makes world culture possible.  
</P>
<P>
 The installation was organized and produced by the Magasin, Centre National 
d'Art Contemporain de Grenoble and coordinated here by MOCA's Alma Ruiz. Both 
installations are part of MOCA's "Focus Series." 
</P>
<P>
 * Museum of Contemporary Art, 250 S. Grand Ave., Kosaka to Sept. 25, Boetti to 
Sept. 4, closed Mondays, (213) 626-6222.

THEATER BEAT: AMIABLE 'RATHER BE' AT WEST COAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many an aspiring actor would doubtlessly empathize with Ellen, the 
long-suffering leading lady who claims "I'd Rather Be a Whore" in Max 
Mitchell's amiable new comedy at West Coast Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Replaced in a "Taming of the Shrew" sitcom by Marla Maples, Ellen (Cynthia 
Steele) and her best friend (Lori Harmon) hit the road in search of a scandal 
that will make them notorious (and castable). 
</P>
<P>
 Theater people are sure to appreciate the play's onslaught of insider jokes, 
although others will have a harder time with the episodic jumble of oddly 
specific plot elements (Keanu Reeves, Scottish clans, Greenpeace activists and 
Norwegian firing squads) that never seem to coalesce around a central point. 
</P>
<P>
 * "I'd Rather Be a Whore," West Coast Ensemble, 6240 Hollywood Blvd., 
Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. Ends Sept. 25. $15. (213)

THEATER BEAT: 'KYLER AND TYLER': MEANDERING MINSTRELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two yuppie minstrels in "Kyler and Tyler Hit Zero Tolerance," now at Le 
Petit Theatre in West Hollywood, should have kept their day jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 This satiric musical, written by and starring Russell Slattery and Phil Ward, 
follows a pair of insurance brokers who quit work and become folk singers on a 
seedy street corner in Hollywood.But they quickly find themselves plagued by 
the tough neighborhood and its colorful hustlers and derelicts, who are evoked 
by a talented supporting cast. The point seems to be, as Kyler (or is it 
Tyler?) concludes in a David Mamet-like tirade, "There's no sanctuary. Sharks, 
vampires, jackals -- that's the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, whatever comic possibilities existed here have been lost 
through Stewart Skelton's meandering direction, some ham-fisted dialogue and 
the punishingly insipid songs ("Yucca Sucka," perhaps the worst, is every bit 
as puerile as the title suggests). 
</P>
<P>
 If this is what street performance is like, selling insurance looks pretty 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Kyler and Tyler Hit Zero Tolerance," Le Petit Theatre at the Hotel Sofitel 
Ma Maison, 8555 Beverly Blvd., West Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends 
Saturday. $10. (310) 652-6997. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. SCOTT COLLINS

THEATER BEAT: ILLUMINATING THE COMPLEX FACETS OF 'GLASS MENAGERIE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to a staging of extraordinary delicacy and insight at the Will Geer 
Theatricum Botanicum, Tennessee Williams' "The Glass Menagerie" comes across 
like a familiar acquaintance glimpsed in a fresh light, forcing us to realize 
how much we've taken him for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 There's not a wasted moment in Williams' eloquent autobiographical portrait of 
flawed characters, life's turning points, and tragedy inflicted through 
ignorance. Director Heidi Helen Davis illuminates these complex facets with 
breathtaking clarity -- and a few surprises along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Always respectful to the text, Davis' innovations range from subtle visual 
embellishments to her bold splitting of Tom, Williams' alter ego, into two 
separate characters -- the narrator (James Lefebvre) who remains onstage, 
unobtrusively reacting to his story, and the younger self (Brian Morri) who 
figures in his re-enacted memories. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an elegant solution to the usually insurmountable dilemma of casting a 
single Tom -- not only are the two actors convincingly appropriate to their 
stages of life, but they even look alike. 
</P>
<P>
 As Tom's fragile, painfully introverted sister, Melora Marshall opens the door 
to Laura's rich, inner world and registers every emotional bruise with 
heartbreaking lack of defense. Jim Pirri, an outgoing and magnetic presence, 
nails the role of the congenial "gentleman caller" who unthinkingly tramples on 
her romantic illusions. 
</P>
<P>
 With sensitivity and restraint, Ellen Geer grounds the domineering mother 
Amanda in a desperation to help Laura that keeps her sympathetic despite the 
damage she inflicts. A sadly ironic figure, she wonders why her children can't 
be normal people -- heedless that the answer lies in her own overbearing 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Complementing these powerful portrayals are the carefully rendered lyrical 
cadences of Williams' language, fusing speech with poetry in the ascension of 
wounded souls. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Glass Menagerie," Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, 1419 N. Topanga 
Canyon Blvd., Topanga . Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 p.m. (Saturdays , 3 p.m.

THEATER BEAT: ODETS' 'AWAKE' FIERY AT ODYSSEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Often dismissed as a left-wing polemicist, Clifford Odets has enjoyed a 
comeback of late. In his classic "Awake and Sing!," now in a fiery, superbly 
acted revival at Odyssey Theatre in West Los Angeles, he wrote about the 
American dream with as much compassion, humor and insight as any other major 
playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 The play follows a Jewish family living on the edge of poverty during the 
Great Depression (Kurt Wahlner's set aptly evokes their Bronx tenement). Son 
Ralph (Gregory Vignolle) and daughter Hennie (Lisa Barnes), both in their 20s, 
long to escape the clutches of their sadistically domineering mother (Marilyn 
Fox, in a frighteningly convincing portrayal). Yet money and social expectation 
have an insidious way of foiling their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Elina deSantos has shrewdly balanced Odets' political and domestic 
concerns, suggesting how the twin pressures for honoring tradition and making 
good can wreak havoc on an immigrant family. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Fox, other standouts in the crackerjack cast include consummate 
showman Orson Bean, as the lefty grandfather who rages against capitalist 
oppression, and Richard Fancy as the cynical, one-legged war veteran Moe 
Axelrod. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Awake and Sing!," Odyssey Theatre, 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd., West Los 
Angeles. Wednesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends Sept. 25.

THEATER BEAT: 'BOY STEWARDESS' FLIES WITH HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Andy Schell recounts in "Confessions of a Boy Stewardess," the absurdity of 
working as a flight attendant begins long before the first scheduled flight. 
</P>
<P>
 At Schell's no-frills airline, cost cuts had eliminated the budget for 
first-aid dummies, so trainees found themselves performing CPR on their 
instruction manuals instead."There we were," he recalls, "trying to stimulate 
the circulatory functions of a book." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for us, Schell, a former writer for Joan Rivers, has managed to turn 
11 years of flying into this lovably loose, delightfully irreverent show, 
directed by Stephen Hibbert at Theatre/Theater in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Blending skits, stand-up monologues and even an occasional song, writer Schell 
and co-star Bridget Sienna explore virtually every facet of this oft-derided 
occupation, from the rote safety demonstrations ("listened to by one out of 
every 75 passengers," Schell estimates) to the celebrity passengers (Shelley 
Winters, in Sienna's apt takeoff, withers upon hearing the airline's no-meals 
policy). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Schell knows how to lampoon his trade without diminishing it or himself. 
The same talent whose adroit impersonations hint of Robin Williams can also 
relate a deeply felt encounter with a 100-year-old passenger from Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 That's an extraordinary gift, one that makes Schell's imaginative flight well 
worth taking. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Confessions of a Boy Stewardess," Theatre/Theater, 1713 Cahuenga Blvd., 
Hollywood. Fridays, 8 p.m. Ends Aug. 26. $10. (213) 850-6941. Running time: 1

 In their most aggressive assault yet on the integrity of police detectives in

 Simpson's lawyers requested information that might indicate that any of the 
four detectives -- Philip L. Vannatter, Tom Lange, Ronald Phillips and Mark 
Fuhrman -- violated Police Department policies by lying in the preparation of 
search warrants, concealing evidence or falsifying reports, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys are eager to get information on all four detectives, but 
took particular aim at Fuhrman, whom they described as "a dangerous officer 
with a propensity to create false information against African American 
defendants." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman's attorney, Robert H. Tourtelot, vehemently denied that allegation and 
said the defense's attack on his client is "a desperate act by a desperate 
attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, members of Simpson's defense team received a tentative but 
guardedly heartening update on the DNA tests being performed by a Maryland lab. 
</P>
<P>
 The first batch of preliminary results do not tend to implicate Simpson in the 
slayings, sources close to the investigation said. The same sources cautioned, 
however, that the results from Cellmark Diagnostics, the lab performing most of 
the DNA analysis, are not final and that analysis is under way on additional 
blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
 One sample that has been tested is a blood spot found on victim Ronald Lyle 
Goldman's shoe, sources said. DNA tests of that sample show it was not 
Simpson's blood, sources said -- an important conclusion for the defense team, 
as it would have been difficult to explain Simpson's blood there. 
</P>
<P>
 The lab, however, is performing DNA analyses on a number of samples recovered 
from Simpson's home and car, as well as from the murder scene. The preliminary 
results do not include findings on most of those samples. Those tests still are 
being conducted, and more samples recently were sent to a Berkeley lab to be 
tested there as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the preliminary results heartened members of Simpson's defense 
team. "It looks pretty good," said one defense source. "It's not the last word, 
but it's a good word." 
</P>
<P>
 The director of the Cellmark lab declined comment Thursday, as did police and 
prosecution officials. Buoyed by the preliminary findings, defense team members 
said Simpson's attorneys may file a motion to force the prosecution to disclose 
the result. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the strong tone of Thursday's motion seeking access to police 
personnel files, attorney Robert L. Shapiro insisted again that race will not 
be a factor as he defends Simpson against charges that he murdered his ex-wife, 
Nicole Brown Simpson, and Goldman. Simpson has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense motion and accompanying documents represent the first time that 
allegations of racism have been raised in official court records in the Simpson 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Included with the defense motion are previously reported transcripts from a 
1983 case in which Fuhrman allegedly made racially charged remarks as he sought 
a stress pension; documents involving a 1991 lawsuit filed by a lawyer who said 
testimony in that case indicated that Fuhrman placed a knife at the feet of a 
wounded suspect, and a new declaration from a woman who said that Fuhrman made 
racially offensive comments to her in 1985 or 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "During our conversation, Mark Fuhrman stated that he would pull over any 
vehicle that was occupied by a black man and a white woman," real estate agent 
Kathleen Bell said, describing an encounter with the officer at a Marine Corps 
recruiting office. 
</P>
<P>
 In her sworn declaration, taken this week, Bell continued: "I then asked him: 
'What if you don't have a good reason to pull them over?' Mr. Fuhrman then 
stated: 'I'd make one up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bell said she asked Fuhrman if he would do the same thing if the two people 
were in love. "Fuhrman then appeared to get disgusted with me and stated, 'If I 
had my way, they would take all the niggers, put them together in a big group 
and burn them.' I became visibly upset, began to cry and left the office." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tourtelot, Fuhrman denies ever having met the woman whose 
declaration was submitted and says he never made the comments attributed to 
him. Efforts to locate Bell were unsuccessful Thursday, and Shapiro would not 
say how the defense team became aware of her account. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations about Fuhrman are included because they cast doubt on his 
credibility, Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourtelot scoffed at that. "He stood up in court and said in front of the 
judge and the world that race was not going to be an issue in this case," 
Fuhrman's lawyer said. "Then we see this motion. What's that they say? If it 
walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. This is about race." 
</P>
<P>
 The motion was drafted by Carl E. Douglas, an associate of Shapiro's 
co-counsel Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. Before he joined the defense team, Cochran 
said that race would loom as a major issue if it were linked to Fuhrman's 
credibility. "I think you'll see the defense really seek to exploit it," 
Cochran said last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the allegations raise potential problems for Fuhrman if prosecutors 
call him as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 If the judge permitted it, he could be cross-examined about his alleged 
statements as defense attorneys try to establish that he had a motive to lie or 
plant evidence in the Simpson case. Fuhrman is the officer who discovered a 
bloody glove at Simpson's estate a few hours after the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no evidence has surfaced that Fuhrman planted the glove, as some 
defense sources have suggested. Police, in fact, have concluded after 
interviewing officers who were at the crime scene on the night of the slayings 
that it would have been virtually impossible for Fuhrman to remove a glove from 
the area where the bodies were recovered and take it to Simpson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor, said the allegations of racially charged 
remarks by Fuhrman might be admissible, at least to cross-examine the detective 
about his willingness and motive to lie. But Arenella, like other legal 
experts, added that the ability to raise those questions might be limited by 
the kind of defense that Simpson's attorneys mount. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is seeking five years' worth of personnel records on the 
detectives. To get them, defense attorneys do not need to establish 
admissibility right away; they need only demonstrate a good reason to review 
the files. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts predicted that the defense probably would get some of the 
records it is seeking, but added that motions such as the one filed Thursday 
are frequently made and often yield only a fraction of what is sought. 
</P>
<P>
 If Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito decides the defense has justified its 
request, the LAPD records would be turned over to him. The judge would review 
them and decide whether anything contained in the documents is relevant to the 
Simpson case. Pertinent records would be made available to the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said that if the police records contain information suggesting 
that Lange or Vannatter have been previously accused of misrepresenting 
themselves in applying for search warrants, the defense would almost certainly 
be entitled to that information. Lange and Vannatter prepared the search 
warrant affidavit in the Simpson case, and the motion filed Thursday alleges 
that the affidavit "contained numerous false statements, misrepresentations and 
concealments of material facts." 
</P>
<P>
 The motion details what defense attorneys say were misrepresentations, but 
does not offer any evidence to suggest that either Lange or Vannatter have had 
previous complaints leveled against them. Likewise, it makes only scant 
reference to Detective Phillips, Fuhrman's supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 But it levels a blistering attack at Fuhrman. 
</P>
<P>
 The files from the 1983 pension case have been widely reported. But the other 
material about Fuhrman contained new details of allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1991 lawsuit, Joseph J. Britton alleged that he was shot six times by 
Fuhrman and another officer April 7, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Britton's lawyer, Robert Deutsch, said testimony during a trial last fall 
indicated that Fuhrman had picked up a knife from one location and placed it 
near Britton's feet to justify the officers' shooting -- a contention similar 
to that raised by defense sources in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Britton, who said he was unarmed and offering no resistance, alleged that 
after he was shot and lying on the ground, one of the officers taunted him, 
saying: "Why don't you just die?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although the taunting officer was not identified by name in the original 
complaint, Deutsch said Thursday that the officer was Fuhrman. 
</P>
<P>
 A substantially different version of the same incident emerges in a report 
prepared by prosecutors who routinely investigate officer-involved shootings. 
Those prosecutors found no wrongdoing on the part of the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the September, 1987, report, which is based on statements that 
Fuhrman and Officer J. P. Aiken gave to investigators, Britton and another man 
were attempting to rob an ATM customer when Fuhrman and Aiken emerged from a 
stakeout and chased the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers found Britton hiding in a nearby shopping center and together 
fired 16 rounds at him after he refused to drop a "shiney object" that Aiken 
thought was a gun, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 A knife nearly 15 inches long was recovered, the report said without 
indicating where and at what point the knife was found. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining why no wrongdoing was found on the part of the officers, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Herbert R. Lapin said Britton eventually pleaded guilty to the 
robbery and a charge of "drawing or exhibiting a weapon in a rude and 
threatening manner."

STATE HIGH COURT OKS INSURANCE REFORM RULES; PROP. 103: JUSTICES CLEAR WAY FOR 
MORE REBATES TO POLICYHOLDERS. BUT INDUSTRY CHALLENGES COULD DELAY REFUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously upheld Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi's rules for enforcing Proposition 103, clearing the 
way for possibly $1 billion in additional refunds to an estimated 14 million 
insurance policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-0 decision by the largely conservative court rejected a constitutional 
challenge to Garamendi's rules by Woodland Hills-based 20th Century Insurance 
Co. and affirmed the commissioner's wide-ranging authority to set rates as he 
sees fit and apply a single rate-setting standard to all companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But California policyholders may not get their rebates immediately, in part 
because insurers could contest the amounts that Garamendi orders them to pay -- 
a process that could drag on for months. Also, Garamendi's successor -- to be 
elected in November -- could change the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five companies have voluntarily paid more than $800 million in rebates 
to 7 million customers, with individual rebates from some of the biggest 
companies averaging between $100 and $300 per policyholder. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the holdouts are two of the state's three largest insurers: State Farm 
Mutual Automobile Insurance Co., which has been ordered to rebate $235 million, 
and Farmers Insurance Group, which has not received a specific rebate order. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's ruling reversed a February, 1993, decision by a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge. The higher court's ruling is the biggest milestone in the 
legal fight that began Nov. 9, 1988, one day after voters approved Proposition 
103, which called for auto, homeowners and commercial property insurers to roll 
back their rates by 20% from 1988 levels and refund one year's "excess 
premiums" to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have here is a unanimous decision by a court that is not exactly 
renowned nationwide for its wild-eyed, liberal interpretations in property 
rights cases," said Fredric D. Woocher, one of Garamendi's outside lawyers in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Woocher said that the strength of the ruling and its reliance on federal 
precedents diminishes the likelihood that 20th Century could successfully 
appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President James Curley said 20th Century has not decided whether to 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 About 670 insurers in the state have not yet paid rebates, with their 
obligations totaling a combined $1 billion, according to Garamendi's office. 
Insurance industry observers voiced skepticism that the remaining rebates will 
ultimately reach anywhere near $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's put it this way: I wouldn't spend it," said Tom Aceituno, chief counsel 
for the Assn. of California Insurance Companies, the industry's oldest and 
largest trade group in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Aceituno noted that the companies that have voluntarily settled with Garamendi 
and paid their rebates ended up paying far less than what the commissioner had 
originally ordered. Allstate Insurance Co. paid $110 million in rebates, less 
than half the $243 million in Garamendi's 1991 order. Aetna, ordered to pay 
$137 million, rebated $31 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's ruling, written by Justice Stanley Mosk, requires 20th Century to 
pay California customers $119 million in auto and homeowners premium refunds, 
plus interest. But 20th Century, crippled by an estimated $685 million in 
claims costs from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, may be unable to afford 
that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi acknowledged the carrier's financial problems in a news conference 
Thursday and said that his staff has begun reviewing "how and when they will be 
able to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I'll promise you this: The policyholders will get their money 
before the shareholders."  
</P>
<P>
 Stock of the insurer's parent company, 20th Century Industries, lost 50 cents 
a share to close at $16.375 Thursday in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said that most other insurers have set aside reserves to cover their 
rebate liability and he doubted that any carrier's financial health would be 
threatened by paying the rebates.  
</P>
<P>
 He also said he would quickly set his sights on the biggest Proposition 103 
holdout: State Farm. As soon as Thursday's decision takes effect -- 30 days 
from now -- Garamendi said he would have State Farm representatives in a 
hearing room to determine their final rebate amount. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm indicated Thursday that the hearing may be contentious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still believe that we owe no rollback, even under the terms of the 
commissioner's regulations," staff attorney Judith Mintel said. "Our greatest 
concern is how much of this ruling will apply in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 What State Farm and other carriers find ominous in the decision is that it 
upholds the commissioner's right to focus on insurers' profits rather than 
their prices. The court said Garamendi's approach in ordering rebates -- 
limiting carriers to a 10% maximum rate of return -- did not amount to 
confiscation, in violation of the 5th Amendment's "taking" clause. 
</P>
<P>
 If Garamendi or his successors extend that principle to future rate-setting by 
putting an across-the-board cap on insurers' allowable profits, it would dampen 
competition, insurance industry observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century has long been known for having the cheapest rates -- and 
some of the highest profits -- of any large California insurer. The company 
says the secret is paring down overhead by selling directly instead of through 
a large and expensive sales force. 
</P>
<P>
 But if such practices are not rewarded with higher profits, what is the point 
of trying so hard to keep costs down, asked Gary Fontana, a lawyer for 20th 
Century. "If you punish people for being efficient, they will go elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Rosenfield, author of Proposition 103, said "the question is not 
whether 20th Century was the low-cost insurer," but whether they should have 
had even lower rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield, who joined Garamendi in the news conference at the Insurance 
Department's Downtown Los Angeles headquarters, said: "You're going to hear a 
lot of complaining and threats that California is once again a bad place to do 
business." But ultimately, he said, few companies will abandon the largest 
insurance market in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The mechanism for implementing Proposition 103 is in Garamendi's regulations. 
But because they are regulations, not laws, his successor elected in November 
will have wide latitude to change them, which could delay rebates or affect the 
amounts paid. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), the Democratic nominee to succeed 
Garamendi, said he supports Garamendi's approach and would continue it if 
elected. Torres said that in future rate-setting, he would try to keep insurers 
from passing on to policyholders such expenses as political contributions and 
punitive damages assessed in lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' opponent, Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush (R-Cupertino), said: "The 
industry must stop fighting 1988's battles and move forward." He urged insurers 
to "sit down immediately" with Garamendi, resolve the remaining rollback 
questions and send out the checks. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his administration would focus on the factors that drive auto 
insurance costs upward, such as insurance fraud, uninsured motorists and 
unreasonably high court verdicts.

NEWS ANALYSIS; HUFFINGTON ON DEFENSIVE IN KEY GOAL OF ENDING WELFARE; POLITICS: 
HE CALLS SYSTEM CRUEL TO POOR. CRITICS SAY HE IS UNREALISTIC IN THINKING 
PRIVATE SECTOR CAN ASSUME BURDEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Mike Huffington said he feels so strongly that government must end 
its role as a welfare provider that it was a primary reason he decided to enter 
the race for U.S. Senate and to invest more than $10 million from his own 
fortune to pay for the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate's wife, author Arianna Stassinopoulos Huffington, said the issue 
is so important that the couple discussed the possibility last fall of 
abandoning the campaign and using the money for a foundation. (In the end, they 
decided the Senate race would be a better platform to win public attention.) 
</P>
<P>
 After months of attacking Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein with millions of 
dollars in television commercials, the Huffington campaign earlier this month 
unveiled its "central theme" -- the proposal that government welfare be 
replaced with private philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the guise of caring for the poor, the federal government has created a 
monstrous poverty machine -- a machine so cruel and destructive that it does 
more to keep people poor than it does to help them out of poverty," Huffington 
said in a speech this week in San Diego. "That is not compassion. It is cruel, 
it is inhuman, it is wrong, it is unfair and it must end." 
</P>
<P>
 In the context of the national debate about welfare reform, the proposal to 
end welfare has been limited largely to the blackboards of a few Washington 
think tanks. Proponents of the idea say Huffington's campaign could be a 
national test of the public's evolving attitude toward welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, the Santa Barbara congressman has quickly found himself on the 
defensive, both for the idea and for acting as the messenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Los Angeles Coalition to End 
Homelessness, said, "I've been doing this for 10 years, and under the Reagan 
Administration, they said the same thing. 'Let's prove that capitalism works. 
Let's prove that the private sector can pick it up.' What's happened over the 
last 10 years is that homelessness has increased about 15% each year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican candidate got a taste of how tough it might be to sell his new 
plan in the San Diego speech, his first on the subject. Huffington told an 
audience of black entrepreneurs that it is time for the government to transfer 
its welfare burden to the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "I firmly believe, that if we allow people to keep more of what they earn, 
they will begin taking responsibility for each other again," Huffington said. 
"My critics say that is unrealistic. Well, I don't agree. I am an optimist. I 
believe in the basic goodness of people. I believe that if we give every 
American an incentive to give their time, their energy, their resources to help 
their fellow man, they will rise to the challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 After the speech, however, Huffington was peppered with questions and 
complaints from an audience that remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "People left here completely laughing," said the Rev. George Walter Smith, a 
Republican minister who hosted the event. "This man does not grasp the issues. 
People were completely disappointed with his lack of understanding the 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Before this year, Huffington had little record as a public advocate on the 
issue of welfare. In the House, Huffington has largely avoided the welfare 
reform debate that is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 And Huffington concedes that his own record of volunteering at homeless 
shelters began only this year, well into his campaign for the Senate. 
Huffington says he has contributed millions of dollars to charity, but he has 
declined to identify the beneficiaries or make public the tax records that 
would confirm his philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist Charles Murray and Republican William J. Bennett have recently 
received national attention -- including a surprisingly sympathetic critique 
from President Clinton -- for their analysis of the reasons to end welfare. But 
Huffington said he could not comment on their work because he has not read it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the very shallowness of his proposal reveals how little he really 
knows about this," said Larry Berg, a political analyst at USC. "A few years 
ago in another Administration we had a President calling for a thousand points 
of light. This one would have to be 10 million points of light. It really is a 
non-credible approach to a serious national problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Berg and others question whether the wealthy former Texas petroleum executive 
can be a credible sponsor of such major change in poverty programs. "Someone 
with his background, as wealthy as he is, who undoubtedly in his life has never 
been involved in any of this, does not have an understanding of the magnitude 
of the problem," Berg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said in an interview he believes it would take about 10 years for 
government to shed its welfare role, though it is unclear how that would occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he doesn't know the cost of the current federal welfare system 
or how much of an increase in charitable giving would be required from private 
sources to assume the government burden. He is also uncertain which programs he 
would target for elimination -- whether it would be just cash grants or 
housing, food and other relief aid too. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington said he would maintain government assistance for three types of 
recipients -- those with mental or physical handicaps and "third are those who 
. . . somehow nobody wants to hire, for whatever reason. I don't know what they 
are, but some are people that people just steer away from." 
</P>
<P>
 He endorses three legislative proposals, two of which have been introduced in 
Congress. One bill would cut welfare benefits to some unwed teen-age mothers as 
a way to reduce illegitimacy. He also favors a former Reagan Administration 
proposal that would issue federal welfare money to the states in block grants, 
allowing them to experiment with a variety of reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman introduced legislation that is described in his current 
television commercial as a way to encourage more charitable donations. The bill 
increases tax deductions for contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legislation has also been questioned by tax experts who doubt that it 
would provide enough incentive to substantially increase giving. Under the 
bill, a couple earning $40,000 who contributed $2,000 would pay $252 less in 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Feinstein is among Huffington's critics who think his vision 
of a privately operated safety net is "wishful thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 "Respectfully, he has not spent a lot of time on the real streets of San 
Francisco or Los Angeles or anywhere else, for that matter," said Feinstein. 
"Most churches are just barely able to survive today. There do need to be 
changes in the welfare system, and serious reform. But volunteerism never will 
be able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Huffington outlined his theme of welfare and personal 
responsibility in interviews with reporters. He described welfare as the best 
example of how well-intentioned government programs can do more harm than good. 
And he said the issue was at the heart of his philosophy to shrink federal 
government and turn over more power, responsibility and tax money to the local 
and community level. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that the timing of his idea was right because America is in the 
midst of a spiritual revival that will lead to a more selfless society. 
Huffington said there is evidence in polls and in church attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at this as being a watershed election," Huffington said. "It's a 
change in direction -- I really do believe it is happening. . . . I believe 
people are ready, but they don't have the leaders to show them the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the candidate has little background as an activist on welfare, the 
theme of personal responsibility as a substitute for government social programs 
has been a topic of Arianna Huffington's for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 She has lectured on it almost since the time she moved to the United States 
from Europe in 1981. It is a central theme in her sixth book, released in May 
-- "The Fourth Instinct, The Call of The Soul." 
</P>
<P>
 In the book, Arianna Huffington suggests that the approaching millennium is 
encouraging "a historic moment such as has not occurred since the Middle Ages 
gave way to the Renaissance. . . . What I am looking for is . . . a spiritual 
breakthrough, a new readiness to redefine what it is to be human." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to see major changes as we get to the millennium, the year 
2000," he said. "They have said, in past histories, as you get to events like 
that, there are major changes." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington today, there is a bipartisan consensus that welfare has failed. 
The debate has sparked ideas once considered radical from some unlikely 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's plan to cut benefits after two years for any recipient who 
has not found a job used to be an idea exclusive to conservatives. Many 
conservatives are moving further to the right in search of solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist Murray, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, 
fueled momentum for a plan that would deny welfare to anyone having a child out 
of wedlock with a column he wrote last fall describing illegitimacy as the 
nation's biggest problem. Murray proposed ending welfare in his 1984 book, 
"Losing Ground." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said of Murray's recent column: "His analysis is essentially 
right. . . . The question is . . . is it morally right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett later pointed to Clinton's comment as evidence that the political 
environment is ready to accept even greater change. He suggested Republicans 
propose an end to welfare, "cold turkey." Bennett said the change would cause 
suffering and dislocation, but he said the current system is "exacting a far 
higher human cost." 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty, however, who disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, a moderate 
Democratic research center that promotes volunteerism as a solution to civic 
problems, said ending welfare "is a conservative panacea and a myth." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall said he agrees that community-based organizations are more effective 
at social cures than the federal government and he hopes welfare reform will 
transfer more responsibility to private sources. But he warned that there is a 
limit to how much of the burden can be accommodated by local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The private sector is not ready to absorb the 14 million people on welfare," 
he said. "Our social structures would be overwhelmed. What's wrong with the 
conservative approach is that there is no transition from the current system to 
the wonderful world where private security and philanthropy pick up the slack." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agree that Huffington's campaign could trigger a provocative debate 
of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he is courageous in raising it, but I think it is a question whether 
California is ready to hear it," said Murray.

PLO, ISRAEL EXPAND POWERS OF PALESTINIANS IN W. BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization stepped beyond their 
differences over security issues and agreed Thursday for the first time to 
expand Palestinian control over some government functions throughout the West 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord is important for both sides because it comes when relations have 
been strained by the PLO's failure to stop attacks on Israelis by Hamas, an 
Islamic militant group. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath 
announced after late-night talks that began Wednesday in Alexandria, Egypt, 
that Palestinians will take responsibility for education and cultural affairs 
in the West Bank before the month's end. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said they would try to wrap up talks next week on turning over 
health care, tourism and taxation responsibilities to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 The hand-over of civil authority comes before the two sides have agreed on a 
redeployment of Israeli troops outside West Bank Palestinian population centers 
or a date and framework for Palestinian elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath and Peres failed to issue an expected joint statement committing Israel 
and the PLO to fight against terrorism together. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin reportedly told a group of Israeli 
lawmakers that he believed the PLO's recent arrest of Hamas activists in the 
Gaza Strip was little more than a publicity stunt. Rabin has expressed 
disappointment publicly with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's reluctance to crush 
Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO rounded up about 40 Hamas activists after one Israeli was shot dead 
and six others were wounded in two drive-by shootings in Gaza last Sunday. But 
all those arrested have been released. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli army says there have been 39 incidents of Palestinians shooting at 
Israelis in Gaza since the PLO took over in May. Palestinian police have failed 
to arrest anyone in connection with any of the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shaath told reporters in Alexandria that the Palestinians are committed 
"to the maintenance of peace and doing everything possible to stop violence." 
Peres welcomed Shaath's statement as "a real commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 And in Gaza, Col. Tawfik Jaber, head of Palestinian police intelligence in 
southern Gaza, a stronghold of Hamas, reportedly delivered a warning from 
Arafat to Hamas that they must not carry guns in public or wear masks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaber "told us he was willing to sacrifice 100 of his men to implement the 
policy of the Palestinian Authority on the Gaza Strip," Ahmad Nakhleh, a Hamas 
member who met with Jaber, told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Hamas and Islamic Jihad, another militant Islamic group that rejects the 
PLO peace accord with Israel, have warned Arafat against stopping their attacks 
on Israelis. Arafat has handled the groups gingerly, fearful a get-tough policy 
could shatter support in Gaza for the still-shaky Palestinian government. 
</P>
<P>
 While Israel and the PLO differ on how to handle Hamas, they agreed in 
Alexandria to work to persuade the international community to deliver funds 
more quickly to the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 In their 11-point statement, issued at the talks' close, the two sides agreed 
they would seek $40 million in immediate aid from donor countries, due to meet 
in Paris next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Those countries have been reluctant to give money to the Palestinian Authority 
for start-up costs, such as police salaries, and the Palestinians have dragged 
their feet on instituting a system of taxation or an accounting mechanism to 
ensure that donations are not misspent. 
</P>
<P>
 But Israeli and Palestinian officials have warned that the self-government 
experiment could collapse unless funds start flowing regularly to the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel also agreed to release by today 249 more prisoners; Jerusalem 
reportedly has offered to release several thousand remaining prisoners if the 
PLO grants a general amnesty to Palestinians in the territories suspected of 
having collaborated with the Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli newspapers reported Thursday that members of the Fatah Hawks, an armed 
group loyal to Arafat, have killed 11 suspected collaborators in the Jericho 
area alone in the last two weeks. Rabin is said to be infuriated by the 
killings and has threatened to stop discussing the release of Palestinian 
prisoners unless the PLO protects suspected collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO and Israel also agreed to invite 400 civilian international observers 
to maintain a temporary presence in the territories beginning in September. 
Their duties must still be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres plans to travel to Gaza today, with Norwegian Foreign Minister Bjorn 
Tore Godal, to meet Arafat. The three plan to lunch together to celebrate the 
Aug. 20, 1993, signing of the Oslo agreement between Israel and the PLO. That 
accord became the framework for the gradual hand-over of government authority 
to the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza by Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres' visit will be the first by a senior Israeli official to Gaza since the 
PLO took over civilian rule there three months ago.

RWANDA REFUGEE FLIGHT BRINGS MISERY TO BUKAVU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mountain forests of Central Africa rise steeply from the banks of Lake 
Kivu at this remote, run-down resort town. The 200,000 or so residents here 
prefer to lift their eyes from the seedy streets and proclaim it the "green 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 But now, under the unstoppable pressure of another Rwandan refugee migration, 
Bukavu is being reduced hour by hour to another squalid cesspool of misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, 50,000 Rwandans have poured into the city, overrunning its parks and 
streets with their makeshift hovels. More press in each hour. The relentless 
chop-chop of machetes has denuded the green city of much of its greenery. The 
air is damp with the reek of human waste and campfire smoke. The fear of 
banditry is palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 And Thursday, the United Nations and relief agencies said the first epidemic 
of disease has taken hold here -- deadly shigella dysentery, resistant to all 
but the most expensive and exotic antibiotics. Cholera and meningitis also are 
reported, although not yet at epidemic levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sanitation is horrible. People are sleeping on top of each other. There are 
problems with water. It is the start of a real disaster," said Samantha N. 
Bolton of the French relief agency Doctors Without Borders. 
</P>
<P>
 To the north, the Zairian border city of Goma already has endured this horror. 
But Bukavu presents its own unsettling challenges as more refugees come 
streaming down the Rwandan roads in epic columns, now more than 100 miles long. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, unlike Goma, this area is densely populated and there are no 
satisfactory sites for refugee camps nearby. Within a 20-mile radius, 12 small 
camps have been established to hold about 55,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Another site was designated Thursday for 60,000 people -- but it is an 
impossible 60 miles away, meaning already weak refugees will have to march 
another four days. Or transportation will have to be found to truck them the 4 
1/2-hour drive over miserable roads. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bad solution, but it's the only one we have," said Kris Janowski of 
the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, shrugging. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical question for this region is how many refugees eventually will end 
up here. About 320,000 Rwandans are now massed in the vicinity of the 
Rwanda-Zaire border. Perhaps another 1 million or 1.5 million are within 
walking distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The region of Rwanda adjacent to Bukavu has been designated a "safe zone" for 
refugees from Rwanda's civil war and is protected by French troops -- but only 
until Monday, when they promise to complete their pullout and leave security to 
U.N. peacekeepers from an assortment of African nations. 
</P>
<P>
 A desperate campaign is under way to persuade the refugees not to stampede 
into Zaire. The effort is led by the French and the United Nations, with 
cooperation from the victorious new government in Rwanda, installed by the 
rebel, Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defeated, Hutu-controlled government is mounting an equally vigorous 
propaganda campaign to propel the refugees into Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, two governments -- the old and the new -- are battling to control 
a substantial chunk of Rwanda's population. And this population, most of it 
poor, uneducated Hutu farmers, wants only its safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of Zaire, meanwhile, are likewise pawns in a larger game of African 
politics. President Mobutu Sese Seko of this economically troubled nation has 
not resisted the refugee influx, despite its bitter toll on his people. 
</P>
<P>
 Western nations cut off most economic aid to the Mobutu government three years 
ago in frustration with his corrupt, authoritarian regime. But now Western 
nations find themselves at his doorstep, asking for his help in the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone seems to think this is a real boon for Mobutu," said one Western 
diplomat. So far, Mobutu has not reached out his hand for renewed Western 
assistance. "But he will, you can be sure," said the diplomat.

CLINTON AGREES TO DEEP CUTS IN CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS and DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unable to get more votes from Democrats without dropping an assault-weapons 
ban, President Clinton agreed Thursday to make major spending cuts in his 
anti-crime initiative in order to win more Republican support for the 
threatened measure, White House and congressional sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 After another day of intensive but largely fruitless efforts to win over a 
handful of elusive votes, Clinton summoned Democratic House and Senate leaders 
to the White House for a crisis session on the crime bill. The legislation has 
been stalled in the House for the last week because of opposition from 
Republicans and conservative Democrats opposed to its ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional sources said after the meeting that, given a choice between 
making the steep cuts Republicans favor in the bill's crime prevention programs 
or siding with approximately 40 conservative Democrats by dropping the 
assault-weapons ban, Clinton opted for more cuts beyond the $1 billion he had 
been offering to shave from the $33-billion bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sources cautioned that no deal had been cut, they said that House 
Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and other Democratic House leaders are 
working on a proposal that would strip more than $3 billion from the bill and 
make other concessions -- but leave the assault-weapons ban intact. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate comment from House GOP leaders, who earlier in the day 
had said they would insist on cuts of at least $5.5 billion -- mostly from the 
$7.4 billion the bill provides for crime prevention programs such as midnight 
basketball leagues and after-school activities for violence-prone youths. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.), the leader of a group of 11 moderate 
Republicans who voted with the Administration when opponents used a procedural 
motion to block the crime bill from coming to the House floor last week, 
indicated earlier that more of his GOP colleagues would vote for the bill if 
Clinton would accept cuts "in the $2-billion to $3-billion range." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic sources said those reductions probably would be accomplished by an 
across-the-board cut of 10% in all of the omnibus bill's prevention and law 
enforcement provisions for an overall savings of about $3.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they said, some of the remaining $6.5 billion in funding for 
crime prevention initiatives likely would be turned into grants that city and 
state governments could use as they see fit -- a concession that would meet 
another Republican demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The concessions were hammered out only after a difficult meeting at which 
Clinton resisted calls from the Democratic leadership to keep the spending 
intact and jettison the assault-weapons ban, White House officials said. 
Clinton will hold a 10:30 a.m. PDT press conference today to answer questions 
about the bill and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressional leaders "wanted to be able to say we did it all with 
Democrats," but Clinton's strategists argued that this would have put the White 
House in the untenable position of arguing in favor of what the public sees as 
"pork," while killing the gun ban, which polls show is among the most popular 
provisions of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (congressional) leadership understands the President's position on the 
assault-weapons ban. It was made very clear to them," one White House official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill proposals were being refined late Thursday night and will be 
"shopped around" to lawmakers Friday in the hope that the measure can be 
brought back to the floor with enough bipartisan support to pass it by Sunday 
or Monday, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a source close to the negotiations cautioned that the proposals still 
are subject to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, this source said, it is by no means certain that the compromise 
would mean passage of the bill because members of the Congressional Black 
Caucus and other liberal lawmakers have threatened to turn against it if 
Clinton agrees to cuts of more than $350 million in crime prevention programs. 
Democratic leaders have been offering cuts in that range to Republicans for 
several days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not clear that we can pick up enough Republicans to compensate for the 
liberals we lose, and if we can't, then it will be back to the drawing boards," 
said another senior Democratic source, who, like everyone else associated with 
the delicate negotiations, would not speak on the record. 
</P>
<P>
 The likelihood of a liberal stampede away from the bill was confirmed earlier 
in the day by Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), who 
said that the 33 caucus members who have thus far agreed to support the bill 
would begin to "drop off" if the crime prevention programs they favor are cut 
by more than $350 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of those members, Reps. Craig Washington (D-Tex.) and Louis Stokes 
(D-Ohio), only reluctantly agreed to support the package Thursday, bringing the 
Administration to within three votes of the 218 it needs to win the procedural 
motion that opponents had been using to block the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither lawmaker, who had opposed the bill because of its expanded death 
penalties, have officially announced their support yet, and a Democratic 
leadership aide said he fears that they may refuse now that the package is 
being changed to make it more acceptable to Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the mood at the White House after the emergency strategy session 
was decidedly more upbeat than it had been just a few hours earlier, when 
frustrated Democrats were talking for the first time about the possibility that 
the crime bill would not pass at all this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to come up with a bill that meets the President's 
objectives, and I think it's going to pass," White House adviser George 
Stephanopoulos said after the meeting between Clinton, Foley, Senate Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt 
(D-Mo.). 
</P>
<P>
 Once the House completes action on the bill, it will move immediately to the 
Senate, where it is expected to pass without difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 Although funding for things like prison construction and additional police 
officers on the streets would also be trimmed back by the cuts, the bill would 
retain such provisions as expanded death penalties for federal offenses, 
legislation to help protect the victims of spousal abuse and the so-called 
"three strikes and you're out" clause mandating sentences of life imprisonment 
for three-time convicted felons. 
</P>
<P>
 Tougher language sought by the Republicans on the registration of paroled 
sexual offenders would also be included in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important for Clinton, however, the bill would retain the 10-year ban on 
the manufacture and sale of 19 assault weapons, which has been fiercely opposed 
by the National Rifle Assn. and other gun lobby groups as well as a broad 
cross-section of Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting back on funding for more police and other anti-crime programs is a 
price that White House aides said Clinton is willing to pay for keeping the 
assault-weapons ban intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get 90% of what we wanted on the spending, 100% of what we wanted on 
assault weapons and a chance to show the President is capable of taking on a 
powerful Washington interest group and winning," said one aide.

NEW U.S. POLICY WILL HOLD CUBANS IN REFUGEE CAMPS; IMMIGRATION: ADMINISTRATION 
PLANS DETENTION CENTERS AFTER AN EMERGENCY APPEAL BY FLORIDA'S GOVERNOR. 
THOUSANDS REPORTEDLY PREPARE TO FLEE THE CASTRO REGIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration, fearing a surge of refugees fleeing Cuba by boat 
and raft, announced Thursday that those who come here will be held in detention 
camps rather than being permitted to settle in Florida or other parts of the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The major policy change, announced late Thursday by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, 
came after an emergency appeal by Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles and intelligence 
reports showing that thousands of Cubans are massing to set sail for America. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno said the Administration wanted to "be sure we did everything we could" to 
discourage Cubans from making the voyage before the refugee situation got out 
of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles said Thursday night that he was delighted with the Administration 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This keeps Castro from being able to call the shots in regard to immigration 
policy," Chiles said. "It also allows us to make sure these people get the 
proper health screening, that other screening is done. Right now, we don't know 
who is coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is trying to stave off a repeat of the Mariel boat lift of 
1980, during which about 125,000 Cubans -- many of them criminals or mentally 
ill -- streamed into South Florida over a five-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 The detention policy, which officials said was approved personally by Clinton 
late Thursday afternoon, was one of several that the Administration has been 
considering since the number of refugees began swelling this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard said its vessels picked up 369 Cubans on Thursday in the 
Florida Straits after a record-breaking 537 Wednesday. Those figures are up 
from a rate of about 300 refugees a day last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno gave no indication where the Administration plans to detain refugees 
picked up at sea, but officials suggested that some could be housed at federal 
installations in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the Administration already has made plans to open tent cities 
to hold about 8,000 refugees at Homestead and Key West, Fla., to serve as 
screening centers. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear Thursday whether refugees would be afforded 
formal hearings to determine whether they should be allowed to settle in the 
United States. Under current law, U.S. officials do not have to accept Cuban 
refugees, but once the refugees are allowed to settle here, they are granted 
immigrant status. 
</P>
<P>
 Key Administration policy-makers said the White House also is considering 
asking other Caribbean countries to accept some Cuban refugees temporarily, as 
Jamaica did in the case of Haitian boat people. Those details were also 
incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also is considering other options, ranging from increasing 
the number of Coast Guard vessels assigned to pick up Cubans to tightening 
pressure on Cuba so it will stop encouraging dissidents to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House also is expected to announce soon a plan to make it easier for 
Cuban nationals to apply for standard immigration visas at the U.S. Interests 
Section in Havana, which functions as an unofficial U.S. embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 The action Thursday amounts to a major policy reversal for the Administration, 
which until now has maintained that it is obliged under the 1966 Cuban 
Adjustment Act to allow all Cuban refugees to settle here. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the law permits the Immigration and Naturalization Service to refuse 
entry to Cubans who do not qualify for immigration status. But since Cuba has 
declined to take them back, such people have no place to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno's announcement came after an emergency meeting of Clinton's top national 
security advisers earlier Thursday, in which policy-makers reviewed the refugee 
situation and discussed possible options for dealing with it. Although Clinton 
did not attend the meeting, officials said he was briefed on it later and 
decided to go ahead with the detention plan. He also talked to Chiles by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles formally declared a state of emergency Thursday in Florida and, in an 
emotional early morning press conference, urged Clinton to make a similar 
proclamation and send more Coast Guard vessels and aid to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that a true emergency exists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, top Administration officials appeared to give Chiles the cold 
shoulder earlier. Reno pooh-poohed Chiles' request, as well as any suggestions 
that the Cuba refugee policy would change, and White House Press Secretary Dee 
Dee Myers dismissed Chile's plea out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been able to handle the surge in Cuban migrants in an orderly fashion 
and we'll continue to do that," Myers had said bluntly. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of refugee aid groups in Miami also expressed skepticism. Ken Tota, 
coordinator of the U.S. Catholic Conference's resettlement effort, said the 
influx looked manageable. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours later, however, leading Administration officials said the White 
House was considering Chiles' request seriously, and Clinton called the Florida 
governor to ask for his suggestions on how to deal with the surge in refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the quick action apparently was prompted by fresh 
intelligence estimates reporting that thousands of Cubans were lining the dock 
at Mariel, waiting to sail to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Castro has not actively promoted the current exodus, as he did in 
1980, officials said he has made clear to dissident Cubans that he will not try 
to stop them if they want to go to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, about 6,872 Cubans have arrived in the United States by sea 
-- up from 3,656 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in recent days have come by homemade boats and even inner tubes, a move 
that Coast Guard officials warn is dangerous in the 90 miles of open sea 
between Cuba and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have said the main difference between the 1980 Mariel boat lift 
and today's situation is that this time Cuban Americans in South Florida are 
not taking their boats to pick up relatives in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Administration has concentrated its efforts on persuading 
Cuban Americans to stay home rather than set sail for Cuban waters. So far, it 
has been reasonably successful, but some officials worry that could change 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the facilities at Homestead and Key West, officials said the 
Administration is planning relocation camps at three dozen sites across the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miami's Little Havana neighborhood Thursday evening, refugees by the 
busload arrived from Key West at two separate facilities, where they were put 
in contact with family members and helped with settlement problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban Americans gathered outside one of the centers, curious to see if loved 
ones were among the new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmin Baas, 51, burst into tears of joy when she spotted a nephew and niece 
through the bus windows. "I feel so happy," she said. "At last they are out of 
Cuba and that's the best thing. They could have died there with no food." 
</P>
<P>
 Baas had left Cuba 15 years earlier with her three children and husband and 
had worried ever since about relatives left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Some refugees who arrived were dirty from their treacherous voyage across the 
Florida Straits. The crowd cheered each time a cluster of refugees emerged from 
the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilberto Blanco, a topographer, arrived on a 23-foot motorboat Thursday 
morning with 20 family members. "We left five houses empty in Havana," he said. 
The last month had been particularly difficult because food was scarce and 
Blanco dropped from a trim 140 to 112 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But food, he said, is not the reason he left. "The most difficult thing in 
Cuba is the way the government obstructs the lives of the people. No one can 
say what they want to say. You can't express your feelings or you will go 
immediately to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 In his press conference Thursday, Chiles declared that the large numbers of 
refugees was creating "an emergency situation for services and assistance," and 
he called on Clinton to invoke a federal contingency plan to provide additional 
help for the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emergency is the direct responsibility of the federal government," he 
said. He called out the Florida National Guard, Marine Patrol, state law 
enforcement department and other state agencies to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles also issued a warning to Cubans, pleading with them not to "risk your 
lives on a very dangerous journey" to the United States. "The Castro government 
is clearly weakening and the day of freedom is near in Cuba," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials clearly were piqued at the stridence of Chiles' appeal, 
particularly since he is a Democrat in a state whose electoral votes Clinton 
will want if he decides to run for reelection. The President did not carry 
Florida in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Chiles, who is facing a tough reelection bid this fall, is worried 
about the burden of immigrants on his state. Earlier this year the state sued 
the federal government for $1.5 billion, Chiles' estimate of the public cost of 
accommodating hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles said then that the refugees threatened to overwhelm the ability of 
state and local agencies to provide housing, health care, education and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States' special treatment of Cuban refugees stems from the 
mid-1960s, when Congress, eager to encourage defections from Castro's Communist 
regime, passed the Cuban Adjustment Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has more than enough slots for the few thousand Cubans each year 
who apply for standard entry visas through the U.S. Interests Section in 
Havana, a kind of unofficial embassy that the United States maintains in the 
Cuban capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Cubans who come to American shores by airplane or boat -- as most among the 
current wave of Cuban asylum-seekers are doing -- have been permitted to stay 
for at least a year and have been granted near-automatic immigrant status after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War-era policy has delighted Cuban Americans in South Florida but it 
has gnawed at leaders of the area's fast-growing Haitian community, who have 
watched their own relatives in Port-au-Prince being turned away from U.S. 
shores and sent back to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian American relief groups have complained bitterly that Haitian 
asylum-seekers -- who in many cases are being subjected to political threats 
similar to those that have plagued the Cubans -- have been discriminated 
against by U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians have a point. Under current law, Haitians who are seeking asylum 
in the United States must prove that they have a well-founded fear of 
persecution in their homeland. If they merely are seeking to come here to 
better their economic plight, they are summarily rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cubans who have come by boat have been admitted with no questions asked 
and have not had to prove that they are escaping from a repressive regime. The 
government has assumed that they are political -- rather than economic -- 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Castro has refused to allow U.S. authorities to return Cuban 
nationals who have been rejected for entry. Except for those sent back after 
the 1980 Mariel boat lift -- after protracted negotiations with the Castro 
government -- Washington has only been able to return one Cuban national in the 
35 years that Castro has been headed the Cuban government.

SENATE GROUP FAVORS MINIMAL HEALTH REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting to words of caution by a top budget expert, a bipartisan group of 
senators Thursday dramatically scaled back their "mainstream" health care 
reform proposal, embracing a minimalist approach that stresses deficit 
reduction and does not attempt to extend coverage to 39 million uninsured 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 By ducking that and other tough decisions, the group is promising far less 
than President Clinton has said he will accept. Still, its long-awaited plan is 
likely to rejuvenate the debate in a stalemated Senate where debate has droned 
on for more than a week as senators have considered the health reform plan of 
Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstream coalition's plan -- expected to be presented to the Senate 
leadership today -- is likely to focus on insurance reform, which is similar to 
a proposal by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.).  
</P>
<P>
 The bipartisan plan, which is expected to try to strike a compromise between 
the Mitchell and Dole proposals, may significantly alter the dynamics of the 
debate, moving it more toward the GOP view. The 15 to 20 members of the 
coalition are considered to be the swing votes for any plan approved by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John B. Breaux (D-La.), a coalition leader, called the mainstream plan "a 
good faith, last-ditch effort" to enact health care reform this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is far from clear that Senate liberals and other moderates will accept 
such a proposal. The still-uncompleted plan, as described late Thursday by 
senators involved in its drafting, is certain to incur the wrath of liberals, 
labor unions, the elderly and other groups that would lose an array of benefits 
promised by the President and his congressional allies in their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition's abrupt change in direction came after a Thursday morning 
meeting with Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office. 
He indicated to the group that its original intention of expanding coverage 
through insurance reforms and government subsidies -- without significant 
revenue-raising devices -- would create a shortfall of several hundred billion 
dollars in the years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 That sent grim-faced senators back to their drawing boards in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a shock," Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) said after the Reischauer 
briefing. "We got a reality check," added Breaux. 
</P>
<P>
 After they emerged Thursday evening, the coalition senators said they were 
ready to offer a bare-bones reform agenda that, above all, would reduce the 
deficit -- even if that means little, if any, government subsidies to help the 
needy buy insurance. Details of how the plan would reduce the deficit were 
unclear Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the process of shrinking back to the basics," said Sen. David L. 
Boren (D-Okla.), adding that the coalition was considering little more than 
insurance reforms that would ban discriminatory industry practices to broaden 
consumer access to insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks more and more like that's the only thing we can do this year," Boren 
said. "We all have sticker shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the opposition that it will engender, the coalition's approach holds 
considerable political appeal. It would provide a convenient cover for senators 
who fear facing voters in November empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to do something constructive in an atmosphere of fear," Breaux 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another coalition member, who asked to remain anonymous, added: "It's hard to 
tell who's running for cover and who's trying to get a bill." 
</P>
<P>
 The "mainstream" approach is vulnerable to attack on a central point: 
Enactment of insurance market reforms without at the same time quickly 
extending coverage to all will worsen matters in the long run, many health 
analysts, economists and the President have asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 They say such "incremental" reforms in the absence of a universal coverage 
requirement will drive up rates for those with insurance. The rates would go up 
because the sick would have access to insurance and many healthy people likely 
would opt not to buy insurance, knowing that they could buy it if they became 
ill. In turn, the insurance pool would include sicker people and rates could go 
up enough to put insurance out of reach for many. 
</P>
<P>
 But "mainstream" coalition members were not conceding that point Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health care reform should reduce the deficit," said Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.). 
"You may not cover as many as you'd like. . . . The problem is, this is 
expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance market reforms, he added, could "dramatically" improve matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaux acknowledged that the group's bill will have "less than what George 
Mitchell has, but more than what Bob Dole has." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's plan aims for 95% coverage by the year 2000, relying also on 
voluntary measures and a variety of insurance reforms and subsidies to the 
needy. But it would trigger an employer mandate by 2002 in states that did not 
achieve 95% coverage, requiring large businesses to pay at least 50% of a 
worker's premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's bill would rely on voluntary measures and insurance reforms while 
offering less generous subsidies to help people buy insurance as a way to 
expand coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The mainstream coalition's bill will not contain any form of an employer 
mandate, according to Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), another group member. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members said that their plan would slowly phase in subsidies for the 
needy and that it will contain a "fail-safe" mechanism to ensure that subsidies 
are not so generous as to create unanticipated budget deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fail-safe is the essential ingredient," Breaux said. "You set a baseline 
and don't go over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), who once offered his own universal coverage plan 
and is now a leader of the coalition, said that the group's plan would provide 
for "very, very basic but important changes to our health care system." 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate began its health care debate last week. But as day after day passed 
with virtually no progress, the work of the mainstream group assumed increasing 
importance. 
</P>
<P>
 Many senators pinned their hopes on the group's work as it became clear that 
Mitchell did not command sufficient support for passage of his plan, which is 
backed by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition plan also is expected to considerably scale back the role of 
government and red tape in Mitchell's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition had not reached agreement Thursday night on the question of 
taxation, members said. One area still to be determined is the size of a tax on 
cigarettes, with discussions focused on a range between 45 cents to $1 per 
pack. Another was some variation of a 25% tax on health plans that exceed 
annual price-increase ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially the most controversial part of the plan -- a measure still under 
discussion -- would be a tax on the health benefits that individuals receive 
from their employers.

DEAR BOSS: WE WON. BYE; INSURANCE FIRM LOSES ENTIRE DEPARTMENT WHEN 4 LOTTO 
MILLIONAIRES QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Four co-workers at an Irvine insurance company fulfilled just about every 
employee's fantasy Thursday: They promptly quit their jobs after winning a 
share of the $20-million lottery jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's investment in a winning SuperLotto ticket (which came to $3.25 
each for 13 quick picks) catapulted them from "unimportant, unlucky" claims 
processors at Fidelity National Title Insurance Co. to millionaires, they said 
at a news conference at a California Lottery district office. 
</P>
<P>
 The four friends will be sharing $6.8 million of Wednesday's $20-million 
jackpot. That means they each will receive $85,250 a year, before taxes, over 
the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other winning tickets have not been turned in yet, lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of the four Fidelity workers means the 150-employee Irvine 
branch will lose an entire department. Their boss, however, remained sanguine 
about the turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the claims payment processing department," said Frank P. Willey, 
executive vice president of Fidelity. "We'll hire new people unless they end up 
reconsidering. Maybe their euphoria will temper a little. It'll be business as 
usual." 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no signs of waning excitement as the four women checked off a 
list of "to do's" with their first check. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they declined to say how much they made at Fidelity, they said it was 
"much less" than what they will be getting in lottery money each year. And 
there were no mentions of returning to work -- except maybe to help train the 
new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had a picture of (Willey's) face when we told him," said Suzanne 
Seibold, 40, of Westminister. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina DiGeorge, 22, of Garden Grove had worked in the department for only a 
week when she adopted 13 as the group's lucky number and urged co-worker Debra 
Larson to buy 13 quick pick tickets at a liquor store in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Seibold had to scrounge in her purse for enough money to pay for the lottery 
tickets, she said. Karla Bresette, 22, of Westminister also contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson, 31, of Garden Grove said: "We just went nuts" when lottery officials 
verified their good fortune Wednesday at 8:08 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were yelling, crying, screaming. It was pandemonium," Larson said 
breathlessly.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; PROP. 187; IMMIGRANT MEASURE FOES OPEN DRIVE; A COALITION 
INCLUDING SHERIFF SHERMAN BLOCK ATTACKS BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT WOULD WITHHOLD 
PUBLIC SERVICES TO THOSE HERE ILLEGALLY. ITS CO-AUTHOR ACCUSES THEM OF 
APPEALING TO PUBLIC FEARS. 
</P>

 Charging that passage of Proposition 187 could lead to increases in juvenile 
crime and deadly disease, a broad-based coalition of educational, political and 
medical officials kicked off their campaign Thursday against the so-called 
"Save Our State" initiative that would deny a wide range of public services to 
illegal immigrants and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am as concerned about illegal immigration and its impact on this state as 
anyone else," said Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block. "But Proposition 
187 does not address the problem in any fashion and, in fact, to my mind, 
actually exacerbates the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Block addressed a news conference outside the Los Angeles County Jail along 
with leaders of organizations including the California State PTA, California 
School Boards Assn., California Teachers Assn. and American College of 
Emergency Physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in a telephone interview, Harold Ezell, co-author of the ballot 
measure, spoke confidently about the initiative's chances for success and also 
accused opponents of appealing to public fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Several speakers at the Los Angeles gathering acknowledged that Proposition 
187 is a "hot button" issue offering alternatives that sound attractive, at 
first glance, to voters tired of illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 But the initiative, they said, could prove counterproductive by booting as 
many as 400,000 youths out of public schools and by denying basic medical care 
and immunizations to those without proper documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would put children out on the streets and quite frankly, we know what 
happens with dropouts," said Pat Dingsdale, president of the state PTA. "The 
writers of this initiative did not do their homework." 
</P>
<P>
 "You simply cannot do disease control selectively," said Dr. Thomas Peters, 
chairman of the Assn. of Bay Area Health Officials. "I've been a public health 
official in California for 20 years and I have never seen a more direct 
assault, a more direct threat, on the public health of all Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 Initiative opponents also cited a report by the nonpartisan state legislative 
analyst's office that says California risks losing up to $15 billion a year in 
federal funds because of conflicts between the initiative and federal privacy 
and non-discrimination rules. Most of the money in peril would be federal child 
welfare and medical funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of how large a tax hike would be necessary to cover that cost," said 
Vilma Martinez, a Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the anti-Proposition 187 forces acknowledged that coalition members 
span a wide spectrum in regard to how to best deal with illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Block called for tough new policing efforts at the nation's borders to keep 
out illegal immigrants, a stand not universally endorsed by opponents of the 
November ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main point, all agreed, is that Proposition 187 will not work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been called everything from stupid to courageous for taking a stand on 
this issue," said Block. "But Proposition 187 is a hoax." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell had other words Thursday to describe the sheriff and his opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far back as Block and his gospel band are in the polls, they need to 
strike up the band and get the people out," said Ezell, former top Western 
administrator of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service. "But they're 
not going to change public opinion, which has been growing in saying something 
has to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell accused opponents of spreading misinformation in citing the potential 
$15-billion cost and in raising the specter of 400,000 public school students 
out on the streets. If the ballot measure is approved, he said, it would first 
trigger a court challenge to a landmark 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that 
stated that illegal immigrant children are entitled to a public school 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the reason we put this on Proposition 187 -- to go back and revisit 
the 1982 decision," Ezell said. "There's no 300,000 or 400,000 little kids 
going to be turned out of school when this thing passes. Who knows when it will 
get to the Supreme Court?" 
</P>
<P>
 As for medical care, Ezell emphasized that the measure would not affect 
emergency treatment. "But as far as giving free medical aid to every other 
person here illegally, you have to say no. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's immunizations," Ezell continued, "let some of the private groups pay 
for some of this stuff. Let MALDEF open a clinic for it. Let the Ford 
Foundation pay for that."

BOUTROS-GHALI URGES U.N. WARNING TO SOMALI WARLORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a somber report, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged the Security 
Council on Thursday to warn feuding Somali warlords to reconcile by September's 
end or face the possible withdrawal of all U.N. peacekeepers from their 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 His careful words, etched with pessimism, underscored the prospect that 
then-President George Bush's dispatch of more than 25,000 Marines to Somalia 
beginning in December, 1992, and the large U.N. peacekeeping operations that 
followed will prove to have done little to untangle the Somalis' political 
turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali blamed the depressing situation on the continual feuding between 
Mogadishu warlords Ali Mahdi Mohamed and Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid. 
</P>
<P>
 He lamented the failure of both the United States and the United Nations to 
disarm them. Bush refused to involve U.S. Marines in general disarmament, and 
President Clinton persuaded the United Nations to call off all aggressive 
engagements after 18 Rangers died in October, 1993, in an abortive U.N. manhunt 
for Aidid. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the Clinton Administration, which has withdrawn all American 
troops from the peacekeeping mission, has urged the United Nations to reduce 
the number of its troops to save money. The United Nations now has 18,760 
peacekeeping troops in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boutros-Ghali -- while accepting limited reductions -- proposed holding 
off substantial cuts while giving Mahdi and Aidid until the end of September to 
reach a peace settlement. The secretary general acknowledged that "the omens do 
not appear promising." 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, he said that "lack of progress in disarmament, as well as 
factional disputes, inter-clan rivalries and conflicts, have made it impossible 
to proceed with the establishment of a central administrative mechanism." 
</P>
<P>
 He mostly blamed feuding within the Hawiye clan -- to which both Mahdi and 
Aidid belong. He said dissension and tension among all 15 political factions of 
Somalia "are also by and large attributable to rivalries within the Hawiye 
clan." 
</P>
<P>
 Mahdi and Aidid have promised to take part in a Hawiye reconciliation 
conference, Boutros-Ghali said, "but there are . . . no clear signs that 
preparations for a Hawiye conference are under way." Still, he proposed that 
the Security Council wait a few more weeks to see if the Hawiyes convene one. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing the numbers of troops, he said that it would be possible to cut the 
force to 17,200 by the end of September and even to 15,000 without preventing 
it from carrying out its mandate. Peacekeepers now have authority mainly to 
guard airports and seaports, escort relief convoys, protect the premises of 
humanitarian groups and organize a police force and judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Boutros-Ghali confessed to "grave misgivings about the seriousness of 
their (the Somali factions') commitment to peace and national reconciliation," 
he said it is too early to conclude the U.N. mission "cannot achieve the 
objectives for which it was established." 
</P>
<P>
 The mission's U.N. mandate expires March 31. Boutros-Ghali said "there might 
even be a case for extending the mission . . . if national reconciliation can 
be achieved and an interim government established by the end of 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 But an end to the peacekeeping mission could also halt relief operations, 
since there would no longer be troops to protect aid workers.

MANDELA PLEASED WITH PROGRESS AFTER 100 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 100 days as president of the new South Africa, Nelson Mandela surveyed 
the national landscape Thursday and pronounced himself more than satisfied with 
the progress so far. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech before a joint session of Parliament, he praised what he called 
the collective success of the black-led coalition government that was elected 
in April on a wave of national euphoria to create a multiracial democracy after 
generations of harsh white rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "A hundred days after our inauguration, our overwhelming impression of our 
reality is that our nation has succeeded to handle its problems with great 
wisdom," said Mandela, who wiped his eyes often during the speech as a result 
of a recent operation for cataracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a government that has brought together bitter enemies into a 
constructive relationship," he added. "Our Parliament and Cabinet have properly 
focused on the task of reconstruction and development. And we have a government 
that is in control and whose programs are on course." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela's opening months in office, however, have brought no significant 
change in the lives of most South Africans. Most of the ambitious programs that 
he promised during his campaign to improve the welfare of the impoverished 
black majority have yet to begin and budget limits suggest that at least some 
of the soaring goals may be impossible to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither has economic chaos, social anarchy and racial war come to pass, as 
many had feared. Nor is it likely. Independent analysts, opposition politicians 
and Western diplomats generally give high marks to the young government and the 
courtly, 76-year-old president in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, a public opinion poll suggests most voters are satisfied. 
According to a survey published Wednesday in the Star, a Johannesburg 
newspaper, 60% of blacks and whites believe the nation's blighted race 
relations have improved since the election and only 4% think conditions have 
worsened. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll said public fears of uncontrolled violence and crime have dropped 
significantly. Indeed, half of those polled said the new South Africa was 
better than they had expected; only 9% believed it was worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whites are satisfied," said Willie Breytenbach, professor of political 
science at the University of Stellenbosch. "That's the irony. Whites don't feel 
any difference whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 "The honeymoon persists," said Bill Johnson, an analyst with the nonpartisan 
Institute of Multi-Party Democracy in Durban. ". . . But the speed of change is 
much slower than (Mandela) thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheer logistics is one reason. Besides trying to draft a new set of policies 
and programs to redress inequities of the past, the new government has spent 
much of the last three months simply moving offices, finding staff and learning 
the complexities of a vast bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has focused on its Reconstruction and Development Program, a 
sweeping plan to reorganize services and policies. About $700 million has been 
taken from existing budgets and will be used in coming months to kick-start 
efforts on housing, health care, job creation and education.

DEFENSE; NATO TURNS TO TASK OF FILLING WOERNER'S SHOES; THERE IS NO CLEAR 
SUCCESSOR TO THE ALLIANCE'S LATE SECRETARY GENERAL, WHO HAD TRANSFORMED THE 
POST. OFFICIALS SAY AN ACTIVE, INNOVATIVE LEADER IS NEEDED. 
</P>

<P>
 As senior ministers from NATO's 16 member nations gather here today at a 
commemorative service for the alliance's late secretary general, Manfred 
Woerner, they will start to address the crucial issue of succession. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Woerner, who died here Saturday, had been fighting a losing battle 
against cancer for more than two years, there has been little thought given to 
a successor. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, ambassadors to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization wanted to 
believe Woerner's own conviction that he had defeated the disease and would 
resume his full schedule next month. And with no obvious candidate, such debate 
was avoided as potentially divisive. 
</P>
<P>
 For several reasons, the choice of a successor has never been more important 
to the future of NATO -- America's most successful and enduring military 
alliance: 
</P>
<P>
 * During his six years as secretary general, Woerner transformed the job from 
one dominated largely by thankless administrative tasks to one of genuine 
power. He laid out a new agenda for NATO in the post-Cold War era, then lobbied 
effectively to get the backing of member states. 
</P>
<P>
 * While Woerner was instrumental in defining NATO's new direction -- one that 
calls for changed relations with the former enemy nations of Central and 
Eastern Europe, a strengthening of the European role in alliance actions and a 
new job as a U.N.-endorsed peacekeeper -- the alliance has taken only initial, 
tentative steps in all three areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a clear idea of what's to be done, but it's all just started," an 
alliance diplomat said. "This is no time for a caretaker. We've got to keep 
moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
 * With defense no longer the compelling issue it was during the four decades 
when a nuclear-laden Soviet Union threatened the West's very existence, NATO 
governments today tend to be far less focused on alliance affairs -- a fact 
that generates a power vacuum that can only be filled by an active, innovative 
secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner used this new environment to develop and then effectively sell his 
agenda. If his successor fails to do the same, the alliance itself could 
flounder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woerner made the job much bigger than it was," said a senior NATO official 
here, who declined to be identified by name or nationality. "Whether this is 
sustained depends mainly on who takes over." 
</P>
<P>
 The real search for a successor is expected to get under way next week after 
Woerner is laid to rest following a private ceremony in his home region of 
southwestern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, more than a dozen names float through informal chats at NATO 
headquarters, but doubt surrounds them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Those most frequently mentioned include former Norwegian Foreign Minister 
Thorvald Stoltenberg, who is currently attempting to mediate the war in the 
former Yugoslav federation; former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers; the 
European Union External Affairs Commissioner Hans van den Broek, and former 
Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right choice has to be a convinced Atlanticist, have a good feel for the 
needs of Eastern Europe and be close to the European Union's attempts to build 
a defense profile," said Uwe Nehrlich, deputy director of a German defense 
think tank near Munich known as the Ebenhausen Institute. "None of these have 
all three." 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian Foreign Minister Willy Claes; his British counterpart, Douglas Hurd; 
and former Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen are also discussed, but 
their interest in the job is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, nationality will play a role. An American is ruled out because the 
United States already holds the alliance's most senior military posts. 
Luxembourg and Iceland carry too little weight. The Turkish-Greek dispute over 
Cyprus would appear to rule out anyone from those two countries, and another 
German is highly unlikely to succeed Woerner. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO officials anticipate southern European nations may stake a claim to the 
job on grounds that only one of NATO's seven secretaries general has come from 
south of the Alps (Italy's Manlio Brosio, who served 1965-71), but this alone 
will not be enough, they insist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job has become too important to go to someone just because he's the right 
caste," noted one official. 
</P>
<P>
 While opinions differ on candidates, there is unanimity on one issue: that a 
divisive debate resulting in a weak, ineffectual compromise choice must be 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Woerner legacy is fragile," summed up a senior NATO source. "We 
desperately need someone with the perseverance and drive to keep us on our 
way." In the Running

CRIME; RECENT INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE AGAINST CHILDREN SHOCK CAIRO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In this crumbling metropolis where being an adult is difficult enough, the 
case of 7-year-old Emad Nagah Madi has the city wondering what is happening to 
its children. 
</P>
<P>
 Emad, like millions of other Egyptian children, took a job in an auto 
upholstery shop instead of going to school, to help make ends meet for the 
family. About a month ago, the shopkeeper next door sent him to fetch a 
sandwich. Emad must have grumbled. The man pulled him over to an air 
compressor, inserted the hose in his anus and turned it on. 
</P>
<P>
 Emad was left rolling in pain in the dust, his intestines ripped open. Now he 
lies in a hospital bed in downtown Cairo with a colostomy bag attached to his 
stomach. Guards stand outside the door; they fear his stepmother will snatch 
him away to prevent him from testifying against the shop owner, who police 
believe has paid the family to keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which has launched an uproar in Egypt, is only the worst of many 
incidents of violence against children in recent months in a country largely 
unaccustomed to any kind of violent crime: 
</P>
<P>
 * A 17-year-old boy was drenched in gasoline and set afire in front of his 
mother in the southern Cairo suburb of Maadi after his mother, who reputedly 
was fencing stolen goods, had a falling-out with her alleged suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last month, a 10-year-old boy who worked in a bakery had his hand held 
inside the roaring oven by an angry employer. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 9-year-old boy working in an auto repair shop earlier this year had his 
skull fractured when he was hit with a wrench by an angry boss. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 12-year-old girl working as a maid was repeatedly tied down and tortured 
with a spoon heated on a stove. She had suffered severe burns by the time 
police interceded. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologists, law enforcement officials and psychiatrists say that such 
incidents reflect a number of social factors working together to destabilize 
Egyptian families. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of families have become effectively fatherless in recent years as 
Egyptian men have migrated to Europe and the oil-rich Persian Gulf countries 
for higher-paying jobs. Families are increasingly penny-pinched as inflation 
has sent prices soaring, and it is now not uncommon to send a child as young as 
7 or 8 out to get a job paying as little as $1 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Center for Sociological Research has estimated that 2 million to 
3 million Egyptian children have forgone school to take jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian law allows 12-year-olds to enter the job market, but not in dangerous 
fields such as heavy industry or mines, nor in places that would present a 
moral hazard, such as nightclubs.  
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say there is as yet no trend toward violence against 
children. "The man who committed the attack on Emad is a sadist, and whether he 
had a child or an adult standing in front of him, he would have done the same 
thing," said Capt. Hussein Sawah, deputy director of Cairo's youth crimes 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem in most of these cases is due to the social changes that occurred 
in the last couple of decades: economic and political reasons that led to a 
deterioration in situations for a large number of families, that eventually 
were forced to put children to work," said Ahmed Magdoub of the national social 
research center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is a very complicated one. It is very easy to say children should 
be in school, not working. But you cannot tell these people to take their 
children to school and starve."

N. KOREA SUCCESSION 'NOT FALLING INTO PLACE'; ASIA: DELAY IN PUBLIC TRANSFER OF 
POWER TO LATE RULER'S SON LEADS TO SPECULATION, CONCERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 American experts on Korea are beginning to wonder whether, as Shakespeare 
might put it, something is rotten in Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks after the death of President Kim Il Sung, the succession of his son 
and political heir, Kim Jong Il, is still mysteriously incomplete. American 
specialists are no longer as confident as they were last month that the younger 
Kim will consolidate his power as the new North Korean leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Any power struggle in Pyongyang could hamper North Korea's ability to carry 
out agreements to terminate its nuclear weapons program, one of the top 
priorities of American foreign policy. North Korean and U.S. officials in 
Geneva entered into a first, tentative agreement on nuclear issues last week 
and are scheduled to meet again next month for further negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are not falling into place," said James Lilley of the American 
Enterprise Institute, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea. "You get these 
gnawing signs that something is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The signs of possible disarray fall into two categories: 
</P>
<P>
 * First, the lack of any formal confirmation of Kim Jong Il's accession to 
power. There has been no meeting of the Korean Workers' Party to name Kim as 
its new chairman. Nor has he been appointed North Korea's official head of 
state. In fact, the most important new title he acquired was head of the 
organizing committee for his father's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second, Kim Jong Il has not given any speeches, met with foreign diplomats 
in Pyongyang or assumed any other public role beyond attending his father's 
carefully staged funeral. His seclusion has fueled old speculation that Kim 
might have some sort of debilitating or embarrassing health problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The American specialists cautioned that no one knows for sure what is 
happening in Pyongyang, one of the world's most secretive places. And many 
warned that it is too early to draw any firm conclusions about Kim Jong Il's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said one thing is already clear. "He simply isn't going to have the 
same unchallenged authority as his father," said Selig Harrison of the Carnegie 
Endowment for International Peace. "There's going to be more broad-based 
decision-making." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, who has made frequent visits to Pyongyang, said he believes it is 
still too soon to say whether there is a power struggle brewing within the 
North Korean leadership. But he acknowledges that "if, by the first of October, 
there were still no changes (to confirm Kim Jong Il's status as the North 
Korean leader), it would raise questions in my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. intelligence officials are similarly perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody can figure out why they haven't had any convocation (of the Korean 
Workers' Party leadership) yet," admitted one intelligence specialist. "Why is 
it taking so long?" 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility for the delay is that Kim Jong Il is trying to extend the 
mourning for his father as long as possible, in hopes that North Korea's 
reverence for Kim Il Sung will be transferred to his son and political heir. A 
long mourning would also give Kim Jong Il more time to work behind the scenes 
at consolidating his power. 
</P>
<P>
 Another theory, advanced by some South Korean officials, is that Kim Jong Il 
may be waiting for some special, propitious occasion to formally assume power. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are several dates, like Sept. 9, the anniversary of the founding of the 
North Korean republic, and Oct. 10, the date of the founding of the party," 
South Korean Ambassador to Washington Han Seung Soo said. "I think they're 
trying to choose a good date." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no sign of activity by Kim Jong Il, the Korea watchers 
pointed out that neither is there much evidence of other political activity in 
Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we don't see any signs of the North Korean military or 
security forces behaving in a way that's going to threaten him," one senior 
U.S. intelligence official asserted. "There's no sign of any political 
opposition (to Kim Jong Il) building up." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest mystery of all is why Kim Jong Il has avoided all speeches and 
public appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Kim, 52, had been groomed to assume power for almost two decades 
before his father's death. He had, by many reports, taken over increasingly 
active control of day-to-day affairs in North Korea in his father's last years. 
He had already taken over as commander in chief of the armed forces in 
December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't a new leader, in a nation whose economy has recently been contracting 
at the rate of 5% a year, want to address his people? Apparently not in North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Korea specialists noted that Kim Jong Il has always been something of a 
recluse. He avoided seeing foreign visitors in Pyongyang for years, most 
recently when former President Jimmy Carter visited last June for talks on 
nuclear issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was surprising when North Korea announced that no foreign leaders 
would be invited to Kim Il Sung's funeral. And it raised eyebrows when 
television footage of the funeral ceremonies showed Kim Jong Il looking 
haggard, expressionless and, most of all, speechless. 
</P>
<P>
 In public, at least, nothing has been heard from him since. 
</P>
<P>
 There long have been reports that Kim Jong Il suffered from some physical 
problem that impaired his ability to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison is convinced that Kim Jong Il is in good health. He pointed out that 
Bo Hi Pak, an official of the Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church and 
publisher of the Washington Times, last month visited Pyongyang for Kim Il 
Sung's funeral and afterward reported that the younger Kim seemed to be fine. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, Kim Jong Il's continuing silence underscores the remarkably 
secretive nature of North Korea's political system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (North Korean officials) haven't decided when to let this guy (Kim Jong 
Il) out of the closet," said one perplexed U.S. intelligence official. 
"(President) Clinton is on the air every 35 seconds. This guy is going to be 
lucky if he's on TV three times in a year."

SRI LANKA PREMIER IN PARENTS' FOOTSTEPS; ASIA: APPOINTMENT ENDS SUSPENSE 
ENGENDERED BY ELECTION IN WHICH NO PARTY WON A MAJORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A dynamic if largely untested opposition leader -- whose parents both served 
as prime minister of Sri Lanka -- was asked Thursday by the island nation's 
president to assume the job herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of Chandrika Kumaratunga ended tremendous suspense and tension 
sparked by Tuesday's hard-fought parliamentary election, in which no single 
party won a clear majority. 
</P>
<P>
 After some negotiating, Kumaratunga's socialist People's Alliance, the top 
vote-getter Tuesday, said it had assured itself of the support of several 
smaller Tamil and Muslim parties, guaranteeing it control of the 225-seat 
Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 She was supposed to form a Cabinet and be sworn in today. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination of the 49-year-old leftist by President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga 
was in the grand dynastic tradition that has become common in the Indian 
subcontinent, often with a sinister sub-current of tragedy and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's father was his country's leader 
before he was deposed in 1977 and executed. Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's prime 
minister, is the widow of an assassinated president. In India, the largest and 
most influential country in the region, power was long held by the Nehru clan 
-- Jawaharlal Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi, and her son Rajiv Gandhi. Only 
Nehru died of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga may be the world's first head of government to succeed both 
parents in that office. Her father, Solomon Bandaranaike, prime minister in the 
1950s, was assassinated in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 The mantle of leadership in the socialist Sri Lankan Freedom Party, 
Bandaranaike's creation, then passed to his widow and Chandrika's mother, 
Sirimavo Bandaranaike. She became the world's first woman prime minister in 
1960-65 and 1970-77, and was the titular leader of the People's Alliance that 
on Tuesday handed Wijetunga's ruling United National Party its first general 
election defeat in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga's feisty mother has tapped her to become the Freedom Party leader. 
It is not a job the new prime minister has acknowledged coveting. "I still hope 
that somebody, someone would fall from the heavens to take up the leadership so 
I can just be there to do the work," she said this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Her own bitter experience probably lies at the root of her reluctance. In 
1972, she abandoned studies for a doctorate in developmental economics at the 
Sorbonne in Paris, in part to help her husband, actor Vijaya Kumaratunga, 
campaign for a Parliament seat. In 1988, after the couple formed a socialist 
opposition party, anti-government radicals assassinated Vijaya. Facing death 
threats herself, Kumaratunga fled to Britain with their two young children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her life has been a hard fight, marred by tragedy," commented Leslie 
Dahanaike, editor of the Sunday Observer, a Sri Lankan weekly. "Both her father 
and her husband were killed. It was a hard fight to come to the top." 
</P>
<P>
 She returned to Sri Lanka in 1990, formed another party that proved 
unsuccessful, then joined her mother's Freedom Party. When her brother Anura 
turned his back on his family and joined the ruling United National Party, 
their mother chose Kumaratunga as deputy party boss and said if they won 
Tuesday's national election, she would be the party's choice for prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 As charismatic a stump speaker as her mother, Kumaratunga was elected chief 
minister of Sri Lanka's largest province last year. In March, she led the 
People's Alliance to a stunning win in regional elections in the south. And 
while her mother recovered from foot surgery, she led the Alliance's national 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 During the campaign, Kumaratunga pledged to continue Sri Lanka's free-market 
policies, but as an avowed socialist, advocated "capitalism with a human face." 
She also promised to travel to the heart of Sri Lanka's Tamil country and talk 
"unconditionally" to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who have been 
fighting since 1983 for a separate state for their ethnic minority.  
</P>
<P>
 The Tamil rebels are reportedly ready to meet her. On Thursday, in the 
Liberation Tigers' first reaction to the election results, London-based 
spokesman Anton Raja said, "We are very happy she is willing to talk to us. We 
are also willing." Asked specifically if the Tigers would lay down their guns, 
Raja replied, "We will, after the talks." 
</P>
<P>
 Kumaratunga will succeed Ranil Wickremasinghe, a member of the United National 
Party.

QUAKE IN ALGERIA LEAVES 150 DEAD, 289 HURT

<P>
 A powerful earthquake killed at least 150 people in northwestern Algeria on 
Thursday, striking as they slept and spreading panic through villages and towns 
in the Mascara region. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 5.6, according to the Algerian Center 
for Astrophysical Research, and was followed by a series of aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 289 people were injured and 8,000 to 10,000 were left homeless by the 
pre-dawn quake, local rescue officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of straw-and-mud brick dwellings collapsed on their sleeping 
occupants. Where structures remained intact, terrified survivors ran into the 
streets to keep worried vigils for aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Algerian authorities sent troops to help in search and rescue missions. 
Western agencies weighed whether to also send in aid teams because of threats 
by Islamic extremists against foreigners.

 Bosnian Serb leaders announced they will formally seek to link their 
territories with the rump Yugoslavia and Serbian-held parts of Croatia.The move 
appeared timed to increase Bosnian Serb opposition to an internationally 
negotiated peace plan that would require the Serbs to give up nearly a third of 
the 70% of Bosnia they control. Bosnian Serbs are to vote on the proposal Aug. 
27-28. The rebels also withdrew permission for the evacuation of dangerously 
ill women and children from the Muslim enclave of Gorazde.

 Police sealed off key trade union buildings in Lagos, enforcing Nigerian 
military ruler Gen. Sani Abacha's crackdown on striking oil workers trying to 
drive him from power. Oil union leaders, sacked from their posts by Abacha on 
Wednesday, vowed to continue their six-week strike, which has disrupted fuel 
deliveries and paralyzed the economy. Sources said the effect of Abacha's 
crackdown would not be known until Monday because of a holiday weekend starting 
today.

SPECTER OF MARIEL BOAT LIFT IS RAISED -- 14 YEARS LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been 14 years since 125,000 Cuban refugees flooded U.S. shores after 
President Fidel Castro permitted them to leave the port of Mariel in small 
boats in what one U.S. official called "population warfare." 
</P>
<P>
 They came across the Florida Straits in droves, overwhelming resettlement 
agencies and refugee camps. Castro warned then, as he has done recently, that 
Washington's policy of accepting Cuban immigrants while granting few visas 
encourages illegal efforts to leave his country. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians said that the flotilla was spurred by social unrest in Havana and 
the promise of economic opportunity in the United States. When Castro announced 
that he would permit Cubans who wanted to leave the country to sail for Florida 
from Mariel in April, 1980, hundreds chartered boats. Cuban Americans in 
Southern Florida used their own boats to help transport refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after Castro's announcement, then-President Jimmy Carter said that 
the United States would "welcome the Cuban refugees with open arms and open 
hearts." Carter later asked Castro to help regulate the influx of immigrants 
and instructed the Coast Guard to prevent further boat lifts on May 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard was spending nearly $700,000 a day to stem the flow of 
immigrants but its efforts largely failed because the sheer numbers of boats 
leaving Cuba overwhelmed them. Cutters seized more than 1,400 small craft but 
many more slipped through. 
</P>
<P>
 The exodus continued until September, when a Castro order ended it. By then 
Cuban immigrants had flooded the nation's processing centers and begun staging 
hunger strikes to protest lengthy detention as they awaited resettlement. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 8,000 criminals and hundreds of mentally ill refugees -- 
apparently released from Cuban institutions by Castro -- were among the 
refugees who flooded into Florida and other states. About 1,100 of the refugees 
-- some convicted of crimes in this country -- still are held in federal 
prisons without the right to legal immigrant status. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the refugees are now U.S. citizens, immigration experts said. Many 
settled in the Miami area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the criminal activity surfaced, Marielito (a term for those who came to 
the United States in the exodus) became like a bad word," said Juan Clark, a 
Miami sociologist. "Once the rotten apples were weeded out, the whole thing 
changed and today you don't hear that word much any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Beach police officials reported that the city's crime rate soared by 30% 
in the first three months of the flotilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton called out National Guardsmen in June 2, 1980, 
to deal with rioting by hundreds of Cuban refugees, who were held at Ft. 
Chafee, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Cuban criminals were held in a federal penitentiary in Atlanta, where 
they rioted and set fires in 1984, causing $1 million in damage.

REFUGEES 'RISK THEIR LIVES,' RENO SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The text of Atty. Gen. Janet Reno's announcement Thursday night concerning 
detention of Cuban refugees: 
</P>
<P>
 Again today we have seen a significant number of Cubans take to sea on unsafe 
rafts and risk their lives to flee the failing policies of the Cuban 
regime.This exodus is encouraged by the Cuban government and shows callous 
disregard for the lives of its citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to deter more Cubans from risking their lives, effective 
immediately the Immigration and Naturalization Service will detain all 
individuals interdicted. The detention of these people will continue pending a 
determination of how they should be processed by the INS.

IBM URGES WORKERS TO DEFEAT HEALTH CARE BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 International Business Machines Corp.'s management has urged the company's 
110,000 employees to work to defeat two Democratic health care reform bills in 
Congress, the New York Times reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
 The paper said the message was sent out to employees in a memo on the 
company's internal electronic mail network Monday. The memo is believed to be 
the first of its kind for IBM, which has a tradition of keeping politics out of 
its communications with employees, the newspaper said.

TREASURY LAWYER TIED TO WHITEWATER QUITS; INQUIRY: JEAN HANSON BECOMES THE 
SECOND SENIOR AIDE TO RESIGN IN TWO DAYS. HER TESTIMONY BEFORE CONGRESS 
ANTAGONIZED DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jean Hanson, the Treasury Department's general counsel, became the second 
senior Treasury official in two days to resign in the wake of Congress' recent 
Whitewater hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson, 45, had antagonized other senior officials in the Treasury Department 
as a result of her testimony during the hearings, in which she sharply 
contradicted Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman's account of contacts 
between White House and Treasury officials. An investigation of a failed 
Arkansas savings and loan owned by a former business partner of President 
Clinton was discussed during the contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson also suggested that Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen knew more about 
the case than he had indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury officials were so angry about Hanson's testimony that they suggested 
she would be forced out by Bentsen after the hearings ended on Aug. 5. 
Lawmakers criticized her for not providing full disclosure about the extent of 
contacts between the Treasury and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson's resignation followed Altman's by one day. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Administration sources said that the long-stalled nomination of 
Washington lawyer Ricki Tigert to chair the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
appears to be in jeopardy. She was first nominated to be one of the nation's 
top banking regulators by Clinton in November, 1993, and the Senate Banking, 
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee voted to confirm her in February. 
</P>
<P>
 But a group of more than 40 Senate Republicans placed a "hold" on her 
nomination, which has indefinitely delayed action by the full Senate. The 
Republicans were angry that Tigert did not pledge in her confirmation hearings 
to recuse herself from any Whitewater-related issues that might come before 
her. She would say only that she would review such issues with her ethics 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration source said Thursday that her nomination is all but a 
dead issue. But an FDIC spokesman stressed that Tigert has not withdrawn. The 
FDIC has been without a permanent chairman since August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson, who is said to be returning to the Wall Street law firm where she 
previously worked, will be succeeded by Edward S. Knight, currently Bentsen's 
executive secretary and senior adviser. In her letter of resignation to 
Bentsen, Hanson said that "the time I have spent working for you and Roger 
Altman at Treasury has been a privilege . . . but this is the right time for me 
to return to New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson's testimony during the hearings called into question whether Altman had 
made a full accounting in testimony to congressional investigators of his 
contacts with the White House about a confidential criminal referral in a 
Resolution Trust Corp. investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, the 
Arkansas thrift. Altman was acting chairman of the RTC at the time and Hanson 
was helping him with legal matters there, although both continued to fill their 
roles at Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said in her testimony that Altman told her to meet with White House 
Counsel Bernard Nussbaum last September to inform him about the criminal 
referral. The referral, which had not yet been issued at the time of the 
meeting, named Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign as a possible beneficiary 
of criminal wrongdoing at Madison Guaranty. Altman insisted that he did not 
know that Hanson had met with Nussbaum.

DETROIT MAYOR WON'T OPPOSE CASINO GAMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dropping his opposition to casino gambling, Mayor Dennis Archer said Thursday 
he will support gaming halls but only if it is clearly shown their development 
will help revitalize this depressed city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will support it as long as it helps the people of Detroit," Archer said at 
a City Hall press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement comes two weeks after city voters approved non-binding 
proposals to allow development of Native American-run gaming halls and 
riverboat casinos. Voters had rejected four previous casino measures since 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit joins a growing list of Midwestern cities that are considering casino 
gambling, including Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Gary, Ind., and Flint, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure for legalized gambling has grown here since May when a casino 
opened just across the Detroit River in Windsor, Canada. Since then, thousands 
of Detroit-area residents have flocked daily across the border to play 
blackjack, craps and slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
 In last fall's mayoral election, Archer campaigned against casino gambling, 
saying it was not a panacea for the city's travails. He still has reservations 
about the benefits of casinos but now vows to seriously explore their 
feasibility and negotiate the best deal for the city with developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Casino opponents say that while Archer's willingness to embrace legalized 
gambling is a blow, his insistence that such development must unequivocally 
benefit Detroit economically is sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a well-thought-out approach," said Trisha Arndt, co-chairwoman of 
Citizens Against Casino Gambling. "But we still think that casinos are a real 
zero from an economic development standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Already three gambling proposals have been made for downtown: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Sault Ste. Marie Chippewa tribe has joined with two downtown developers 
to build a casino in Greektown, a popular restaurant district near Rennaissance 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harrah's Casino Hotels proposed a $300-million casino in Foxtown, a proposed 
redevelopment of the arts district around the Fox Theater. The area is also the 
proposed site for a new baseball stadium. The casino would be owned by 
Michigan's seven Indian tribes and managed by Harrah's. 
</P>
<P>
 * A group headed by real estate developer Herb Strather wants to build a 
$60-million riverboat with a 50,000-square-foot casino. It would dock downtown 
on the Detroit River. 
</P>
<P>
 Any casino owned by Native Americans must be approved by the U.S. Department 
of the Interior and the state's governor. Other casinos must be approved by the 
state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. John Engler, who is running for reelection in November, has formed a 
commission to study casino gaming. Archer plans to appoint an official within 
30 days to coordinate and evaluate the gaming issue for the city.

LAST-SECOND MALFUNCTION ABORTS SHUTTLE LAUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The space shuttle Endeavour roared to life Thursday as the countdown clock 
read zero. Then it suddenly shuddered into silence -- its main engines shut 
down before the scheduled dawn launch because of an overheated fuel pump. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth engine shutdown at the pad in 13 years of shuttle flights and 
the third since March, 1993. But none had been so close to launch. 
</P>
<P>
 Deidra Baker, wife of the shuttle commander, was watching from the launch 
control center three miles away with their two daughters. Her voice quivered as 
she described seeing husband Michael Baker stuck inside a vibrating, rumbling, 
2,000-ton rocket ship filled with explosive fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said he and the five other astronauts fell silent when red warning 
lights flashed in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 The astronauts were strapped in their seats for about an hour after the launch 
was aborted, as ground crews rushed to make sure that Endeavour was safe. The 
launch team's prime concern was the possibility of hydrogen fuel leaks; that's 
why 300,000 gallons of water were sprayed at the pad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everything went well. The systems did their job and shut us down," 
said Baker, a Navy captain and former test pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 When the three main engines fired on cue 6 1/2 seconds before liftoff and 
spewed huge clouds of steam, NASA's deputy manager for engines, Boyce Mix, said 
he thought "we had it in the bank." 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, the engines were turned off automatically by computer command, 
starting 1.9 seconds before the solid rocket boosters were to have ignited. 
NASA's countdown clocks got all the way to zero when the launch was halted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix said the problem was with a high-pressure fuel pump in main engine No. 3 
that overheated. The pump had just been refurbished, and there was no immediate 
explanation for why it failed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is testing a redesigned 
version of the pump that is intended to improve safety while reducing 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 If an engine had failed soon after liftoff, Baker would have had to attempt a 
dangerous emergency landing at the space center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Earth-monitoring mission -- a repeat of an April flight -- is off until 
early October. Shuttle managers decided to proceed with Discovery's scheduled 
Sept. 9 launch and move Endeavour off the pad next week in order to replace all 
three engines.

MIDNIGHT BASKETBALL IS WINNER ON STREET; CRIME: PLAYERS, COACHES, POLICE 
OFFICERS SAY THE PREVENTION PROGRAMS HAVE PROVED THEIR WORTH. BUT SOME 
LAWMAKERS AREN'T CONVINCED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Wearing baggy sweats, hightops and a black baseball cap turned so the bill 
stuck out sideways, Brian Proctor sauntered across the basketball court to pick 
up his trophy: "Most Valuable Player, Prince Georges County, Maryland Midnight 
Basketball League." 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old former drug dealer, one of the coaches said, is all the proof 
members of Congress should need to include funding for crime prevention 
programs such as the Midnight Basketball League in the anti-crime bill now 
being debated on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the program, which started in this county in the suburbs of Washington 
eight years ago and has spawned leagues in 50 cities across the country, has 
become the subject of heated debate as the Clinton Administration and lawmakers 
argue over dropping some provisions from the bill in order to secure enough 
votes for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 Midnight basketball is intended to lure young men off the streets during the 
peak crime hours of 10 p.m. to 2 a.m. It requires them to attend workshops on 
everything from job training to sexually transmitted diseases as a condition of 
playing. Some of the programs require the players to pursue a high school 
diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people between age 17 and 26 are the general targets of the programs, 
but the criteria for participation vary. Some leagues are aimed at school 
dropouts. Others are aimed at those who have served jail time. Still others are 
intended for those who are poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs' fans, including police chiefs across the country and politicians 
from George Bush to Bill Clinton, have praised the leagues for offering an 
attractive alternative to crime to unemployed or underemployed young men living 
in poor urban neighborhoods -- like Proctor. 
</P>
<P>
 After dealing drugs since he was 13 years old in the southeast Washington 
neighborhood where he grew up, Proctor was caught three years ago with $8,000 
worth of crack cocaine and sentenced to prison. In 17 months, he was back on 
the streets -- without a high school diploma or any direction in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real hard," Proctor said, to earn minimum wage working in a barber shop 
instead of bringing in $2,000 a week dealing drugs. But the league has helped 
him stick to the commitment he made to himself while in prison not to get into 
trouble again. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for the league, I wouldn't be here today," Proctor said after 
picking up his trophy before the league championship game Tuesday night. "It 
started me off and keeps helping me on my way." 
</P>
<P>
 Proctor's coaches have arranged for him to start in a GED (graduate 
equivalency diploma) program next year, and he hopes that he will be able to 
get a college scholarship from one of the scouts who appear eager to recruit 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 For other players in Prince Georges County and elsewhere, midnight basketball 
has been a ticket to further education and training or a job. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the first state to launch a statewide program, players without 
high school degrees must attend GED classes as a condition of playing in the 
midnight leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, 1,280 young residents of public housing projects have participated 
in midnight basketball since it began in 1989. With the help of the program, 
300 have found jobs and 300 more have sought further education, said Gil 
Walker, director of sports and recreation at the Chicago Housing Authority. 
Though many of them had criminal records when they joined midnight basketball, 
none have had trouble with the law since, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds of 400 to 500 people cram into gyms to watch the midnight leagues, and 
players win local renown for their play. But at the end of every game in the 
Chicago league, players must attend workshops where they are instructed in 
everything from cleanliness to mutual respect to career planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basketball is just a hook," Walker said. "Once I have them into the gym, 
they have to listen to the gospel according to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker takes issue with Republican members of Congress who argue against 
spending $40 million over six years on leagues like his. Most of the leagues 
currently are financed through a combination of private donations and local 
public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't put money on the preventive end, we're going to pay more trying 
to clean up the trouble they get into," Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Georges County Police Chief David Mitchell agrees that midnight 
basketball is an investment worth making. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, when crack cocaine first hit the Washington area, the late Van 
Standifer, the town manager of Glenarden, Md., saw crime in his suburban 
community skyrocket. Looking at the statistics, he found that most of the crime 
was committed between the hours of 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. by young men. 
</P>
<P>
 He proposed opening Glenarden Recreation Center during those hours so that 
young men could play basketball. Once they were in the gymnasium, they could be 
taught some of the life skills that they had missed growing up. The Glenarden 
program began in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a 60% reduction in drug-related crime," Mitchell said, as he 
watched the league's ninth annual championships. "That success has continued. 
It's a crime-prevention program that works." 
</P>
<P>
 One of midnight basketball's biggest evangelists is Sam Saxton, Prince Georges 
County's director of corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely convinced that it is programs such as this that will help us 
get out of the problem we have with crime," Saxton said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though President Bush awarded the program his 124th Point of Light and 
cheered its founder for contributing "to the struggle against crime and 
delinquency," House Republicans have objected vociferously to funding the 
program during debate on the anti-crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), called the program "vague social spending" and 
suggested that including it in the anti-crime bill is based "on the theory that 
the person who stole your car, robbed your house and assaulted your family was 
no more than a disgruntled artist or would-be (basketball) star." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who represents the district where the first 
league was created, argued that the Republicans who oppose it are trying to 
hide their real objection to the crime bill -- its ban on assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course this is not the sole answer," he said while watching a championship 
game here at Bowie State University. "But it makes good sense to invest in 
programs that give young people at risk of turning to crime an alternative that 
gives them discipline, a purpose and a sense of worth." 
</P>
<P>
 For Proctor, the program stands for that and a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something about the midnight basketball league that brings out the 
best in people," he said. "We're like a family out here."

CHEMICAL SPILL THREAT SEEN IN CALIFORNIA; ENVIRONMENT: STUDY SAYS STATE LEADS

 California leads the nation in industrial accidents that released hazardous 
chemicals, according to a study provided Thursday by two environmental advocacy 
groups that suggested many of the nation's chemical plants are catastrophes 
waiting to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 11 chemical spills, leaks or fires occur each day in the state, which 
had 4,820 accidents in a wide range of industries between 1988 and 1992, said 
the report by the National Environmental Law Center and the U.S. Public 
Interest Research Group. 
</P>

 More than 1,200 of the 34,500 accidents reported nationwide to the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency in those five years occurred in Los Angeles 
County, the report said. Statewide, 409 accidents involved deaths, injuries or 
evacuations during the five years, the data showed. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials said California's top ranking in the study is misleading. 
"This state has 12% of the nation's population. I'd be surprised if we weren't 
ranked No. 1," said Dan Pellissier, a spokesman for the California 
Environmental Protection Agency. "We also have stronger reporting requirements 
than any other state." 
</P>
<P>
 In releasing the report, Hillel Gray, policy director for the Environmental 
Law Center and a co-author of the report, said the nation's environment "is 
subjected to a daily barrage of accidents involving toxic chemicals that cause 
cancer, birth defects, reproductive disorders and ecological damage. It's not 
enough to contain the spills and put out the fires. We need to prevent 
accidents in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and worker-safety advocates blamed executives of the oil and 
chemical industries for the lion's share of the accidents, saying that they 
have been too slow in devising ways to shield employees and communities from 
the risks of hazardous materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial programs concentrate almost exclusively on reactive, "Band-Aid" 
solutions rather than proactive prevention, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underlying problem is that the production systems are, intrinsically, a 
hazard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pellissier said prevention of accidental spills is still a high priority for 
the California EPA but that "there's always room for improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials played down the significance of the report's figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do they represent a broad-scale disregard for safety? I don't think so," said 
Rod Spackman, a spokesman for the Chevron Inc. refinery in El Segundo. The 
plant, which once used hazardous coolants, has switched to safer chemicals in 
the last three years, Spackman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said accidents have released more than 680 million pounds of toxic 
chemicals, including 84 million pounds of chlorine, a highly acidic chemical 
used in water-treatment plants and paper factories, and 39 million pounds of 
sulfuric acid. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies should incorporate more safety procedures into the handling of 
hazardous materials and use alternative chemicals to prevent accidents, the two 
groups said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said he hopes that the study will counteract a fierce lobbying effort by 
chemical companies seeking to delay more stringent EPA safety rules. 
</P>
<P>
 To compile data for the study, researchers combed the EPA's Emergency Response 
Notification database, which covers industrial and transportation-related 
accidents. The report may greatly understate the scope of the problem of 
chemical accidents, its authors said, because the database only includes spills 
and disasters reported to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical companies or industrial workers sometimes hide accidents for fear of 
serious penalties, according to environmentalists and workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People get injured and don't even know it," said Henry Jones, a safety 
representative for British Petroleum Co. "They'll have an acute reaction, but 
they've been on the job so long they accept it as part of the job." Jones, who 
has served as a technician at his company's plant outside Philadelphia, said 
failures of high-tech safety mechanisms are not unusual.

JUSTICE DEPT. BACKS CLINTON ON IMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new brief by the Justice Department supports President Clinton's contention 
that he cannot be sued while in office. It urges a federal judge to postpone 
Paula Corbin Jones' lawsuit until Clinton once again is a private citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-page brief, dated Thursday, adopted basically the same arguments put 
forth last week by Clinton's private attorneys. The department's lawyers argued 
the country would suffer if Clinton was forced to defend himself against Jones' 
allegation of sexual harassment, while Jones would lose little if the suit was 
delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the public and constitutional interest in the President's unimpaired 
attention to his duties conflicts with the purely private interest of a 
plaintiff in immediate relief, the private interest must yield," the brief 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Justice Department normally would be expected to take a stand on 
an issue of such importance to the presidency, officials hesitated before 
weighing in. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno wanted to be convinced that the department 
needed to voice a position, officials said. Solicitor General Drew S. Days III, 
whose name is on the brief, had an obligation to the office of the presidency 
to give the opinion, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 No court has ever decided whether a sitting President is immune from civil 
suits arising from acts that allegedly occurred before the President took 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Jones said the brief "is just as we had expected . . . merely a 
recap of Bill Clinton's argument for presidential immunity."

COURT REFUSES TO PROBE STARR'S POLITICS; WHITEWATER: SEN. LEVIN SOUGHT AN 
EXAMINATION OF THE INDEPENDENT COUNSEL'S GOP ACTIVITIES. DEMOCRATS, CITING BIAS 
ISSUE, STEP UP CRITICISM OF PROSECUTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A special three-judge court refused Thursday to look into the political 
activities of independent Whitewater counsel Kenneth W. Starr, saying that it 
lacked any power to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), leading Senate sponsor of the independent counsel 
law, urged the court last Friday to ask Starr for "a complete accounting" of 
his recent Republican political activities and to either ask him to resign or 
explain why the activities do not impair his "appearance of independence." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel two weeks ago appointed Starr, solicitor general during the George 
Bush Administration, to replace Robert B. Fiske Jr., who had been named by 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno seven months ago after an earlier independent counsel law 
had expired. In turning down Reno's request that it name Fiske under a newly 
signed law, the court said that it was "in the best interest of the appearance 
of independence" to choose a person not affiliated with the Clinton 
Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's refusal came as Democrats stepped up their criticism, saying that 
the selection of Starr violated the same standard that the court had cited in 
removing Fiske. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin, in his letter to Judge David B. Sentelle, who presides over the special 
panel, cited Starr's role as co-chair of a Republican congressional campaign in 
Virginia and his participation in a televised debate on the sexual harassment 
suit brought against Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones, a former Arkansas state 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr also has come under attack for working on a legal brief for a 
conservative women's organization that challenges the President's claim of 
immunity in the Paula Jones suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Levin disputed the court order, saying: "Not only do they have such authority, 
but they alone have the authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr's appointment also has been criticized because Judge Sentelle had lunch 
with Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), a leading advocate of removing Fiske, while 
the special court was weighing who it should name as independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), a leading supporter of Sentelle when he was named 
to the bench, joined Faircloth and Sentelle at the lunch. They have denied 
discussing the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr has rejected Democratic calls for him to step down, noting that his 
"sole loyalty" is to the Constitution and the laws of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In turning Levin down, the special court said that the law authorizing the 
court did not contemplate the accounting from Starr that he sought. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent counsel act "simply does not give" the special court "the 
power to 'supervise' the independent counsel in the exercise of his or her 
investigative or prosecutorial authority," it said, citing a 1988 Supreme Court 
decision upholding the constitutionality of the independent counsel law. 
</P>
<P>
 It added that Levin had sought a "supplementary opinion passing on the fitness 
of an independent counsel already appointed and as to whom the court has no 
current power of either supervision or termination."

OFFICER FAKED HIS OWN SHOOTING, POLICE SAY 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This town's only police officer has been accused of staging his own shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 James Little said someone shot him Aug. 11 as he was in the parking lot of a 
diner in this town 70 miles north of Pittsburgh, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Two helicopters and dozens of police from several counties and five state 
police posts rushed to the diner and searched nearby forests, but no suspect 
was found. Police said there were bullet holes in Little's cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 But now police say Little, 33, took off his bulletproof vest and fired into it 
to make it appear that he had been shot. He was treated for a bruise and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Little was charged Wednesday with lying to police, unsworn falsification to 
authorities, making a false alarm to police and tampering with evidence.

STUDENT SLAIN WHILE NOTING LICENSE OF SUSPICIOUS VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police said Thursday they were searching for two men in connection with the 
fatal shooting of a UC Irvine engineering student who was slain while trying to 
jot down the license number of a van he thought was linked to a recent 
vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police said Robert Sapinoso, 19, who lived in Westminster, 
suffered multiple gunshot wounds about 6:50 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso's passenger, who was not identified, wrested the victim from the 
driver's seat of the car and drove his friend to a nearby hospital that did not 
have an emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso was pronounced dead by emergency rescue paramedics summoned by 
hospital personnel to Vencor Hospital Orange County, which has been without an 
emergency room for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. John Woods said that because of the severity of Sapinoso's wounds, 
it was not known if he would have survived had he been treated sooner, either 
by paramedics at the scene of the shooting, or at one of the hospitals with an 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the assailants were described as two men between 17 and 21 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso and his friend were outside Sapinoso's car not far from the 
intersection of Trask Avenue and Newland Street, when they saw the van drive 
past and recognized it as a vehicle involved in a recent car vandalism, Woods 
said. Woods said he did not know whose car had been vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "They decided to follow it and get the license number," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the pair stopped at the intersection, the van's occupants apparently 
realized that they were being followed and decided to strike, Woods said. "The 
passenger got out of the van . . . and was able to walk right up" and fire four 
or five shots from a handgun through the windshield, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects fled in the van, which Westminster police said fit the 
description of a vehicle used in at least two recent burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital administrator at Vencor said a sign in front warns that the 
facility has no emergency room. The hospital now specializes in respiratory 
diseases and is not licensed for emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two men arrived, a nurse tried to provide cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation and staffers called paramedics, said administrator Rich McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provided a level of care we were capable of doing. We did not refuse 
treatment. We did not turn him away," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods said Sapinoso managed to capture part of the license number. "He got 
part of it -- not the whole thing," he said.

JUSTICES REFUSE TO BLOCK TRANSFER OF NG'S MURDER TRIAL TO ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court refused Thursday to block the transfer to Orange 
County of Charles Ng's trial on charges of 12 sex and torture murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Ng is being held in Calaveras County, where prosecutors say the murders 
occurred and some of the victims were found.His lawyers sought a transfer 
because of pretrial publicity but argued that the case should be tried in San 
Francisco, where a 13th murder was allegedly committed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ng is accused of taking part in the slayings in 1984 and 1985 along with 
Leonard Lake, who killed himself in 1985 shortly after he was arrested. Police 
found a torture chamber and mass graves on land owned by Lake's family in the 
Calaveras County town of Wilseyville. Ng fled to Canada, where he was arrested 
and extradited. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calaveras charges were transferred to Orange County in April.

PANEL TO URGE ENDING BAN ON FUNDING HUMAN EMBRYO STUDIES; BIOMEDICINE: GROUP IS 
EXPECTED TO RECOMMEND THAT FEDERAL AGENCY ALLOW RESEARCH ON SURPLUS EMBRYOS. 
ITS DELIBERATIONS HAVE BEEN BITTERLY OPPOSED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal panel is preparing to recommend that the National Institutes of 
Health -- the world's largest biomedical research organization -- end a 20-year 
moratorium on publicly funded research on human embryos created in 
laboratories.  
</P>
<P>
 The 19 policy-makers, legal experts and medical specialists on the NIH 
advisory panel are not expected to make their findings public until next month. 
But interviews with several panel members and a report in the journal Science, 
released today, indicate the group is prepared to lower the barriers to such 
research for the first time in a generation, signaling a new turn in one of 
medicine's most bitter controversies.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite a de facto ban on federal funding, researchers in the United States 
conduct hundreds of human embryo experiments every year with no public control 
or regulation. The work is carried out at many of the hundreds of U.S. 
infertility clinics with embryos created through in-vitro fertilization. 
Researchers experiment with spare embryos created during the course of 
infertility treatments or with embryos that are later implanted in the hope 
they will develop into healthy children. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiments include efforts to improve an infertile couple's ability to 
conceive a child or to ensure the offspring's genetic health. So little is 
known about the biochemistry and genetics of early human development that for 
most purposes every human embryo created in the laboratory is an experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about creating life," said Patricia A. King, a Georgetown 
University law professor who is the panel's policy chairwoman. "There is a fine 
balance between doing something that has scientific merit and is also sensitive 
to the different perspectives and fears about the beginning of human life. 
There are concerns about going too far in the name of science."  
</P>
<P>
 NIH Director Harold Varmus appointed the panel in January to address the moral 
and ethical issues arising from research using human embryos in laboratory 
experiments. The move stemmed in part from an international furor over a team 
of George Washington University researchers who asserted they had cloned human 
embryos.  
</P>
<P>
 The panel's meetings stirred such strong feelings that NIH was obliged to hire 
security guards to monitor its most recent session. The panelists, who have 
received hate mail and numerous threats, are also being sued by an 
anti-abortion group in Pittsburgh intent on halting their deliberations. U.S. 
Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), in a letter signed by 35 members of 
Congress, questioned whether NIH even has the authority to revise the federal 
research guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has not funded any research using human embryos since 
1973, when a Nashville University embryologist triggered a political firestorm 
over the propriety of such experiments by proposing that NIH fund a study 
investigating the health of human embryos created in the laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is expected to recommend that NIH permit research on surplus embryos 
created during the course of infertility treatments up to their 14th day of 
development.  
</P>
<P>
 "We fully expect that some of the research will be directed toward treating 
infertility and that some of these embryos would be implanted," said panel 
member Thomas Murray, an expert at Case Western Reserve University on medical 
ethics. "We would have very strict precautions so that there is a minimum risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are talking about implanting an embryo in the hope it will develop 
into a child, you have the same moral considerations you have when you ask a 
parent to consent to research on their child," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is also expected to endorse a new technique called blastomere 
biopsy, in which a single cell is extracted from a laboratory-created embryo 
and used to diagnose inherited diseases such as muscular dystrophy.

TREE RING STUDIES SUGGEST TREND OF GLOBAL COOLING SINCE 4800 BC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tree ring studies from the bristlecone pine, the oldest living tree species, 
suggest that the Earth has been cooling for at least 6,800 years, Caltech 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study to be published today in the journal Science, two Caltech 
scientists said measurements of chemical ratios in the trunks of trees grown in 
the White Mountains of California show that temperatures declined about 5 
degrees since 4800 BC. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is consistent with other studies, such as the ice cores, and suggests 
that the cooling may very well have been global," said Samuel Epstein, lead 
researcher in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the research cannot be related to current theories that the Earth 
is warming because of the so-called greenhouse effect caused by an increase of 
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein said the bristlecone pine record of ancient temperatures cannot be 
related to any mathematical model of future changes because "the modern climate 
is much more unpredictable." 
</P>
<P>
 "In modern times, there seems to be some mechanism that is not well 
understood," he said. "When the climate gets a little warmer, the models go a 
little haywire." 
</P>
<P>
 In the study, Epstein and a Caltech graduate student, Xiahong Feng, measured 
the ratio of two chemicals, deuterium and hydrogen, in the annual growth rings 
of bristlecone pine trunks that are known to be up to 8,000 years old. It is 
known that the ratio of deuterium and hydrogen increases in tree rings as the 
climatic temperature rises. A single tree ring is created annually by growth of 
a wood layer in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on measurements in 50-year intervals from three trees, the researchers 
found that temperatures climbed slightly until about 6,800 years ago and then 
started a long cooling slide. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend flattened out from 2,000 to 400 years ago, and then another cold 
period started. The coldest period was between 1700 and 1900, with a slight 
warming at the end of the measured period. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein said the last measured season was in 1950, the time at which the trees 
were cut. Wood from the trees has been preserved for scientific study because 
the bristlecone pine is thought to be the longest-lived tree on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice cores drilled from Devon Island in far northern Canada also have given 
long-range temperature trends, but some experts have said this data may have 
been influenced by the ocean or local effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein said the bristlecone pine temperature measurements are in general 
agreement with those of the ice cores, suggesting that the cooling trends 
recorded by the two methods may have been worldwide.

EX-SPY RESIGNS POLISH INTELLIGENCE POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marian Zacharski, the newly appointed chief of Polish intelligence, stepped 
down Thursday after an international outcry arose over his past as a top Cold 
War spy who stole military secrets from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout my life, I was always led by what was good for Poland," he said in 
a resignation letter. "I do not want to be the cause of conflict among Poles at 
a moment when Poland most needs agreement and harmony." 
</P>
<P>
 His decision to quit less than a week into the job was greeted with relief by 
Polish officials, who had come to fear his controversial appointment would 
undermine Poland's campaign to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the 
alliance Zacharski sought to subvert as a Soviet Bloc spy in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO forces are scheduled to participate in joint maneuvers in Poland for the 
first time next month under the alliance's "Partnership for Peace" program, 
making the furor over Zacharski's appointment all the more awkward for both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only hope this incident will not adversely influence the American Congress 
and President Clinton in regards to helping Poland militarily," said Krzysztof 
Krol, who heads the Confederation for an Independent Poland in Parliament's 
lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 President Lech Walesa, who Wednesday called for Zacharski to quit, would not 
comment Thursday. Under an informal arrangement with the government, Walesa has 
responsibility for the Interior Ministry, which includes the intelligence 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 A top aide to Walesa said the president was not consulted about Zacharski's 
appointment, an assertion viewed with skepticism by many lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, it was Walesa's public rebuke of Zacharski that doomed the former 
spy's short-lived tenure at the helm of the intelligence service. 
</P>
<P>
 Zacharski was sentenced to life imprisonment in the United States in 1981 
after obtaining secret information about several highly sensitive American 
defense programs and passing the material to the Soviet Union. His appointment 
to the intelligence post was seen as an embarrassment for the United States, 
which still considers him a criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Zacharski was able to collect data on the B-1 bomber, the F-15 fighter and 
Patriot air-defense missiles after successfully recruiting William Holden Bell, 
a radar system expert at Hughes Aircraft Co. in El Segundo. Bell provided the 
Polish spy with copies of documents in exchange for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Zacharski returned to Poland in 1985 after an East-West spy exchange. But he 
received only limited clemency in the United States, meaning he would be 
subject to arrest and reimprisonment if he ever traveled here -- even in his 
capacity as chief of Polish intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of Zacharski's critics questioned his credentials for the intelligence 
post. Even Walesa praised his professionalism and experience when asking him to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zacharski's ties to the Communist past left many feeling uneasy about the 
influence of former Communists in democratic Poland. His departure was 
interpreted as a victory for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, the whole shocking incident will be good for Poland," said Jan 
Nowak-Jezioranski, head of the Polish American Congress. "It will be seen as a 
warning to the old nomenclature not to try something like this again."

 The Palmdale man who was convicted of molesting his 10-year-old goddaughter, 
Desiray Bartak, was released from prison Wednesday. The man changed his name 
while in prison from Richard Streate to Kyle Hochstraser and has returned to 
the city in which he committed his crime. Desiray, who is now 14 and has moved 
to Northern California, fought against Hochstraser's early release and 
previously sued him for $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Should convicted criminals be allowed to change their names? 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they should be able to escape their record and get away from 
the reputation they've established. Communities need to be aware of which 
members of its neighborhoods (are convicted criminals). That is the basic 
fabric that makes up a community. In the crime bill that we debated last week, 
Republicans wanted a clause that would have mandated the names be released to 
the community. . . . It was taken out of the crime bill. They are trying to 
protect the criminal and not giving the community the right to know. We think 
people need to be held accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Henry Hearns, Lancaster city councilman 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not, as far as I'm concerned. I would say that if they want to 
change their names, I think the community should know who they were. . . . If 
they get the option of changing their name, that name should also be identified 
in the community that this person lives around. I think that name should be 
disclosed so people know that Henry is equal to John -- the same person. The 
same rapist or killer." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Capt. Tony F. Welch, commander of the Antelope 
Valley Sheriff's Station 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they should be able to. It's just a method to deceive possible 
victims. On the other hand, as far as law enforcement is concerned, we'll know 
who that person is. The unsuspecting public would not possibly know about the 
name change. I believe that the fact that the media is on top of this to let 
them know helps. I'm not sure what the parole agents' rules and regulations 
are, but I have heard that some lawmakers want to prohibit them (criminals) 
from changing their names in jail. That would be the way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Rogers 
</P>
<P>
 "I specialize in child molestation, physical child abuse and rape cases 
involving adult victims. In my opinion, the convicted felon, especially in 
cases like these that are repetitious, should not be allowed to change their 
names and that is not in violation of the constitutional principles or 
practice. A court can give as an order that the felon use no name other than 
their own. . . . It is extremely difficult to track these kinds of offenders.  
</P>
<P>
 "Within the last few years in Los Angeles County, we have used tracking codes 
so that when we have a case presented we have some ability if they have been 
reported as having been involved in these kinds of crimes. Before, if they were 
too young to qualify, I may have to reject that case. Now I have the ability to 
track the rejects, so to speak, in our computer files. . . . We've had this 
happen in five cases. We dig into the cases and we find that this is not the 
first victim and there are others who may now be mature enough to testify. . . 
. Anything as simple as not changing names that assists law enforcement and 
child protective services to adequately know seems to me to be a public benefit 
with hardly any intrusion."

O.C. GROUP'S VISIT TO VIETNAM ANGERS FACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A trade delegation sponsored by Orange County's Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce 
will travel to Vietnam in September for an unprecedented meeting with President 
Le Duc Anh and other top government officials, the chamber announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-day trip, which will mark the first time that top leaders of the 
Vietnamese government have received a delegation organized by Vietnamese 
American expatriates, immediately sparked protests from Vietnamese Americans 
who steadfastly oppose closer ties with the Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation, however, will include only a handful of Vietnamese 
Americans, along with other business representatives eager to improve trade 
between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is historic in that as far as we know, no other Vietnamese groups have 
been able to set up something of this magnitude with Vietnam," said Hien Phan, 
executive director of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. "We hope it will be 
successful, and we hope it will only be the first of many such delegations." 
</P>
<P>
 Wary of hostile reaction from Vietnamese Americans, chamber officials, who 
said they have been planning the trip for several months, attempted to keep it 
a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 But news of the tour leaked in the Vietnamese press Thursday. Immediately, one 
of the largest organized Vietnamese-American groups in the Southland announced 
that it would stage a protest at a business seminar the Vietnamese chamber is 
conducting Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want anything to do with the Communists, and we don't want anything 
to do with people who support them or do business with them," said Quyen Van 
Le, president of the Vietnamese Community of Southern California. "As long as 
there is a Vietnamese community, there will be protests to anything that 
proposes that we work with the people who destroyed our lives and made us 
refugees." 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber billed the trip, scheduled Sept. 30 to Oct. 9, as an "historic 
trade mission to Vietnam." It is co-sponsored by the Asian Business League of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 people -- including bankers, developers, academics, immigration 
attorneys and representatives from medical, trading and industrial companies -- 
have verbally committed to go, Phan said. He and other officials declined to 
identify any of the delegation's members, but said most are not ethnic 
Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to protect their privacy and we want to protect them from 
harassment," Phan said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the chamber itinerary, delegates would visit Hanoi and Ho Chi 
Minh City, formerly Saigon. In Hanoi, they are to meet Oct. 3 with President 
Anh , Communist Party General Secretary Do Muoi, Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet and 
Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also scheduled to talk with Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Manh 
Cam and officials of the Hanoi People's Committee, which governs the city. 
Delegates also will meet with officials of the People's Committee of Ho Chi 
Minh City. 
</P>
<P>
 According to chamber literature, the delegation will seek to "promote 
goodwill" between the two nations, expose the American business community to 
the Vietnamese investment process and help build relationships between business 
people in the two nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Co Pham, president of the Westminster-based Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, 
said he has received numerous "verbal" assurances from representatives of the 
Vietnamese government that the delegation will meet with President Anh and 
other top Vietnamese officials. Pham said he is waiting for written 
confirmation of the meetings, without which, he said, the trip will not occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "For companies contemplating . . . business in Vietnam, this trade mission 
will introduce you directly to top decision-makers who will assist you in 
formulating your investment and trade strategies," chamber officials advertised 
in a letter sent Aug. 2 to various business people throughout the state and 
elsewhere seeking additional members for the trade delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make sure that the trip is worthwhile for those participating, and 
that they meet the very people who could help them if they choose to do 
business with Vietnam," Pham said. "This is a business trip for business 
people. This is not a political trip." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Aug. 2 letter, chamber officials demanded that delegation members 
promise not to "distribute or disseminate any political and ideological 
literature or material in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most vocal conservative Vietnamese Americans of Orange County, there 
is no dividing line between political and business relations with the 
Vietnamese government. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifting of the U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam by President Clinton in 
February brought the promise of closer economic ties between the two nations, 
but at the same time heightened tensions in Orange County's Vietnamese 
community between those who supported Clinton's decision and those who did not. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times poll taken shortly after the embargo was lifted found that 54% of the 
Vietnamese living in Southern California favored full diplomatic relations with 
Vietnam and the lifting of the trade sanctions, while just 20% voiced 
opposition to those moves. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 861 Vietnamese residents, conducted between March 28 and April 
19, had a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, after news of the impending September trip was publicized, the 
Vietnamese Community of Southern California, which lists membership of 5,000, 
faxed letters to Little Saigon Radio, various Vietnamese organizations and 
conservative Vietnamese newspapers, encouraging people to join its protest 
Saturday at a chamber-sponsored seminar in Anaheim. The seminar, co-sponsored 
by West Coast University in Orange, is for business people interested in 
investing in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham "is trying to undermine our fight and belief, which is absolutely no 
dealings with the Communists until human rights are restored," said Duy Sinh 
Nguyen Duc Phuc Khoi, editor of the newspaper Tu Do, which published a scathing 
editorial against Pham Thursday. The editorial accused the chamber of "becoming 
the Chamber of Commerce of Hanoi."  
</P>
<P>
 "Meeting with the highest ranking officials of Communist Vietnam will only 
mean lining (the government's) pockets," the editor said. "It will not mean 
improving the lives of the 73 million people in the country who are living in 
miserable poverty." 
</P>
<P>
 Pham "has done many things that offended us before," said Le, president of the 
Vietnamese Community of Southern California. "But this is the worst he's ever 
done. He's going to shake hands with the most powerful of our enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, hundreds of people demonstrated outside of Pham's Westminster 
office after he hosted a Vietnamese ambassador to the United States at his 
Huntington Beach home. Pham received numerous death threats and hired a 
bodyguard. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham said he is prepared for similar pressure this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just doing what I think is right, and what I think will help business 
people here in the U.S. and the ordinary people in Vietnam," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wish people who don't agree with me would agree to meet and talk to me 
instead of just fanning hysteria."

POLICE IN HUBER CASE WADE THROUGH A FLOOD OF 'TIPS'; CRIME: SOME LEADS HELPED 
ASSEMBLE A PROFILE OF THE SUSPECT AND TRACK HIS MOVEMENTS. OTHERS PROVE 
USELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When an Arizona house painter was arrested for the murder of Denise A. Huber, 
Patricia Alexander of Detroit immediately telephoned authorities to report 
disturbing "psychic dreams" she had experienced days before. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander told authorities that one of the nighttime visions placed her in a 
young woman's body while she, like Huber, was being bludgeoned to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was really going through what that poor woman was going 
through," Alexander said. "I'm not kidding." 
</P>
<P>
 Hattie Berry picked up her phone too. When authorities were digging around 
suspect John J. Famalaro's country club home for other possible victims, Berry 
urged police to dig up the rectangular-shaped planters outside the suspect's 
house, "because on television it looked like the dirt had been freshly turned 
and watered." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where I would have looked," Berry said, not knowing that the "dirt" in 
those planters was actually earth-toned lava rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The calls from Alexander and Berry were among the dozens that have poured in 
to law enforcement agencies in Arizona and California during the investigation 
of Huber's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 While some callers provided detectives with substantial leads in the case, 
many more came from wanna-be cops, self-styled gumshoes or people simply 
startled by memories of chance encounters with Famalaro -- weeks, months or 
years before Huber's frozen body was found in a freezer stashed in a rental 
truck in Famalaro's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Information flowed from every imaginable source -- from a shaken Dana Point 
neighborhood where the defendant had painted about a dozen homes to Prescott 
Valley, Ariz., where residents encountered the lean, bearded man at flea 
markets or at the local car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some leads from wackos and others who turned out to have some pretty 
nice information," said Costa Mesa Police Chief David L. Snowden. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Thursday his department continues to field telephone calls and 
letters, all containing potential "tips" in the case of Huber, a 23-year-old 
Newport Beach woman who mysteriously vanished along the Corona del Mar Freeway 
after her Honda Accord blew a tire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We treat every piece of information the same way and follow up every lead," 
the chief said. "We don't throw anything away. Sure, it's time-consuming, but 
you never know what you're going to turn up." 
</P>
<P>
 The most valuable tips, Snowden and other officials said, came from people who 
were able to help officers piece together a "profile" of Famalaro and track his 
movements between California and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were plenty of other tipsters, like those whose calls are now 
choking the O.J. Simpson hot line, recently created to attract information that 
could help free the football legend from double murder charges.  
</P>
<P>
 And as in the Simpson case, Snowden said the amount of media attention devoted 
to the Huber case -- first chronicling her disappearance three years ago and 
continuing through Famalaro's arrest last month -- has easily generated more 
calls than any other investigation handled by the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that coverage, Snowden said callers seemed to have formed a strange 
bond with Huber and her family and felt compelled to contribute any tidbit of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "People saw information about the case on nationwide television," the chief 
said. "In the case of Denise Huber, I don't know of anybody of sound mind who 
was not touched." 
</P>
<P>
 Prescott's Paula Slaughter said news that Huber's body had been discovered 
near her hometown triggered memories of an encounter with Famalaro more than a 
year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After the house painter's arrest, Slaughter felt compelled to call the Yavapai 
County Sheriff's Department and report that she attended a garage sale at the 
defendant's home and considered buying a brown jacket for $10. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman also said she noticed a woman at Famalaro's house, who appeared to 
have a "timid and scared look on her face." 
</P>
<P>
 Although police believe Huber was killed shortly after her disappearance June 
3, 1991, Slaughter continues to wonder whether she "could have made a 
difference" in the case had she reported the sighting at some earlier point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I won't ever forget the look on that woman's face," Slaughter said in an 
interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Moynihan of neighboring Prescott Valley called the Yavapai County 
Sheriff's Department to report she saw two men driving erratically in a Ryder 
rental truck shortly before Huber's body was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to myself, 'They must be involved with drugs,' " said Moynihan, who 
drives a school bus and is always on the alert for bad drivers. Moynihan said 
she called authorities after Famalaro's arrest because she thought the sighting 
might indicate that more than one person could be responsible for Huber's 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want anyone to get away with this so I called just in case," she 
said. "I don't know if they can use it but these guys were weird. But I didn't 
see the freezer or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Assistant Dist. Atty. John Conley speculated that many people 
have been motivated to call by watching television shows that seek viewer 
participation, such as "America's Most Wanted." A videotape of the show was 
found among Famalaro's belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the feeling is, 'I might have one little detail that can help crack 
this. I, the citizen, can help,' " Conley said. 
</P>
<P>
 While many of the tips go nowhere, law enforcement officials do not dismiss 
the barrage of phone calls and letters that follow in the wake of high-profile 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual in a major case for lots and lots of people to call in," 
Conley said. "Any police officer will tell you we cannot solve a crime problem 
without citizen involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Police Sgt. Douglas Morrill said higher-profile cases typically 
tug at the public's heartstrings, causing average people to want to help in 
some way. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Garden Grove Police Officer Howard E. Dallies Jr. was shot and killed in 
March, 1993, police have received more than 3,500 tips. 
</P>
<P>
 The average murder investigation generates about 50 tips, Morrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a real likelihood that the tips you receive will be beneficial, 
especially early in the case," Morrill said. "As the case gets older, however, 
your chances diminish. But you can't dismiss any lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrill said law enforcement agents also get sinister, unsettling leads from 
people who claim to be the killer, or who claim to know the location of a 
murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine psychiatry professor Louis Gottschalk said people who make such 
malicious claims are usually hostile toward law enforcement and seeking a small 
amount of revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are just people out there who want to make trouble," Gottschalk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Morrill and Gottschalk said they attribute the outpouring of well-meaning 
tips to good-hearted citizens who want to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think there are a lot of people who still have a moral conscience and 
they feel want to help the police department and society in general," Morrill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottschalk agreed, adding that many people feel the need to get involved 
instead of just being passive about crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may seem a bit corny, but there are deep, altruistic genetic traits among 
many of us and what they read about in the news touches them. It's another 
issue why everyone isn't like that," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In many criminal cases, people who might not have witnessed the crime can 
still be critical to its prosecution or defense, officials said. The testimony 
of a neighbor who noted a suspicious car, or a clerk who can place the 
defendant 50 miles from the crime scene, can be key during a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In the O.J. Simpson case, for example, police canvassed the neighborhood 
around Nicole Simpson's home for witnesses who might have seen or heard 
anything unusual. Those findings have been critical in helping police narrow 
down the time of the attack, which could help determine whether Simpson could 
have been in the area when his ex-wife and a friend were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia, who is representing 
Famalaro, said he isn't finished doing his job until he follows up on tips that 
might help prove a defendant was someplace else when the crime was committed. 
Sometimes, even experienced defense attorneys, prosecutors and law enforcement 
officers can overlook the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the calls can be weird, but you can't dismiss everyone as a 
crackpot," Gumlia said. "You just never know what might turn up."

 Who says government resists change? Come January it will no longer be a crime

 Airport '94: At the end of a day in which each had accused the other of all 
manner of untruth, GOP Gov. Pete Wilson and Democratic challenger Kathleen 
Brown found themselves on the same Southwest flight from Sacramento to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 As Brown got on the plane with ticket 129--no reserved seats--Wilson was 
already aboard, in the front row with his people (in movies and politics, 
people have people). 
</P>
<P>
 "Good afternoon, Governor," Brown said. "If this plane goes down, John 
Garamendi and Ron Unz will eat their hearts out." (Garamendi and Unz, you 
recall, lost their primaries.) 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Brown people, everyone laughed but Wilson. Even Wilson's 
people, who say on their behalf that the governor smiled.

 Ludwig schmudwig: Parents of saxophone players think the new conductor of the 
Sonoma County Junior Symphony has a lot of brass. Asher Raboy wants to let 
Beethoven be Beethoven, i.e., no saxophones in the "Pastorale." "Don't take 
this away from the kids," urged one pro-sax parent. "Put these kids above your 
own concerns." 
</P>

 Racing colors: The cast-iron lawn jockeys of Tiburon's Main Street will stay 
put, and stay white. A local African American minister had complained that the 
perennially controversial statues should be black, to honor African American 
jockeys who dominated racing in the last century. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiburon went through a mirror-experience 10 or 12 years ago, after people 
complained to the contrary, and the original black jockeys were replaced with 
white ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 compromise: the white jockeys remain, and a statue of "Jocko" will be 
taken from storage and displayed with a plaque. Legend holds that Jocko was a 
young slave who froze to death as he held George Washington's horse while the 
Father of His Country crossed the Delaware one Christmas to clobber the 
British. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassandra Flipper, whose great-great-uncle was the first black cadet to 
graduate West Point, sat in on the talks. The cookie-cutter statues, she says, 
never commemorated black jockeys but were modeled after black children in 
jockey costume who held carriage horses.  
</P>
<P>
 But the Jocko statue honors an individual, and "an event all Americans can 
relate to."

DANA PARSONS: IS GOD OR IRVINE CO. TO BLAME FOR TREE'S CRUSHING FALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Granted, God works in mysterious ways, but did He cause a 70-foot eucalyptus 
tree to fall onto Farshad Farhand's Mazda 626, totaling it, while he was 
driving on University Drive in Irvine? 
</P>
<P>
 And if God wasn't at fault, is the Irvine Co.? 
</P>
<P>
 Farhand, who graduated this spring from UC Irvine with a degree in computer 
science, says he'll never forget the Sunday morning of last Nov. 13. He was on 
his way to a computer lab on campus and was taking the same route along 
University he'd taken for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 He had the street to himself and remembers just passing the IHOP restaurant 
when, from off to his right, he heard a cracking sound. Momentarily, one of the 
towering eucalyptus trees next to the street toppled onto the roof of his 1985 
Mazda sedan. Farhand escaped with minor physical injuries but a major case of 
the jitters. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree landed on the roof, smashed both front and back windshields and 
rendered the car instantly obsolete. A repair shop told him to forget about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree stood in a row of trees outside the Parkwood Apartments. The Irvine 
Co. owns the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Through an attorney, Loren John Castro of Yorba Linda, Farhand sued for 
damages, asking that the Irvine Co. reimburse him $12,000. The company has 
refused. An insurance adjuster handling the claim, according to Castro, called 
the mishap "an act of God." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hypothesis," Castro says. "That tree was defective. I've been told 
trees like that don't fall the way this one did. This tree came completely out 
of the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro originally assumed the tree may not have been pruned properly, causing 
it to become top-heavy. But tree experts offered him other possible causes, and 
Castro even found some case law involving eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a tendency to split or break, so some type of maintenance is 
required. When I started talking to experts, I began to learn it isn't 
necessarily the pruning of the tree. I started to learn that when trees fail, 
it's usually from man-made reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 That's why he's asked for maintenance records for the trees on the apartment 
complex property. If he doesn't get them, Castro says, he'll take the case to 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 I met Farhand for lunch Thursday. A slight man with playful eyes who says he's 
trying unsuccessfully to gain weight, Farhand has what you'd call the good 
attitude about the situation. He can laugh about the incident, and why not, 
since everybody else does, he says. "Sometimes they try to be nice or polite 
about it, but they all laugh," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His friends have gotten lots of mileage about the "act of God" explanation, 
ribbing him mercilessly about being "a bad boy; God must have struck you down." 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers vividly the moment of impact. "For some odd reason, I looked over 
and saw the tree coming down. It was so huge, there was no way I could dodge 
it. I still remember I was driving, listening to the radio and, boom, I was 
stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing he wasn't seriously hurt, he said his first thoughts were that he 
had just lost the first car he ever owned. It also dawned on him he had no 
insurance, a situation he sheepishly confesses to and which resulted from his 
insurance costs being prohibitive, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he decided not to feign injury from the incident, he says. "I'm not 
that kind of guy. If I had said right off the bat that my neck hurt, my 
shoulder hurt, my case would have been settled in a week." 
</P>
<P>
 All he really wants, he says, is a car. "I'm driving my brother's car, and I 
got no money," he says, making it almost sound funny. He's working at an Irvine 
computer consulting firm but still has an outstanding $15,000 student loan, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro believes the Irvine Co. has treated Farhand's claim cavalierly, while 
at the same time dragging things out in an effort to get him to drop the case. 
</P>
<P>
 I left a message Thursday for Scott Smith, who is representing the Irvine Co. 
on the matter. I had hoped to get his legal reading of the potential liability. 
His secretary said he got the message, but I didn't hear from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they could show that lightning struck the tree or a tremendous gust of 
wind of 150 miles an hour hit that nothing could withstand, then I would turn 
to Farshad and say, 'Something happened, and you have to pick up and move on,' 
" Castro says. "But from the very beginning, the company's attitude was, 
'You're just a little guy, there's not much money involved and we're going to 
make it imprudent for you to litigate.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Castro says he'll press the case until he sees evidence that proves no one is 
at fault. "My own personal opinion is that when a company is taking advantage 
of doing business in this society, they have to insure themselves properly for 
any type of liability. I'm not talking strict liability, but here you have a 
case where you put a tree next to a public thoroughfare and an innocent 
individual goes by the property and a tree lands on (his car), destroying 
property, and basically their response is, 'Tough luck, kid, it's not our 
problem.' "

IN THE WRONG PLACE -- TWICE ; VIOLENCE: UC IRVINE STUDENT IS FATALLY SHOT WHILE 
FOLLOWING A VEHICLE HE BELIEVED WAS INVOLVED IN A RECENT VANDALISM INCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Police said Thursday that they were searching for two men in connection with 
the fatal shooting of a 19-year-old UC Irvine engineering student who was slain 
while trying to jot down the license plate number of a van he thought was 
linked to a recent vandalism incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police said that Robert Sapinoso, who lived in Westminster, 
suffered multiple gunshot wounds to his upper torso after he stopped his car 
near the van at the intersection of Newland Street and Trask Avenue about 6:50 
p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso's passenger, who was not identified, wrestled the shooting victim 
from the driver's seat of the car and drove his friend to a nearby hospital 
that, it turned out, is one of the few in Orange County that does not have an 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso was pronounced dead by paramedics summoned by hospital personnel to 
Vencor Hospital-Orange County, which has been without an emergency room for the 
last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. John Woods said that because of the severity of Sapinoso's wounds, 
he may not have survived even if he had been treated sooner, either by 
paramedics at the scene of the shooting or at a hospital with a fully staffed 
emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if it would have made any difference and would have saved him," 
Woods said. Police said the assailants were described as two men between 17 and 
21 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso and his friend were outside Sapinoso's car not far from the 
intersection of Trask and Newland when they saw the van drive past and thought 
they recognized it as a vehicle involved in a recent car vandalism incident, 
Woods said. Woods said he did not know whose car had been vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "They decided to follow it and get the license number," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the pair stopped at the intersection, the occupants of the van apparently 
realized they were being followed and decided to strike, Woods said. "The 
passenger got out of the van . . . and was able to walk right up" and fire four 
or five shots with a handgun through the windshield, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods said the only suspected motive for the slaying was that the men in the 
van apparently knew they were being followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The killers fled in the van, which Westminster police said fit the description 
of a vehicle used in at least two recent burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Sapinoso's passenger, who was uninjured in the attack, 
struggled to move his friend out of the driver's seat and then drove off. 
</P>
<P>
 "The windshield was blown out, and it was like he was having a hard time 
getting the car started, and then he drove away real fast. It scared . . . me," 
said Karen Straly, who lives near the intersection and called 911 after hearing 
gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital administrator at Vencor, called Humana Hospital-Westminster 
before it changed hands two years ago, said a sign in front warns that the 
facility has no emergency room. The hospital now specializes in respiratory 
diseases and is not licensed for emergency care. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two drove up, a nurse tried to provide cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
and staffers called paramedics, said administrator Richard McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provided a level of care we were capable of doing. We did not refuse 
treatment. We did not turn him away," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods said Sapinoso managed to get a partial license plate number for the van. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso's father said his son was an A and B student at UC Irvine, where he 
was enrolled in summer school. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dan Sapinoso said he knew little about the incident that took his son's 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am still in a state of shock. I can't believe it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues at the computer firm where Robert Sapinoso worked as a part-time 
office assistant for the past two years described him as an easygoing, polite 
young man who typed so fast they nicknamed him "Zap." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of respect for him," said Duane Nielson, director of medical 
imaging at MicroWest Industries Inc. in Irvine. "We all gathered together this 
morning for a company photograph, and he just never showed up." Chronology 
Events surrounding the death of Robert Sapinoso on Wednesday. UC Irvine 
engineering student Robert Sapinoso 19, and a friend, who are outside 
Sapinoso's car in Garden Grove shortly before 6:50 p.m., notice a van they 
believe was involved in a recent car vandalism incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair follow the van in their car in an attempt to write down the van's 
license plate number. 
</P>
<P>
 At Newland Street and Trask Avenue, a passenger in the van, apparently aware 
that the vehicle is being followed, emerges and fires four or five shots 
through the windshield of Sapinoso's car. Sapinoso is hit several times in the 
torso. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso's friend wrestles him out of the driver's seat and drives to nearby 
Vencor Hospital-Orange County, a respiratory care facility in Westminster that 
has no emergency room. The gunmen flee in the van. 
</P>
<P>
 A nurse at the hospital provides CPR while other staff members call 
paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso dies at 7:16 p.m. waiting for emergency personnel to arrive.

NO WAY TO FORGET; CATHY TORREZ'S VIOLENT DEATH STILL HAUNTS FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the six months since 20-year-old college student Cathy Torrez was found 
slain, her family and community have not been able to forget the violence that 
touched them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's changed every one of us in different ways. It's affected us not only 
because of the fact that we realize that she was taken from us," said Torrez's 
mother, Mary Bennett. "Just the way it happened, we can't understand that. It 
was senseless." 
</P>
<P>
 The killer who stabbed Torrez repeatedly, stuffed her body into the trunk of 
her 1990 Toyota and left it parked in the Placentia Linda Community Hospital 
parking lot has not been found, despite a reward of nearly $36,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they have few new leads but are following up on every tip. They are 
waiting for the results of some soil tests conducted by a Unocal chemist who 
volunteered his services, examining the sole of the one shoe Torrez had left 
when her body was found six months ago today, hoping it will reveal chemical 
traces that will point to a murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The community that renamed a children's learning center in Torrez's memory 
keeps hoping for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe somebody in our community has some vital information," Bennett 
said. "I believe that one day it will be solved, for Cathy and for us. We're in 
a limbo waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Torrez's friends from Cal State Fullerton last week brought a Hemet 
psychic to the area near where her body was found in search of vibrations that 
might reveal more, but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia resident Mike Buelna put out flyers seeking information from 
residents of Torrez's neighborhood, on the theory that not all of the rumors 
and speculation on the street -- potential leads -- are reaching police. He has 
offered to act as a go-between for anyone who wants to come forward with 
information on the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of little ribbon-strung white clay hearts dangling from rearview 
mirrors and the necks of Torrez's friends have become a symbol of a community 
waiting for answers many still believe are hidden in their midst. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to keep it going. There's an answer and it has to be found. There's 
a lot of people in Placentia and somebody must have seen something," said Tina 
Miranda, who began making the "hearts of innocence" for mourners at Torrez's 
rosary and funeral. Miranda swapped many of the hearts for donations at the 
Placentia Street Fair earlier this month, raising $902. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The little thank-you notes we put on them said, 'Now, when you, too, see a 
white heart, you will think of our friend Cathy Torrez,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda and others like her help Torrez's family keep going. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have approached us and said, 'Oh, you must be strong.' We're not 
strong. But outside we put ourselves to look like we are strong. Inside, we are 
not strong," Bennett said. "I will not stop until I find my daughter's killer. 
. . . No one has a right to take anyone else's life. Cathy did not deserve to 
go that way. She worked hard. She had dreams and she worked for them all her 
life. Somebody, just because they wanted to or for whatever reason, took it all 
away from her. And it's not fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Police still won't say how many times Torrez was stabbed, only that the 
attacker was "seriously disturbed." There was no evidence of sexual assault. 
There were no fingerprints, no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we had basically when the body was discovered on the 19th (of February) 
is what we still have," Placentia police spokeswoman Corinne Loomis said. 
"There is no magic in what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez fought her attacker ferociously and was outside the car, walking in 
mud, for at least a short time before she was killed, Loomis said. The inside 
of the car was in disarray and some parts were broken, indicating a violent 
struggle had taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 The most promising clue right now is the one, mud-caked shoe Torrez was still 
wearing when her body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the bigger things, if not the biggest thing we have pending right 
now, but we don't know where it will take us," Loomis said. "Even if you're 
standing there in the middle of a murder scene, now you know where it happened, 
but you still aren't any closer to who did it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That would take finding physical evidence such as Torrez's belongings, a 
murder weapon or something else that might lead them to the killer, Loomis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez called her mother Feb. 12 from the Sav-On drug store where she worked, 
giving no indication that anything was amiss. She left work around 8 p.m., 
drove out of the parking lot and disappeared. Her body was found a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, in my heart, I believe Cathy died that Saturday night," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe Torrez met with foul play somewhere in the mile between her job 
and home but was killed somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Buelna, an anti-gang activist who never knew Torrez, has a "gut feeling" her 
killer is still in Placentia and that gangs were not involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some rumors of that kind that went around," he said. "But I don't 
believe that was the case. Things that have been said, things that I've read, 
even talking to gang members, they don't condone that" type of killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Buelna distributed flyers in the La Jolla and Atwood neighborhoods, asking 
residents to pass all leads, even rumors, along to police. But he believes fear 
is keeping the community quiet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fear of reprisal," Buelna said. "But I find it hard to 
understand that. What difference does it make? How would that individual (the 
killer) know what was said anyway?"

IN THE WRONG PLACE -- TWICE ; TRAGEDY: A FRIEND DRIVES THE VICTIM TO A HOSPITAL 
WITH NO EMERGENCY ROOM, WHERE HE DIES WHILE WAITING FOR PARAMEDICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Sapinoso's luck was as bad as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the 19-year-old was shot in the chest. Then his friend mistakenly drove 
him to one of the few hospitals in Orange County with no emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could not have been more unlucky," said Edward J. Foley, regional vice 
president of the Hospital Council of Southern California in Santa Ana. "To take 
someone to that hospital was a serious mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Figuring wrongly that a hospital was a hospital, Sapinoso's friend took him to 
Vencor Hospital-Orange County -- a respiratory-care facility that is not 
licensed to handle life-threatening emergencies. Once a full-service 
Westminster hospital, Vencor changed ownership two years ago and has not 
provided emergency services since. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs are posted on the grounds to inform people of that fact, hospital 
administrators said. But by the time Sapinoso arrived there, bleeding 
profusely, shortly after 7 p.m. Wednesday, it was too late to turn back. 
Horrified nurses accustomed to treating patients recovering from surgery and 
chronic illnesses were called upon to save a man bleeding from gunshot wounds. 
According to Vencor administrators, the staff could do little more than 
administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation and call 911. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to give him whatever level of support we could at the time," Vencor 
administrator Richard McCarthy said Thursday. "Someone administered CPR on the 
spot. But we don't have the trained personnel for emergencies like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Sapinoso died of his injuries while waiting for help to arrive, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The young man's wounds were so serious, police said, that there is a good 
chance he would have died even if he had been taken straight to the nearest 
trauma center. But in other instances, when a few minutes can determine whether 
a person lives or dies, ending up on the doorstep of the wrong hospital could 
be disastrous, emergency medical experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only three trauma centers in Orange County. They are at UCI Medical 
Center in Orange, Western Medical Center in Santa Ana and Mission Hospital 
Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. Although all but a handful of the 
county's 34 hospitals have emergency rooms, those facilities do not provide 
specialized trauma care for gunshot wounds and other serious, life-threatening 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Orange County Medical Services, the following hospitals are not 
certified to receive ambulance patients: Santa Ana Hospital Medical Center, 
Orange County Community Hospital in Buena Park, Buena Park Medical Center, 
College Hospital Costa Mesa and Doctors Hospital of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency response officials said Thursday that it is usually advisable to 
dial 911 in extreme emergencies, rather than relying on one's own wits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big difference is that the paramedic units can stabilize a patient and 
start treatment, whereas if you just pack them in the car, you don't have that 
advantage," said Garden Grove Administrative Division Chief Jerry Halberstadt. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he said, when a person has been shot, paramedics often use an 
inflatable device to force the flow of blood from the limbs to the brain. 
Intravenous lines are also inserted during the ride to the hospital to allow 
replacement of bodily fluids or infusion of medication. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, when the ambulance reaches the hospital, the trauma center staff has 
already been notified and has had time to make advance preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you just drive your relative over to the hospital, you catch the staff 
completely unaware," Halberstadt said. "You just walk in and offload on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Orange County Fire Department echoed those sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paramedics can also tell you what to do before help gets to you in cases 
like a drowning, choking or childbirth," said spokeswoman Maria Sobol. "If you 
try to take them yourself, all kinds of things could occur." Trauma Centers 
</P>
<P>
 Just three hospitals in Orange County are equipped to handle traumatic 
injuries. In addition, two trauma centers in Long Beach serve parts of western 
Orange County. 
</P>

4 CO-WORKERS IN IRVINE WIN LOT O' BUCKS; LOTTERY: THEY QUIT THEIR JOBS AT AN 
INSURANCE COMPANY AFTER LANDING $6.8 MILLION IN A $20-MILLION JACKPOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Four co-workers at an Irvine insurance company fulfilled just about every 
employee's fantasy Thursday: They promptly quit their jobs after winning a 
share of a $20-million lottery jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
 The women's investment in a winning Super Lotto ticket (which came to $3.25 
each for 13 Quick Picks) suddenly catapulted them from "unimportant, unlucky" 
claims processors at Fidelity National Title Insurance Co. to millionaires, 
they said during a news conference at a California Lottery district office 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The four friends, who said they are "like family," will be sharing $6.8 
million of Wednesday's $20-million jackpot. That means they each will receive 
$85,250 a year, before taxes, over the next 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other winning tickets have not been turned in yet, lottery officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The departure of the four Fidelity workers means the 150-employee Irvine 
branch will lose an entire department. Their boss, however, remained sanguine 
about the sudden turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the claims payment processing department," said Frank P. Willey, 
executive vice president of Fidelity. "We'll hire new people unless they end up 
reconsidering. Maybe their euphoria will temper a little. It'll be business as 
usual." 
</P>
<P>
 But there were no signs of waning excitement as the four women checked off a 
list of "to do's" with their first check. Although they declined to say how 
much they made at Fidelity, they said it was "much less" than what they will be 
getting in lottery money each year. And there were no mentions of returning to 
work -- except maybe to help train the new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had a picture of (Willey's) face when we told him," said Suzanne 
Seibold, 40, of Westminster. "He didn't believe it at first. He thought we were 
on a strike because we were ticked off" about a 10% pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina DiGeorge, 22, of Garden Grove had worked in the department for only a 
week when she adopted 13 as the group's lucky number and urged co-worker Debra 
Larson to purchase 13 Quick Pick tickets at a liquor store in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Seibold said she had to scrounge in her purse for enough money to pay for the 
lottery tickets. Karla Bresette, 22, of Westminster also contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson, 31, of Garden Grove, said, "We just went nuts" when lottery officials 
verified their good fortune Wednesday at 8:08 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were yelling, crying, screaming. It was pandemonium," Larson said 
breathlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Larson and Bresette said they plan to use a part of their winnings to upgrade 
weddings and extend honeymoons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best feeling in the world," Larson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seibold said she plans to finish writing a novel that chronicles her parents' 
lives. She will also pursue her dream of sharing a glass of Calvados brandy 
under the Arc de Triomphe in Paris with her husband, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 DiGeorge, who has played guitar since the age of 6, said she wants to build 
her own music studio at her home and record blues music. 
</P>
<P>
 Seibold's family and Larson's fiance also attended the news conference, where 
lottery district manager Charles E. Haywood presented them with a mock check 
for $6.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Seibold said she will help fill the empty claims processing department at 
Fidelity by training new employees for her job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of it is that I want to work instead of I have to," said Seibold, 
who once supervised the small department. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other winning tickets were purchased in San Bernardino and Pittsburg in 
Northern California. If not claimed within 180 days, the money will go into the 
California education system, said Haywood, the lottery district manager.

EPA ASKED TO LIGHTEN RULES IN CLEAN-AIR PLAN; ENVIRONMENT: LOCAL POLLUTION 
CONTROL DISTRICT'S STATEMENT SAYS FEDERAL PROPOSAL COULD DAMAGE VENTURA COUNTY 
ECONOMICALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County air quality officials are asking the federal government to back 
off on several severe measures included in a proposed plan to clean up the 
county's air, saying the measures could ruin the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The harshest measures to curtail local air pollution sources could force 
factories to reduce output and drive small trucking firms out of business, the 
officials say in the county's first formal position statement on a proposed 
federal plan due to go into effect early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're looking at production cutbacks, laying people off or relocating out of 
the county," said Bill Mount, assistant manager of the Ventura County Air 
Pollution Control District and overseer of local plans for clean air. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not good for Ventura County. But if you put that type of a burden on 
business, what other choice do they have?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mount and the staff -- siding with county businesses and agriculture in 
seeking less stringent federal rules -- also recommend in a letter to the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency that regulations to limit air pollutants in 
pesticides be phased in over time. 
</P>
<P>
 They also are asking that fees on shipping at the Port of Hueneme be removed 
and surcharges to discourage industrial pollution eliminated in favor of 
positive incentives to reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district also called for tougher controls in other areas. Regulations 
on private car smog checks, train locomotives, shipping in the Santa Barbara 
Channel and supply boats to offshore oil rigs should be more stringent, the 
district contends. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's written comments on the EPA's proposed program will be 
discussed Tuesday by the Board of Supervisors and the Air Pollution Control 
Board, which includes the board and city representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors will also consider whether to approve their own position 
statement objecting to several of the same provisions and encouraging 
consideration of the local plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA is accepting written comments on the plan through the end of August, 
and expects to issue its final document in February 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the district's proposals parallel those in a local alternative plan 
developed by the Ventura County Economic Development Assn. and the local 
Council on Economic Vitality in conjunction with the air pollution district. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Paulger, co-chair of the Council on Economic Vitality, said he was 
pleased that the district offered support for the local plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really in favor of the enhanced (smog check) program," he said. "We 
have to get a substantially increased reduction from automobiles." 
</P>
<P>
 He called the development of the local plan a "monumental piece of work and an 
extraordinary coming together of all aspects of the community: the (air 
pollution) agency, business and environmentalists." 
</P>
<P>
 Paulger said he was disappointed, however, that the air pollution district did 
not take a position on one of the most controversial measures in the local 
plan, which would ask the state to impose fees on individual motorists based on 
the number of miles they drive and the amount of pollution their cars produce. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA issued the proposed federal implementation plan in February under 
court order, six years after the Citizens to Preserve the Ojai sued the agency. 
The Citizens contended that the EPA should not have approved a local air 
quality plan that did not meet federal health standards for clean air. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal implementation plan also covers Sacramento and Los Angeles, which 
were also sued by environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The most contested provision of the plan would require industry to reduce its 
emissions yearly, without allowing credit for reductions already made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have some of the toughest rules in the country and most of our 
sources are already operating with the best available technology," Mount said. 
"The sources that have already done the most to reduce emissions would be 
penalized." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal plan should also allow industry to continue trading emission 
reductions, the district says. It was through that program that Procter & 
Gamble was able to expand its Oxnard plant by buying emission reduction credits 
from 3M, which had voluntarily reduced its pollution well beyond the level 
required. 
</P>
<P>
 3M then donated the money paid by Procter & Gamble to create a new clean-air 
fund in the county to help reduce pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than place so much emphasis on stationary sources of pollutants, the 
plan should require mobile sources to pick up more of their share of the 
burden, the district contends. 
</P>
<P>
 The smog check program in the state should be reorganized so that cars are 
checked at centralized locations with sophisticated equipment that provides a 
truer picture of tail-pipe emissions when the car is running. Those shops would 
be state monitored and would offer inspections only with out repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "That eliminates the possibility of conflict of interest," Mount said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, ocean shipping lanes that handle large tanker and container ship 
traffic should be moved outside the Channel Islands, the district recommends. 
Those ships now travel through the Santa Barbara Channel, allowing their 
emissions to move onshore into the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The large boats that supply materials and shuttle crews to the offshore oil 
rigs along the Ventura and Santa Barbara coast should also be regulated, as 
they contribute a substantial amount of nitrogen oxide emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA plan should also allow more credit for reductions in emissions already 
made by Southern California Edison at its two county plants. The plants have 
been reducing emissions since passage of a strict new regulation imposed 
locally that required 90% cuts in pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 But a surcharge on vessels calling at Port Hueneme should be eliminated, since 
the port is "too small to regulate" and the charges could discourage use of the 
county's only deep-water port, the district said. 
</P>
<P>
 And a plan that would require large trucks to make only one stop within the 
county per trip or convert to clean-fuel engines by 1999 is too tough, and 
would hurt local businesses, the district said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the regulation should allow the clean-fuel trucks to be phased in, 
and should begin first with the larger fleets and then pick up the smaller 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Controls on pesticides, which contain spreading agents that cause air 
pollutants, should be imposed in such a manner that allows California enough 
time to adopt statewide regulations. In addition, manufacturers should be able 
to trade reductions with other manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a manufacturer that reduces pollutants by 75% in one product 
should be allowed to sell credits to another company that makes a pesticide 
critical to agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Leavens, newly installed president of the Ventura County Economic 
Development Assn. and a rancher in the county, applauded the district's 
comments and cooperation with agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad enough when you pit California farmers against all the other farmers 
in the country, with the stringent requirements we have here. But if you also 
pit some of the growers in California against the rest of California growers, 
that's compounding the felony." 
</P>
<P>
 If the EPA accepts the district recommendations, it will be "win-win for 
everybody. We're working with standards that we can all live with," she said.

VENTURA COUNTY FAIR; FOR FAIR-GOERS, RIDES ARE A REAL SCREAM; ENTERTAINMENT: 
ONE BOLD PATRON SAMPLES ALL THE HEART-STOPPING, WHITE-KNUCKLE ATTRACTIONS IN 
SEVEN HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 High noon on the midway, and Steve Charleston is talking about drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
 As a concessions manager at the Ventura County Fair, part of his job is to 
make sure the rides are safe and the operators sober. So carnies are randomly 
tested for drugs and booze, and Charleston regularly strides past the 
amusements keeping an eye out for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to keep it clean," he explains. "It's a business. . .It's just like 
McDonald's." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not quite. The issue of drug testing is far different for a fry cook 
than it is for a worker assembling and operating fair rides. And the 
blood-curdling screams erupting from the whirling midway machines are unlike 
anything you will find at a fast-food joint. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Charleston has done little to build up the confidence of the 
faint-hearted. Fact of the matter is, some of these beasts are downright mean 
looking. 
</P>
<P>
 One ride rotates like the hands of a clock run amok. Others spin so violently 
that pregnant women and those with weak hearts and bad backs are warned not to 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Many follow a familiar pattern: They start out easy, lulling riders into a 
false sense of complacency. Then they pick up speed, spinning one way before 
slowing nearly to a stop and spinning the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, my reaction to many of these rides also follows a familiar 
pattern: Panic. Then nausea, followed by weak knees and a cold sweat. Finally, 
this thought: Stop the world, I want to get off. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more than 40 rides crammed into the midway at the county fair, there 
are about 10 souped-up, super-speed machines designed to make you weak and 
woozy. These are a favorite of the younger generation and the iron-stomached 
set. 
</P>
<P>
 I belong to neither. Yet I was assigned this week to sample every 
heart-stopping white-knuckler at the fair. I did it in about seven hours. And I 
pray I'll never have to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Because when it comes to rides that whirl at blinding speed, I'm more like 
29-year-old Lisa Schmeltz of Camarillo, who stood by as her niece and nephew 
climbed aboard a ride called Force 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's wicked," she said in amazement, watching the ride gain speed and 
disappear into a blur of purple and gold. "I mean, really, look at that. That's 
a wicked ride." 
</P>
<P>
 She was right. Force 10 prides itself on generating enough gravitational force 
to pin riders deep in their seats. Signs warn would-be passengers to keep off 
if they are in poor health. 
</P>
<P>
 When it starts, it looks like a roulette wheel with baskets. It lifts 90 
degrees and ends up looking like a Ferris wheel gone out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmeltz's nephew and niece -- Gideon Gulsvig, 12, and Crystal Gulsvig, 11 -- 
came off the ride stepping sideways, trying to maintain their balance. I'll 
admit, I did the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time for something a bit kinder and gentler. From the top of the Grand 
Wheel, the midway unfolds in bright splashes of crimson and gold. The Ferris 
wheel also offers an unmatched view of the Ventura coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did I know that I would soon see the water from a different angle. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked 11-year-old Laura Kosman of Ventura if I could join her on a behemoth 
by the name of Top Spin. She said she had already been on six of the fastest, 
most dizzying rides the fair had to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 She also told me she was a screamer. She told the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Spin raises you almost as high as the Ferris wheel, before twirling you 
end-over-end. The highlight of the ride is an upside-down view of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura shrieked the whole time, but when it was over she asked: "Is that all? 
It wasn't long enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are those rides that last too long. The Wave, for example, is a 
mechanized version of a school-yard merry-go-round. But it's fast and seems 
like it will never stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the carny at the controls is no help. Part ride operator and part 
disc jockey, he lays down a smooth rap while The Wave picks up momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys want to go faster?" he shouts into a microphone above blaring rock 
music and a piercing truck horn. "C'mon Ventura County, let me hear you 
scream!" 
</P>
<P>
 I'm screaming. I'm screaming for him to stop, or at least slow down. He must 
mistake that for a desire to go faster. He pushes the throttle forward and more 
screams explode. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally it stops. Cold sweat and weak knees. My balance has been ruined, 
possibly forever. I've got to sit down. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a few hours to figure out the key to getting through the day. If you 
ride one that makes you sick, follow with one that doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 So after taking a spin on Gravitron -- a ride that whirls so fast that you 
stick to the walls -- I took a cruise on the bumper cars. And after the Twister 
-- a ride so violent that you slam into your riding partner again and again -- 
I went on a small version of a haunted house. 
</P>
<P>
 I climbed aboard something called 1,001 Nights, despite concerns about the 
reliability of a ride that had been closed a couple of hours for technical 
adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, I asked a couple of carnies about those safety issues. Ric Kelly 
has more than 30 years in the business while Ron Loken has 25. Both say much 
has changed from the old days of clunky, hand-operated rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the rides are high-tech and computer-operated. If a door doesn't shut 
or a lap bar doesn't close, the rides don't go. The machines are inspected four 
or five times a day and if there is even the hint of a problem, they are 
immediately shut down for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly and Loken work a ride called the Kamikaze. They pay attention to their 
machine and to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their facial expressions mean a lot," Kelly said. "There's a lot of 
difference between being scared and being terrified." 
</P>
<P>
 I trust they know what they are talking about as I'm strapped in a ride that 
circles round-and-round like the hands of a clock. Apparently, I don't look 
terrified because I do the whole 90 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 But by this point in the day, I'm really ready for the world to stop so I can 
get off. Fred's Wild Rides: A Pick-Six Opinionated Guide Ride: 1. Kamikaze 
Description: A 32-seat, souped-up version of the old standard "The Hammer," the 
two arms of this ride spin clockwise, then counter-clockwise. Highlight: the 
ride can ends by hanging you upside down for a few seconds. Opinion: The 
Kamikaze is 90 itty-bitty seconds of fun, so that even the faint of heart can 
try it and like it. * Ride: 2. Force 10 Description: At the start, this ride 
resembles a roulette wheel with baskets. At the end, the wheel raises 90 
degrees and resembles an out-of-control ferris wheel. Opinion: This beast 
prides itself on G forces that nail riders to their seats. Only those with iron 
stomachs need apply. * Ride: 3. Grand Wheel Description: This old-fashioned 
ferris wheel offers an unmatched view of the midway and the Ventura coastline. 
Opinion: A welcome break from rides designed to leave you woozy. A must at any 
carnival. * Ride: 4. Top Spin Description: It is designed to do one thing: 
raise you in the air, spin you around and suspend you upside down. You share a 
long bench seat, or sit back-to-back, with others in your shoes. Opinion: 
Amazingly gentle, if you don't mind blood rushing to your head. * Ride: 5. 
Twister Description: Imagine the Mad Hatter's tea cups run amok. The baskets of 
this ride spin wildly from side-to-side. Share a seat and you'll slam into your 
partner over and over again. Opinion: This is a bruising ride that goes too 
fast and lasts too long. It leaves you dizzy and sore. * Ride: 6. Ghost Pirates 
Description: A cramped car leads you on a short trip past scary stuff. Opinion: 
It costs two bucks to ride. Save your money. * SCHEDULE OF EVENTS: B2

JUDGE ALDRICH PICKED FOR APPEALS POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just three years after Richard D. Aldrich was appointed a Ventura County 
Superior Court judge, Gov. Pete Wilson picked him Thursday to become a state 
appeals court justice in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 If Aldrich passes an Aug. 29 confirmation hearing by the Commission on 
Judicial Appointments, he will become the newest justice in Division 3 of the 
2nd District Court of Appeals. He is replacing Justice Edward Hinz, who retired 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very honored that the governor would have enough confidence in me and my 
work on the Ventura courts to have made the appointment," Aldrich said 
Thursday. "I'm hopeful of making a significant contribution to the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County lawyers applauded the appointment of the popular, top-ranked 
judge to the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is one of the most respected Superior Court judges in Ventura County, 
notwithstanding he's only been on the bench for three years," said Thomas 
Hinkle, president-elect of the Ventura County Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinkle called Aldrich "a gentleman" who has an excellent judicial temperament. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is extremely knowledgeable in the law," Hinkle said. "He usually is able 
to cite to counsel appearing before him the rules of law before they cite the 
rules to the judge, which is not usual. He is an excellent trial judge." 
</P>
<P>
 Aldrich, 56, of Westlake Village, who has called himself a moderate 
Republican, was appointed to the Superior Court in 1990 by departing Gov. 
George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 For the previous 20 years, Aldrich had been president of the law corporation 
that bore his name, specializing in general civil litigation, business fraud, 
attorney and medical malpractice, insurance bad faith, personal injury and 
products liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, he worked for a year as counsel for Great Western Savings & Loan 
in Los Angeles, after earning a bachelor's degree from Loyola University and 
his law degree from UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Aldrich wrote a letter asking Deukmejian to consider him for a 
judgeship.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, the American Board of Trial Advocates named him 1990 
California trial lawyer of the year, and California Lawyer magazine listed him 
as one of the state's most respected lawyers, describing him as "a smart and 
aggressive trial attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Deukmejian appointed him in late December, 1990, and just 16 months after his 
appointment, a Ventura County Bar Assn. members' poll ranked Aldrich the best 
judge in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll awarded him the top overall score -- 8.35 out of a possible 10 points 
-- and ranked him highest of all Ventura County Superior Court judges for 
demeanor, efficiency, knowledge of the law and integrity/courage. 
</P>
<P>
 And in 1993, the Ventura County Trial Lawyers Assn. named him and Municipal 
Judge Barry B. Klopfer the outstanding jurists of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since joining the bench, he has been instrumental in setting up the Open Door 
Courthouse, a program of trial alternatives including mediation and settlement 
conferences conducted by bar association members donating their time, said 
Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 His 27 years as a civil lawyer will serve him as well as his three years 
judging experience when he begins ruling on the law as an appeals court 
justice, Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very intelligent, very skilled, very experienced civil litigator who's 
made an excellent judge," Campbell said. "Very few judges have his background 
in terms of the level of excellence and quality he had as a private 
practitioner." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "I'm very happy for him, but I'm deeply disappointed for the court. 
I know he'll be missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Aldrich said he is not sure why he won elevation to the appeals court in the 
relatively short span of three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics have always been a mystery, so I don't know," he said. "Although, I 
have done a lot of work with the (state) Judicial Council since my appointment 
to Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Aldrich said, he served on a council advisory committee on 
civil and small claims courts and was chairman of a subcommittee on case 
management and delay reduction, "So perhaps some of that work came to someone's 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Aldrich, who is married and has three sons in their 20s, said he has no plans 
to move from Westlake Village to shorten his commute to the appeals court in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he will miss "the collegiality that I enjoyed in Ventura. I'm 
going to miss every judge in that court, and every person on that 
administrative staff. My personal staff was absolutely the best I've ever 
experienced." 
</P>
<P>
 There are seven divisions in the 2nd District Court of Appeals. Division 6 
covers the counties of Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo, while 
Division 3, where Aldrich will serve, covers Los Angeles County.

TRIAL ORDERED IN SHOOTING OF TEEN-AGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Speaking softly from his wheelchair, a 14-year-old boy recalled in court 
Thursday how he was left paralyzed after an angry neighbor burst into his 
Ventura Keys home in January, pulled a handgun and shot him in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing the dramatic testimony, Ventura County Municipal Judge James P. 
Cloninger ordered 21-year-old defendant Brian Adams to stand trial for the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 An arraignment for Adams on charges of attempted premeditated murder and 
burglary was set for Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Kevin Natale, spent six months in the hospital after the shooting 
and now has no use of his legs, hands or left arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking into a microphone clipped to his T-shirt, Kevin recalled playing 
video games with his teen-age friend Sean Wilcox in his living room when he 
heard a rap on the front door in the early evening hours of Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean went to answer the door, but Adams charged in first and tackled Sean, 
according to testimony, then pulled from his waistband a 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic pistol and fired at Kevin in the living room, according to 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 When he saw the gun, Kevin said he headed for the back door, but was hit in 
the spine by a bullet. "I heard a shot, and I went down," he told the silent 
courtroom, where about a dozen family and friends listened. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Kevin could testify, Adams' lawyer had asked the court to postpone the 
hearing because Adams tried to commit suicide in jail Tuesday. Defense lawyer 
George C. Eskin said he ingested about two weeks worth of anti-depressant pills 
that he had been hoarding in his cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III, who heard the request to delay the 
hearing, refused, although a psychologist testified Adams needed time to 
recover from depression related to the suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams previously had been treated at Patton State Hospital, where he was 
determined to be mentally competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Kevin's comments, Judge Cloninger heard testimony from Sean and 
Ventura Police Detective Pat Stevens. Sean described how Adams burst through 
the front door, knocked him down and shot Kevin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pushed me down into a corner, put his hand over my mouth and pulled a gun 
out," Sean said. He said Adams was wearing latex gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 The detective said that shortly after the shooting, Adams called police from a 
phone booth about 1 1/2 miles away to give himself up. Police found a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun at the phone booth. Adams had purchased the 
gun four days before the shooting from Shooters Paradise in Oxnard, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens, however, said Adams told police he never entered the Natale house. He 
said Adams admitted shooting Kevin, but only after he heard a noise outside the 
house and saw the boy charging him. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his testimony, Kevin said Adams seemed to hold a grudge against him 
ever since the Natale family moved to Dolphin Court three years before the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 While he occasionally played with Adams' younger brother, Kevin said the only 
thing Adams had ever said to him during those three years was to stay off his 
family's property. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin, who was involved in organized baseball, soccer and basketball, said 
Adams would get irritated when Kevin played ball in the street. The Natale and 
Adams families live across the street from one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin testified that things between his family and Adams' heated up in April, 
1993. That was when Adams attacked Kevin's stepfather after a tennis ball 
thrown by Kevin hit Adams' car. 
</P>
<P>
 The stepfather was attacked when he went to retrieve the ball, Kevin said. He 
testified that the only way he could get Adams to stop hitting his stepfather 
was to hit Adams once with an aluminum baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams chased Kevin, but never caught him after being struck in the thigh by 
the bat. That same night, however, the tires on his stepfather's car were 
slashed, Kevin said. 
</P>
<P>
 After that incident, Kevin said he tried to stay clear of Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seven months between the flare-up and the shooting, Kevin said he had 
no major problems with Adams. And he said he was surprised to see the defendant 
burst through his door. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, Ventura clinical psychologist Katherine Emerick testified 
that Adams had told her "he had to do something to stop the bad feelings" 
between he and Kevin. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerick also testified that Adams told her why he wore gloves when he charged 
through the Natale family's front door Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're Arnold Schwarzenegger, you want to go in with all your equipment," 
Adams said, according to Emerick.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TEENS LEARN MEDICINE BY DOING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High school senior Dawn Sneed assumed she would just watch the doctors treat 
cancer patients when her internship at FHP Hospital in Fountain Valley rotated 
to the oncology ward. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she was told she would take every patient's vital signs. A nurse 
showed her how to use the equipment and gave her a white lab coat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just like dress-up," Sneed said of the uniform that marks doctors 
everywhere. "I got to put it on and think that some day I would have my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Sneed was one of 21 Orange County high school students who started the long 
years of study and training required for a medical career by interning at FHP. 
</P>
<P>
 The students were scattered at various sites belonging to the huge HMO, and 
tasks varied from hands-on experience with patients to office work. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina To, a Huntington Beach senior who plans to be a doctor, learned to 
negotiate the labyrinth of bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just helps inform me how careful the company is," said To, who worked in 
the office that credentials doctors. "I guess it surprised me how much 
paperwork it takes to get hired by a company like this." 
</P>
<P>
 To said she discovered the allure of science in eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Another intern, Olga Tutulugdzija, had been leaning toward hotel management 
until she won her internship at FHP's Specialty Center in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she has decided to follow her mother's example and take courses to become 
a registered nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw nurses working with the patients, that inspired me," said 
Tutulugdzija, a senior at Cypress High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Nursing would fulfill her desire to work with people but would not involve the 
frantic pace that doctors live, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The intern also learned about the ups and downs of the job. "When I saw 
chemotherapy being done on a 2-year-old, that just broke me down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the emotional side of the job are the sacrifices, said Sneed, who 
talked with many doctors about their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were saying you are going to have to put your family on hold a lot," she 
said. Sneed already follows that code to some extent and does not have a 
boyfriend. "I don't have time for that right now," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 The FHP program will conclude in about a week. Many of the interns, like 
Sneed, have no regrets about missing lazy summer days hanging out with friends 
at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first real job," Tutulugdzija said. "I'm real sad that it's over."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY WILL CONTINUE ITS RETIREMENT TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Property owners will continue paying a special tax that covers city employee 
retirement costs, despite opposition from two City Council members who voted to 
eliminate it.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week voted 4 to 2 to set the rate for the property-tax 
levy, which is expected to raise $6.25 million to pay 67% of employee 
retirement costs.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson and Councilman David Sullivan voted against the 
measure; they wanted the tax to be phased out over a five-year period and to 
exempt public safety cutbacks from the effects of any revenue loss. Councilman 
Jim Silva was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The special tax has been in place since voters approved it in 1966. The 
average homeowner pays $84 a year, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a poor tax," Moulton Patterson said. "To me it has nothing to do with 
the retirement system. . . . I don't like the way it is levied and I can't vote 
to continue it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan had made a motion to phase out the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 "My objection is we're the only city in Orange County that has this particular 
tax," Sullivan said. "All the other 30 cities have to deal with it upfront out 
of the general fund." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan also proposed putting a measure on the November ballot to let voters 
decide whether to repeal the tax, but he failed to gain the support of the 
council at the Aug. 1 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Grace Winchell said the tax "may not be a perfect tax," but 
called it fair and equitable. Winchell added that there is no way to replace 
the revenue should the tax be eliminated, especially now when the city is 
facing budget cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan called the tax, which on property tax bills is referred to as 
Huntington Beach city debt, a hidden tax that citizens are not aware they are 
paying. 
</P>
<P>
 The council majority also voted to send a letter asking the county 
auditor-controller to change the wording on tax bills to reflect the nature of 
the tax. The city will request that the city tax levy be labeled as "City 
Retirement Costs." 
</P>
<P>
 The city pays for employees' share of their retirement costs. City annual 
retirement costs total about $9.7 million. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; ZOO IS ORGANIZING AN AFRICAN SAFARI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Zoo has long offered a glimpse of exotic wildlife in a natural 
setting, but now it plans to raise money by going one step further. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in February, the zoo will take its patrons to see the real thing 
during a 13-day trip to Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity to see some of the best game viewing in East Africa," 
said director Ron Glazier. "There's nothing like seeing an animal in its 
natural environment. It's just a different experience."  
</P>
<P>
 While other zoos have sponsored similar treks, this will be the first such 
safari offered locally. Included in the trip's $3,175 price tag is a $100 
donation to the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is kind of a fund-raiser, but it is an educational trip as well," Glazier 
said. The trip is expected to raise $3,000 for the zoo's capital improvement 
fund, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers will leave from New York on Feb. 12 and return there Feb. 24. The 
itinerary includes a stop in Vienna before proceeding to Nairobi, where 
visitors will stop at several game preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the wildlife is disappearing in some of these areas. It's good 
to see them in areas that are protected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers will see animals such as elephants, impala, zebras, ostriches, 
gazelles and cheetahs. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoo officials are planning a slide show presentation in October for people 
interested in the trip. Information: (714) 836-4000. JON NALICK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; ADULT EDUCATION ADVOCATES ANGRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angered by a proposal to take more than $450,000 from the Simi Valley adult 
education program to offset the school district's $3.2-million deficit, adult 
school students and employees reprimanded school board members this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding up a Band-Aid during the board's meeting Tuesday night, adult school 
employee Margaret Leese accused the trustees of using adult education's budget 
as a bandage for the district's financial wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "All little people want a Band-Aid when they have an owie," she said. "This 
district has an owie and adult education is its Band-Aid." 
</P>
<P>
 The adult education program, which is the largest in Ventura County, serving 
about 11,000 students, has carefully saved millions over the past 10 years, 
said Sondra Jones, adult education director. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, California legislation said money generated in adult education 
must stay in adult education and cannot be used to fund K-12 programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state Legislature recently changed that law by allowing school 
districts to take 10% of adult education money for this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident and former adult school student Walt Madrid told the 
board  
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday that just because the state permits the transfer does not mean the 
trustees should take such action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think this is wrong," Madrid said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some school board members responded angrily to the embittered pleas, 
reminding community members that the district is facing a massive deficit that 
warrants the transfer of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed that the adult school would come forward and say, 'Don't 
touch us,' " Trustee Diane Collins said. "It's about all I can do to sit here 
and listen to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board will vote on the transfer of funds at its next meeting Sept.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; WOMAN ELECTROCUTED IN RESIDENTIAL POOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman was electrocuted late Wednesday night in a swimming pool that may have 
had a wiring problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Douglas, 21, was pronounced dead shortly after midnight at West 
Anaheim Medical Center, said Garden Grove police Lt. John Woods.He did not know 
whether Douglas lived at the house where the pool was located. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary investigation indicated "possible faulty wiring," Woods said. He 
said Garden Grove Fire Department workers answered a call about a reported 
drowning at 11:10 p.m. in the 11100 block of Biscayne Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers determined she had been electrocuted in the pool, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison technicians were called in to check wiring but 
found no problems with the company's wires going from the street to the house, 
said Criss Brown, spokesman for the utility. The company is not responsible for 
wiring on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation is continuing into the cause of the electrocution, police 
said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; BAN ON SLEEPING IN CARS AT NIGHT OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has tentatively approved an ordinance that prohibits people 
from sleeping in parked vehicles between 9 p.m. and 9 a.m. The proposed law is 
modeled after one enacted by the city of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every city that I know has it," said Councilman Jim Potts, who is a sergeant 
with the Irvine Police Department."I was shocked that we didn't have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Potts said he requested the new law after hearing complaints recently about a 
man who was sleeping in a disabled car that had been towed to a residential cul 
de sac. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stayed in his car for four or five days," Potts said. "You can't expect 
residents to put up with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law, approved by a 5-0 vote on its first reading Monday, would not 
apply to people sleeping in campers, motor coaches or motor vans parked in 
trailer courts or campsites within the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Final approval of the ordinance is expected at the Sept. 6 council meeting.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; WOMAN TO DONATE KIDNEY TO SISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley woman and her sister plan to be laid out on operating tables in 
a UCLA surgery center Wednesday, put to sleep and opened up so one can receive 
an extraordinary gift. Angie Tomlin, 29, of Ashland, Ore., has volunteered to 
donate one of her healthy kidneys to her sister, 36-year-old Karen Drumheller 
of Simi Valley, whose own kidneys have failed after 19 years of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my sister very much, and I want to see her healthy," Tomlin said 
Thursday. "She's a really active person, and lately she just hasn't been able 
to do all the things she'd like to do, so I want to help her out." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors told her she will be able to function normally on just one kidney, and 
the one she donates will help her sister return to a normal life, said Tomlin, 
a nurse's aide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right kidney grows to compensate and take up the work the left kidney 
did," Tomlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drumheller, who has been forced to cleanse her blood with dialysis treatments 
every four hours for nearly two years, said she is thrilled with her sister's 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do I say? It's just wonderful," Drumheller said. "I don't know how to 
thank her." 
</P>
<P>
 Local doctors were skeptical, telling Drumheller the diabetes would only kill 
the implanted healthy kidney, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 But after intensive medical tests, UCLA specialists cleared the sisters for 
the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the incisions are made in separate operating rooms, one of Drumheller's 
damaged kidneys will be removed, as will her sister's healthy left kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlin's healthy kidney will be flushed out, put on ice and taken across the 
hall to her sister's operating room, where surgeons will implant it in 
Drumheller. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women will be kept in the hospital for observation for six days and, if 
all goes well, sent home for four to six weeks of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, doctors will transfuse one pint of blood from Tomlin to 
Drumheller the day of surgery and one pint 10 days after in an experimental 
treatment meant to thwart tissue rejection, Drumheller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomlin said she is a little nervous about the surgery, but is looking forward 
to coming out of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Drumheller said she is nervous, too, but she is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Day One, I wanted a transplant," she said. "Because it's either do 
(dialysis) for the rest of my life or do a transplant." MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PLANNERS APPROVE RECYLING PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan that would force existing and future Simi Valley housing developments 
to set aside specific areas for recycling dumpsters has been approved by the 
Simi Valley Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission agreed Wednesday night to forward the proposal to the City 
Council for final approval.If passed, it will revise Simi Valley's current 
recycling ordinance and bring the city closer to state-mandated recycling 
goals, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state requires cities to divert 25% of their trash away from landfills by 
1995 by setting up new recycling and composting programs. Cities must divert 
50% of their trash by Jan. 1, 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's plan would require developers to include specific areas for 
recycling bins in their development proposals. And existing housing projects 
would be required to set up recycling areas before they could receive new city 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal passed on a 4-0 vote at Wednesday night's Planning Commission 
meeting. Commission Chairman Dave McCormick was absent. MATTHEW MOSK

<TEXT>
<P>
 A tree will grow in Boisseranc Park Memorial Grove to honor community 
volunteer Dorothy S. Maurer. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree will be planted Saturday, in keeping with an annual tradition since 
1984 that remembers a deceased community activist.Maurer will be honored for 
her 13,000 hours of service to Buena Park's senior citizens.  
</P>
<P>
 "She would go out early in the morning and pick up day-old bread and take it 
to the seniors," recalled William Maurer, her husband. "She had a lot of 
plaques from the state and the city and the county for her special efforts." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Maurer was president of the Senior Center's transportation, luncheon 
and counseling program for more than eight years and was active in the Emblem 
Club, according to a resolution adopted by the City Council Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city expects about 100 people to attend the park ceremony at 1 p.m., when 
a white alder will be planted. Maurer's name will be added to a plaque honoring 
past volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her three children, Marilyn Hanson of Buena Park, Micheal Maurer of Placentia 
and Mary Kraft of Pine Grove, will join friends and dignitaries for the 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Maurer died in 1989 at age 73.LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; COUNCIL OKS 3% HIKE IN DEVELOPER FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Developer fees have been increased by 3% as the City Council tries to raise 
money to pay for streets and sewer and water lines for new developments. 
</P>
<P>
 The fees hike, which was approved Tuesday, only applies to new residential and 
commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Lynn, environmental programs manager, said that six fees make up the 
developer fees, including those for sewers, annexation to water districts and 
median beautification. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn said the higher fees will provide revenue to meet the increasing costs of 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time developer fees were raised was in the summer of 1991, Lynn said. 
She said fees had not been raised so far during the recession in order to 
promote building in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 How much revenue the new fees will generate depends on the number of projects 
that receive city approval, Lynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the council approved spending $71,244 to buy five new police 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 Ford Crown Victoria police cars will be bought through an order 
placed by the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. DEBRA CANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOL BOARD REJECTS $1-MILLION CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley school board has rejected a $1-million claim by a former Simi 
Valley High School student who alleged that his basketball coach caused him 
physical and emotional damage by grabbing him during a Jan. 14 game. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen-year-old Samuel Rodriguez's administrative claim accused varsity 
basketball coach Dean Bradshaw of squeezing his neck, shoulder and arm and then 
throwing him down on a bench after the guard was given a technical foul during 
a game against Westlake High School. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials suspended Bradshaw for the final nine games of the season 
over the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley school board members rejected Rodriguez's claim during their 
meeting Tuesday night, a standard procedure for all administrative claims, 
Supt. E. Leon Mattingley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Expecting that the claim would be rejected, the Rodriguez family now intends 
to file a lawsuit, said Daniel R. Gonzalez, Rodriguez's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got six months in which to file a lawsuit against the district and 
the coach and that's what they are looking at doing," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires plaintiffs to file administrative claims before a lawsuit can 
be filed in Ventura County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, a senior at the time of the incident, graduated this spring. TRACY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; HELP FOR IMMIGRANTS AVAILABLE BY PHONE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Immigrants living in Orange County who want to change their status may request 
forms by telephone and need not go to an Immigration and Naturalization Service 
office, an INS official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Kice of the INS western regional office in Laguna Niguel said that 
the forms are available by calling (213) 526-7647.A recorded instruction will 
tell callers what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will save them a lot of time and effort," Kice said. "They will get the 
forms in the mail within five to 10 days." 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting this week in Westminster, top officials from the INS Los Angeles 
district office promised to expand the agency's services in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Kice said that the Laguna Niguel office does not provide face-to-face service 
to clients. Instead, it processes mail requests for immigrant registration card 
replacements, employment visas, citizenship applications and other 
immigration-related matters.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who need personal attention have to go to the Westminster office on 
Magnolia Avenue at Westminster Boulevard or the district office in Los Angeles, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Niguel regional office provides administrative support to INS 
offices in California, Alaska, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; TEMPLE TO LEAVE CITY FOR IRVINE BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congregation Shir Ha-Ma'alot, the oldest Reform Jewish congregation in 
southwestern Orange County, will move from a shared church property in Newport 
Beach to a new facility in Irvine next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation, founded in 1968, was originally called Harbor Reform. The 
name, changed in 1974 as a memorial to 23 teen-agers killed in a massacre in 
Ma'alot, Israel, means "song of spiritual ascent." 
</P>
<P>
 The temple has shared quarters at 2100 Mar Vista Drive with St. Mark's 
Presbyterian Church for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 25 years as joint tenants, we are looking forward to having our own 
home," Rabbi Bernie King said. "The location is both picturesque and 
convenient. More importantly, once we move in we will be able to expand our 
offerings to include child care, catering services and additional programs for 
our congregations." 
</P>
<P>
 Temple publicity coordinator Judy Uttal said the synagogue has been looking 
for a new home for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The new home, in a former sports club at 3652 Michelson Drive, fits the 
congregation's needs, Uttal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, it was in Irvine. It was important for us to be in Irvine. We 
wanted to attract young families and we thought Irvine was good for that, and 
it's central," Uttal said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building was appealing partly because it is next to a golf course that 
affords a peaceful view and partly for engineering reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Structurally, it really lent itself to be adapted," Uttal said. "It has high 
ceilings and was kind of a more open type of building, versus an office 
building or something like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the temple will look like a more traditional synagogue, Uttal 
said. Plans call for a dozen classrooms for religious school and day care, a 
kitchen and social hall, a library, teen activities room, gift shop and a 
sanctuary for 200 worshipers. The congregation will make its move Sept. 4, just 
in time for the High Holy Days.  
</P>
<P>
 Congregation members will carry the Torah three miles from the old site to the 
new one that day. Rosh Hashanah begins at sundown Sept. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to do a Torah relay. We're going to walk the Torahs and hand them 
off," Uttal said. "It will be nice to get the whole congregation involved."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; COUNCILMAN DECLINES TO RUN FOR REELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Councilman L. Allan Songstad Jr. declining to run for reelection, at 
least one newcomer will gain a seat on the City Council this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Songstad said he never intended to run for a second council term and that he 
is not a "career politician." That leaves space for at least one of the 
challengers, Cindy Greengold, Saeid Hariri, Grant R. Marcus or Charmane Riggs. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers also will try to unseat the two incumbents, R. Craig Scott and 
Randal J. Bressette. Scott, a 41-year-old attorney, and Bressette, a 
41-year-old financial planner, said they hope to serve on the council again 
because council continuity would strengthen the community and keep the city 
financially secure. 
</P>
<P>
 Songstad, Scott and Bressette said they are proud of the city's progress since 
its December, 1992, incorporation, especially in the areas of financial 
steadiness, expansion of parks and residents' growing sense of their city as 
distinct.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city is established and we have a great staff," said Songstad, 48, an 
attorney. "It's time for me to move on and someone else to move in." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the challengers, Greengold, 41, a medical office administrator, has been a 
resident of Laguna Hills for 10 years and was involved with the city 
incorporation. She also has served on the Parks and Recreation Commission for 
the past two years and is co-chair of Taxpayers for Responsible Planning, the 
Laguna Hills group campaigning against the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
airport ballot initiative.  
</P>
<P>
 Greengold said she wants to see more police protection for the city's parks 
and trails and more recreation opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Hariri, 39, a property manager, said his business experience in managing 
condominium complexes and apartment buildings would be useful in running the 
city. He said his campaign will focus on gaining library service for Laguna 
Hills and making sure that drugs, gangs and graffiti don't infiltrate the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus, a 26-year-old real estate broker, said he hopes to increase residents' 
participation in government if he is elected to the council. Along with the 
other candidates, his campaign will stress public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The other challenger is Riggs, a homemaker who did not state her age on her 
filing papers. She said she wants the community to remain safe and to have more 
activities for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the new candidates, Greengold and Riggs, live in Nellie Gail Ranch. 
That has been the area of highest council involvement, with three of the 
current council members -- Melody Carruth, Songstad and Scott also living 
there. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; COUNCIL OKS 5-YEAR REDEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan that will guide the course of redevelopment over the next five years 
was approved 4 to 1 this week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, cities must adopt five-year plans by the end of 1994 
explaining how redevelopment will reduce urban blight. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea's plan identifies goals such as completing the current downtown 
revitalization project, increasing the amount of affordable housing, marketing 
vacant industrial buildings and properties, and making infrastructure 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Kathryn E. Wiser, who cast the dissenting vote, said Brea's 
redevelopment efforts, which began in 1971, have had a "beautiful end result." 
But she said that acquiring land by use of eminent domain is too high a price 
to pay.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city wouldn't stop if we didn't have" redevelopment, Wiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea did not originally use eminent domain for redevelopment purposes, but 
that policy was reversed in 1989 because the city was having trouble getting 
the final pieces of required property. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's redevelopment efforts have been harshly criticized by some 
residents and business owners, and have been scrutinized by state and federal 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the state Fair Political Practices Commission says that one of the 
current council members, Carrey J. Nelson, apparently violated 
conflict-of-interest laws by voting on matters while he had a financial 
interest in property in the redevelopment area. No enforcement action was 
taken, however, because the statute of limitations had expired, the report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, who has decided not to run in the November election, now abstains from 
voting on redevelopment matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Former mayors Ronald E. Isles and Wayne D. Wedin also were charged with 
conflict of interest. Isles was removed from the council after being 
successfully prosecuted by the Orange County District Attorney's Office. Wedin 
was acquitted in a jury trial but chose to give up his council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the legal controversies, Councilwoman Bev Perry praised the city's 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The downtown would not have happened by itself," Perry said, referring to a 
long-delayed project to revitalize 50 acres of the city core. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's first phase got under way in June when construction began on 
Gateway Center, a 22-acre shopping complex at Imperial Highway and Brea 
Boulevard. Later phases will involve building nearly 100 single-family homes 
and developing the Birch Walk pedestrian mall with movie theaters, fountains, 
public art, shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping this will be Brea's future for some time," Perry said, "and it 
has to be done right." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Burnie Dunlap also endorsed the five-year plan and redevelopment in 
general. He pointed out that redevelopment efforts have already resulted in 
school improvements and construction of Fire Station No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Other redevelopment projects include the Civic and Cultural Center, Brea Mall, 
Brea Marketplace, renovation of the Brea plunge and widening of Imperial 
Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "This community has received enormous benefit and will continue to receive 
enormous benefit" from redevelopment, Dunlap said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Glenn G. Parker said redevelopment has allowed Brea to increase its 
sales tax income in the wake of sharp revenue losses due to the passage of 
Proposition 13. Brea now generates enough sales tax to pay for 94% of the 
public safety expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 13 changed the rules for cities," Parker said. "That's the bottom 
line." ALAN EYERLY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; RV RESORT FOES DECRY HEARING IN EUREKA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of a proposed recreational vehicle resort in Port Hueneme on 
Thursday turned out to protest a California Coastal Commission decision that 
postponed and transferred a hearing on the proposal from Long Beach to Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing on the beachfront RV resort was initially scheduled for Aug. 10, 
but the commission rescheduled the hearing for Sept. 13 in Eureka, saying it 
did not have the information necessary to vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm astonished with the unfairness and arrogance of the Coastal Commission to 
hold the hearing in Eureka, the farthest possible location from the people who 
are going to be affected by their decision," said Ann Miller, a 13-year Port 
Hueneme resident. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 residents showed up for the protest in a parking lot of Oliveira 
Plaza, where they also decried a trip to Sacramento by city officials to lobby 
state officials for the approval of the resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming obvious that the people of Port Hueneme and the agencies 
involved do not support the project," said Alan Sanders, a Port Hueneme 
resident and a member of the Sierra Club. "Their only option is to lobby the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, City Manager Richard Velthoen, Director of Community Development 
Tom Figg and Councilman and Coastal Commissioner Dorill B. Wright went to 
Sacramento to speak with representatives from state agencies including the 
Department of Fish and Game and the Department of Trade and Commerce, Figg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of our trip was to acquaint those agencies with the efforts the 
city has made to accommodate the concerns of the California Fish and Game 
Department and the Coastal Commission," Figg said. "We wanted to enlist their 
support in the project as it proceeds through the Coastal Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said they were annoyed because it is nearly impossible for many of 
them to make the 1,400-mile round trip between Ventura and Eureka, and they 
wanted the Coastal Commission to reschedule the hearing for October, when it is 
scheduled to meet in Long Beach again. 
</P>
<P>
 Figg said if the hearing is postponed until October, the entire project is 
delayed for at least another nine months.

 The city, Figg said, agreed not to do any construction from the middle of 
March to early October when the California least tern and western snowy plover 
are in their breeding season.  
</P>
<P>
 But residents argued that the city has already waited five years, so they do 
not understand why the city cannot wait another year, particularly when there 
will be a new majority on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need to expedite this project," said Jon Sharkey, who is running 
for City Council. "The new council may overturn the entire project." CHRISTINA

<P>
 Three months of undercover investigation led to the arrest of a Camarillo man 
and the seizure of more than two pounds of marijuana and assorted other drugs 
and paraphernalia, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the East Valley Sheriff's Department narcotics unit arrested 
Steve Rivera, 25, about 9 p.m. Wednesday after purchasing half an ounce of 
cocaine and two pounds of marijuana from Rivera through undercover detectives 
over the length of the investigation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies executed a search warrant at Rivera's home in the 200 block of 
Peoples Street in Camarillo late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the home they found 2 1/2 pounds of marijuana, an ounce of cocaine, 19 
ampuls of anabolic steroids, 21 syringes and four grams of hashish, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 No estimated street value of the illegal drugs and paraphernalia was provided 
by investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera was arrested on suspicion of possession of marijuana and cocaine, 
possession for sale of marijuana and cocaine, and possession of dangerous 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 He is in custody at Ventura County Jail in lieu of $20,000 bail and is 
scheduled to be arraigned today in Ventura County Municipal Court. JEFF

 Saddleback College's radio station is seeking musical performers for its show 
that airs the work of up-and-coming talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio station, KSBR-FM, is accepting tapes from solo musicians and groups

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; DISTRICT APPROVES 'FAMILY TRANSFERS' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the Brea Olinda Unified School District have decided to allow 
students whose older siblings attend a school outside their attendance 
boundaries to go to the same school. 
</P>
<P>
 The move now allows the district to approve "family transfers" when room is 
available.In the past, some students were accepted at schools outside their 
attendance boundaries, but some of their siblings were not. That left some 
parents sending their children to different elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Several parents complained that the situation caused emotional hardship as 
well as transportation problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Lynn Daucher said the past practice was a way to keep schools from 
getting overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has a new policy that randomly chooses who will be allowed to 
transfer to schools of their choice. Now, the chosen students' siblings also 
may go there, as long as there is room available, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that we would reunite families if possible," Daucher said. "We 
think it's a wise decision to keep families together whenever possible." MIMI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAKE FOREST; 4TH MALE ACCUSED IN TEEN'S BEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies have arrested a fourth male suspected of taking part in the 
beating of a black teen-ager three weeks ago, an attack being probed as a 
possible hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell T. Scarce, 19, of Lake Forest, was arrested Wednesday on a warrant 
after returning home from an out-of-state trip, said Orange County Sheriff's 
Department spokesman Lt. Tom Garner. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner said Scarce was booked on suspicion of assault with a caustic chemical 
and assault with a deadly weapon in connection with the Aug. 5 attack on Ruben 
Vaughan, 15, of Tustin, and a white friend who went with him to Portola Hills 
for what they were told was a party. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan, a sophomore at Santa Margarita High School, was beaten and stabbed 
with an unknown weapon and his friend was punched and sprayed with pepper spray 
when met by a group of as many as 30 people in a Portola Hills cul-de-sac.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said someone reportedly shouted a racial slur during the attack 
and are investigating whether the attack was a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juveniles and a Huntington Beach man also have been charged with taking 
part in the beating. A Costa Mesa man was charged with dissuading a witness 
from testifying, but not for the attack itself. KEN ELLINGWOOD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; JUDGE BLOCKS CITY'S PLAN TO RAZE HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge ruled Thursday that one man's castle may 
still be his home, granting Haym Ganish's request for a temporary injunction to 
block the city's planned Nov. 10 demolition of his castle-like dwelling. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 years of alternately remodeling his home and battling city officials, 
Ganish won a reprieve from the impending destruction of what his neighbors call 
the "Kron Street castle." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Nancy Wieben Stock ordered both Ganish and the city to return to court 
Nov. 9, when a trial date will be set. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ganish's attorney, the dispute centers on the rights of the individual 
verses the conformity of a planned community. But for Irvine city officials, 
who contend that hazardous conditions inside Ganish's unfinished home violate 
state law, it's a matter of public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "These homeowners would have the same problem whether they lived in Irvine or 
Irwindale," said Irvine City Atty. Joel D. Kuperberg. "It doesn't matter what 
the name of the city is -- these laws are on the books in every city in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Ganish bought the home in 1978 in the section of Irvine known as the Ranch. He 
began to modify the single-story ranch-style home into a suburban baroque 
castle in 1982. Ganish and his wife, Fern, live in the house with their two 
adult sons and 13-year-old daughter. Son Gilad Ganish, 18, is running for City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganish's attorney, Robert Sainburg, is challenging the city's nuisance 
ordinance as "unconstitutionally vague." He disputes the city's contention that 
Ganish has violated state building codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a nuisance ordinance, it's a conformity ordinance," Sainburg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Irvine has been stopped from demolishing the house. It was a 
victory," he said of Thursday's court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kuperberg said the ruling was narrow and did not strike down the city's 
nuisance ordinance, on which the City Council based its resolution ordering 
demolition of the three-story house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court indicated that the City Council's resolution remains in force," 
Kuperberg said. "But the court also indicated that the city cannot enforce the 
resolution until the court decides whether or not the house can be destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously approved the resolution in July after seeing 
photographs taken inside the Ganish home, which council members say showed 
exposed wires, an unvented water heater and other problems including an 
unsupported balcony. RUSS LOAR

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: RINCON; TEST RESULTS DELAYED IN OIL FIELD DEATHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Results of carbon monoxide tests on blood samples from three oil field workers 
killed last week were delayed Thursday as analysts sought to complete their 
chemical studies, the Ventura County coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county medical examiner said the test results, which typically take weeks 
to process but have been expedited in this case, should be available today. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are chemistry exercises and if something doesn't turn out right, then 
they have to do it again," Chief Medical Examiner Ronald L. O'Halloran said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Halloran declined to say what has delayed the analyses. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials initially thought the deaths were caused by hydrogen sulfide, a 
colorless gas known to exist in the Rincon oil field. 
</P>
<P>
 But no evidence of hydrogen sulfide was found, so officials now believe that 
poisonous carbon monoxide gas is the most likely cause of the fumes that 
overcame seven workers at a Vintage Petroleum oil field on Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Company and state investigators have yet to identify any potential sources of 
carbon monoxide at the scene of the accident, which also injured four others.  
</P>
<P>
 Should the tests, being performed by analysts with the Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department laboratory, come back negative, officials said they 
probably will re-investigate their initial theory that hydrogen sulfide gas 
killed and injured the oil workers. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; GANG MEMBER PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO MURDER

<P>
 A 23-year-old gang member charged with shooting to death another gang member 
over a romantic triangle pleaded not guilty in Ventura County Municipal Court 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Thomas A. Corral burst through the door of his ex-girlfriend's 
Ventura home July 21 and shot Roger Rowland, 23.Corral, 23, is charged with one 
count of murder and also faces a kidnaping charge from an unrelated case, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III ordered Corral held at the Ventura County 
Jail without bail. Corral and co-defendant Ruben Viveros were arrested in Las 
Vegas a week after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Viveros, 19, remains in Nevada serving time in jail on local charges, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory G. Phillips. Charged as an accessory to Rowland's 
murder, Viveros has waived extradition and is expected to be returned to 
Ventura County within two weeks, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corral thought Roger may have been dating Melinda," Phillips said, referring 
to Melinda Corona, the ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura police said they arrested Corral and Viveros while breaking up what 
they suspect was a plot by friends of Rowland to seek revenge for his death. 
The cases of the two suspects arrested for allegedly conspiring to kill Corral 
are being prosecuted by Nevada authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Corral also had been a fugitive since 1991, when he and a group of friends 
allegedly kidnaped the 3-year-old son of a woman who claimed that one of 
Corral's friends raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 The other defendants in that case already have been convicted and sentenced.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SAILING MARATHON TO AID CRISIS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westlake Yacht Club hopes to raise more than $10,000 to benefit Casa 
Pacifica, Ventura County's new children's crisis-care center, by hosting a 
sailing marathon Saturday on Westlake Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating skippers will raise money for the center by sailing eight- to 
13-foot boats around a lake course and collecting community pledges for 
completed laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Club member Susan Artof, chairwoman of the event, said the club has received 
nearly $10,000 in pledges for the event, which will feature 10 to 15 boats, 
each with a team of local sailors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had a sailing event on our lake that was so visible," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The yacht club wanted to create an annual fund-raising event that would 
benefit a local organization, and it found its cause in the new children's care 
center, Artof said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to affiliate ourselves with a group that had children involved," 
Artof said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Casa Pacifica being the newest Ventura County organization in need, we 
approached them." 
</P>
<P>
 The $11-million Casa Pacifica complex in Camarillo opened this summer after 10 
years of planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The center still needs about $450,000 a year to cover its operational costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Artof said the money her group plans to raise would be given to Casa Pacifica 
to buy books, educational materials and recreational equipment, or to pay for 
any other operational needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The sail-a-thon will begin at 10 a.m. and conclude at 10 p.m. at the lake, 
which straddles the border of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Live entertainment and food will accompany the daylong lakeside event. 
</P>
<P>
 Pledges will be accepted through 9 a.m. on Saturday.

HIGH COURT RULING FAVORS OUSTED CHEERLEADER; LAW: BUT STATE JUSTICES WON'T 
PUBLISH THEIR FINDING, MEANING IT WILL AFFECT ONLY IRVINE SCHOOLS. OTHER 
DISTRICTS MAY MAINTAIN DUAL ELIGIBILITY STANDARDS FOR ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A ruling by the state Supreme Court Thursday involving a former Irvine 
cheerleader will allow most public schools to continue setting higher grade 
standards for cheerleaders than athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District, however, will probably have to change its 
rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involved the Irvine district's dropping a cheerleader from the pep 
squad after she failed a class, a requirement that didn't apply to athletes. 
The appellate court found in the teen-ager's favor, a ruling that would have 
prohibited public schools statewide from setting a double standard. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court on Thursday voted 4 to 3 to deny review of that case, 
meaning that the appellate court's order stands for Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Supreme Court justices unanimously withdrew the appellate ruling as a 
precedent that would have been binding on trial courts statewide. Following its 
usual practice, the court gave no explanation for its decision, an action that 
leaves the legal issue unsettled. 
</P>
<P>
 The former cheerleader, Melissa Fontes, and her attorney said they were 
dismayed at the court's decision to keep the ruling off the books. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make sense to me," said Fontes, now 21 and a college student in 
Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes was barred as a cheerleader at Woodbridge High School in Irvine several 
years ago after she failed chemistry and her grade average for the semester 
fell below 2.5. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're saying, 'Yes, what happened in this Irvine district is wrong,' why 
wouldn't they apply that to all districts? It seems very arbitrary. Either it 
shouldn't happen anywhere or they should reverse the (appellate court) 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes' attorney, Bonnie Lawley of Hacienda Heights, said the court's action 
was a disservice to other young people throughout the state who may find 
themselves in Fontes' position and be forced to sue to protect their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's extremely unfortunate, because the only thing the publication of 
the decision does is to force school districts to comply with the equal 
protection clause of our Constitution," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for the Irvine district, Mark Bresee, said the high court's 
decision to let the appellate court's ruling stand was a disappointment. The 
action cannot, however, "be construed as supporting" the appellate court, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion . . . the fact that they took it off the books either means 
they were neutral on it or they disagreed with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bresee said the decision was a "clear victory" for California school districts 
as a whole. The California School Boards Assn. had submitted letters urging the 
court to depublish the decision because it was wrong, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine school board has not determined what effect the court's action will 
have on its policies, Bresee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a question that hasn't been addressed yet by the district, because (the 
case) was still making its way through the courts." 
</P>
<P>
 But one school board member, Margie Wakeham, said Thursday night that the 
district apparently will have to adopt the same standards for cheerleaders as 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wakeham said she thought the Supreme Court decided not to hear the case 
because justices thought it was "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was ridiculous, too. At least they depublished it." Currently, 
the district's policy is to require cheerleaders to maintain a 2.5 average each 
semester, on a scale of 4.0, and to disqualify them for failing an class. 
Athletes are judged by minimum standards of the California Interscholastic 
Federation, requiring a grade average of 2.0 for their high school career. They 
could fail one class in a semester and remain eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other school districts in the state have differential grade requirements, 
lawyers for the Irvine district said. 
</P>
<P>
 After unsuccessfully appealing to the school and the district board, Fontes 
sued. The district defended its policy, saying cheerleaders, unlike athletes, 
performed year-round and served as ambassadors of goodwill for the district, 
and therefore could be held to higher standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gardner, a retired appeals court justice assigned to Orange County 
Superior Court, ruled in the district's favor. But he was overruled in May by 
the 4th District Court of Appeal, which found no rational justification for the 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interscholastic sports and cheerleading are both non-academic extracurricular 
activities," said Presiding Justice David Sills in the 3-0 ruling. "There is 
nothing about cheerleading that makes it qualitatively any more or less 
scholarly than football, baseball or some other sport." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a case of sex discrimination, Sills wrote -- boys and girls take part 
in both activities -- but of arbitrary discrimination between athletes and 
cheerleaders. He said constitutional standards of equal protection require a 
single eligibility standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheerleaders are not mere passive supporters of football and basketball 
teams, but, like athletes in spectator sports, (are) entertainers in their own 
right," Sills said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said athletes represent their school no less than cheerleaders, and spend 
more out-of-class time on their activity, counting practice time. The school 
district can decide to lower one standard or raise the other, and might be able 
to justify higher eligibility requirements for extracurricular activities with 
a greater academic connection, Sills said. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking state Supreme Court review, the district's lawyers said courts 
should leave such matters to schools and their elected governing boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Court of Appeal manufactured a distinction between 'academic' and 
'non-academic' extracurricular activities" and failed to define it, said 
district lawyer Pamela Depsey in court papers. She called the ruling an 
"impermissible intrusion into functions reserved to local governmental 
agencies."

STEINER SEEKS TO POSTPONE 200 NEW HIRES; BUDGET: THE POSITIONS SHOULD NOT BE 
FILLED UNTIL IT IS CLEAR THAT THE STATE WILL NOT BE DIPPING INTO COUNTY COFFERS 
TO BALANCE ITS BOOKS, THE SUPERVISOR SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner on Thursday asked that the county 
delay the hiring of about 200 new employees proposed in this year's budget 
until it is clear that state budget officials won't tap county revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be filling positions in the fall and laying people off in 
the spring," Steiner said at the close of three days of public budget hearings. 
"I don't think it's appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said he wants to move ahead carefully on filling the new positions 
because he is concerned that state lawmakers, who have balanced their budget 
with some speculative revenue sources, may eventually look toward California 
counties to make up any shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested filling positions only as needed until Nov. 15, when the state 
issues a report card on its budget. At that time, if the state is off its 
budget projections by more than 1%, automatic across-the-board spending cuts -- 
except for education -- would be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner's recommendations, which he made before his colleagues at the end of 
the hearings, are expected to become part of the final budget scheduled to be 
adopted by the Board of Supervisors in late September. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 90 of the positions Steiner wants to hold off filling are scheduled for 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department and linked to the expansion of the Theo 
Lacy Branch Jail, which is being delayed because of litigation with the city of 
Orange. He also asked that the county postpone filling eight Health Care Agency 
positions in special education, and 56 slots for the Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said most of the hires he wants to postpone have been budgeted to deal 
with expanding workloads that will occur later in the year and are not needed 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the county is even considering hiring new employees is an 
indication of the uncharacteristically upbeat $3.7-billion budget package 
proposed for this fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the 19th budget that I've attended since being a member of the board. 
. . . I would like to say that this is the best we've had," said board Chairman 
Thomas F. Riley, who is retiring in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner's proposal covers only about 200 of 932 new positions in the proposed 
budget. Most of the 932 new positions proposed will be funded through state and 
federal mandates. More than 100 positions are being funded by contracts with 
cities that are asking the county to provide fire or law enforcement services. 
</P>
<P>
 During the budget hearings this week, officials said the county is in a much 
better financial situation than it has been in the past three years, when about 
2,000 positions had to be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county's fiscal health, officials say, depends largely on what happens 
in Sacramento. County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said he is 
concerned because the state is expecting a $3.6-billion reimbursement from the 
federal government over the next two years for providing services to illegal 
immigrants. Furthermore, the state is counting on getting another $500 million 
from a lawsuit settlement against a number of California corporations over 
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of these revenue assumptions are highly speculative from our 
perspective," Schneider told the board earlier this week.

ICE CREAM BECOMES HOT COMMODITY IN HEAT WAVE; MOORPARK: KIDS MOB MARCELLO 
PADILLA'S TRUCK, WHICH BRINGS A DELICIOUS WAY TO COOL OFF. BUT THE WEATHER 
BRINGS OUT THE SWEET TOOTH IN ADULTS, TOO. 
</P>

 In the late-afternoon heat, Marcello Padilla's ice cream truck turned the 
corner onto Dorothy Avenue in Moorpark. Screen doors slapped open on nearly 
every house as small children emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Marcello, Marcello!" they shrieked, running after him, change clutched in 
their hands. Bicycles were tossed aside, pockets dug into. 
</P>
<P>
 For 6-year-old Junior Navarrete, the implement for cooling down was a 75-cent 
Cherry Bomb, while Susana Rodriquez, 10, selected an ice-cold White Lemon Bomb 
for her sister and a cookie-ice cream combo called a UFO for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 If there has been a benefit to that hot sun blasting down on Ventura County 
for the last two weeks, it has been to ice cream parlors and vendors like 
Padilla, who say business has never been brisker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done so much business I burned out my walk-in (freezer) yesterday trying 
to maintain the vast amount of product I've needed," said John Zodrow, owner of 
two Penguin's frozen yogurt stores in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Zodrow said he has been averaging about 500 customers a day per shop -- twice 
his business during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 In deference to those who just do not have the appetite to eat in the heat, 
Zodrow started offering veritable platters of frozen yogurt as a lunch 
substitute. "I call it Lite Lunch," he said proudly. "Four layers of different 
flavors." 
</P>
<P>
 Kate Conway, manager of the Creamery, an old-fashioned ice cream parlor in 
Moorpark, said her patrons tend to come in for ice cream in the evening, when a 
cone can be licked clean without fear of uncontrollable meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between 8 to 10 p.m., it's just packed in here," Conway said. "Summertime is 
our best time." 
</P>
<P>
 Rock Islands Food, which distributes Haagen-Dazs, Nestle and It's It ice cream 
products to supermarkets and convenience stores throughout the county, reports 
a big jump in the appetite for its deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a heat wave like this, deliveries definitely go up," said spokesman 
Michael Cudahy. "It should be about 15% above normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are these the sultry dog days of summer, they are the days of 
Popsicles, sugar cones and the repetitive jangle of the ice cream truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla heads out every afternoon during the summer, waiting until 4 p.m., 
when even the most energetic children are lying around listlessly waiting for 
the heat to die down. Sounding like a broken and tuneless record, his truck 
roams the streets of Moorpark seeking customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Daisy Torres, 10, ran out to the curb when she saw Padilla approach, pushing 
her cousin Salvador, 5, ahead of her. She explained that she was there to 
assist him in his purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any money," she said. "I'm just helping him get his Frooty 
Patooty." 
</P>
<P>
 Between the salesman and the young customers, there is little conversation. 
The children gaze up at the stickers illustrating their options on the side of 
the old white truck. They make their decision by jabbing at the picture, and 
Padilla leans out to see which one they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, they try to negotiate. A 75-cent nut cone for 50 cents? A 
Screwball for a quarter? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no," Padilla tells them, as gently as he can. "Fifty cents. Screwball is 
50 cents. Nut cone is 75 cents." 
</P>
<P>
 Stubbornly, they poke longingly at the artist's rendering of a nut cone 
anyway, often settling for the old bargain standby, a Popsicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla buys the ice cream from a distributor in San Fernando. During the 
current heat wave he has been going there daily to stock up. He spends about 
$30 on the products, then on a good day, grosses about $60. Lately the days 
have been good. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the ice cream trucks that roam east Ventura County come up from the 
San Fernando Valley, Padilla said. He usually runs into two or three 
competitors on his Moorpark route. In Simi Valley, 10 or 12 trucks cruise the 
residential streets in the afternoon, then head back south. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla tries to beat the competition into the neighborhoods, because his 
young customers, their change burning a hole in their pockets, are not 
discriminating in their choice of vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, a Cherry Bomb is a Cherry Bomb, no matter who's driving the truck.

JURY CONVICTS FUGITIVE IN 1982 SLAYING; COURTS: SAILMAKER WHO FLED TO 
PHILIPPINES IS FOUND GUILTY OF MANSLAUGHTER IN HIS COUSIN'S SHOOTING DEATH AT A 
CROWDED AIRPORT BAR.

<P>
 A former Laguna Beach sailmaker who spent more than a decade on the run in 
Mexico and the Philippines was convicted Thursday of voluntary manslaughter in 
the 1982 shooting death of his cousin at a crowded John Wayne Airport 
restaurant bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Russell Daniels, 44, was caught about 10 months ago in the Philippines, 
where he had been living on a small island with his common-law wife and stepson 
and running a surf school. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said they didn't find any evidence that Daniels planned to kill Barclay 
F. Hodges on June 8, 1982, and found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter 
rather than murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a premeditated murder," said juror Matt Hall of Costa Mesa. The 
Orange County Superior Court jury also found true an allegation that Daniels 
used a gun in the crime, an enhancement that can add additional prison time. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Marshall M. Schulman said he was pleased with the verdict. He 
had contended during the weeklong trial that Daniels had "exploded" in a drug- 
and alcohol-induced rage. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the paranoid belief his first cousin, the victim, was having an affair 
with his estranged wife," Schulman said. "He couldn't take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon set Daniel's sentencing for Sept. 
30. Because the killing took place in 1982, Daniels will be sentenced under 
12-year-old guidelines and faces up to eight years in prison, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. David Brent said. If the crime were committed today, Daniels could face 
up to 16 years in prison if convicted of the same crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Brent had asked the jury to convict Daniels of second-degree murder, but said 
outside of court he would not quarrel with the guilty verdict on the 
less-serious count. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent said, however, he believes Daniels benefited from fleeing the country so 
many years ago, allowing evidence -- especially witnesses' memories -- to grow 
stale. Brent said one witness who was reading over his 12-year-old statements 
to police had forgotten so many of the details he likened it to reading a 
novel, where he was the main character. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 'I don't remember, I don't recall,' with every witness," Brent said, 
who said the time lapse between the killing and the trial may also have dulled 
the jury's reaction to the tragedy at hand. "That's the problem with trying a 
murder case more than 10 years after the fact. I wish the case had been tried 
back then." 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual twist, Daniels did not face an additional penalty for fleeing 
the jurisdiction in 1982 because there was no law against it at the time, Brent 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman said during his closing argument that Daniels was high on cocaine and 
had a blood-alcohol level of at least .20 when the shooting took place. Daniels 
was so drunk he could not recall whether he even fired the fatal shot, the 
attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman attacked the prosecution's case on two fronts, arguing both that 
Daniels never intended to kill anyone but was acting under the influence of the 
drugs and alcohol and that there was still insufficient evidence to prove 
Daniels -- and not someone with a grudge against Hodges -- had committed the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses to the shooting told investigators that Daniels, Hodges and a third 
man had been sitting at a corner table at Delaney's Restaurant for about six 
hours when shots were fired, sending panicked customers running. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges, then 40 and facing charges of selling cocaine, was shot in the head. 
The victim was the brother of then-Westminster Councilman Guinn (Gil) Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels was arrested at the scene and later pleaded not guilty and was 
released on $75,000 bail. After he failed to appear at his preliminary hearing, 
a U.S. magistrate issued a felony arrest warrant on Nov. 10, 1983. He has been 
held on $500,000 bail since he was rearrested in November.

POLITICAL BRIEFING: CONGRESS CAN'T BREAK FOR SUMMER VACATION WITH AN INCOMPLETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine an incredibly large community college with students who take 
themselves and their studies very seriously, one now quivering on the verge of 
a long-awaited summer break. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a hitch: Two exams -- with tough questions on health care and 
crime -- have almost the entire school cramming around the clock. Even students 
not taking the tests must wait until the others are through before bursting out 
the classroom doors. 
</P>
<P>
 And so they linger -- irritable over having to eat non-refundable airline 
tickets for vacation trips they now must miss or reschedule, pointing fingers 
at one another for being so stubborn and disorganized that, well, now they all 
have to attend summer school.  
</P>
<P>
 That's the scene this week on Capitol Hill, where both the House and Senate 
are in special session to pass long-awaited legislation on crime and health 
care -- both Republicans and Democrats complaining of the other's partisan 
politicking. They're as cranky as two de-clawed cats stuck in a burlap sack. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's partisan, that's for sure," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama 
City). "There's finger-pointing, but we're used to that around here. I'd say 
the mood is more resignation than hostility." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita): "Nobody is happy about being 
here under these circumstances. The Republicans won the crime vote last week, 
and that has just thrown everything into a tizzy. I don't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked a Democrat today, 'Why can't we get things speeded up and get out of 
here?' It's just crazy. We're dragging out stuff that's not very controversial 
and not hard to do." 
</P>
<P>
 As senators face possible round-the-clock sessions and House leaders huddle in 
strategy meetings, an anxious nation and the Washington world -- tens of 
thousands of interns, aides and policy-makers -- await some kind, any kind, of 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Thursday marked Day 4 of Capitol Hill held hostage to its own 
indecision. While lawmakers were scheduled to break on Aug. 13, many now 
suggest that they might work through Sept. 7 -- when they were scheduled to 
resume session -- if a compromise is not reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, besides the crime and health care issues, the business of Capitol 
Hill has pretty much ground to a halt. Since most legislators and policy-makers 
figured they'd be sunning themselves on a Tahitian island right about now, 
nobody scheduled any of the hearings and meetings that normally consume days 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 A strange quiet pervades the House and Senate office buildings, normally 
bustling with taxicabs delivering lobbyists and professionals to testify at 
committee and subcommittee hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers weary of long months of answering telephone calls and constituent mail 
are holed up like squirrels in their offices, anxiously watching the door, 
ready to bolt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at that empty hallway -- it's usually full of people," said David 
Joergenson, legislative assistant to Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R-Glendale). "There 
are seven or eight committees and subcommittees in this building, sometimes 
going three at a time, bringing in all kinds of people. Now the place is 
deserted." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, committee rooms across Capitol Hill display "Not in Session" placards 
over their doors. It's even slow at the House post office, a place that usually 
dispatches mail by the ton. "It's ugly," a worker said. "People are just 
waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Hill staffers feel like that worker on Friday afternoon when the boss is 
away: They want to leave early. But they're afraid that something will happen 
the moment they walk out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to get out of here with the House in session, no matter what you 
do," said an aide to Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). "The calls come in 
from constituents wanting to know why these lawmakers just can't make up their 
minds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees are working 
long hours hammering out details on a health care package. One staffer 
literally fell out of his seat this week when he dozed off during a marathon 
committee meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "People I know are talking divorce," said one Waxman staffer. "Spouses are not 
pleased over this delay." 
</P>
<P>
 The delay cost Gene Smith, Berman's chief of staff, a non-refundable ticket to 
Arizona. Now she has to pay full fare. "My weekend in Phoenix is going to cost 
me $200 a day," she said. "What's irksome is that we work too hard for our 
vacations here to see them hung up on simple partisan one-upmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon has other problems. In this election year, he had several town meetings 
scheduled back in his district. And he's not happy about missing his son's 
return to Los Angeles after two years with a Mormon mission in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 For McKeon, a carefully planned schedule has gone haywire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told by the Speaker and congressional leaders that I could count on 
this time being inviolate," he said. "I had town hall meetings three nights 
this week. I was only able to make one of them. The others I did by telephone." 
</P>
<P>
 But Berman says such hardships are part of the job, one the voting public 
expects its lawmakers to endure without complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody feels sorry for us," he said. "And in a way, they shouldn't. We keep 
running for reelection. Nobody is making us do this job."

OXNARD MAN MAY LOSE FOOT AFTER JUMPING FROM TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 28-year-old man attempting to jump off a cargo train near the Oxnard 
Transportation Center at about 8 p.m. Thursday was injured when his left foot 
apparently got caught in a wheel of the train, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics who treated the man, identified as Jose Garcia of Oxnard, said he 
faces the possibility of losing the foot, said Oxnard Fire Capt. Brad 
Windsor.Garcia was taken to Ventura County Medical Center and was listed in 
fair condition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Windsor said a security guard found the man "screaming in pain" on the transit 
center lawn. "He was speaking Spanish so we really couldn't get a good 
description of the accident from the victim," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A trail of blood indicated that the man had walked 20 to 30 feet before he 
came to a fence and collapsed, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they believe Garcia was illegally riding the train, which 
was carrying automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The security guard, John Devereau, was among the first to find the man. He 
said he was summoned by someone walking by the tracks. "He was obviously in 
pain, he was just lying there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Devereau said Garcia was with a slightly older man, who Devereau thought might 
have also been riding the train and jumped off with Garcia.

SUSPECT SHOT, ARRESTED IN CAR CHASE THROUGH VALLEY STREETS; CRIME: HE ALLEGEDLY 
BRANDISHED PELLET GUN BEFORE BEING WOUNDED BY OFFICER, WHO LOST CONTROL OF HIS 
MOTORCYCLE AND CRASHED.

<P>
 A Los Angeles motorcycle officer Thursday shot and wounded a man who charged 
him with his car and threatened him with a pellet gun, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 After firing, the officer lost control of the motorcycle and went down. Other 
officers on the scene pursued the suspect and after a chase on surface streets 
rammed his car and captured him, according to a statement issued late Thursday 
by Lt. John Dunkin, of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorcycle Officer George Maycott, 48, was taken to North Hollywood Medical 
Center. Maycott was in good condition and was expected to be released today, 
Officer Jon Herrington said late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, identified by police as Larry Rodrick, 33, had been shot once in 
the left forearm. He was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center for 
treatment, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon Rodrick allegedly held, a pellet gun, was recovered at the scene, 
according to the police statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when Maycott, a 20-year LAPD veteran, saw Rodrick commit a 
traffic violation near the intersection of Sherman Oaks Avenue and Flume Walk 
at about 3:45 p.m., the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrick, driving a white Chevrolet Corsica, allegedly ignored Maycott's order 
to stop and the chase began northward on surface streets until they entered the 
5300 block of Leghorn Avenue in Van Nuys, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodrick suddenly made a U-turn, the statement said, and drove directly toward 
Maycott. 
</P>
<P>
 As the suspect bore down on the him, Maycott saw Rodrick grab what appeared to 
him to be an automatic handgun, the statement said, and point it directly at 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Maycott pulled his service revolver and fired once, striking Rodrick in the 
arm. The officer then lost control of the motorcycle and crashed, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in a scene captured from overhead news helicopters, patrol cars and 
unmarked cars chased the driver south on Van Nuys Boulevard where additional 
patrol cars approached from the opposite direction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 5000 block of Van Nuys, a patrol car rammed Rodrick's Corsica, which 
caused the car to spin and face north. He again tried to flee, police said, 
until his vehicle collided with an unmarked police car. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers from more than half a dozen cars jumped out and pointed their 
weapons at Rodrick, who then threw his hands in the air and surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they believe the car he was driving was stolen in St. Louis in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:30 p.m., more than two hours after the chased ended, police still had a 
section of Van Nuys Boulevard cordoned off between Burbank and Magnolia 
boulevards. Rodrick's car appeared badly damaged at the rear left wheel, and 
blood was visible on the roof of the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said there was no early indication that Maycott violated police 
procedure in the chase when he fired his weapon from the moving motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing that says you can't fire at or from a vehicle if the 
circumstances warrant it," Dunkin said. "We don't shoot at vehicles. We shoot 
at suspects in vehicles." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Plotnick, 53, a psychiatrist who was walking his dogs in a park across 
the street from the scene, said he watched the police block Rodrick's car and 
then subdue, handcuff and escort him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was wild, the guy was heading this way," he said pointing south, "and then 
the (police) car rammed him and he did a 180," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks resident said he was saddened but not surprised by the scene 
because two months earlier he had witnessed and unwittingly become entangled in 
a fight between two rival street gangs who met at the park to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was sitting right here," he said from a fast-food restaurant directly 
across from the park, "when I got a 9-millimeter pistol shoved into my face."

FORGERS BEATING CUSTOMERS TO NEW CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newly issued blank checks are being stolen and fraudulently cashed in a rash 
of crimes targeting the western San Fernando Valley, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the spree in the Woodland Hills, West Hills and Calabasas areas has 
cost Wells Fargo Bank alone tens of thousands of dollars, said bank spokeswoman 
Kathleen Shilkret. 
</P>
<P>
 At the bank's Warner Ranch branch on Topanga Canyon Boulevard, 25 to 30 
incidents of check fraud have been reported since the end of July, Shilkret 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 All stemmed from newly ordered or reordered checkbooks that never reached 
customers, she said, adding that other banks have been affected too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having an outbreak in the West Valley," Shilkret said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the U.S. Postal Inspection Service's Los Angeles Division 
are looking into whether the checkbooks are being taken from mail trucks or 
post offices, said Postal Inspector Pamela Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been apprised of the situation and are investigating it," Prince 
said. "There's not much more I can say." 
</P>
<P>
 One victim, a customer of the Warner Ranch branch, said he had been told by a 
bank manager that the Woodland Hills Post Office is a suspected source of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think someone is stealing the blank checks out of the post office," said 
the customer, who asked not to be named because his home address was printed on 
his missing checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The customer said he learned of the thefts about noon Wednesday when an alert 
teller at a Wells Fargo branch in West Los Angeles beeped him. 
</P>
<P>
 The teller asked whether he knew the woman who was trying to cash one of his 
checks at that very moment. One of his checks had already been cashed for $200 
earlier in the day, the teller informed him, as the woman fled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was completely befuddled," the customer said. "Then it all became painfully 
clear that the checks I've been waiting for were the checks this woman was 
using." 
</P>
<P>
 A presumed ring of thieves is intercepting boxes of the blank checkbooks and 
then distributing the checks to "mules" who forge the owners' names and cash 
them, Shilkret said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank detectives and postal inspectors have come up with a list of 25 suspects 
who have a record of check fraud, she said. Bank officials are urging customers 
waiting for new checkbooks to phone their bank branch if the checks don't 
arrive promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Savings' Calabasas branch has also reported thefts, though 
only a handful so far, said Al Sommerville, vice president and director of 
audit and security. 
</P>
<P>
 Sommerville said he learned of the thefts only this week and was looking into 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a while for them to cycle out," Sommerville said of fraudulently 
cashed checks. "When you see a statement all of a sudden you see a check you 
didn't write."

ELECTIONS / L.A. CITY COUNCIL; THE OTHER YAROSLAVSKY ENTERS 5TH DISTRICT FRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky confirmed Thursday that she will run for the Los Angeles 
City Council seat now held by her husband, Zev, sparking a debate over whether 
her move constitutes dynasty building. 
</P>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky will resign in December to assume new duties as a member of 
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. He was elected to the board in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky's decision, although widely anticipated recently, brings a 
new dynamic to the emerging battle over political succession in the affluent 
and politically active 5th District, which includes Westwood, Sherman Oaks and 
Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 The entry of the 47-year-old Yaroslavsky makes her an instant front-runner, 
said political consultant Richard Lichtenstein. "She starts with phenomenal 
name ID that you couldn't buy," he said. "The challenge will be for her to 
create her own set of footprints and identity on issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Others quickly predicted her name, while her biggest asset, will be the source 
of her biggest political headache in next spring's special election to fill the 
last two years of her husband's term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opposition has to take her biggest asset and turn it into her biggest 
liability," said political consultant Joe Cerrell. However, said the veteran 
strategist, pointing to the Kennedys of Massachusetts and the Browns of 
California, while people may disparage dynasty-building efforts "in American 
politics, they work more often than not." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, who has been active in community affairs for years, said in an 
interview Thursday from the couple's Fairfax District home that one of her 
biggest fears is that the media, searching for controversy, will cast her 
candidacy as a bid by the Yaroslavsky family to dominate Westside politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "My big fear isn't that the candidates will say these things, but that the 
media will," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Michael Feuer, executive director of Bet-Tzedek Legal Services and 
one of several candidates for the 5th District seat, said he intends to 
campaign on his record of running a successful and popular legal program for 
the disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
 But along with another announced candidate, former Los Angeles school board 
member Roberta Weintraub, Feuer refused to speculate about whether the 
exigencies of an arduous campaign might force the dynasty issue to the 
forefront. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub, whose high public profile makes her nearly as much a household name 
as Yaroslavsky, said for the time being she feels comfortable running on her 
record of 14 years on the Board of Education. "I'm the only one with hands-on 
government experience," Weintraub said. "I don't think people will be voting to 
reelect Zev, and (Barbara) will have to stand on her own two feet. This is not 
an era when women can succeed their husbands in office and run simply on their 
coattails." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Leah Purwin D'Agostino, well known for her courtroom work 
and her run for district attorney several years ago, reacted to Yaroslavsky's 
move by stopping just short of announcing her candidacy. "This is an 
interesting development," she said. "I'll have my own announcement shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 But Police Protective League spokesman Danny Staggs was less coy. "We'll be 
endorsing Leah," he said. "She's always been a strong supporter of the police. 
Barbara Yaroslavsky is a nice lady, but not qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky confirmed that she was running just as she started making 
calls to three dozen political activists and community leaders about her 
decision. "I'm not prepared to comment on it now," she said. "I've only just 
been making calls for the past two hours. I'd like for people to hear it from 
me, not read about it first in the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 But later, she released a prepared statement. "That I'm running for City 
Council is the natural next step of a decades-long commitment to work in behalf 
of this community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I undertook these efforts not because I was looking for recognition or 
walking in the shadow of my husband. Rather I'm a committed community activist 
and I believe that the passionate actions of one individual can bring about 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky emphasized that she would run on her record. "I don't have to 
defend what Zev has done -- actually, he's done a wonderful job and in many 
respects, we're not so different," she said. "We're both very committed to the 
quality of life and preservation of the environment and seeing that the 
district gets adequate funding." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's decision comes after weeks of speculation about her targeting 
the seat in the wake of her husband's election to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her decision also sparked new speculation about the role her powerful husband 
will play in her campaign. Barbara Yaroslavsky said she has not talked to him 
about this, but she expects his help. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Feuer and Weintraub said they are in the race to the end, 
Lichtenstein, the political consultant, said that Feuer and Yaroslavsky's 
constituencies of progressive Jewish Democrats are almost identical, and that 
one of them will have to give. "I don't think there's enough of that 
constituency for both of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky recently proposed that the City Council appoint an interim 
council member to fill his seat until his permanent successor is picked in a 
special election. Given the timing of his departure, it is likely that a 
special election will not be held until next spring to fill out the two years 
remaining in his term. 
</P>
<P>
 That could leave the 5th District without representation at City Hall for as 
long as seven months.

WELCOME WATER; QUAKE-WEARY TRAILER PARK RESIDENTS GET SOME RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The toilet caused Sidney Yarboro countless hours of stress since the Jan. 17 
earthquake. So did the shower and sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Long after the quake knocked out water, power and sewage to his trailer park 
nestled under the Golden State Freeway, and long after the rest of Los Angeles 
and most of his neighbors had utilities restored, Yarboro and a few neighbors 
were relegated to bottled water and Porta Potties. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, about a week ago, the water came back on. 
</P>
<P>
 Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarboro and friends spliced into a temporary water main and tank -- with water 
company blessings. The line still goes dry now and then -- with their luck, 
probably in the middle of showers -- but it's a long-awaited relief for a small 
community that is still straining to regain the basic necessities while other 
quake-weary homeowners have graduated to the stage of arguing with contractors 
and loan officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarboro, for one, is trying to remain stoic about the whole mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a boy I grew up with very little to eat," Yarboro said. "I just 
said I have to do what I did when I was a boy. Learn to ration and learn to 
face everything with a smile." 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of the main shock and the freeway collapsing on the Crescent 
Valley Mobile Home Park's front stoop knocked out utilities to all 87 park 
spaces for about a month, said Brian Fitterer, the park's managing partner. 
Access to the park was cut off as well, while emergency workers rebuilt the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the occupants left -- 10 never came back. But as insurance money and 
the hospitality of relatives ran out, the other residents slowly filtered back. 
Some on the top levels of the park, set high on a hill, had services restored 
within a few months of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But life on the park's bottom level is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The impromptu water line may be working now, but a few residents still have no 
sewer service. Yarboro does have sewer service. He also has his neighbors' 
sewage emptying on to his driveway -- but that's another story. 
</P>
<P>
 Necessity has taught Yarboro and his neighbors perseverance. When their 
conveniences failed, they supplanted them with jury-rigged contraptions. 
</P>
<P>
 They wound hoses through the hills, siphoning water from the swimming pool. 
They lugged water-filled milk jugs up to their roofs to fill their swamp 
coolers, about six or seven times a day. And doing the wash? That was done in a 
bucket or the sink. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other adjustments, and indignities, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Post office boxes have taken the place of mail carriers. "They say it's too 
dangerous to come down here," shouted Diana Lemaster, as a giant backhoe 
operator dug up the road and neighboring driveways. Lemaster's floors vibrate 
along with the machinery from first morning light until just before sundown. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemaster and her roommate moved back to the park in May. They had to wait 
until two weeks ago for workmen to lay new water pipes and until this week for 
the water to finally flow. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday the County Department of Health Services told her the water 
was also safe for drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep working and digging, though, and turning it off and on," Lemaster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor, Lois Reyes, is condemned to the Porta Potties. Under her 
trailer, where a sewage pipe used to be, there is only a long trench. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we flushed it would come out under the trailer," Reyes said. "It's a step 
up from camping, but I'd rather not be camping." 
</P>
<P>
 Since workers dug up the road a few months back, the tenants have had to 
contend with the thick dust that swirls around the trailers. When the crews 
water it, hoping to keep the fine dirt from coating cars and homes, the road 
turns a muddy mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitterer, who lives in Orange County, said disputes with contractors, public 
works officials and insurance companies have caused delay after delay in 
repairing the more than $1 million in damage. He figures the work is 90% 
complete and said he hopes to have things back in order by the middle of next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Yarboro took comfort in the few bits of modern life he has 
had returned, like running water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful feeling to have it back," Yarboro said. "To me, it's worth a 
million dollars."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; THEATER, OFFICE CENTER COMPROMISE HINTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The developer and opponents of a proposed large-scale office complex and movie 
theater say a compromise may be near as the City Council prepares to vote next 
month whether to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The council -- which postponed a vote on approval at its Aug. 10 meeting -- 
has since been trying to work out a compromise. The council is expected to vote 
on the matter in late September. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to give the developer time to scale down plans for an 
eight-plex movie theater and retail center as part of a planned 
1.5-million-square-foot office complex known as Calabasas Park Centre. It would 
be located south of Calabasas Road between Park Granada and Parkway Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has also named a panel made up of city officials who have been 
meeting this week with both sides in an attempt to reach a compromise. 
Councilman Marvin Lopata, who serves on the panel, said Thursday that he 
believes talks have been going well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible we may come to a point where both sides will be happy, but 
we'll have to see," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopata and the other three council members, along with Mayor Karyn Foley, all 
told developer John Kilroy at that last meeting that they could never accept 
the project on such a large scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of the project seem to be softening their stance on the theater, 
which has been one of the main points of contention. Some critics had earlier 
vowed they would never accept a theater, saying it would bring crime and 
violence to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the spirit of negotiation, I would accept something smaller, something up 
to 1,000 seats, or something like that, " said Doris La Violette, who is on the 
board of directors for the Malibu Canyon Homeowners' Assn. She is also a 
delegate to Los Virgenes Homeowners' Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 She belongs to an organization called Save Our City, which has been adamant in 
its opposition to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of anyone who has been against the project completely,' she said 
Thursday. "We're somewhat realistic about that. It's a question now of just how 
much is too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Ossala, vice president of Kilroy Industries, and project director of the 
Park Centre, said his side is willing to compromise "as long as it is 
economically feasible for us." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would be willing to accept less than 2,800 theater seats, but he 
declined to give an exact number. But, he added, United Artists has been able 
to make a profit operating theaters with 2,300 seats. FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; YOU GET TO EAT CAKE AND HELP OUT TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've heard about Movie Star Barbie and Gymnast Barbie, but what about 
Chocolate Cake Barbie? 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, a Sherman Oaks bakery will hold the first in a series of 
cake-decorating classes in an effort to collect donated goods for the Union 
Rescue Mission, a charity that provides meals and services to Los Angeles' Skid 
Row population. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaleh Sagheb, head cake chef at SolleysRestaurant, Delicatessen and Bakery, 
will demonstrate how to decorate a Barbie doll cake, in which Barbie is placed 
waist-deep in four layers of cake that are contoured to form a bell-like skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Students will be asked to contribute 13 -- a baker's dozen -- dollars, canned 
goods or packages of disposable diapers. The first class will be next Thursday, 
and on the last Thursday of every month thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very grateful because the need is great," said Cori Barron, public 
relations coordinator for Union Rescue. "We see it as an innovative way for the 
business community to get involved in making some positive change in Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 The Barbie doll cake was chosen for the first class because it is the most 
popular of the specialty cakes offered by Solleys, according to the bakery's 
namesake and owner, Sol Zide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbie is an ageless thing," Zide said. "I recently had a 50-year-old woman 
come in and say, 'I want a Barbie doll cake.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Real Barbies are used, and Solleys offers a wide variety of races and hair 
color -- as well as cake type and icing color -- to meet the specifications of 
the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent demonstration, Sagheb made it look easy as she decorated a Barbie 
doll cake to fill an order. Using a pastry bag and pink icing, the decorator 
added ruffles, streamers and bows to gussy up Barbie's ball gown. Still using 
icing, she fashioned a top for the doll with puffy sleeves and a plunging 
neckline in back. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was finished, she pulled out the toothpick that had been holding 
Barbie's hair back in a bun, arranged the golden locks and placed a dainty 
icing rosebud in her hair. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit series is Zide's second effort in support of Union Rescue. The 
first was last Christmas Day, when Zide dropped off a truckload of surplus 
Christmas cakes and cookies at the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "The line was around the block. The fact that they were there on Christmas Day 
-- it just grabbed me," Zide recalled. "It just felt good to help them out." 
Solleys also donates day-old bread to the Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Future classes will give pointers on decorating Halloween cupcakes, balloon 
birthday cakes, and Christmas and Hanukkah cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first class, students are asked to BYOB -- bring your own Barbie. To 
sweeten the deal, students get to take home their creations -- not 
inconsequential when you consider that Barbie doll cakes cost from $49.50 to 
$62.50. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI FREEWAY REPAIRS WON'T END TIE-UPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think traffic congestion will end when Caltrans wraps up quake repairs on the 
Simi Valley (118) Freeway? 
</P>
<P>
 Think again. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as repairs are expected to end in the quake-wracked Granada Hills stretch 
of the Simi Valley Freeway in mid-September, the California Department of 
Transportation will begin a $22.4 million project to add car-pool and other 
lanes to an even longer stretch of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11.8-mile project, which includes both directions of the freeway from just 
west of the Ventura County line to the Golden State Freeway, will add two mixed 
flow and two car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 By 2010, the additional lanes are expected to reduce by 11,500 the number of 
drivers during the morning and afternoon peak periods, according to Caltrans 
District 7 Director Jerry B. Baxter. The project is expected to be completed in 
two years. 
</P>

 Caltrans contributed $9.7 million to the project and $12.7 million came from 
local transportation taxes approved in 1990 by Los Angeles County voters in the 
form of Proposition C. FCI Constructors of San Diego is the contractor.

 The project also includes two new Park-and-Ride lots, one near the San Diego 
Freeway/Simi Valley Freeway interchange and the other to be built on Winnetka 
Avenue. Four sound walls to lessen noise in residential neighborhoods and near

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; CITY ASKS RESIDENTS TO RECYCLE MOTOR OIL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Agoura Hills wants residents to dispose of their used motor oil in 
an environmentally safe manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are dumping it in trash, in storm drains, in landfills, and it ends up 
in streams leading to the beach," said Mike Kamino, the city's senior planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills residents can bring their used motor oil to Agoura Hills 10 
Minute Lube at 29338 Roadside Drive for recycling.  
</P>
<P>
 The facility is certified by the state as an authorized collection center, 
Kamino said. The service station contracts out to a hauler who takes the used 
oil to a recycling facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The establishment is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; 
Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a 20-gallon-per-day limit on the amount of oil that can be brought 
in, Kamino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any oil that is suspected of being contaminated with other pollutants like 
antifreeze or brake fluid will not be accepted. FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; GUIDE TO AIDS SERVICES AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first comprehensive guide for HIV/AIDS services in the San Fernando Valley 
and a bus bench campaign promising "Confidentiality and Caring" to the 
economically disadvantaged were unveiled Thursday at the Valley HIV/AIDS 
Center's open house celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Vargas, project coordinator, said that until she started compiling the 
list of HIV agencies and services, she thought she would only have enough 
material for a brochure.Instead, she spent months putting together "Quick Look: 
The Guide to HIV/AIDS Services in the San Fernando Valley," a 30-page directory 
with a segment on safer sex, which will be available free at the center and at 
Valley clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Center in Van Nuys has provided counseling and case management for 
two years. With its clientele numbering in the hundreds -- and growing due to 
the 220 bench ads placed throughout low-income neighborhoods -- the center 
hopes to move out of its small office at the Sherman Way Plaza. Other plans for 
expansion include a bilingual case management center in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 John Maceri, executive director of the Homestead Hospice and Shelter in Los 
Angeles, has been actively involved in expanding services for HIV-positive 
residents of the San Fernando Valley. Maceri said most HIV cases in the Valley 
are among minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilingual case manager Ileana Rosas said many of her Spanish-speaking clients 
did not consider themselves at risk of being infected by HIV because they do 
not consider themselves gay or bisexual, even if they have had same-sex 
partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Latina women, if they ask their husbands, 'Here, wear this condom' it's 
like breaking their marriage," Rosas said, explaining one of the most difficult 
problems in HIV prevention in the Latino community. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; PLAN IS UNVEILED TO REVITALIZE DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downtown Glendale could be revamped with new retail shopping areas, a civic 
auditorium, a public park and even an outdoor amphitheater if the city 
implements all or part of a multifaceted "strategic plan" for future 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The first concrete images of how Brand Boulevard and the rest of the downtown 
might evolve were unveiled Wednesday night at a meeting attended by about 100 
residents, business people and city officials. Proponents of the plan say it 
will be a planning tool to help revitalize Glendale over the next 10 to 15 
years, but still leaves the city with options for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "This plan is not a block-by-block blueprint for what should happen with each 
piece of property. It's not that specific," said Alex Cooper, a New York 
architect and urban planner who has been coordinating the study since its 
inception last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper displayed a series of maps and drawings that showed specific 
improvements he envisions for the central business district and outlying 
neighborhoods. He said these "options" are now being weighed by a 
city-appointed committee for inclusion in the final strategic plan, which will 
be presented to the City Council for approval in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A major public/private "town center" in the area bounded by Central Avenue 
and Colorado, Harvard and Louise streets. This could incorporate the existing 
Central Library with a new civic auditorium, a public park and/or "gathering 
area" and new retail developments along the west side of Brand and Colorado.  
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion of the Glendale Galleria onto Brand, with a pedestrian-friendly 
entrance between Broadway and Harvard. A 200- to 300-room "urban hotel" or 
low-rise office building would also be ideal in this area, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Decreasing traffic on Brand by as much as 30%.  
</P>
<P>
 * The creation of new neighborhood parks in residential areas of the greater 
downtown.  
</P>
<P>
 Some people who attended the forum were cautiously optimistic, although there 
was concern the plan may be too far-reaching. "I can't honestly say I was 
pleased with all they were saying, although I do think Glendale needs to be 
upgraded a little bit," Bette Ackerman, 59, who lives in the Adams Hill area, 
said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Holderness, a longtime Glendale businessman and a principal developer of 
The Exchange shopping center, called the plan a "wish list." He said the most 
pressing need is for parking structures. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; YAROSLAVSKY AIDE ASSISTS QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If Mike Jimenez were to hang a shingle in front of his office, it might read: 
"We take all cases. No problem too small." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe not every case. Just the same, the aide to City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, who was hired to help Sherman Oaks property owners get financing 
to repair their quake-damaged apartments and condominiums, has not pooh-poohed 
the opportunity to help in smaller ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Just recently, for example, Jimenez got some volunteers from the First 
Presbyterian Church of Sherman Oaks and the L.A. Conservation Corps to help 
move an elderly woman's belongings from her quake-damaged condo in Sherman Oaks 
to her temporary quarters in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something that wasn't all that difficult to do, but it required that 
someone take two hours to coordinate," Jimenez explained on Monday, as he was 
getting ready to inspect some apartment buildings to make sure they were 
boarded up and fenced. 
</P>
<P>
 In the two months since the consultant was hired, he estimates he has helped 
about 35 property owners get their structures boarded up and fenced, apply for 
city loans and deal with their insurance companies. The bulk of his clients are 
those who need help securing their properties from looters and vagrants, 
Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez also helps apartment and condominium owners apply for reconstruction 
loans from the city housing department, which has $129 million available for 
that purpose. The city loan is intended to help bridge the difference between a 
loan from the Small Business Administration and the actual cost of repairing a 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 The area in which Jimenez is helping property owners is bordered by Cedros 
Avenue to the west, Coldwater Canyon Avenue to the east, the Ventura Freeway to 
the north and Dickens Street to the south. The housing department, in a 
separate program, is lending a hand to property owners on Willis and Natick 
avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez said he is also willing to make calls to insurance companies on behalf 
of policyholders who are having problems getting their cases settled. For more 
information, call (818) 756-8083. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; RESIDENTS WARY OF REDEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to redevelop parts of Sherman Oaks has angered some residents in 
this upscale hamlet. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the conflict is how much decision-making power residents will 
have to determine the priority and nature of the activities under a 
redevelopment project that would divert some of their taxes to repair 
quake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. on Wednesday night, Vivian 
Rescalvo, an aide to City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, said there isn't enough 
time to form a citizens advisory committee to help the Community Redevelopment 
Agency develop a preliminary project plan. This angered residents in 
attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents eventually won a promise from Rescalvo that a citizens committee 
will be allowed to help shape the plan, which will likely go before the City 
Council for approval some time in October. Under state law, Los Angeles must 
act by Oct. 17 if it wants to designate Sherman Oaks an emergency redevelopment 
area.  
</P>
<P>
 Under a redevelopment project, local property taxes would be used to rebuild 
quake-damaged buildings. The money could also be used to construct new 
buildings and make public improvements such as sidewalks and streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA has identified a preliminary project area that encompasses 570 acres 
of Sherman Oaks, including Ventura Boulevard from the San Diego Freeway to 
Coldwater Canyon Avenue. Also included are Willis, Van Nuys and Hazeltine 
avenues roughly from Ventura Boulevard to the Ventura Freeway, and Riverside 
Drive approximately from Hazeltine Avenue to Whitsett Avenue. At the meeting, 
which was attended by 100 people, homeowners expressed frustration with 
government officials who they say appear to be speeding forward with a plan 
without consulting residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting the distinct impression that this is a done deal," said resident 
Ellen Vukovich. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rescalvo said Yaroslavsky would not support the creation of a 
redevelopment area in Sherman Oaks if residents did not want it. She said that 
the councilman sees the proposal as an opportunity for Sherman Oaks to get 
rebuilding funds. The primary purpose of the project, she stressed, is to 
reconstruct what was already in Sherman Oaks, not make wholesale changes to the 
community. Proposed Redevelopment Area The Community Redevelopment Agency wants 
to create a 570-acre redevelopment zone in Sherman Oaks, one of the hardest-hit 
areas in the quake. A portion of local property taxes will be diverted to pay 
for reconstruction, new construction and public improvements. Source: Community

VALLEY COUNCIL MEMBERS TO SEEK MORE QUAKE FUNDS; POLITICS: HOUSING PLAN WAS 
APPROVED WHEN THREE AREA REPRESENTATIVES WERE ABSENT. IT APPROPRIATES $14.7 
MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Valley council members will ask the Los Angeles City Council today to amend a 
plan that appropriates $14.7 million in housing funds to quake-damaged areas, 
instead of the $23 million that had been proposed by Valley representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to bring in a motion Friday to allow us to amend the decision that 
was made," said Councilman Richard Alarcon in an interview on Thursday. "We 
need to allow debate and I do not believe there was adequate debate on this 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal passed 12-0 Wednesday with three Valley council members absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Hal Bernson and Zev Yaroslavsky were on vacation. Councilman Joel 
Wachs left the meeting early to fly to Vail, Colo., where he delivered the 
keynote address to the International Conference of Symphony and Opera 
Musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal that passed had been put forth in a report written by Councilman 
Mark Ridley-Thomas, chairman of the Housing and Redevelopment Committee. He 
recommended that $18 million be allocated for citywide use, $14 million for 
areas affected by the civil unrest of 1992 and $14.7 million for quake-damaged 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by Yaroslavsky and Alarcon, who sit on that committee, had 
recommended allocating $10 million for housing development and rehabilitation 
citywide, $14 million for areas affected by the unrest and $23 million for 
earthquake damaged areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon wants the council to reach a settlement closer to these figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the council as a whole will decide to put more of the dollars into 
earthquake recovery," he said. "Earthquake recovery should be our top priority 
and we have not mustered sufficient resources to be able to recover fully." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas had argued that while the quake has severely damaged certain 
areas of the city, the need for housing is a long-standing problem throughout 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Several council members or their representatives had argued that the vote was 
unfair because of the absence of the three Valley councilmen. To vote on a 
matter that affected them while they were absent violated the council's 
standing protocol, Alarcon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been the practice, as long as I've been on the council, to allow a 
council member to have a matter to be continued while they're on vacation or 
out of town," he said. "I would hate to think that if I go out of town people 
will be slipping motions behind my back." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's staff attempted to delay the vote until next week when the 
councilman is scheduled to return. But the council denied that request on a 
vote of 5-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky, speaking from northern British Columbia where he is vacationing 
with his 12-year-old son, said he was outraged that the council decided to vote 
on the issue while he was away and he referred to the move as a "sneaky 
effort," on the part of Ridley-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky charged that Ridley-Thomas scheduled the proposal to be discussed 
on a day that he would be away. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew I wouldn't be present," Yaroslavsky said. "I believe it was 
intentionally done. . . . His minority report would have never passed with the 
full council present." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridley-Thomas said there was no reason to try to rush the vote while 
Yaroslavsky was away and that agenda is public knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The agenda is posted in advance and it's a public document," he said. 
"Everyone knows what's on the agenda. The suggestion that it is sneaky is 
clearly baseless."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Agendas for Wednesday's meetings "are posted downstairs and put in the council 
boxes and distributed," the previous Friday, said Mike Carey, executive officer 
of the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "An effort was made to continue it in the full light of day and the votes were 
not there to continue," Ridley-Thomas said. "Obviously the will of the body was 
to dispose of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not take kindly to being charged as being sneaky and further it would be 
much better for Zev to learn how to accept that he is not always going to win 
and to accept that graciously." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky argued that the areas affected by the civil unrest suffered, "no 
residential damage to speak of," and that less money should have been allocated 
to those parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "To take a big chunk and put it in the civil unrest area is inexplicable," he 
said.

FAMILY OF TRAIN VICTIMS GRIEVES, WAITS FOR RETURN OF BODIES; ACCIDENT: MOURNERS 
MUST DELAY FUNERAL PLANS FOR THREE RELATIVES UNTIL THE CORONER RELEASES THE 
BADLY MANGLED REMAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It is hard enough to cope with the shattering deaths of his wife, daughter and 
father-in-law, who were struck by a commuter train, but the county coroner's 
office is preventing him from bringing the tragedy to a close, Frank Villanueva 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Villanueva's family doctor, Elizabeth Remedios, who spoke to coroner's 
officials on his behalf, said Thursday she was told that the bodies of the 
three victims were so badly mangled that it may take another week or more to 
identify them, preventing their release for burial. 
</P>
<P>
 Coroner's officials said they were unprepared to comment on the case Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been four days since the three family members were killed by a 
Metrolink train. Six of their relatives have flown in from Miami to attend a 
burial service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, said the family's pastor, the Rev. 
Fidel Carreno. But the service cannot be held until the bodies are released. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, it will cost between $10,000 and $12,000 to bury the bodies, money that 
Frank Villanueva says he does not have. A fund to gather donations for him has 
been set up by Union Federal Bank in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still believe in the Lord," Villanueva said as he sat in his father's 
sparsely furnished apartment, next door to his own, Thursday. "Right now, I 
don't know what I'm going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Villanueva, 38, had been in seclusion since Monday, when his wife, Maylem 
Blanca Villanueva, 37; their daughter, Francis Villanueva, 7; and Maylem's 
father, Juan Antonio Pina, 80, took a shortcut across the Metrolink tracks in 
Glendale and stepped into the path of an oncoming train. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Pina's ill health, Villanueva said, they took a popular shortcut 
across the tracks that many in Glendale prefer to the Western Avenue automobile 
and pedestrian overpass. Villanueva said he himself has taken the shortcut 
several times. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illegal to walk across the tracks, but there are no warning signs 
posted. Metrolink officials have said the three victims were trespassing on 
private property. 
</P>
<P>
 Although still shaken by the accident, Villanueva said he blames no one for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking softly, he occasionally wiped his forehead and let Carreno express 
the family's concern over retrieving the bodies.

 "We are urging (the coroner's office) to do this as fast as possible," Carreno 
said.

 "They were loving," the pastor said of Frank and Maylem Villanueva. "Most of 
all, they had the love of God in their hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 As often as three to four times a week, the couple would attend services at 
his church, the Iglesia Puerta Del Cielo of the Assembly of God in Glendale, 
sometimes inviting others to join them, the pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, they struggled financially but seemed to be doing better lately, 
said Iezza Primo, an owner of the modest, two-story apartment building where 
the couple lived, just two blocks away from the train tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only trouble they had was money, but finally they were able to pay the 
rent. They were a very, very close family," Primo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villanueva's surviving 10-year-old daughter, Marlene, lay on a living room 
sofa, flipping through family photos, and paused when she reached her sister's, 
slowly whispering, "Francis, Francis, Francis." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Villanueva's faith in God, his pastor said, has remained unshaken. "He's 
accepted . . . that sometimes things happen that we don't like to happen."

INTRUDER ATTACKS WOMAN, TEEN-AGE GIRL; CRIME: MAN BREAKS INTO TWO HOMES IN 
EARLY MORNING AND ASSAULTS ONE WOMAN; 14-YEAR-OLD IS ABLE TO FIGHT HIM OFF, 
POLICE SAY.

 A rapist broke into two homes in quiet neighborhoods early Thursday and 
attacked a 21-year-old woman in one and a 14-year-old girl in the other as they 
slept. 
</P>
<P>
 But the teen-ager was able to fend off her attacker, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In both assaults, the suspect, identified as a black man between 25 and 30 
years old with short-cropped hair, entered the single-family homes through rear 
doors, said Los Angeles Police Detective Mel Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold said investigators do not know whether the doors to the homes were 
locked. 
</P>
<P>
 The first assault occurred about 3:45 a.m. on Nagle Avenue. The suspect 
entered the house and walked to a bedroom the woman shared with her 1-year-old 
daughter, Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was treated at a local hospital for minor abrasions and released. 
Her daughter was not harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The second attack occurred about 6:30 a.m. on Morrison Street, about 6 miles 
west of the first location. The man entered and went to the bedroom of a 
14-year-old girl, Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the girl was able to fight him off and he fled from the home, Arnold said. 
The girl was treated at a local hospital for superficial lacerations to her 
hands and released, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are checking the past criminal activities of recently released 
sex offenders as well as contacting law enforcement agencies across Southern 
California to determine whether there have been reports of similar assaults, 
Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Arnold urged residents to take extra care to secure windows 
and doors at night to prevent break-ins, which usually increase in the summer, 
particularly on hot nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tempting to leave them open in the hot weather, but unfortunately 
sometimes you get more than a cool breeze through the windows," Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to statistics compiled at the Police Department's Valley Bureau, 
there have been 248 rapes in the San Fernando Valley in 1994. Of that number, 
65 were in the area patrolled by the Van Nuys Division where the two attacks 
occurred Wednesday morning, said Detective Woodrow Parks.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 3 MEN KILLED IN CRASH OF C-130 FIREFIGHTING 
PLANE IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Authorities have identified the three crew members who died when a 
firefighting plane crashed Saturday in rugged terrain near Palmdale, but the 
cause of the accident remained under investigation Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men were aboard a privately owned C-130 plane, under contract to the 
U.S. Forest Service, that took off from a Hemet airfield to drop fire retardant 
liquid on a forest fire in Kern County.  
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said they saw a mid-air explosion, causing a wing to detach from the 
body of the plane just before it crashed in Angeles National Forest near 
Devil's Punchbowl, a county park. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was owned by Hemet Valley Flying Service. Its president, Jim 
Venable, confirmed the identities of the crew members Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tragic accident," Venable said. He said the C-130's captain was 
Robert Lawrence Buc, 61, a retired Navy aviator who lived in Missoula, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 The co-pilot was Joe William Johnson, 60, a retired Eastern Airlines pilot who 
also had been a Navy aviator. Johnson was from Boca Raton, Fla. Also killed was 
flight engineer Shawn Douglas Zaremba, 30, of Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the Federal Aviation Administration and the National 
Transportation Safety Board were trying to determine why the plane crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Witnesses said the aircraft appeared to have exploded in flight," said FAA 
spokesman Hank Verbais. "But it's way too early for either the FAA or the 
safety board to say with any kind of certainty what caused the crash." 
</P>
<P>
 Venable said an initial inspection suggested that one of the C-130's four 
engines caught fire and blew up, causing the wing to detach. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Cockrum, a California Department of Forestry battalion chief at Hemet, 
said the mood among firefighting pilots at the airfield has been somber since 
Saturday's crash. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Hemet is the world's busiest airport for firefighting planes, and 
many of the pilots based there were acquainted with the crew members who died.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WATER AGENCY CUTS DEBT $26.8 MILLION; 
RESOURCES: WHOLESALER REFINANCES A CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT LOAN, REDUCING THE 
INTEREST RATE FROM 7.26% TO 6.23%. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Castaic Lake Water Agency has trimmed $26.8 million off future loan 
payments for the construction of the Rio Vista Water Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the water wholesaler have refinanced a $132-million capital 
improvement loan the agency took out in 1990, cutting the loan's interest rate 
from 7.26% to 6.23%. The lower rate covers the entire 30-year term of the loan, 
cutting the agency's payments by $26.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 New residents and businesses may benefit from the move, but current water 
customers won't see any savings, according to Robert Sagehorn, CLWA general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not reflect in water rates, but will forestall the raising of 
connection fees," Sagehorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 New homes and businesses pay a hookup fee for water service, based on a 
projection of how much water they will use. Although connection fees vary 
widely, they now average about $3,000, Sagehorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the refinancing move, the water agency also freed up $11 
million initially used to insure the loan. The agency no longer needs to put 
that money in reserve because of its consistent payment record since 1990. A 
portion of the $11 million has been used to pay off $4.7 million of the loan's 
principal, Sagehorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 CLWA officials plan to pay off the water treatment plant loan and other debts 
with future property tax increases, and have filed two lawsuits against Santa 
Clarita to stop the city from spending the money elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita City Council in February adopted a redevelopment plan that 
would use the future tax increases for Northridge earthquake recovery projects 
and to improve streets and other infrastructure needs, rejuvenate blighted 
areas and build affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Both lawsuits say the redevelopment plan illegally claims to be a disaster 
recovery plan and actually goes way beyond recovering from the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The first lawsuit was rejected last month and the second legal action is still 
pending.

COLISEUM LOOKS ALMOST READY; QUAKE: MUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE RECENTLY IN 
REPAIRING THE STADIUM, WHICH IS SET TO REOPEN SEPT. 3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Little more than two weeks before its scheduled reopening Sept. 3, Los Angeles 
Memorial Coliseum officials gave a tour of the facility's earthquake repair 
project Thursday, and it revealed there has been dramatic progress in the last 
three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 On the upper-level concourse, throughout the 68,000 regular seats, in the 
historic peristyle, and in the expanded outside concourse, hundreds of workers 
are doing the detail work that they say will ensure a Coliseum ready for USC 
and Raider football crowds this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Those conducting the tour -- repair project director Don C. Webb, Los Angeles 
City Council President John Ferraro and Margaret Farnum, chief administrative 
officer for the commission -- hailed the $60-million project, financed 
primarily with federal disaster funds, as a sterling example of what government 
can do in a short time when it gets its act together. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Webb said, it would have taken eight to 10 months just to design the 
repair and 24 more months to accomplish it. "Instead, we have done it in just 
six months since it was officially authorized several weeks following the Jan. 
17 earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Farnum, Ferraro -- who also serves as vice president of the Coliseum 
Commission -- and Webb all lauded Tutor-Saliba Corp., the prime contractor, for 
its management of a work force that numbered as high as 1,300 at times, working 
shifts 24 hours a day, to accomplish a project twice as costly as the Santa 
Monica Freeway repair. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is now the one stadium in Southern California that meets all of the 
current seismic standards," Webb said. "I'm not suggesting that the other 
stadiums are unsafe, but I can say this is the only one empirically that meets 
all the standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stadium is safe for everybody but the people on the visiting team," Webb 
quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 The gaping cracks that were evident at the stadium after the earthquake are 
gone, and with the new concession booths, new restrooms and a handsome 
maroon-and-white decor in the upper concourse, the stadium, once obviously 
aging, appears to have new life. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt, the easiest thing after the quake was to tear this place down," 
Ferraro said. "But then there would have been a tremendous fight from the 
preservationists as to how to rebuild it, and it would have been much more 
costly to rebuild, and much more difficult to secure the financing." 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the estimate of the cost of the repair was $35 million. But Webb 
said the work of seismically securing the stadium turned out to be far more 
complicated than expected. With the partial demolition of the quake-ruined 
press box and placement of 150 temporary outdoor desk-seats for the press, the 
most recent repair estimate of $58 million has been pushed to about $60 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the tour revealed this status for key aspects of the Coliseum: 
</P>
<P>
 * The upper concourse will be complete and the restrooms functioning by Sept. 
3. All power is due to be turned back on this week.  
</P>
<P>
 * Fifty-six massive reinforcing steel-and-concrete A-beams, containing more 
concrete than 15 freeway overpasses, have been installed to anchor the stadium. 
All are complete. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thousands of cracks have been sealed and seats replaced in their former 
locations. Several hundred seats must still be reinstalled, but the work is 
expected to be completed by Sept. 3. A large crack around the stadium has been 
sealed and encased with a $500,000 rubber isoflex joint that will be evident to 
fans occupying seats in one mid-level row. 
</P>
<P>
 * The peristyle still requires considerable pouring of reinforcing concrete, 
but this is scheduled to be complete in time for installation of new 
scoreboards on Aug. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 * Landscaping of the earthen berm supporting the outer stadium is proceeding 
clockwise around the stadium. Considerable work is finished on the south side; 
the north side, where the berm is barren, will be landscaped next week. Twenty 
huge palm trees, removed after the earthquake, will be replanted near the food 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 * About 25% of the press box has been demolished. Only the first level will be 
used this fall, for television cameras and network correspondents. Full 
demolition and construction of a new press box will proceed after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 * The outer ground-level concourse has been extended in one corner and the 
ground prepared to build a temporary food court that will replace some 
concessions that were removed to make way for the A-beams. A permanent food 
court will be built after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Three new electric power stations have been built outside the stadium, and 
it will have more power available than it did previously. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be things that will not be finished by Sept. 3," Webb said. "But 
what will be finished 100% will be all the seismic and structural elements of 
this project."

OFFICIALS LINK GANG RIVALRY TO PARTY SLAYINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A violent rivalry in the San Gabriel Valley between a Chinese gang and gangs 
of mixed Asian heritage -- Vietnamese, Filipino and Vietnamese Chinese -- may 
have led to the shooting deaths of two youths at a San Marino high school 
graduation party in June, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 When members of a mixed Asian gang arrived at the party and discovered that 
rival Chinese gang members were there, they left to seek powerful weapons, 
including an AK-47, investigators said. They returned, authorities said, and 
killed two people and wounded seven others.  
</P>
<P>
 San Marino police initially characterized the June 5 shootings as the 
unfortunate result of a flyer party whose photocopied invitations attracted the 
wrong crowd to a posh house on Lombardy Place. An argument with a disc jockey 
after gang members were kicked out of the party was said to have sparked the 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Teri Schwartz, who is prosecuting the case, said 
Thursday "we're fairly confident that it was gang rivalry that was the 
motivation behind the shootings." 
</P>
<P>
 According to investigators, the gang members arrived at the San Marino party 
to drop off a female acquaintance. After she was told that rival Chinese gang 
members were inside, her companions regrouped at a crash pad in El Monte, 
phoned around for weapons and returned to the party. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang scenario is likely to be used in the murder trial of the four 
suspects charged in the slayings of Dennis Buan, 18, of South Pasadena, and 
David Hang, 14, of San Marino, Schwartz said. Police said the two were killed 
when the attackers opened fire on 35 people. 
</P>
<P>
 At their arraignment in Pasadena Municipal Court on Thursday, not guilty pleas 
were entered by Hau Tac San, 18, of South El Monte; Cuong Chan Phan, 18, of 
Monterey Park; Vi Quoc Chau, 18, of Rosemead, and Tam Thi Tran, 19, of 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 All four are to return to court Sept. 15 for a preliminary hearing to be set. 
Meanwhile, they remain in custody on $1-million bail each. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The four were arrested Aug. 9 in a sweep of 11 homes in the San Gabriel 
Valley, Los Angeles and Stockton by more than 120 sheriff's deputies and 
officers from San Marino and Monterey Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators seized five weapons: a 9-millimeter handgun, an AK-47 rifle, two 
shotguns and a 380-caliber handgun with an interchangeable barrel capable of 
firing different caliber ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 Five others taken into custody the same day -- Phuong Tung Nguyen, 19, of 
Canoga Park; Son That Ton, 19, of El Monte; Thuan Quang, 25, of Garden Grove; 
Long Huynh, 24, of Rosemead, and a 17-year-old Rosemead girl -- were released. 
Police no longer believe the five were involved in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Marino slayings follow nearly a year of shootings, assaults and 
murders between Asian gang members in the San Gabriel Valley, said Sgt. Tom 
Budds of the Sheriff's Department Asian organized crime unit. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang war arose over control of the extortion rackets, he said. Pitted 
against each other are members of an older, highly organized crime ring of 
Chinese gang members and a new alliance among those belonging to a variety of 
gangs whose members are Filipino, Vietnamese, ethnic Chinese from Vietnam and a 
mix of all three, Budds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives have found that Asians of mixed ethnic backgrounds not only join 
the same gangs but share "crash pads," or hangouts where they rest or plan 
crimes, Budds said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang violence sprang from a rivalry between two " dai los, " or gangster 
big brothers in separate gangs, said sheriff's Detective Bill Howell, who also 
works in the Asian organized crime unit. Other gangs soon became embroiled in 
the growing violence and sheriff's deputies in the San Gabriel Valley began 
seeing an increase in shootings and assaults at pool halls and restaurants. 
Many of the crimes were never formally reported to police, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the crimes authorities believe may be gang-related are: shootings last 
August at two pizza restaurants in the city of San Gabriel, the November 
slaying of a 20-year-old Alhambra man in the parking lot of an El Monte pool 
hall, the December shooting death of an 18-year-old Los Angeles man at a 
billiard hall in El Monte, shootings early this year at an El Monte video 
arcade and the assault two weeks ago of a 67-year-old woman in Monterey Park 
whose son is allegedly a Wah Ching gang member. Not all the cases have been 
solved.

WIFE TO RUN FOR YAROSLAVSKY'S COUNCIL SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky confirmed Thursday that she will run for the Los Angeles 
City Council seat held by her husband, Zev, sparking debate over whether her 
move constitutes dynasty-building. 
</P>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky is resigning in December to assume his new duties as a member 
of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. He was elected to the board in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Barbara Yaroslavsky, 47, although widely anticipated, brings a 
new dynamic to the emerging battle over political succession to the affluent 
and politically active 5th District that includes Westwood, Sherman Oaks and 
Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's entry makes her virtually an instant front-runner, political 
consultant Richard Lichtenstein said. "She starts with phenomenal name ID that 
you couldn't buy," he said. "The challenge will be for her to create her own 
set of footprints and an identity on issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said that her name, although her biggest asset, would become the source 
of her biggest political headache in next spring's special election to fill the 
remaining two years of her husband's term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opposition has to take her biggest asset and turn it into her biggest 
liability," political consultant Joe Cerrell said. But the veteran strategist, 
citing the Kennedys of Massachusetts and the Browns of California, said that 
although people may disparage dynasty-building efforts "in American politics, 
they work more often than not." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky, who has been active in community affairs for years, said 
in an interview Thursday that one of her biggest fears is that the media, 
searching for controversy, will cast her candidacy as a bid by the Yaroslavsky 
family to dominate Westside politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "My big fear isn't that the candidates will say these things, but that the 
media will," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Bet-Tzedek Legal Services executive director Michael Feuer, one of 
several candidates for the 5th District seat, said he intends to campaign on 
his own record of running a successful and popular legal program for the 
disadvantaged.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Roberta Weintraub, another candidate for the council seat, said she 
expects to run on her record of 14 years on the Los Angeles school board. "I'm 
the only one with hands-on government experience," Weintraub said. "I don't 
think people will be voting to reelect Zev, and (Barbara) will have to stand on 
her own two feet. This is not an era when women can succeed their husbands in 
office and run simply on their coattails." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Leah Purwin D'Agostino, who ran for district attorney 
several years ago, reacted to Yaroslavsky's move by stopping just short of 
announcing her candidacy. "This is interesting development," she said. "I'll 
have my own announcement shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Protective League spokesman Danny Staggs was less coy. "We'll be 
endorsing Leah," he said. "She's always been a strong supporter of the police. 
Barbara Yaroslavsky is a nice lady, but not qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky said in a prepared statement that her candidacy is the 
"natural next step of a decades-long commitment to work in behalf of this 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 "I undertook these efforts not because I was looking for recognition or 
walking in the shadow of my husband. Rather, I'm a committed community activist 
and I believe that the passionate actions of one individual can bring about 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Questioned further, Yaroslavsky said she would run on her own record. "I don't 
have to defend what Zev has done -- actually he's done a wonderful job and in 
many respects, we're not so different," she said. "We're both very committed to 
the quality of life and preservation of the environment and seeing that the 
district gets adequate funding." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Feuer and Weintraub said they were in the race to the end, 
Lichtenstein, the political consultant, said that Feuer and Barbara 
Yaroslavsky's natural constituency of progressive Jewish Democrats is so 
identical that one of them will have to give. "I don't think there's enough of 
that constituency for both of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky recently proposed that the City Council appoint an interim 
council member to fill his seat until his successor is picked in a special 
election. Given the timing of his departure, it is likely that a special 
election will not be held until next spring to fill out the term. 
</P>
<P>
 That could leave the 5th District unrepresented at City Hall for as long as 
seven months.

HAILING MARY'S RETURN; POLICE BRING MARBLE STATUE BACK TO ST. CASIMIR'S 3 
MONTHS AFTER THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If it was not a miracle, then it was good detective work based on a lucky tip. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, the 700-pound marble statue of the Virgin Mary was put back this 
week on its pedestal outside St. Casimir's Lithuanian Roman Catholic Church in 
Los Feliz -- three months after thieves hauled it away in the dead of night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the idea that it was taken, that's what bugged me," said Police 
Detective Art Placencia, who helped find the 40-year-old statue in a house 
about a mile away. "It used to be that churches always left their doors open. 
Now they have to lock the doors and they have to bolt the statues." 
</P>
<P>
 A center of Lithuanian culture and politics in Southern California since World 
War II, the 1,000-family parish had just about abandoned hope of ever seeing 
the pure white statue again, according to its pastor, Father Algirdas 
Olsauskas. "We were looking to buy a new one, a cheaper one made of concrete so 
no one would take that one too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the church is celebrating the return of the beloved artwork, which 
depicts a caped Mary, Queen of Peace, her hands folded in prayer. Now bolted to 
its concrete pedestal as a precaution, the five-foot-high statue once again 
looms over the intersection of St. George Street and Griffith Park Boulevard 
across from Marshall High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's happy," said parishioner Vincent Juodvalkis. "It looked awful 
there without it." 
</P>
<P>
 A neighborhood tipster led police to the Atwater Village house where they 
found the statue in dirty, but otherwise good condition. No arrests have been 
made, but investigators are focusing on the Atwater Village woman who says she 
received the statue as collateral for a $25 loan she made to man she knew only 
as Ronnie. (Church officials estimate the statue's value at $5,000.) Detectives 
also are looking for Ronnie, if he exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither detectives nor church leaders believe that the theft was related to 
Baltic politics or any anti-Lithuanian sentiment. "I think someone was just 
shopping for antiques. It was not terrorism," Olsauskas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by exiles, the church often was involved in protests against the 
Soviet Union's 1940 annexation of Lithuania and the other two Baltic nations, 
Latvia and Estonia. During the past three years of restored Lithuanian 
independence, St. Casimir's has been more happily aiding the resurgent Catholic 
churches in the post-Cold War homeland. Although many Lithuanian American 
families have moved from the Northeast Los Angeles neighborhoods near the 
church, many still drive to the parish from suburban homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Police suggest that more than two people were involved in the May 13 theft. 
Because no one in the neighborhood reported hearing the noise of a motorized 
hoist or crane in the middle of the night, a group of thieves probably took the 
statue the old-fashioned way -- "by brute force," Placencia said. It took four 
police officers to carry the statue out of the Revere Avenue house where it was 
found in a hallway, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Olsauskas asked Placencia and fellow Detective Robert Gonzalez how he could 
thank them for their help in bringing the Virgin Mary back to St. Casimir's. 
They asked him to bless their police badges. He did.

SAFETY AUDIT OF SUBWAY WORK FINDS VIOLATIONS; TRANSPORTATION: ALLEGED HAZARDS 
INCLUDE MORE THAN 80 TYPES AND RANGE FROM EXPOSED WIRES TO CIGARETTE USE NEAR 
COMBUSTIBLE GASES. FINES COULD REACH $175,000 OR MORE.

<P>
 Inspectors conducting a comprehensive safety audit of Metro Rail tunneling 
have concluded that contractors violated more than 80 safety regulations, 
including the improper storage of flammable chemicals, the presence of 
electrical hazards and even the apparent use of cigarettes in a passage prone 
to combustible gases. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a week's investigation, inspectors reported 86 types of 
alleged workplace hazards in the Red Line tunnels and stations under 
construction between Downtown and Hollywood, Cal/OSHA district manager Lee 
Klein said Thursday. The alleged violations could result in penalties of 
$175,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said investigators found inadequate shoring around trenches, a lack of 
guardrails around shafts and exposed electrical cords and live wires. Workers 
also stored incompatible gas cylinders together that could cause an explosion 
like the one that seriously injured three welders last month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In what officials described as the most egregious safety breach, numerous 
cigarette butts were discovered in a tunnel continuously monitored for methane 
and hydrogen sulfide -- both highly volatile gases. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a potential (explosion) there," Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the alleged violations were corrected on the spot, she said. Although 
inspectors slapped stop-work orders on five cranes that may have faulty 
controls or wiring, no general shutdown of operations was required. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation reflects growing concern over working conditions on the 
nation's costliest public works effort, which has been plagued by accusations 
of poor safety and construction in recent months. Since March, the project has 
suffered two accidents and a tunnel misalignment that has set back the 
timetable for the 4.5-mile subway extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The two accidents, involving a runaway train and the explosion last month, 
prompted state occupational safety officials to mount the current audit and to 
invite federal inspectors to join them. Also, Cal/OSHA has cited contractor 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny in connection with the derailed train, ordering the firm to 
pay $301,675 in one of Cal/OSHA's largest assessments of the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials on Thursday reiterated the 
agency's commitment to safety on the project, saying that the rate of serious 
injury has been lower than the national average for such work. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA will distribute copies of the alleged violations to all of the 
project's major contractors, with instructions that they report on any 
outstanding problems, said Edward McSpedon, the MTA's executive officer for 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 McSpedon noted that the current investigation is not the first such 
wide-ranging audit by Cal/OSHA. A similar investigation two years ago 
identified some violations but concluded that "the job overall was being 
well-handled," McSpedon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the new round of alleged violations are linked to 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny and Tutor-Saliba-Perini, another major Red Line contractor, 
Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the two companies did not return phone calls seeking 
comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 86 violations identified, 44 were classified as "serious," 33 as 
"general" and nine as "regulatory." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Klein said none of the violations is likely to be classified 
"willful," which implies knowledge and deliberate overlooking of a hazard and 
carries the greatest financial penalty.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; REMAINDER 
OF JUDGE'S SUIT AGAINST PAPER DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last two causes of action in a Los Angeles Superior Court judge's suit 
against a small legal newspaper have been dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ricardo A. Torres had sued the Metropolitan News for libel, among other 
allegations, after employees of the paper circulated a memo at the County 
Courthouse lampooning Torres, who was then presiding judge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mock memo on Superior Court stationery, Torres pompously describes 
himself as "a judicial officer with august status" who was suspending "the 
election of my successor until such time as I determine it to be appropriate to 
hold such election." 
</P>
<P>
 An appellate court ruled in February that the memo was an obvious parody and 
ordered that the libel portion of Torres' suit be dismissed. On Monday, retired 
Court of Appeal Justice Winslow Christian, sitting as a Superior Court judge, 
granted the newspaper's request for summary judgment against Torres' remaining 
allegations -- invasion of privacy and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan News Publisher Roger M. Grace said the newspaper's conflict with 
Torres can be traced to its aggressive coverage of his tenure as presiding 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Torres told the court's administrative staff, 234 judges and 60 
commissioners, that the county would pay for one subscription to a legal 
publication. Most selected the Daily Journal, a larger publication. Grace said 
the loss cost his paper $34,000 a year. EDWARD J. BOYER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ARCADIA; BLACK BEAR 
CAPTURED IN PARK FOR RETURN TO WILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State fish and game officers captured a 150-pound black bear in an Arcadia 
park early Thursday, hitting it once with a tranquilizer dart. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers will relocate the bear in the Angeles National Forest by today, said 
Bob Schlichting, a spokesman for the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 The bear had been rummaging through trash dumpsters in Arcadia Wilderness Park 
just after midnight, avoiding a trap baited with marshmallows, strawberry jam 
and sardines, Schlichting said. Officers had set the trap this week, hoping to 
catch a bigger bear that had been overturning trash cans, pawing fruit trees 
and jumping into hot tubs in foothill neighborhoods. That bear had been 
described as roughly 350 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The bears probably are wandering down from the forest to look for water and 
raid avocado, peach and other trees that bloom in the summer, Schlichting said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's policy is to relocate wild animals that do not cause damage 
or threaten humans, he said. But wild animals that stalk neighborhoods and show 
no fear of people are killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Azusa police shot and killed a 350-pound bear that wandered onto a 
residential street one morning, just as children were getting ready to go to 
school. That bear was hit twice with tranquilizer darts, but the drugs had 
little effect.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HUNTINGTON PARK; POLICE 
OFFICER SETTLES SEX HARASSMENT CASE WITH CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Huntington Park police officer -- whose sexual harassment complaint against 
the city triggered an internal investigation that led to the removal of the 
police chief and two other officers -- has settled her case for $187,500 and is 
scheduled to return to work Monday, city officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Gina Scolari filed a harassment claim earlier this year that named 
Police Chief Frank Sullivan, who was placed on administrative leave in May, and 
Sgt. Robert Mercado, who was fired last month for falsifying a police report 
and other misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really looking forward to getting back to work and it looks like it 
will be a better place to work because of what she's gone through," said 
Scolari's attorney, Jack O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 Scolari, 30, had been with the department nearly four years when she alleged 
that Mercado, then her supervisor, had sexually harassed her. She alleged that 
Mercado attempted to grab her and verbally abused her. 
</P>
<P>
 During the investigation, city attorneys took testimony from more than a dozen 
officers who raised additional allegations against Sullivan, Mercado and other 
members of the Crime Impact Team, an elite eight-man unit that was disbanded in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations spurred an internal investigation that led to the dismissal of 
Mercado and Officer Keith Walker, who was fired Aug 4. for overtime fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercado and Walker plan to appeal their dismissals to the county Civil Service 
Commission, their attorney said.

EX-INGLEWOOD POLICE OFFICER WILL FACE GAMBLING CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Misdemeanor charges have been filed against a recently fired Inglewood police 
officer in connection with his alleged involvement in a bookmaking ring, the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick V. Freeman, an 11-year veteran, was among 15 officers implicated in an 
investigation that began in December with an anonymous tip to Inglewood Police 
Chief Oliver M. Thompson.Freeman was fired for his alleged role. The other 
officers -- against whom no charges have been filed -- were given suspensions 
of one to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Freeman filed a $10-million claim against the city, complaining 
that his constitutional rights had been violated and alleging that search 
warrants served on his home, automobile and police station locker had been 
obtained through falsified information. The city has yet to respond to the 
claim, which could serve as a precursor to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman and Martin Casillas, who does not work for the Police Department, are 
scheduled to be arraigned Aug. 29 on charges of engaging in bookmaking, 
accepting wagers and recording wagers, according to prosecutors and Freeman's 
attorney, Michael Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the Police Department nor the district attorney's office provided 
further details Thursday about the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Thompson said several months ago that the gambling occurred while the 
officers were on duty and involved sports betting connected to a bookie outside 
the department. Thompson did not identify the alleged bookie.

JUDGE HALTS $7-MILLION DELIVERY TO PIZZA MAKER; COURT: JURY'S AWARD TO OWNER OF 
DOMINO'S OUTLET BURNED DOWN IN RIOTS IS TERMED EXCESSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Domino's Pizza man in Willowbrook has been told to forget about quick 
delivery of one order. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the $7 million that a jury ordered an insurance company to pay pizzeria 
owner Dennis Stephan. It could be two years before the cash arrives -- if it 
ever does. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury awarded the judgment six months ago after Stephan sued the Insurance 
Co. of North America and one of its agents for allegedly failing to reimburse 
him when his Domino's outlet was burned down in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge in the case has ruled that the verdict is excessive and has 
ordered a new trial unless Stephan is willing to accept a $100,000 settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephan isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge F. Ray Bennett's ruling will be appealed, said Steve 
Thomas, the West Los Angeles lawyer representing the pizza maker. The appeal 
process could take two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if a new trial does take place, "we think another 12 people on a new 
jury will do the same or better," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 2 1/2-week trial in February, Stephan argued that the insurance 
company and its agent refused to cover his $225,000 loss after rioters 
destroyed his pizza store April 30, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He asserted that differing policy numbers appearing on his insurance 
certificate and on a riot settlement offer of $20,000 proved that the agent and 
the company switched insurance policies on him after he filed his claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia-based insurance firm and the Gold Cities Insurance Agency of 
Grass Valley, Calif., denied wrongdoing. They asserted that Stephan dropped his 
coverage when he briefly shut down his pizza store in early 1992. They said 
that when he reopened shortly before the riots, he only authorized $20,000 
worth of new coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the order for a new trial is reversed, this is not over by a long 
shot," David Gorney, a Los Angeles lawyer representing Gold Cities, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After February's trial, the jury ordered the insurance agency to pay $249,000 
of the judgment and the insurance company to pay the rest. The company's 
lawyer, Stuart Brody was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephan, 33, said he has continued operating two other Domino's outlets in 
Carson while awaiting insurance money to reopen his Willowbrook store. But he 
said the continuing loss of one-third of his income has resulted in foreclosure 
on his home in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven million was more than I ever thought about getting. It's not what I 
asked for -- it's the number the jury came up with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was victimized during the civil unrest, and now I'm victimized again."

LIVING THE DRY LIFE; MONTHS AFTER QUAKE, RESIDENTS STILL LACKED COMFORTS -- 
SUCH AS WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The toilet caused Sidney Yarboro countless hours of stress since the Jan. 17 
earthquake. So did the shower and sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Long after the quake knocked out water, power and sewage to his trailer park 
nestled under the Golden State Freeway, and long after the rest of Los Angeles 
and most of his neighbors had utilities restored, Yarboro and a few neighbors 
were relegated to bottled water and portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, about a week ago, the water came back on. 
</P>
<P>
 Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarboro and friends spliced into a temporary water main and tank -- with water 
company blessings. The line still goes dry now and then, but it's a 
long-awaited relief for a small community that is still straining to regain the 
basic necessities while other quake-weary homeowners have graduated to the 
stage of arguing with contractors and loan officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarboro, for one, is trying to remain stoical about the whole mess. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a boy I grew up with very little to eat," Yarboro said. "I just 
said I have to do what I did when I was a boy. Learn to ration and learn to 
face everything with a smile." 
</P>
<P>
 A combination of the main shock and the freeway collapsing on the Crescent 
Valley Mobile Home Park's front stoop knocked out utilities to all 87 park 
spaces for about a month, said Brian Fitterer, the park's managing partner. 
Access to the park was cut off as well while emergency workers rebuilt the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the occupants left -- 10 never came back. But as insurance money and 
the hospitality of relatives ran out, the other residents slowly filtered back. 
Some on the top levels of the park, set high on a hill, had services restored 
within a few months of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 But life on the park's bottom level is another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The impromptu water line may be working now, but a few residents still have no 
sewer service. Yarboro does have sewer service. He also has his neighbors' 
sewage emptying onto his driveway -- but that's another story. 
</P>
<P>
 Necessity has taught Yarboro and his neighbors perseverance. When their 
conveniences failed, they supplanted them with jury-rigged contraptions. 
</P>
<P>
 They wound hoses through the hills, siphoning water from the swimming pool. 
They lugged water-filled milk jugs up to their roofs to fill their swamp 
coolers, about six or seven times a day. And the wash? That was done in a 
bucket or the sink. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other adjustments, and indignities, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Postboxes have taken the place of mail carriers. "They say it's too dangerous 
to come down here!" shouted Diana Lemaster, as a giant backhoe operator dug up 
the road and neighboring driveways. Lemaster's floors vibrate along with the 
machinery from first morning light until just before sundown. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemaster and her roommate moved back to the park in May. They had to wait 
until two weeks ago for workers to lay new water pipes and until this week for 
the water to flow. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday the county Department of Health Services told her the water 
was also safe for drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep working and digging, though, and turning it off and on," Lemaster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbor Lois Reyes is condemned to the portable toilets. Under her trailer, 
where a sewage pipe used to be, there is only a long trench. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we flushed it would come out under the trailer," Reyes said. "It's a step 
up from camping, but I'd rather not be camping." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since workers dug up the road a few months back, the tenants have had to 
contend with the thick dust that swirls around the trailers. When the crews 
water it, hoping to keep the fine dirt from coating cars and homes, the road 
turns a muddy mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitterer, who lives in Orange County, said disputes with contractors, public 
works officials and insurance companies have caused delay after delay in 
repairing the more than $1 million in damage. He figures that the work is 90% 
complete and hopes to have things back in order by the middle of next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Yarboro took comfort in the few bits of modern life he has 
had returned, such as running water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a beautiful feeling to have it back," Yarboro said. "To me, it's worth a 
million dollars."

CITY LAUNCHES $24-MILLION QUAKE REPAIR LOAN PROGRAM; RECOVERY: PRIVATE LENDERS 
WILL CHANNEL FUNDS FROM TAX-EXEMPT BONDS TO OWNERS OF ABOUT 500 PROPERTIES. AIM 
IS TO RESTORE DAMAGED HOUSING. 
</P>

<P>
 For an apartment building, it was very young -- only six years old -- when the 
Northridge quake rattled its foundation, shattering windows, cracking walls and 
chasing its tenants into the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Like hundreds of other quake-damaged buildings citywide, the 18-unit complex 
on Saticoy Street in Canoga Park might have been demolished or simply left to 
gather cobwebs until its owner could scrape together enough money for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, that building and many others got a new lease on life when 
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and city housing officials held a news 
conference there to launch a $24-million reconstruction loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest of several quake-assistance programs offered by the city, the 
so-called Loans-to-Lenders program will use tax-exempt bonds and the help of 
private banks and lending institutions to finance repairs of about 500 
properties citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Savings of America and First Federal Bank will use the $24 million 
generated by the bonds to offer low-interest loans to owners and potential 
owners of quake-damaged properties. The banks also will take responsibility for 
paying off the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that building owners can refinance their properties at a 
lower interest rate, which makes more money available for reconstruction and 
repair of earthquake-damaged buildings," Riordan said before signing the 
documents to issue the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and others lauded the program, saying the money will make it more 
attractive for current owners to rebuild and for new owners to buy 
quake-damaged properties. Unlike other city or federal disaster loan programs, 
they said, this approach provides flexible financing and can begin distributing 
money as early as Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The crack-laced building in the 21000 block of Saticoy Street where the 
program was launched will be the first to benefit, receiving a loan of about 
$600,000 for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This 18-unit building demonstrates the challenge," said Councilwoman Laura 
Chick, whose district includes the Canoga Park complex. "With no action, this 
building and others would remain an eyesore." 
</P>
<P>
 Although two or three other quake-damaged buildings sit vacant in that same 
neighborhood, the building is not within one of the 12 city-designated quake 
"ghost towns" -- clusters of damaged structures in the San Fernando Valley, 
Hollywood and Mid-City. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said they expect that the building and those around it will 
soon be declared a ghost town and thus will qualify for federally funded 
security measures, such as 24-hour security guards and fencing. Ghost town 
properties also have a higher priority for receiving federal loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.5-million building is owned by Home Savings of America. Fredric 
Forster, president and chief operating officer of the bank, said the building 
would probably be worth only $500,000 if it were sold today, in its current 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual step, Forster said Home Savings of America will team up with a 
nonprofit organization to repair the building and then sell it to the nonprofit 
group, which will offer the units to low-income tenants at reduced rents.

EXPATRIATES PLAN BUSINESS TRIP TO VIETNAM; TRADE: THE DELEGATION EXPECTS TO 
MEET PRESIDENT. NEWS OF TOUR ANGERS SOME VIETNAMESE AMERICANS.

 Orange County's Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce plans to sponsor a delegation 
that will travel to Vietnam in September for a meeting on business 
opportunities with President Le Duc Anh and other top government officials, 
chamber officials announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-day trip, which will mark the first time that top leaders of the 
Vietnamese government have received a delegation organized by Vietnamese 
American expatriates, immediately sparked protests from Vietnamese Americans 
who steadfastly oppose closer ties with the Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. delegation will include only a few Vietnamese Americans, along with 
other business representatives eager to improve trade between the two 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is historic in that as far as we know, no other Vietnamese groups have 
been able to set up something of this magnitude with Vietnam," said Hien Phan, 
executive director of the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Wary of hostile reaction from Vietnamese Americans opposed to any dealings 
with the Communist regime, chamber officials, who said they have been planning 
the trip for several months, attempted to keep the trip a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 But news of the tour was leaked in the Vietnamese press Thursday, and one of 
the largest organized Vietnamese American groups in the Southland announced 
that it would protest at a Vietnamese Chamber business seminar Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want anything to do with the Communists, and we don't want anything 
to do with people who support them or do business with them," said Quyen Van 
Le, president of the Vietnamese Community of Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 The trip, scheduled Sept. 30 to Oct. 9, is co-sponsored by the Asian Business 
League of Southern California. About 25 people -- including bankers, 
developers, academics, immigration attorneys and representatives from medical, 
trading and industrial companies -- have verbally committed to go, Phan said.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the chamber itinerary, delegates would visit Hanoi and Ho Chi 
Minh City, formerly Saigon. In Hanoi, they are scheduled to meet Oct. 3 with 
President Le Duc Anh, Communist Party General Secretary Do Muoi, Prime Minister 
Vo Van Kiet and Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also scheduled to talk with Minister of Foreign Affairs Nguyen Manh 
Cam and officials of the Hanoi People's Committee, which governs the city. In 
Ho Chi Minh City, delegates would meet with officials of the People's Committee 
of Ho Chi Minh City. 
</P>
<P>
 According to chamber literature, the "fact-finding" mission will seek to 
"promote goodwill" between the two nations, expose the American business 
community to the Vietnamese investment process and help build relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Co Pham, president of the Westminster-based Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce, 
said he has received many verbal assurances that the delegation will meet with 
President Anh and other top Vietnamese officials.

NEWSWIRE: REGENT SAYS MAXSON LIED ABOUT CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Maxson, former president of Nevada Las Vegas, lied when he told 
university regents that a $511,000 annual contract was all that was promised 
Rollie Massimino to coach the Rebels, university regent Shelley Berkley charged 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkley said minutes of a 1992 meeting in which Massimino's five-year contract 
was approved by regents showed Maxson giving "absolute assurances" that the 
contract was Massimino's sole income. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she said, the former university president had already signed a secret 
supplemental contract guaranteeing Massimino $375,000 more a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maxson looked us in the eyes and lied," Berkley charged. "It's my 
understanding that the supplemental contract was signed the following day. 
There is no way at the time Bob Maxson made those representations to his 
employers that he had not already orchestrated the supplemental agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino was told this week that the university will not pay him much of 
nearly $2 million secretly promised him by former university officials who 
lured him from Villanova two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Interim president Kenny Guinn said that because the contract was never 
approved by the regents, as required by law, Massimino is not entitled to the 
extra money. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino is out of town and has been unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson, who left UNLV in May to become president at Long Beach State, has 
declined comment on the contract, other than to issue a statement saying it was 
"handled in an appropriate and ethical manner." Tennis

 The State Supreme Court cleared the way for a Los Angeles court to hear a suit 
by the mother of Oregon State basketball player Earnest Killum, blaming the

 Killum, a sophomore guard from Lynwood High, died in a Los Angeles hospital in 
January 1992, three days after suffering his second stroke in six months. He 
had been cleared to play in December of 1991 by university doctors, who reduced

GOLF ROUNDUP; THIS LONG LAYOFF IS NO PROBLEM FOR LIETZKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Returning to the PGA Tour after an 11-week layoff, Bruce Lietzke played as if 
he had never been gone. Better, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Lietzke eased into a familiar position in the International, scoring 16 points 
Thursday to take the first-round lead. A perennial International contender who 
is third in tournament history in points produced, Lietzke had an eagle, six 
birdies and a bogey to move two points ahead of his nearest competitor, Mike 
Reid. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the modified Stableford scoring system used in this event, a golfer 
receives eight points for a double eagle, five for an eagle, two for a birdie 
and loses one for a bogey and three for a double bogey or worse. Medal scores 
don't count. 
</P>
<P>
 Points are cumulative over the four rounds, with the 144-player field being 
reduced to 72 for the third round and to 24 for the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament, sponsored by Sprint, carries a purse of $1.4 million and pays 
the winner $252,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Green, winner of the inaugural International in 1986, had 12 points. Fred 
Couples and Hal Sutton each had 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Peterson-Parker, hoping to salvage par on the final hole to surpass her 
career-best round, made a 15-foot chip shot for birdie instead and earned a 
share of the course record in the first round of the LPGA Chicago Challenge at 
Naperville, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe what happened on 18," said Peterson-Parker, who shot a 
seven-under-par 65 for a one-stroke lead over Kim Catherin and Ellie Gibson. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson-Parker, who had eight birdies and needed only 22 putts, matched the 
course mark set last year by Marta Figueras-Dotti and Stephanie Maynor. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Alcott, one victory away from qualifying for the LPGA Hall of Fame, opened 
with a 67.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: PUTTING TOGETHER A TRIBUTE TO JIM HEALY WAS NOT AN 
EASY JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You couldn't blame Steve Bailey if in the wee hours of the night he screamed, 
"This job is not that . . . easy." 
</P>
<P>
 He may end up going "the Leonard Tose route," but for now he is enjoying every 
minute of putting together the 90-minute Jim Healy tribute that will be 
broadcast on the new KMPC next Wednesday at, naturally, 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, a KMPC producer and announcer for 37 years and the station's executive 
producer before his retirement in 1991; Bob Rowe, a KMPC producer and announcer 
for 25 years, and producer John Felz, the jack-of-all-radio-trades at the 
station for 20 years, have been working on the tribute for more than three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Healy, a Los Angeles radio institution who was on the local airwaves for 43 
years, died July 22 of complications stemming from liver cancer. He was 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the tribute, Bailey said, "It's been an all-consuming project. The problem 
is taking all this material and editing it down into an hour and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds as if a "Jim Healy, Part II," may be in order. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey sent along an unfinished, unedited copy of Wednesday's memorial 
tribute, and it's outstanding. Johnny Carson may come out of retirement to 
proclaim, "I think it's . . . brilliant." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the old Healyisms so familiar to his legions are in there, and many of 
the people he chided over the years are interviewed, along with friends and 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lasorda talks about Mother's Day, 1978, when a young news assistant by the 
name of Paul Olden asked him, after Dave Kingman of the Chicago Cubs had hit 
three home runs and driven in eight runs against the Dodgers, "What did you 
think of Kingman's performance?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda's expletive-laced response became legendary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish I owned the rights to it," Lasorda says in the tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 On a more serious note, he says he never thought it would get on the radio, 
and he regrets it because, he says, in his 44 years of marriage he has never 
used that kind of language in front of his wife, Jo, or in front of any women 
or children, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Others interviewed for the tribute include Vin Scully, talking about his "I 
can't believe it" comment; Al Michaels, talking about Howard Cosell; former 
KMPC deejay Dick Whittinghill, Times Sports Editor "Journalist Bill" Dwyre, 
former Times and Orange County Register columnist John Hall, former KMPC and 
KLAC general manager Bill Ward, former Dodger catcher and Angel manager Norm 
Sherry, Glendale News-Press columnist and sports historian Dawin Esper, son 
Patrick Healy of Channel 4 and many more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of Healy's arch adversaries, Ed (Superfan) Bieler, was tracked down and 
talked into doing an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Bieler says at first he didn't mind Healy's poking fun at him -- in 
particular, playing a tape in which Bieler says, "And what is the name of that 
river that runs through San Antonio? -- the San Antonio River runs right 
through the heart of downtown Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 But after a while, Bieler says, it got under his skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back when he was doing the fights at the Olympic Auditorium, I went down 
there one night to confront him," Bieler says. "People in the business know 
about my temper. It would have been horrible. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the former publicist for the Olympic (Van Barbeiri) -- I believe he's 
now selling real estate in San Pedro -- warned Healy I was coming, Healy snuck 
out the back. I'm glad he did." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Bieler: He says that five or six years ago, during his second stint at 
KABC radio, he ran into Healy at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never met him before and I was amazed how quiet and mellow he was," 
Bieler says. "We had a good time, but then the next day on the radio he 
crucified me." 
</P>
<P>
 Healy played the old Bieler tape in which he forgets the last name of New York 
Knick center Patrick Ewing and also refers to Manute Bol as Manuel Boat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>

 Last add tribute: The program no doubt will draw a huge audience. 
Unfortunately, people listening in their cars won't be able to tape it. How do 
you set a VCR for radio? 
</P>
<P>
 There have been inquiries about any public release of a tape of the tribute, 
as well as other Healy tapes. Reader Jack Nelson of Culver City, known on 
Healy's show as "Listener Jack N.," wrote to suggest donating proceeds to the 
American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 But, for now, there are no plans for marketing any of Healy's material. 
Patrick Healy has the tapes but said he doesn't want to use his father's name 
for monetary purposes.

 Fox debut: Viewers got a sneak preview of how Fox will televise NFL football 
during last Friday's exhibition between the Denver Broncos and San Francisco 
49ers. The most noticeable difference was the score-and-time-remaining graphic 
in the upper left corner. It was always there, except during replays. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing wrong with putting such a graphic up between plays. The problem in 
leaving it there during live action is that it becomes distracting. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been complaints, but David Hill, the president of Fox sports, says 
it's here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill used a similar graphic on soccer telecasts in 1992, when he was the head 
of Sky Sports, Britain's all-sports channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's OK for soccer, with its continuous action. But football has natural 
breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "My crystal ball tells me people are going to get used to it and like it," 
Hill said. "My mother-in-law and her bridge club in Lincoln, Neb., loved it, 
and that's good enough for me." TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Different points of view: Fox was patting itself on the back for the 6.5 
rating it got for its first NFL exhibition telecast, pointing out that it beat 
CBS' average of 6.4 for exhibition football the previous four seasons. But CBS, 
claiming Fox's calculations were misleading, shot back that the 6.5 pales in 
comparison to an 8.1 it got for a San Francisco-San Diego exhibition game last 
Aug. 28. The war has just begun. . . . Fox comes back with New Orleans-Green 
Bay today at 5 p.m. As was the case last week, studio analyst Jimmy Johnson 
won't be at this game either. During the early part of the exhibition season, 
he's allowed to stay home on his boat in South Florida, where he appears live 
via satellite. "Winning two straight Super Bowls has its privileges," Fox's 
David Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel 9 will provide live coverage of Saturday night's Ram-Raider exhibition 
at Anaheim Stadium at 7, with Rich Marotta and Hank Stram reporting. . . . 
ABC's Monday night exhibition football continues next week with Chicago at 
Kansas City. . . . NBC announced Thursday that Notre Dame football this fall 
will be shown live to more than 60 million households in 32 countries in 
Europe, North Africa and parts of the Middle East.

 Prime Ticket staff members were thrilled about their recent bonuses after the 
sale of the regional sports network. Not so happy were free-lance production 
people who have worked Prime Ticket events for years. They were left out 
because they are not on the staff. . . . Showtime previews the Sept. 17 
pay-per-view rematch between Julio Cesar Chavez and Meldrick Taylor in a

 The Sporting Channel, a new Los Angeles company that plans to launch a cable 
channel offering rugby and other international sports, has bought time from 
Rancho Cucamonga's Channel 30, KZKI, to show California League baseball games 
involving the Riverside Pilots, beginning tonight. KZKI, a shopping channel, is 
also carried by most cable systems. The Sporting Channel is headed by a group 
from the entertainment industry -- Robert Crawford, a writer-producer, and 
actors Brad English, Maura Soden and Geoff Callan. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:35 today, TBS offers triple-A baseball, the Richmond Braves and Norfolk 
Tides. . . . Satellite TV Week magazine reports that satellite dish owners can 
choose from more than 150 minor league games between now and Sept. 1, telecasts 
carried by various regional sports networks. . . . KABC radio will again carry 
Albuquerque Duke broadcasts this weekend. . . . Minor league baseball can be 
heard most nights on KMNY (1600), which carries the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. 
The announcer is Joe Castellano, a 1984 USC graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 One benefit of the baseball strike is that KABC has brought back "Sportstalk" 
to fill the nightly void. Steve Edwards and Eric Tracy are the co-hosts of the 
6-to-8 p.m. shows. . . . The Little League World Series, which begins Monday, 
will be carried by ESPN and ESPN2, with ABC showing the championship game next 
Saturday. The ESPN announcers will be Tim Brando and Steve Garvey.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; COOK, LAWRENCE STAR IN SCRIMMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UCLA football team scrimmaged for 29 plays Thursday, with quarterbacks 
getting plenty of passing work, largely because of a lack of available running 
backs. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense scored once, Wayne Cook throwing an eight-yard touchdown pass to 
Mike Nguyen. The defense countered with cornerback Teddy Lawrence intercepting 
a ball thrown by Ryan Fien toward Jim McElroy. Lawrence returned the ball 40 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sign that practice intensity was heating up at Spaulding Field. Four 
concussions among those wearing the red shirt of the injured was another sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd been holding our own all week until today," Coach Terry Donahue said. 
"Today, we had a bunch of guys get hurt in the morning and afternoon 
practices." 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Jasper, Anthony Jones, Mike Flanagan and Daron Washington suffered 
concussions, Jasper in the morning practice and the others in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 running back Sharmon Shah sat out the afternoon workout and scrimmage 
because of swelling in his right knee, which was surgically repaired last year. 
His backup, Derek Ayers, also sat because of tendinitis in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some good things," Donahue said of the scrimmage, in which 
defensive play made him happiest. "I thought (fullback) James Milliner made a 
couple of good runs, and Wayne Cook passed well under pressure. I thought Teddy 
Lawrence made a great play on that interception of Ryan's ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the concussion cases and running backs on the sideline were receiver 
J.J. Stokes, who had a slight hip injury and said it was no real problem. Guard 
Matt Soenksen has a swollen knee and Grady Stretz a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker coach Tim Hundley had an unusual summer, spending nine days 
coaching an all-star team of college players in Japan. He stepped out of his 
usual role in doing so, losing a coin flip and thus becoming the offensive 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really dedicated," he said of the Japanese players. "One night, about 
10:30, we went back to the practice site and they were there watching film. We 
have dedicated players here (at UCLA), but I don't think you'll see them 
watching film at 10:30 at night." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman McElroy is working against a stacked deck in trying to get playing 
time at wide receiver, where the Bruins have Stokes and Kevin Jordan, among 
others. But that doesn't mean McElroy, from Washington High, is being 
overshadowed. "That freshman, No. 85, is really fast," said Cook, after McElroy 
had gotten open for a 50-yard pass -- which he dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, he is like any other freshman," said Cook. "He has to learn the routes. 
Once he learns those, then he can concentrate more on catching the football."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; TAILBACK WALTERS INJURES BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shawn Walters, USC's leading rusher last season, put a chill on the Trojans' 
afternoon practice Thursday when he went down with a back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The 225-pound sophomore tailback was tackled by linebacker Jeff Kopp, who was 
holding onto Walters' left leg when he was hit a split second later by another 
linebacker, Errol Small. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters lay on his back for six minutes while trainers and team physician 
Michael Apuzzo examined him. He was put on a stretcher, immobilized and taken 
off on a golf cart. He was scheduled for X-rays Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add injuries: Starting center Robert Loya is out of action. He has a foot 
injury that Coach John Robinson worries might be similar to the one that caused 
guard Joel Crisman to sit out several games last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Senior starting nose guard Stu Gage has sat out recent practices because of an 
ankle sprain, and senior starting guard Kris Pollack has a neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's backup quarterback, Kyle Wachholtz, after having been granted a 
release by Robinson, has returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachholtz, a junior, was given a failing grade in a speech class by a 
student-faculty committee last spring after admitting that he had submitted a 
false medical report as an excuse for missing a speech assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachholtz, after considering a transfer to four other schools, returned and 
was at Thursday afternoon's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's like it was before -- Kyle is back on the team but academically 
ineligible this season," said his father, Ken Wachholtz. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the senior Wachholtz added that he has hired a lawyer and is 
considering legal action to have his son's grade overturned, in which case 
Wachholtz's eligibility this season would be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 In Wachholtz's absence, sophomore Brad Otton, a transfer from Weber State, has 
been backing up Rob Johnson. EARL GUSTKEY

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; WRIGHT MIGHT BE ON WAY OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wide receiver Alexander Wright will play in his first exhibition of the year 
Saturday against the Rams, and the question is, Will it be his last as a 
Raider? 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who has been sidelined for most of training camp because of a calf 
injury, is rumored to be odd man out among the Raiders' wide receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams in need of a speedy, solid veteran receiver have been keeping an eye out 
for Wright on the waiver wire, figuring he might be expendable because the 
Raiders already have Tim Brown, James Jett, Rocket Ismail and the improving duo 
of Daryl Hobbs and Charles Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I've heard about the rumors having me going to Seattle, the Patriots and 
the Jets," said Wright, who won the NFL's "Fastest Man" competition in 1992 and 
1993. "I just can't let that affect me. I'm still with the Raiders and I will 
continue to go out there and run routes and do what I have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Wright, who was traded to the Raiders by Dallas during the 1992 
season, emerged as a solid starter with 27 catches for 462 yards and four 
touchdowns. He also had 10 kickoff returns for 167 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright suffered his calf injury during the first week of training camp and 
soon found himself on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being an injured player is always difficult because you're watching from the 
sideline," said Wright, who was sound enough to play at Pittsburgh last week 
but was held out by Coach Art Shell because of the artificial turf at Three 
Rivers Stadium. "You just try to maintain your composure and don't mess up. You 
have to stay positive in this business and concentrate on what you're trying to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Bruce Wilkerson said he hopes to play against the Rams after 
playing only one series against the Steelers last week because of a foot 
injury. Defensive tackle Chester McGlockton and cornerbacks Lionel Washington 
and Torin Dorn are questionable because of various injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make sure that they're ready on opening day,' Shell said. "It's 
important that they get some work now, but more important for them to be ready 
to play then." LONNIE WHITE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't like the Rams' offensive line? Wait five minutes, and it undoubtedly 
will change again. 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's exhibition against New England, the starters from left to right 
were Clarence Jones, Tom Newberry, Bern Brostek, Leo Goeas and Darryl Ashmore. 
On Monday, Wayne Gandy replaced Jones and Chuck Belin took Newberry's spot. On 
Wednesday, Bill Schultz replaced Belin. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Coach Chuck Knox announced that Jones would start on the left 
side in place of Gandy, who had replaced Jones. Schultz will start at left 
guard, and Jackie Slater will start at right tackle in place of Ashmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the overhaul of the starting lineup? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a starting lineup," Knox said. "It's still an evaluation process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish that I could say this is sewed up. That would mean we have a pat group 
and we were satisfied with everything that is happening. But I can't say that. 
We're still searching." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Joe Kelly, who moved into the starting lineup last week, will be 
playing against his old teammates, the Raiders, in this week's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to get revenge because those players are guys I respect very 
well," Kelly said. "If Al Davis were lining up and he had on the uniform, then 
obviously it would be different. I'm not going into this game all upset at Al 
Davis because there's nothing I can do to get him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't agree with what he did last year. To release me and make me a victim 
of the salary cap when there were backups on defense who made more money than 
me, just wasn't right. He could have been a man about it, too, and called me 
instead of having a guy from the newspaper call and say I was cut." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Shane Conlan rested a sore knee, but Knox said he expects him to 
play against the Raiders. Defensive end Fred Stokes and quarterback T.J. Rubley 
will sit out the game because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes has been running daily on his sore knee and appears on the verge of 
returning to practice. Rubley, however, said there hasn't been significant 
improvement in his sore arm despite three weeks' rest. T.J. SIMERS

<P>
 Trev Alberts, the fifth overall pick in this year's NFL draft, was declared 
out for the season by the Indianapolis Colts because surgery is needed to 
repair his dislocated elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Indianapolis, which took running back Marshall Faulk with the second overall 
pick, had expected Alberts, an outside linebacker from Nebraska, to be an 
immediate starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberts suffered a partially dislocated elbow in the exhibition opener against 
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Deion Sanders will meet with Coach Don Shula of the Miami Dolphins and hold a 
news conference Saturday before attending the team's exhibition against the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've met him before, but I'd like the opportunity to sit down and talk with 
him a little bit," Shula said. "We'll find out about his interest and go from 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Gary Anderson still holding out, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed David 
Treadwell, the former Denver and New York Giant kicker with the same range and 
reputation as Anderson: great on mid-length field goals, not as good on 
kickoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently dissatisfied with Charlie Baumann's inconsistency on kickoffs, the 
Steelers wanted another veteran should Anderson's holdout continue.

 Bill Musgrave completed a touchdown pass to Darrick Owens with 1:40 left to

SWIMMING; IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL FOR EVANS AND JAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 World record-holders Janet Evans and Tom Jager added to their collection of 
national titles Thursday and teen-ager Allison Wagner won her third title in 
this year's National Swimming Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans won the 800-meter freestyle in 8 minutes 30.82 seconds, bringing her 
total of national titles to 41. The time was more than 14 seconds off her world 
record of 8:16.22 set in 1989, but was more than six seconds quicker than 
14-year-old Brooke Bennett, who was second at 8:37.02. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship was the second of the meet for the 22-year-old Evans, who 
trails only Tracy Caulkins' total of 48 national titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jager, who set the world record for the 50 freestyle of 21.81 seconds in 1990, 
remains one of the world's fastest sprinters at the age of 29 with a time of 
22.33. It was the second fastest in the world this year, but unlike the other 
champions determined at the Indiana University Natatorium this week, he isn't 
headed to next month's World Championships in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Jager won't make the trip because he disagrees with the policy set by U.S. 
Swimming, which requires the team to leave for Italy on Tuesday to start 
preparing for the Sept. 5-11 meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's what they feel they have to do to create team unity," said the 
three-time Olympian. "The heart of the team comes from the athletes and they 
don't need it shoved down their throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Jager said he would be proud to represent the United States in Rome if he was 
allowed to travel later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm swimming because I enjoy it," he said. "If I was going to have to go for 
five weeks . . . this week, the training camp and the World Championships, by 
the time I'd get home, I wouldn't enjoy swimming anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Hall Jr., whose father represented the United States in three Olympics, 
finished second to Jager. Hall, who won the 100 freestyle Tuesday, finished in 
22:46. Bill Pilczuk and Jon Olsen tied for third at 22:84 and will have a 
swimoff Friday to decide who will fill the spot on the team left open by 
Jager's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner added the 200 individual medley title to the 400 medley and 200 
breaststroke titles the 17-year-old high school senior from Gainesville, Fla., 
won earlier this week. Wagner won in 2:13.88. Nicole Haislett, a triple gold 
medalist in the Barcelona Olympics, was second in 2:15.64. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners included Ugur Tanner in the 200 butterfly and Jeff Rouse in the 
100 backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Taner won in 1:59.04 with Ray Carey second at 1:59.32. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin Stewart, who holds the world record in the event, did not compete 
because he was having his tonsils removed.

DEL MAR; MATCH RACE BRINGS A DASH OF FASCINATION

 Match races are as old as thoroughbred horse racing. In fact, match races are 
much older than thoroughbred horse racing. They might have predated the wheel, 
when men realized that a thing called a horse could transport them from their 
caves to the nearest 7-Eleven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Organized" match races are a bit more recent in origin, but still predate 
modern racing times. A horse called American Eclipse won match races in 1822 
and 1823, the first in Washington, D.C., and the second on Long Island. The 
Kentucky Derby was first run in 1875.

 There have been classic matches of famous horses, such as Nashua and Swaps in 
1955, and there have been provincial showdowns of little interest anywhere but 
where they took place. They have been run at classic distances and they have 
been contested at distances little longer than quarter horses run. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most famous, to be sure, was made legendary by tragedy. Ruffian, an 
unbeaten filly, was destroyed after she broke down in a 1975 match race against 
Foolish Pleasure, a colt. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of that tragedy, match races waned. Only eight have been run 
since. The ninth will be run Sunday at Del Mar, pairing a couple of speedy 
4-year-old fillies -- Soviet Problem and Mamselle Bebette. 
</P>
<P>
 The racing world was not crying for this pairing. Del Mar is simply trying new 
concepts, and this fits the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to do different things," said Joe Harper, Del Mar's 
president and general manager. "Match races are always intriguing. Maybe we'll 
attract some new fans." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the entrants, Soviet Problem, will be involved in her second match race 
this year. She went head to head against Lazor at Golden Gate Fields in May, 
winning by 4 1/2 lengths. That was the first such race in California since 
Chris Evert, the horse, defeated Miss Musket over 1 1/4 miles at Hollywood Park 
20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mar's little experiment will be run over five furlongs, hardly a classic 
distance, which will eliminate, in a sense, the likelihood of a tactical race. 
</P>
<P>
 These are speedballs. Bettors could pull the handle on a slot machine and get 
the results in only slightly less time than it will take these fillies to go 
five furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tactics?" said jockey Corey Nakatani, who will ride trainer Jack Van Berg's 
Mamselle Bebette. "I can't talk about my strategy, but I will say this mare can 
go either way. She can rate or go to the lead. My mare can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing his mare is not likely to do in this race is rate, which is to say 
let Soviet Problem get out ahead and try to come from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I can't let (Soviet Problem) get an easy lead," Nakatani said. "I've 
got to put pressure on her." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris McCarron, Soviet Problem's jockey, has never ridden in a match race, but 
he was ready with a tactical parallel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on a speed horse," he said. "Say I'm in a five-furlong or three-quarter 
mile race and there's only one other horse with speed. That's the closest 
comparison I can make." 
</P>
<P>
 So it's a matter of going for it out of the gate? 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't enter the race saying this is what I'm going to do," McCarron said. 
"I'll race it like I race all races -- with an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
 There simply is not much time to make adjustments in such a dash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love 1 1/2-mile races," McCarron said, laughing. "You can employ some 
strategy and you have time to recover from a mistake, provided it's from the 
beginning to middle. A mistake at the eighth pole would be difficult to make 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron will be getting his prerace instructions from Greg Gilchrist, Soviet 
Problem's trainer and a "veteran" of that match race victory at Golden Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If both horses feel and do the same, the start is all-important," Gilchrist 
said. "What you get at the start might make the difference at the finish. You 
get a half-length at the start, it may be worth a half-length at the finish. 
This isn't a race where you'll tell the jockey to take your horse back a couple 
of lengths at the start. It'll be an all-out sprint." 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be surprising that Gilchrist numbers himself among those who would 
like to see more match races. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a mystique about them," he said. "That seems like the only thing 
anyone wants to talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilchrist does have a suggestion for those who want to bet on the race and 
maximize their earnings, though it may not sit well with Del Mar racing 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both horses went off at 3-5 up north," he mused. "The only way to get even 
money will be to find someone who likes the other horse and bet with him." 
</P>
<P>
 One on one. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of Sardula, Del Mar's 1993 horse of the meeting, has scared off 
competition for Sunday's Del Mar Oaks and fattened the field for Saturday's 
Sandy Blue Handicap. Making the switch are Dancing Mirage, Musical Pal, Wood Of 
Bin and Solar Beam. Dancing Mirage's trainer, Rodney Rash, explained: "She 
won't have to run against the heavies." . . . The Pat O'Brien Breeders' Cup 
Handicap, later on Saturday's card, has come up light with only a five-horse 
field: D'Hallevant, Recommendation, Subtle Trouble, J.F. Williams and 
Minjinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Lykatill Hil and Sea Cadet are top-weighted for today's Windy Sands Handicap, 
and Sea Cadet is the morning-line favorite at 2-1. . . . Private Persuasion, a 
3-year-old, won Thursday's $51,000 feature race for older fillies and mares 
over 1 1/16 miles on the turf. . . . Trainer Bill Shoemaker turns 63 today.

WELL-ROUNDED PERFORMER; RAIDER TIGHT END ANDREW GLOVER WAS A THREE-SPORT STAR 
AT GRAMBLING, EXCELLING IN FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL AND TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One hot afternoon in May at a San Fernando Valley three-on-three basketball 
tournament, it was hard not to notice a tall, strong, agile player with enough 
skills to make him stand out among the best athletes in the top division. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost effortlessly, he dominated his competition. He showed inside power with 
dunks and rebounds, then displayed quickness and touch with jump shots and 
creative passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, the buzz among the crowd was that the young player had to be a 
Laker or a Clipper taking a break from his NBA schedule. With that kind of size 
and that kind of talent, they figured, he had to be a pro. 
</P>
<P>
 And the crowd was right. Sort of. The player they marveled at is indeed a pro. 
But he's a pro in another sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Andrew Glover, new starting tight end for the Raiders and probably the 
best-kept-secret two-sport standout in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "Growing up, I always thought that if I'd ever make it professionally, it 
would be in basketball," said Glover, a 6-foot-7, 245-pound four-year Raider 
veteran. "I was always tall and lean, so I figured basketball would be my 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
 That all changed in April of 1991, when the Raiders decided that Glover had 
the makings of a tight end and picked him in the 10th round of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Raiders saw in Glover was an athlete good enough not only to play 
three sports at Grambling, but good enough to excel in all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing under legendary Coach Eddie Robinson, Glover was a two-year starter, 
lining up at either wide receiver or tight end in football. 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged 22.2 yards a catch as a junior, with 17 receptions for 378 yards, 
including six catches for 211 yards and three touchdowns in an NCAA playoff 
game against Stephen F. Austin. As a senior, Glover did not 
</P>
<P>
 see the ball as much, catching 10 passes for 246 yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad career, but not as good as his stint as a basketball player. He was 
a three-year starter at center, and as a senior was an All-Southwestern 
Athletic Conference selection after averaging 16 points and nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Glover's best sport, however, was track and field. He was a three-year letter 
winner and a two-time SWAC champion in the triple jump. 
</P>
<P>
 "In college, I just kept busy year round," said Glover, who graduated with a 
criminal justice degree. "It wasn't as if I was surprised to be drafted by the 
Raiders. I just didn't think that my career would be in football. It just ended 
up that way, where football came first and I couldn't look back." 
</P>
<P>
 When Glover joined the Raiders, his athletic ability helped him make the team 
as a rookie. Playing mostly on special teams and as the team's extra tight end 
on short-yardage situations, he played in all 16 league games and caught five 
passes, three for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Glover got more playing time and caught 15 passes for 178 yards and a 
touchdown. Then last season, Glover gave an indication of his ability when he 
caught four passes for 55 yards and scored a key touchdown against the 
Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 Glover got his big break during the off-season, when veteran starter Ethan 
Horton signed as a free agent with the Washington Redskins. With a chance to 
earn the starting position, Glover worked hard to rehabilitate a knee injury he 
suffered late last season at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to take a lot of time off and give my knee some rest," Glover said. 
"(Afterward) I did a lot of heavy weightlifting to get stronger and a lot of 
running to help my quickness." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting stronger is something Glover -- nickname Pancho -- has done since he 
was drafted. Before he played his first game as a rookie, Glover's best bench 
press was barely more than 225 pounds. His best now is 360. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pancho has always been a strong type of player, but now he's really coming 
into his own," Coach Art Shell said. "He's had a real good training camp and 
we're looking for big things from him." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Glover has held onto his starting position despite competition from 
free agent Jamie Williams, former UCLA fullback Kevin Smith and converted 
running back Nick Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a different feeling coming in this season, knowing that the team is 
counting on you to make a contribution more than you had in the past," Glover 
said. "This is just a great opportunity for me. I didn't feel like the job was 
mine. I knew that I would have to come out and earn it and that's the way I 
wanted it to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Glover could become a key target for quarterback Jeff Hostetler, who likes to 
have a big tight end wreaking havoc on opposing secondaries down the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the man," Hostetler said. "I'll tell you what, he's had an extremely 
good camp and I'm really proud of him. He's responded to the challenge and came 
in healthy and prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very important part for us. Everyone hears about our wideouts, 
wideouts . . . but that only means that our backs and tight ends have to come 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Glover credits his improvement to his off-season workout schedule, which 
included plenty of basketball. He played in summer leagues and celebrity games 
all around Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that he could be the first two-way player to play professional 
football and basketball in the same season -- he's that good," said Aundrae 
Russell, who has watched Glover play and has worked with the Southern 
California Pro League at UC Irvine the last two summers. "He would be a legit 
power forward. He's like Larry Johnson, but he jumps better." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, football coaches frown at players playing basketball during the 
off-season, but Shell, a former college basketball player himself, is in favor 
of Glover's workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that basketball has really been good for him," Shell said. "As long 
as he gets it in during the early off-season months and then cuts down the 
closer the season gets." 
</P>
<P>
 Glover says there still is a basketball dream in the back of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I play now, I pick my spots when I do things because I don't want to get 
hurt," he said. "I'm very careful. But once I've established myself in the 
football world, I would like to give it a shot somewhere. If I still feel good 
and I'm in good health. Who knows? I still love basketball, but its just not 
for me right now."

NO PYRAMID SCHEME; UNIQUE NEW ATHLETIC FACILITY HAS LONG BEACH STATE EXCITED 
ABOUT POSSIBILITIES FOR GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rising dramatically out of the north end of the Long Beach State campus, the 
distinctive future home of the school's basketball and volleyball teams is 
still months from completion but has already infused the athletic department 
with unbridled optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials can barely contain their enthusiasm for the potential of the 
Pyramid, a $22-million structure they say will be unique among campus athletic 
facilities in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe the Pyramid, scheduled to open with a basketball doubleheader on 
Nov. 30, will help them attract better athletes, schedule more noteworthy 
opponents and create a wider base of community support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see the Pyramid as a catalyst for gaining national attention and 
visibility," Athletic Director Dave O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 A promotional video produced by the school to attract sponsors calls the 
Pyramid "a symbol . . . destined to become one of the most significant 
buildings in all of Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, it is different. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were just building a 7,000-seat gym, we'd have what everybody else has 
and it would not be the same," said Don Dyer, executive director of the Pyramid 
and a longtime Long Beach State booster. "But now we have a community landmark 
and a truly unique building." 
</P>
<P>
 It was designed by Long Beach architect Donald Gibbs, who said the school was 
looking for "a symbol to start a new age and a new beginning," while also 
hoping to keep costs down. 
</P>
<P>
 A pyramid, he said, "seemed to create a point of reference," and was less 
expensive to build than a more conventional design. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction began in January, 1993, with costs estimated at $15.7 million for 
a facility that will include a 7,200-seat arena, fitness center, educational 
conference center and athletic offices. 
</P>
<P>
 When the four lower-level seating sections are out of the way -- they are 
hinged and can be hydraulically lifted above the playing surface -- the 
beechwood floor will accommodate three full-court and six half-court basketball 
areas and five volleyball courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Believed to be the largest space-frame pyramid in the world, the structure 
peaks at 178 feet, or about 18 stories. Its exterior of cobalt blue corrugated 
steel can be seen several miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior is open and airy, with the tip of the pyramid about 190 feet 
above the floor, which is 15 feet below ground level. 
</P>
<P>
 The frame, exposed on the interior, consists of more than 14,000 
interconnecting tubes, laid out in sub-assemblies of small pyramids measuring 
six feet in height and 12 feet along the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an elegant and resourceful engineering solution that is exceptionally 
strong and exceptionally stable," Gibbs said. "It's highly earthquake resistant 
because of its stiffness and its lateral strength." 
</P>
<P>
 The university received $11 million in state money to build a campus physical 
education building and has raised more than $5 million from other sources, 
including a 12-year, $1.2-million contract with Coca-Cola. 
</P>
<P>
 The school estimated that it saved about $2 million by building a lightweight 
space frame instead of a conventional box design of massive girders and 
foundations, but cost overruns have left officials about $6 million short. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started out as a physical education addition of about 77,000 square feet 
and it went through its preliminary stages that way," Gibbs said. "But then it 
grew to a facility of 160,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very efficient system for (the budget) they have there." 
</P>
<P>
 The athletic department hopes to raise about half the amount needed to 
complete the project from a donor or donors willing to make a contribution for 
having the Pyramid named after their foundation or corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, O'Brien said, it might be five years before the facility is completely 
finished. Athletic department personnel, temporarily housed in trailers because 
of renovations in the physical education building, probably won't be able to 
move into the Pyramid during its first year of operation. Luxury boxes probably 
won't be built for several years, if at all. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the 49er basketball teams open the Pyramid on Nov. 30, with the women 
facing perennial power Louisiana Tech and the men playing Detroit Mercy on 
ESPN, seating will be available for only about 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien said that he also is inquiring about backup sites for his basketball 
teams' openers in case the Pyramid isn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that has curbed the enthusiasm in the athletic department, or kept 
officials and coaches from promoting the Pyramid. A replica of the facility has 
been incorporated in the athletic department's logo on everything from clothing 
and media guides to business cards and stationery. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Brian Gimmillaro, whose women's volleyball team is the defending NCAA 
champion, said the Pyramid will be the nation's premier volleyball facility 
because of its extraordinarily high ceiling, no hanging scoreboard and lights 
that run along the inside of the frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll never hit anything and you'll never lose sight of the ball," he said. 
"There's never been anything like it for volleyball. It's a paradise. You'd 
have to be outdoors to have it that nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pyramid will certainly be an improvement over the 1,900-seat campus gym 
that has been the 49ers' home for most of the last 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Seth Greenberg, men's basketball coach, said that recruits were turned off by 
"the Gold Mine," which is no larger than many high school gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost kids every year," said Greenberg, who has coached the 49ers for four 
seasons. "(They'd say,) 'Coach, I really like you, I like the program, I like 
what you guys are doings, but . . . .' And the but was always the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg said that two of his top players, sophomore James Cotton and 
freshman Akeli Jackson, would be enrolled elsewhere were it not for the 
Pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us a chance to compete on an even playing field," Greenberg said. 
"And I think the Pyramid itself is very special because everyone else around 
here has built a box. They built a box in Santa Barbara, they built a box in 
Irvine. The shape of the Pyramid lends to the dramatic. It's so impressive, 
just its physical presence, that I think it's going to be a tremendous asset. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the total answer, but it gives us the opportunity to get to another 
level." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its antiquated facilities, Long Beach has developed successful 
programs. The men's basketball team, which has also played home games at the 
Long Beach Arena, has won eight conference championships and made six NCAA 
tournament appearances, the most recent in 1993. The women's team has won more 
games and made more NCAA tournament appearances than any other Division I 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 In volleyball, the women won national championships in 1989 and 1993, and the 
men won in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 With the addition of the Pyramid, the thinking in Long Beach seems to be, the 
sky's the limit. Season-ticket sales for men's basketball have already matched 
last year's, and the start of the season is still three months away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always had the worst facilities in the state," Dyer said. "And what 
this building does, in one fell swoop, we go from last on the list to first, or 
close to first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the uniqueness of the structure and because of the newness of it 
and the excitement it has generated in the community, it's the best thing that 
has ever happened to Long Beach State athletics."

MIKE DOWNEY: JUST THE FACTS, MA'AM, IN HEISMAN CAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the city, Los Angeles, California. My name is Downey. My partner's 
name is Friday. I carry a press badge. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 28 of this year, I was working the always busy Sports Criminal 
Division of the Los Angeles Police Department when a call came in. In a 
building called Heritage Hall, situated on the campus of one of our top 
Southern California educational facilities, a daring burglary had occurred. My 
partner and I were assigned to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was stolen, Cap'n?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Try me." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Heisman Trophy." 
</P>
<P>
 We nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Check it out." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 "Any questions?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Just one." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Any idea where we can find this Mr. Heisman?" 
</P>
<P>
 10:17 a.m.: After taking the traffic-snarled but functionally designed Harbor 
Freeway from headquarters, we arrived at the bustling campus of the University 
of Southern California, where we were directed by a student to the department 
of men's athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 We spoke to a Mr. Garrett. He explained to us that the missing trophy did not 
actually belong to this Heisman, but merely bore that name, like the Hope 
Diamond. He pointed to a vacant spot on a pedestal. We nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 I needed some straight answers. I decided to ask this Mr. Garrett whose trophy 
it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "So whose trophy was it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Try me." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was O.J. Simpson's." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 "You've heard of O.J. Simpson?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, sir. You just mentioned him." 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean the O.J. Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 We nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Garrett had been helpful. He told us that the first police officers on the 
scene had found "fingerprints from two adult males." We were pleased that they 
were able to tell adult male fingerprints from adult female fingerprints. We 
thanked Mr. Garrett for his help. He nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad they didn't get mine." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "My Heisman Trophy." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have one of these trophies?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Right over there." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed. We nodded. There were trophies all over the hall. We wondered why 
burglars would quote-unquote "rip off," as the youngsters say, one trophy and 
not these others. I told Mr. Garrett we would do our best to recover this 
missing trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, officer." 
</P>
<P>
 "And then we'll look for that other thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That diamond of Bob Hope's." 
</P>
<P>
 11:47 a.m.: We drove to a federal courthouse downtown, where we hoped to 
interview this Mr. Simpson to whom the stolen trophy apparently belonged. We 
found ourselves in the packed courtroom of Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, 
where a surprising amount of activity was taking place. My partner pointed to 
two empty seats in back. I nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 12:30 p.m.: As the trial recessed for lunch, we attempted to interview Mr. 
Simpson but were rebuffed by his attorneys, of whom there appeared to be 
several. I asked a Mr. Shapiro if he could provide any information on his 
client's missing football trophy. He said he had greater concerns at the 
moment. He looked busy. We nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 Another attorney, a Ms. Clark, interrupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it's in there." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's in where, ma'am?" 
</P>
<P>
 "See that sealed envelope on the judge's desk?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, ma'am." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the trophy's in there." 
</P>
<P>
 We nodded. The envelope seemed rather thin to contain such a large trophy, but 
Ms. Clark suggested that perhaps the bronze statue had been melted down. She 
said we definitely should satisfy our curiosity and look inside the envelope. 
She even volunteered to inspect the contents of the envelope along with us, if 
we preferred. We nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 1:02 p.m.: Asked to leave his courtroom immediately by a surprisingly angry 
Judge Ito, we decided to visit several neighborhood pawn shops, where so-called 
"hot" merchandise could often be found. On our first stop, we got lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah. Two guys were just in here." 
</P>
<P>
 "With a trophy?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tiny football player on top?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah. Little stiff-armed guy." 
</P>
<P>
 We nodded. The pawnbroker told us that two adult males had attempted to hock 
the football trophy shortly before noon. They claimed it to be an authentic 
Heisman Trophy won by O.J. Simpson and said they had found it on the sidewalk. 
They wanted 50 bucks for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I said no." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why's that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Officer, you ever try to sell a Heisman Trophy?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, sir." 
</P>
<P>
 "It ain't like sellin' some clock radio." 
</P>
<P>
 We nodded. The case was a dead end. We drove back to Heritage Hall to snoop 
around. Maybe something had turned up. 
</P>
<P>
 2:19 p.m.: A woman handed us a bundle, wrapped in newspaper. We opened the 
package. Inside was the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 My partner grabbed my arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got it!" 
</P>
<P>
 "You're hurting me." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman asked what the statue was. I held it in my hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stuff dreams are made of." 
</P>
<P>
 We took her downtown and booked her on illegal possession of an award. We 
needed a fall guy.

HISTORY LESSON; NEGRO LEAGUE VETERANS WANT YOUNGER PLAYERS TO KNOW ABOUT THEIR 
EXPERIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You'll have to forgive the dwindling numbers of Negro league veterans during 
this most recent of baseball strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 They can't believe what they're seeing: Millionaire players walking out over 
something called a "salary cap." 
</P>
<P>
 Sammie Haynes' salary was $200 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not quite. His meal money was $2 a day, and that was deducted from his 
paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Newcombe's "salary cap" was $42,500 a year, and that was after a 27-7 
season in 1956, and after the Dodgers had given him a $10,000 raise. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, it was take it or leave it. 
</P>
<P>
 They took it. 
</P>
<P>
 They took it because they loved baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the days before baseball's integration, blacks who loved the game and 
were good enough to play it had to play it in the Negro leagues. It was Jim 
Crow baseball, but it was baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it hadn't always been that way. After the Civil War, when baseball was 
a young game, there were some integrated teams. And although Jackie Robinson is 
properly credited with breaking baseball's color barrier in 1947, he was not 
the first black major leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
 Moses Fleetwood Walker had beaten Robinson to that distinction by more than 60 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleet Walker, a catcher in the days when catchers customarily caught 
barehanded and did not use chest protectors, joined Toledo of the American 
Assn., then regarded as a major league and the National League's leading rival, 
in 1884. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, about 70 blacks played in organized baseball in the late 19th 
Century, most with all-black clubs but some with integrated teams. By the early 
20th Century, however, the country's growing racism basically relegated black 
players to black teams, and black leagues evolved as a natural outgrowth. 
</P>
<P>
 Most black teams sprang up in the industrialized North, but there were teams, 
and leagues, all over the country, particularly in the early 1900s. Contracts 
were nonexistent or unenforceable and stars frequently jumped teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever the money was, that's where I was," Jules Tygiel quotes shortstop 
John Henry Lloyd in Tygiel's history of black baseball in "Total Baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, there were many leagues, among them an almost constantly 
reforming Negro National League that was the linchpin of black baseball. But 
there also were the Eastern Colored League, the Southern Negro League and, 
ultimately, the Negro American League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Negro National and American leagues eventually gave black baseball its 
focus, since the leagues conducted an annual all-star game -- the major 
money-raiser of any season -- and a less successful World Series. Even so, one 
of the most famous black teams, the Homestead Grays of Pittsburgh, earned its 
considerable fame as an independent. 
</P>
<P>
 At its best, black baseball was very good, and although teams were thin -- 
they seldom consisted of more than 15 players -- there were stars, and 
superstars -- Smokey Joe Williams, Cannonball Dick Redding, Rube Foster, Judy 
Johnson, Josh Gibson, Cool Papa Bell, Buck Leonard, Satchel Paige. . . . Some 
eventually made it to the major leagues, most never did. Haynes didn't, 
Newcombe did. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes is 74 and blind now. Newcombe, the Dodgers' community relations 
director, is 68. Both live in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes played from 1938 through '47 in the Negro American League, for the 
Kansas City Monarchs. Newcombe, before his major league career (1949-60), 
started out with the Newark Eagles (1944-45) of the Negro National Leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews, the two Negro league veterans talked about the old 
days, Robinson, and the strike: SAMMIE HAYNES 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in Atlanta, in the Fourth Ward district. My hero was Josh Gibson, 
who played for the Homestead Grays.  
</P>
<P>
 "Josh was without a doubt one of the greatest hitters who ever lived. He was a 
6-foot-3, 235-pound catcher with a great arm. He hit a lot of home runs, but he 
rarely struck out.  
</P>
<P>
 "He used to tell me he'd choke up two inches when he got two strikes, and 
shorten his stride two inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "In New Orleans once, where they had a short left-field fence, I saw Josh hit 
the fence with a line drive. He'd hit the ball so hard, it bounced back to the 
shortstop, who threw out Josh at second base. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Norfolk once, I saw him fooled on a curveball, and he made contact with 
just his right hand. He hit it over the right-field fence.  
</P>
<P>
 "Josh had more power than (Roy) Campanella, but Campy was as good a catcher as 
Josh. But Campy had nowhere near Josh's power.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid in Atlanta, I had no interest in the major leagues. All I 
was interested in was the Negro leagues. When I was a kid, I'd walk four blocks 
to Yates and Milton's drug store, because that's where I could buy all the 
black newspapers -- the Atlanta Daily World, the Chicago Defender, the 
Baltimore African-American and Pittsburgh Courier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read all I could about the Negro leagues. The white papers never wrote 
about them -- except for maybe a paragraph or two. And they never published box 
scores. In the black papers, it was eight-column headlines.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball was our world. There was no football or basketball for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me to sympathize for today's players, in this strike. Yeah, I 
think they're spoiled. The more money you make . . . then greed comes in, and 
that's too bad, when you forget what the game is all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also fault the owners for giving them too much money in the first place. 
It's a problem of their own making. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major league players today -- they'd never have survived what we went 
through in the Negro leagues. They just don't understand.  
</P>
<P>
 "We traveled in buses. I remember one time barnstorming through Ohio and not 
seeing a bed for 14 days. We slept on the bus or in ballparks. If we were 
lucky, we could get a room with a black family.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'd play a game in, say, Dayton, then shower and eat, then hit the road for 
Columbus. We'd eat, go to the pool hall or a movie. Or maybe look for a one-day 
laundry. Then we'd eat and play a game.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then it was back on the road. That was our life. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were only a few hotels in those days that'd take us. Most of the time, 
if the local promoter couldn't arrange a hotel, we'd stay with families. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest salary was $200 per month. I wasn't a star. In fact I was a very 
poor hitter. But it was the Depression and there were people working for 25 
cents an hour. So I felt I was doing OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "One year, Monte Irvin held out for $175 a month. He didn't get it, so he went 
to Mexico and made more money playing there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one time our owner telling me he'd made enough money on our Texas 
spring training games that he could pay all his overhead for the whole season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did he give anything extra to us? No. But we had no union, so what could we 
do? 
</P>
<P>
 "We always got a $100 bonus when we went east. When we went to Philadelphia, 
we always went to a tailor on Silas Street, who cut us tailor-made suits for 
$25. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie Robinson joined our club in 1945. The first day in the clubhouse, he 
told all of us, 'I'm here to learn. I respect you guys. I'm honored to be 
here.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We all knew about him. He'd been a famous UCLA football player. I remember 
how competitive he was -- we could be 10 runs down to someone, it never 
bothered him. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he went to the majors, it was a question of who fit the bill, not who 
was the best player. There were other blacks who were better players. But he 
had a very flexible personality, and he'd competed with whites in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't drink and he was someone who could take all that pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't a lot of us (Negro League veterans) left anymore. Maybe 200. 
Some of us go to the All-Star game and talk to players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The white players seem more interested in our background than the black 
players. Mark McGwire said to me once, 'I'm sorry you had to go through that, 
but because of you things are much better now.'  
</P>
<P>
 "When Vince Coleman said he'd never heard of Jackie, it was awful. It hurt so 
many people. There's no excuse for a black athlete to be unaware of what Jackie 
did.  
</P>
<P>
 "He paved the way for them. And it killed him. All that pressure and tension 
he had to go through, that's what brought on the diabetes that killed him." DON 
NEWCOMBE 
</P>
<P>
 "You really can't compare this (strike) situation with the Negro leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we'd gone on strike in the Negro leagues, it would have finished them. A 
couple of clubs were making money, but most didn't. They'd have been out of 
business in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd grown up in Newark, New Jersey, but until 1945, I'd never been to a major 
league game in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heroes were all Negro leagues guys -- Satchel Paige, Buck Leonard, Josh 
Gibson. . . . My dad took us to see games at Ruppert Stadium in Newark. When 
the Newark Bears (a white team) were out of town, the Eagles played there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie Robinson did a lot more than people realize today, things beyond 
breaking the color barrier. He desegregated hotels and stadiums. He broke 
segregation at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Cardinals used to set aside 3,000 outfield seats for blacks. This was 
1949, and blacks were driving all the way from places like Memphis to see 
Jackie play.  
</P>
<P>
 "One day, Jackie said he wasn't taking the field unless they let blacks sit 
anywhere they wanted. It worked. They changed it the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 "For seven years, Jackie, Campy, Junior (Gilliam) and I weren't allowed to 
stay in the Dodgers' hotel in St. Louis, the Chase. We had to stay at a place 
in the black section.  
</P>
<P>
 "I came back from the Korean War in 1954 and on our way to St. Louis one time 
I said to Jackie, 'How long are we going to live like subhumans?'  
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie said, 'What do you want to do about it?'  
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I wanted to stay at the Chase and he said, 'OK, let's go.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Campy and Junior wouldn't go with us, but Jackie and I walked in and asked to 
see the manager. He knew who we were. He took us in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You know why we're here don't you?' Jackie asked him. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Yes, you want to stay here with your teammates,' the guy said.  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Right,' Jackie said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'OK, the reason we don't want you staying here is that we don't want you 
using the swimming pool.'  
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie said, 'I can't swim.'  
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I never swim during the season -- it could hurt my arm.'  
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know, that was the last segregated hotel in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little things like that that Jackie did, the (black) players today just don't 
know things like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that still bothers me even today about those days is the lack of 
curiosity our white teammates had about where we stayed, or in what conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never even seemed curious about where we went in St. Louis. I never 
heard one of them even ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years in Cincinnati, we had to eat our meals in our rooms, at the 
Dodgers' hotel, the Netherlands Plaza, because it was 'Too close to Kentucky,' 
they told us.  
</P>
<P>
 "That went on until 1955. One trip, Jackie brought his wife, Rachel. 'The hell 
with it,' he said. 'We're eating in the dining room.'  
</P>
<P>
 "And they did it. And not one word was said about it. After that, because of 
Jackie, we could always eat there. 
</P>
<P>
 "So when Vince Coleman said he never heard of Jackie Robinson, I hit the 
ceiling. I thought he was a . . . idiot. The black sportswriters really raked 
him over the coals for that. "But after I cooled down, I got to thinking. Maybe 
it's our fault. Maybe no one ever taught him about the history of his sport. He 
just didn't know.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, I was at a New Orleans high school to speak. I had some time 
to kill, so I went into the school library. They had books on Martin Luther 
King, Rosa Parks and A. Phillip Randolph, but I couldn't find a word on Jackie. 
</P>
<P>
 "So maybe those of us who played in the Negro leagues need to take on more 
responsibility in teaching today's young people and players how they got where 
they are. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also think Negro league veterans should be fully invested in the major 
leagues' pension plan. Look at Sam Jethroe. 
</P>
<P>
 "He played seven years in the Negro leagues, was the National League rookie of 
the year (for the Boston Braves) in 1950, and played just three years in the 
majors. He doesn't get a dime from the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why does it take so long? Larry Doby (the first black player in the American 
League) retired in 1959, and the Cleveland Indians just last month retired his 
number. What took them so long? 
</P>
<P>
 "Only now are people becoming aware of the Negro leagues. Why did it take so 
long? 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to a dedication of a baseball field that was named for Junior 
Gilliam, I sat next to (former Los Angeles) Mayor Tom Bradley.  
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Tom, why do you have to die before someone recognizes your life?'  
</P>
<P>
 "He said to me, 'Don, I don't know.' "

KINGDOME REPAIRS DELAYED FOR ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Round-the-clock scrambling to repair the Kingdome was put on hold Thursday by 
an investigation into the deaths of two workers in a crane accident at the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two people have died.I am not concerned about the Seahawks and the Mariners 
and about an opening game," King County Executive Gary Locke said during a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 State investigators have made a preliminary finding of cable failure, said 
Mark O. Brown, director of the state Department of Labor and Industries, which 
is investigating the deaths with King County police. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear how long the investigation at the accident site would take, 
Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Sandaas, who took over as interim director of the Kingdome on Monday, 
said he couldn't estimate when work might resume other than that it would be 
days -- and only after the repair program had been reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's accident, which killed two men and injured one, probably will 
change plans to reopen the Kingdome by Sept. 18, the date of the Seahawks' NFL 
home opener against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to remain flexible at this point," Seahawk President David 
Behring said at club headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed in the crane accident were painters Jorge Sanchez Turincio, 39, of San 
Diego and William Lynn Louth, 37, of Portland. Crane operator Charles Cox, 25, 
of Edmonds is in satisfactory condition at Harborview Medical Center.

HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION JACK SHARKEY, 91, DIES; BOXING: HE WAS THE OLDEST 
SURVIVING FIGHTER TO HOLD THE TITLE, WON IN 1932 WITH A 15-ROUND DECISION OVER 
MAX SCHMELING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Sharkey, the oldest living former heavyweight boxing champion, died 
Wednesday at the age of 91. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharkey died of respiratory arrest at Beverly Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharkey fought in the golden days of boxing, logging 55 professional fights 
against such opponents as Joe Louis, Jack Delaney, Jack Dempsey, Mike McTigue, 
Tommy Loughran, Max Schmeling and Primo Carnera. His record was 38-13-3 with 
one no decision. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the championship June 21, 1932 in a 15-round decision over Schmeling 
and lost it to Carnera the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sharkey described the highlight of his career as his July 21, 1927 bout in 
New York's Yankee Stadium against Dempsey, which he lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned to the referee to complain I was getting hit low and I got hit with 
a haymaker," Sharkey remembered later. "That was that. I was out on the 
canvas." 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey was at the end of his career, although he fought one more fight, 
losing to Gene Tunney in an effort to regain the heavyweight crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You came out of a fight with Dempsey full of welts and bruises and every bone 
aching," Sharkey said when Dempsey died May 31, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 In a comeback at 34, Sharkey fought Joe Louis on Aug. 18, 1936 and was knocked 
out in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
 "Louis? A great fighter and a great hitter," he said. "But he was a 
methodical, punishing type of boxer who built up to a terrific explosion." 
</P>
<P>
 After his loss to Louis, Sharkey retired from the ring to open a restaurant in 
Boston and pursue his love of fishing. He also refereed wrestling and boxing 
matches in the United States and Canada and entertained troops in North Africa 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Oct. 26, 1902 in Binghamton, N.Y., Sharkey began his professional boxing 
career in 1924 in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Named Joseph Paul Zukauskas by his Lithuanian immigrant parents, he changed 
his name in order to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get into the game in Boston back in the '20s, and I told them my 
name," he said in 1967 when he turned 65. "So they told me to do better than 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharkey borrowed Dempsey's first name and the last name of Tom Sharkey, 
another boxer he admired. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1929, he knocked out Loughran in the third round to win the vacant American 
heavyweight title. After knocking out Phil Scott in three rounds in Miami, 
Sharkey then fought Schmeling in 1930 in Yankee Stadium for the vacant world 
heavyweight title after Tunney had retired. 
</P>
<P>
 That time, the German won, becoming the only fighter to win the world 
heavyweight championship on a foul. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sharkey beat two top heavyweights in 1931, Mickey Walker and Carnera, and 
got another shot at the title. 
</P>
<P>
 This time Sharkey beat Schmeling on a decision in a bout that went the full 15 
rounds at the Garden Bowl in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In his next bout, on June 29, 1933, he lost the title to Carnera on a knockout 
in the sixth round. 
</P>
<P>
 He was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the oldest living heavyweight 
boxing champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharkey and his late wife, Dorothy, moved from suburban Boston to Epping, 
N.H., in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 A funeral mass was scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday at St. Joseph's Catholic 
Church in Epping, N.H. Burial was to be private.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; OFFENSIVE LINE IN TRANSITION

<P>
 Wait five minutes, and the Rams' starting lineup along the offensive line 
undoubtedly will change again. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay attention: In last week's exhibition game with New England, the starters 
from left to right were Clarence Jones, Tom Newberry, Bern Brostek, Leo Goeas 
and Darryl Ashmore. On Monday, Wayne Gandy replaced Jones and Chuck Belin took 
Newberry's spot. On Wednesday, Bill Schultz replaced Belin. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Coach Chuck Knox announced that Jones would start on the left 
side in place of Gandy who had replaced Jones. Schultz will start at left 
guard, and Jackie Slater will start at right tackle in place of Ashmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Why such an overhaul of the starting lineup? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a starting lineup," Knox said, after naming Jones, Schultz, Brostek, 
Goeas and Slater as his starters for Saturday night's game against the Raiders. 
"It's still an evaluation process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish that I could say this is sewed up. That would mean we have a pat group 
and we were satisfied with everything that is happening. But I can't say that. 
We're still searching." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Joe Kelly, who moved into the lineup last week for the Rams, will 
be playing his old teammates in this week's exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to get revenge because those players are guys I respect very 
well," Kelly said. "If Al Davis were lining up and he had on the uniform then 
obviously it would be different. I'm not going into this game all upset at Al 
Davis because there's nothing I can do to get him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't agree with what he did last year. To release me and make me a victim 
of the salary cap when there were backups on defense who made more money than 
me, just wasn't right. He could have been a man about it, too, and called me 
instead of having a guy from the newspaper call and say I was cut." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Shane Conlan rested a sore knee, but Knox said he expects him to 
play against the Raiders. Defensive end Fred Stokes (knee) and quarterback T.J. 
Rubley (arm) will miss the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes has been running daily and appears on the verge of returning to 
practice. Rubley, however, said there hasn't been significant improvement in 
his sore arm despite having rested it almost three weeks. T.J. SIMERS

BEACH VOLLEYBALL; KIRBY BEGINS QUEST FOR FIFTH CONSECUTIVE TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karolyn Kirby has proved through the years that she is the best player in 
women's pro beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old has been ranked No. 1 for the last four seasons and has won a 
record 51 tournaments with eight partners. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 feet 11 she is powerful, quick and consistent. Today in Manhattan Beach, 
Kirby will begin a quest to win her fifth consecutive World Championship title. 
</P>
<P>
 She has won the season-ending event with four partners, including her current 
one, Liz Masakayan, in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Karolyn is an exceptional athlete," said Deb Richardson, who is seeded third 
this weekend with partner Dennie Knoop. "That's why she can win with anybody 
and that's why she's at the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Masakayan, a former UCLA All-American, and Kirby have dominated the Women's 
Professional Volleyball Assn. tour for the last two seasons.  
</P>
<P>
 This year they've won 10 of 11 tour events, shutting out most of their 
opponents in the process. And in July, Kirby and Masakayan won the gold medal 
at the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia.  
</P>
<P>
 They are seeded No. 1 in the 31-team World Championships, which begin today at 
noon. The final, Sunday at 11 a.m., will be televised live on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "This event has always been way physically harder than any other," Kirby said. 
"It's always in August, so it's always hot and it's the end of the season when 
we're tired. Also, the sand is deeper than anywhere in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the third-ranked team of Gail Castro and Elaine Roque will miss the 
championships to compete in an international event in Puerto Rico, the only 
team expected to really challenge Kirby-Masakayan is second-seeded Barbra 
Fontana and Lori Kotas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana, a Manhattan Beach native, and Kotas beat Kirby-Masakayan in a 
tournament final in Myrtle Beach, S.C., in late May. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Masakayan was hospitalized because of a pelvic infection that 
prevented her from training for several days.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have no more aches and pains and my body is completely recovered," she 
said. "But I haven't really been able to work out."

TONEY MAKES SHORT WORK OF UNPREPARED BLANCO; BOXING: MIDDLEWEIGHT WINS BY 
KNOCKOUT IN SECOND ROUND AFTER OPPONENT HAS TROUBLE STAYING ON HIS FEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 With his stablemate Terry Norris looking on, middleweight Rodney Toney showed 
he soon might not be the only boxer from Campo's First Fighters Squadron to 
have a world championship belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney scored his seventh consecutive knockout by disposing of an unprepared 
Basante Blanco of San Felipe, Venezuela, with 41 seconds left in the second 
round Thursday night at the Irvine Marriott in front of 1,000 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanco (9-10) was knocked down once by Toney in the first round and twice in 
the second round before referee Larry Rozadilla stopped the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to work the jab, but I got a little excited," Toney said. "When I hit 
him, I knew he was hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Toney (16-0-2, eight knockouts) hit Blanco with a left and then a right 
uppercut that sent Blanco down. Blanco spent the rest of the fight trying to 
plant his feet. But as he threw his punches, his feet would slide out from 
beneath him. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney was so busy hitting Blanco that he didn't seem to notice his opponent's 
footing problems. A right hand to the side of Blanco's head sent him down a 
minute into the second round. Then Toney finished off Blanco with a solid right 
uppercut. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're helping me with my confidence," Toney said of his trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Sayatovich, Toney's trainer, said Toney's punches are becoming as lethal 
as those of Norris, the World Boxing Council junior middleweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to fight him," Sayatovich said. "He's too strong. We had 12 
turndowns for this fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Sayatovich said he might bring Toney back to Irvine next month before matching 
him with Quincy Taylor for Taylor's North American Boxing Federation title. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach heavyweight Dave Yonko's comeback from a six-year layoff was a 
short and controversial one. He was knocked out at the end of the second round 
by San Diego's Reginald Blackmon. Referee Fritz Werner stopped the bout as the 
bell was ringing when Yonko took about 10 punches in a row from Blackmon (4-0, 
four knockouts) in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 A frustrated Yonko (10-5) threw his mouthpiece in the middle of the ring as 
the crowd booed loudly. Yonko, who weighed 247, was a Marriott favorite back in 
the late 1980s before spending two years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightweight Ramon Franco (4-0), also a First Fighter Squadron boxer, won a 
split six-round decision over Oxnard's John Ramirez (10-6-2) despite being cut 
by a head butt in the second round.

LITTLE LEAGUE JUNIOR WORLD SERIES; THOUSAND OAKS SHOWS SPARK, 5-2; BASEBALL: 
WEST CHAMPION IMPRESSES ANDERSON WHILE ADVANCING TO CHAMPIONSHIP ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW RUDY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The home team won, as far as Manager Sparky Anderson of the Detroit Tigers was 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who lives in Thousand Oaks during the off-season, watched his team 
beat Hamilton, Ohio, 5-2, and secure a spot in the championship round of the 
Little League Junior World Series 13-and-under baseball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The California team will now wait for three teams to play off in the losers' 
bracket. The survivor must beat Thousand Oaks twice on Saturday to win the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put all your money on Thousand Oaks," Anderson said. "They got some guys who 
can play." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Howard (7-1) pitched a seven-inning complete game for Thousand Oaks, 
striking out seven and scattering five hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks opened the scoring in the bottom of the first inning when 
shortstop Matt Rogers walked and scored on right fielder Wes Munyon's double to 
right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Dully answered for Ohio with a towering solo home run to left-center in 
the top of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard broke the tie with an RBI double in a three-run third inning. He scored 
on a bloop single by third baseman Ryan Ayers. Thousand Oaks scored once more 
to take a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Jon Shepard closed out the scoring for Thousand Oaks with an RBI 
double in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did all the basic things well today," said Thousand Oaks coach Craig 
Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put the ball in play, played fundamental defense and got the key hits when 
we needed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard pitched his way out of a jam in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 After John Lanni singled and Brett Jackson reached base on an error by 
Shepard, Howard caught Danny Bradner's bunt attempt on the fly for the first 
out of the inning. He walked Tyson Stine to load the bases, then fell behind 
the next hitter, Ronnie Bicknell, three balls and no strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest thing was pitching out of the hole," Howard said. "I told myself 
not to aim it, just to throw it down the middle and let my fielders play the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The fielders didn't have to move. Howard struck out Bicknell on three more 
pitches -- two sweeping curves and a fastball low and away -- then walked Andy 
Mignery on four pitches to force in a run. Then, he struck out Phil Bell on 
three pitches -- two curves and the fastball -- to kill the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio, which had been averaging 12 runs per game in the tournament, didn't 
threaten again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't hit at the key times," said Ohio Manager Bob Jackson. "We were 
roping the ball all over the field for the first few innings, but it was right 
at somebody. If we could have gotten some hits early, maybe we could have 
rattled the pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Mignery, who pitched a complete game for Ohio, took the loss. He gave up only 
five hits, but walked six. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier said his team will take today off to rest and watch the remaining 
teams -- Ohio, New York and Mexico -- fight for a ticket out of the loser's 
bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico beat Florida, 7-3, by scoring four runs in the top of the eighth 
inning. The Latin American entry will play New York, a 7-6 winner over Canada 
in 11 innings Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of that game will play Ohio for the spot opposite Thousand Oaks in 
the final at 2 p.m. Saturday.

BULLFROGS DEFEAT RHINOS, TAKE LEAD IN PLAYOFFS; ROLLER HOCKEY: SAN JOSE GETS 
QUICK START, BUT ANAHEIM RALLIES FOR 8-5 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 Victor Gervais scored three goals and goalie Rob Laurie gave up only one 
second-half goal to lead the Bullfrogs to an 8-5 victory over the San Jose 
Rhinos in Game 1 of a Roller Hockey International playoff series in front of 
4,565 fans Thursday at San Jose Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs, who lost five of their last six regular-season games, struggled 
in the first half. But Laurie, who had 37 saves, kept them close. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one on this team has lost confidence in Robbie," Bullfrog Coach Grant 
Sonier said. "He deserves a great deal of credit for keeping us in it tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Gervais' two power-play goals in the third quarter were the first of six 
consecutive Bullfrog goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said before the game that we can't get too high if we win and we can't get 
too low if we lose," Sonier said. "Tomorrow night comes really quick." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams play Game 2 of the series at 7:30 tonight at The Pond of Anaheim. 
The Bullfrogs win the series if they win Game 2, but if San Jose wins, a 
12-minute mini-game will follow to determine the series winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, San Jose was in control early, taking a 3-0 lead early in the second 
quarter. Rhino goalie Jon Gustafson made 19 saves in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Although goals by Darren Langdon and Steve Beadle drew Anaheim within one, at 
3-2, San Jose's Cooper Naylor scored to make it 4-2 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 But only 12 seconds into the third quarter, Gervais scored on a power play to 
cut the lead to one. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we scored that goal, the intensity really picked up on the bench," 
Gervais said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gervais added another power-play goal with 2 minutes 51 seconds remaining to 
draw Anaheim even, 4-4, then Darren Perkins, who had a goal and four assists, 
blasted a slap shot past Gustafson to give the Bullfrogs a 5-4 lead with 9:51 
remaining in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Langdon, who scored only three goals in the regular season, scored his second 
of the game on a power play with 7:12 remaining and goals by Gervais and Brown 
in the final five minutes sealed the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Gervais' third goal was a short-handed goal. After reaching the right faceoff 
circle, he beat the remaining defender with a 360-degree spin before knocking 
in a backhand shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a few breaks," San Jose Coach Roy Sommer said. "But the power plays 
were the key. They converted on theirs and we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of this series advances to the Pacific Division finals to play the 
Blades-San Diego series winner.

VENTURA RACEWAY; SHUMAN CATCHES KIRBY, THEN GOES PAST WILLIAMS

 Four-time non-winged sprint car champion Ron Shuman passed defending 
California Racing Assn. champion Mike Kirby of Lomita at the finish line with 
one lap remaining in Thursday's 30-lap Sprint Car Racing Assn. feature race at 
Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman held the lead to the finish, culminating a five-lap battle for the lead 
and giving the Tempe resident the lead in the points standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman started fifth, and was content to hold his position for the first half 
of the race until a 16th-lap crash caused a 20-minute delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Rip Williams of Yorba Linda, who fell to second place with 871 points to 
Shuman's 892, ran over the back of a lapped car driven by Dale Cross of Clovis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross' car did a barrel roll, landing upright, while Williams' vehicle flipped 
end over end into the Turn 1 fence. It hung there by its nose, the tail section 
barely touching the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 It took safety crews seven minutes just to figure out how to dislodge the car 
from the fence, and another 12 minutes to clear the damaged cars from the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 After the restart, Shuman needed just four laps to move into second place, 
from where he immediately set his sights on Kirby, whose car apparently had 
been leaking water during the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman made his first attempt at Kirby on Lap 25, going for an inside pass 
between turns but fell back after pulling even. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuman mounted several challenges before finally getting the job done as the 
white flag came out.

 The field of 54 includes Jody Duclos of Moorpark and Linda Chen Olsen of 
Granada Hills, each of whom played in the U.S. Women's Amateur last week in 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Players are vying for 18 available berths over 18 holes of stroke play.The

 El Caballero, one of the most difficult courses in the region, has a par of 
72.

QUICK STUDY; SPLASH'S VALDIVIA MAKES SMOOTH TRANSITION TO INDOOR SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armando Valdivia thought he had a future in professional soccer when his 
playing days ended at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never expected his livelihood would depend on his ability to bounce 
balls -- and opponents -- off plexiglass walls in arenas throughout the 
country. Welcome to the Continental Indoor Soccer League and the Anaheim 
Splash. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia has proved a quick study to the high-paced, frenetic game. Despite 
playing indoors for only two months, the first amateur selection of the Splash 
has made the transition well enough to become a contender for the CISL 
rookie-of-the-year award. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the furthest thing from my mind," said Valdivia, 23. "I was never 
really interested in indoors at all until this year. I've watched it on TV 
before, but I never pictured myself playing it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash, for the moment, is a good fit for Valdivia, one of three former 
Northridge players on the team. Steve McKenzie and Bobby Reyes are reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 All three have had to adjust to the indoor game, with differences such as 
teams of six players rather than 11; 15-minute quarters instead of 45-minute 
halves, and a smaller ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like black and white compared to outdoors," Valdivia said. "I still have 
tons of learning to do. The touch on the ball is different; you can't really 
kick it, and you have to keep it close to you. There's a lot more individual 
defense and running nonstop." 
</P>
<P>
 Running has been a problem for Valdivia lately, though. He sprained his knee 
last week and has missed two games; the Splash embarks on a three-game eastern 
trip tonight, and the team is hopeful he can return to the lineup for an Aug. 
27 game in Las Vegas or the next night at home against Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-8, 160-pound midfielder from Ridgecrest Burroughs High has 16 goals 
and 12 assists for the Western Division-leading Splash (15-6). He has two 
game-winning goals and three game-winning assists.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some players are better suited for indoors, and I think he is," Splash Coach 
George Fernandez said. "He's got speed, skill and vision and he has a little 
bite in him -- the whole package. I believe he can be a superstar in the indoor 
game. It's just time, that's all it is." 
</P>
<P>
 And money. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-paid players in the CISL earn between $2,000 and $3,500 per month 
for a 28-game regular season that runs from June through August. Reserves fare 
even worse, making as little as $75 per game depending on playing time. 
Valdivia, who has signed a one-year contract with the Splash, declined to 
reveal his salary. 
</P>
<P>
 In the outdoor American Professional Soccer League, players can earn as much 
as $60,000 for a 20-game schedule that runs concurrently with the CISL's. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaries in Major League Soccer, the outdoor league that is scheduled to make 
its debut in April with 12 teams, are expected to be higher than any previous 
professional league in this country. Valdivia, who is living in an apartment in 
Anaheim, said he is biding his time in the CISL in hopes of attracting an offer 
from the MLS. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main goal is to get to the MLS, but I'm comfortable right now and not 
complaining at all," Valdivia said. "There are a lot of doors that will open up 
if I continue to play well. There is tremendous talent in this league. Our team 
would make a great outdoor team." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia had offers from three professional teams in Mexico after his junior 
season at Northridge in 1992, but decided to return to Northridge at the urging 
of his father and Northridge Coach Marwan Ass'ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't regret it," Valdivia said. "I stuck it out and that extra year of 
experience helped make me a better player."  
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia led the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation last fall with 20 assists 
-- ranking him second in the nation -- plus he had 17 goals for 54 points. He 
was chosen MPSF Pacific Division player of the year after leading Northridge to 
its first Division I playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia, who is still a year away from a degree in kinesiology, left school 
after last season and moved to his birthplace of Guadalajara, Mexico, to pursue 
a professional career. He trained in Guadalajara with a club team for nearly 
two months without pay and wasn't offered a contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great team and it's hard to get into," Valdivia said. "Most of those 
guys will be playing for the national team, but I arrived in the middle of the 
season so they were reluctant to sign me." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia returned to Northridge in January after receiving an invitation from 
the U.S. National "B" team. He didn't play for the team, though, after it was 
learned he is not a U.S. citizen. Valdivia moved to the United States with his 
family when he was 5 but only recently applied for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born in Mexico but I love this country and I would rather play here, 
indoor or outdoor," Valdivia said. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the Fullerton-based Salsa of the APSL came knocking. But the 
Salsa offered a two-year contract, and Valdivia, on the advice of Ass'ad, 
insisted on a one-year deal. Negotiations soon broke off. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kid is great, and the bottom line is he can do things very few players 
in the U.S. can do," Ass'ad said. "God willing, everybody is going to see it. I 
told him don't tie yourself down or it will explode on you. It's a business and 
give yourself the freedom to look around after the season ends." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash had no objection to a a single-season contract, and Valdivia's 
professional career began. His plans when the season ends?  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll sit down and talk," Valdivia said. "I love outdoor soccer, but indoor 
soccer has grown on me. I really didn't like it at first, but I've tried to 
keep an open mind about it. It's been a lot better experience than I thought."

PITCHING IN; COACHING FROM THE STANDS, DAVIS KEEPS LITTLE LEAGUERS FOCUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On name alone and because of his baseball work, this Mark Davis is often 
mistaken for that other one, the former Cy Young Award winner with the San 
Diego Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the pitchers on the Thousand Oaks team at the Little League Junior 
World Series for 13-year-olds in Taylor, Mich., there's no doubt which of the 
two is better known or appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a great pitching coach," said Kevin Howard, the team's ace 
right-hander. "He can take the little things I'm doing wrong and help me 
correct them. He is probably the best pitching coach I've had." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is not only the team's pitching coach, but also somewhat of an oddity by 
youth baseball standards.  
</P>
<P>
 He has been with the team since it started competing last month in qualifying 
tournaments and is perhaps the only coach at the World Series who has been paid 
by parents for his services. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he watches the games from the bleachers or behind outfield fences 
because Little League rules allow only the team manager and one coach on the 
field, his presence anywhere near the action sometimes is enough to spark the 
pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He keeps the guys mentally focused," said Ed Kitchen, the team manager. "He 
tells them to go after the hitters and to let whatever happens happen. . . . He 
is a tremendous help." 
</P>
<P>
 For Davis, traveling with the team is a new experience. A former pitcher at El 
Camino Real High and College of the Canyons who played in the New York Mets and 
St. Louis Cardinals minor league systems in the early '80s, Davis has made a 
living by running baseball camps and teaching privately for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his students play in Valley-area youth leagues, so when Thousand Oaks 
advanced last season to the Little League Western Regional for 11- and 
12-year-olds, some parents of players hired Davis to work with the pitchers.  
</P>
<P>
 That team was eliminated in the semifinals after beating eventual World Series 
champion, Long Beach, 16-1, in the second round, but the foundation had been 
laid. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents came to me after last season and said, 'Next year, we are going 
all the way and you are going with us,' " said Davis, who doesn't coach a team 
in the league. "This is a special situation and I enjoy doing this." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the World Series expenses for Davis and his wife Christina are being 
financed by Dean Strauser and Bill Morrow, the fathers of team members Chris 
Strauser and Zeke Morrow. Dean Strauser says Davis is an integral part of the 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a big part of the reason we are where we are today," said 
Strauser, a masonry contractor. "He relates to these kids like he is one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the money and expenses he receives are less than what he would earn 
through his coaching services, but he hardly minds.  
</P>
<P>
 Eleven of the 14 players on last year's team are playing in Michigan.  
</P>
<P>
 They pledged to win the title in the higher division this year, and Davis 
wants to see the job completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like a family," Davis said. "I like the kids and they like me." 
</P>
<P>
 And they never confuse him with that other guy by the same name. But even if 
they did, Davis said, his wife would give them her standard reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they ask me if I'm that Mark Davis, she says 'No. We don't have $18 
million,' " Davis said, laughing.

SENSE OF FAMILY LEADS MARCACCINI TO PEPPERDINE; BASKETBALL: AFTER PLAYING IN 
ITALY, SWINGMAN RETURNS TO CALIFORNIA TO BE CLOSE TO AILING FATHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Monte Marcaccini, who spurned Indiana's Bob Knight to play basketball in Italy 
last summer, has returned to California and signed to play college basketball 
at Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini, 19, The Times' Valley player of the year in 1993 while at Notre 
Dame High, said Thursday that the deciding factor was his desire to stay close 
to his ailing father. Giancarlo Marcaccini, 60, is battling lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have loved to go to Indiana," said Marcaccini, a 6-foot-6 swingman. 
"But I have a different situation than I did a year ago, with my dad being 
sick. Our whole family's real close. This is a pretty big blow. It's something 
you've got to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 His father's illness was diagnosed four months ago. Giancarlo had surgery to 
remove a lung in Paris in June. He continues to live in Paris, where he is 
undergoing radiation treatments. Monte said his father plans to return to 
Encino as soon as he is strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he gets out here as soon as he can," Monte said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini also was attracted by the new Pepperdine coaching staff, headed by 
former San Diego State Coach Tony Fuller. One of Fuller's assistants is Bob 
Mandeville, who coached lower-level basketball teams at Notre Dame High from 
1986-89. Mandeville also had assisted Fuller with the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Coach Mandeville," Marcaccini said. "The coaching staff's good guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini also has an opportunity to play right away.  
</P>
<P>
 "For my situation, I need to be somewhere where I can play right away and get 
some experience," he said. "Indiana right now probably wouldn't be the best 
place for me to develop my game. Coach Knight's got three guys at my position 
right now. I think I'd be able to play, but not as much as I want." 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, Marcaccini averaged about 25 points a game as a shooting guard for 
the Benetton United Colors, which won the junior national championship. He led 
Notre Dame to the Southern Section Division III-A championship in 1993, 
averaging 19.7 points and 11.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He signed with Indiana during the fall signing period in November 1992, 
turning down an offer from UCLA. But last August, Marcaccini left for Italy 
before the start of classes at Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Marcaccini played for an amateur team in Italy, he retained his NCAA 
eligibility.

BIG BROTHERS BLAZED TRAIL FOR NORTHRIDGE LITTLE LEAGUE STARS; BASEBALL: PLAYERS 
FROM 1967 AND 1975 WORLD SERIES TEAMS RELIVE GLORY THROUGH 1994 SQUAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once a dream comes true, can it recur? 
</P>
<P>
 It can for a select few who were part of Northridge teams that qualified for 
the Little League World Series in 1967 and 1975.  
</P>
<P>
 Several of them are following this year's 11- and 12-year-old Northridge 
all-stars, who are one victory from advancing to next week's World Series in 
Williamsport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (16-0, 4-0 in regional play) will face Hawaii (10-2, 5-1), a 5-3 
winner over Utah, tonight at 5:30 in the Western Regional final. A Northridge 
defeat would force a second game, 30 minutes after the conclusion of the first. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Little League Headquarters, Northridge would be the first league 
from the Western Region to send three teams to the World Series since it began 
in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Wold, star pitcher of the 1967 team and currently a coach in Northridge 
Little League, is a close friend of Larry Baca and George Saul, the manager and 
coach of this year's team.  
</P>
<P>
 Wold, whose father, Glen, was manager of the 1967 team, hit a game-winning 
home run against Spain and was the losing pitcher in a 1-0 loss to Linares, 
Mexico, in the '67 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending this year's games with Wold has been Bob Mitchell, coach of the 1967 
team and father of Bobby Mitchell, a Northridge player in '67 who played with 
the Dodgers and Minnesota Twins from 1980-83. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Mitchell is a minor league coach with the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 Wold will pitch batting practice to the team today because he throws a 
curveball that simulates the one they expect from the opposing pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those kids crush my fastball, but my curve gets them pretty good," Wold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting side by side at every game have been E.J. McClave and Barry Breen, 
manager and coach of the 1975 team.  
</P>
<P>
 They wear tattered red Northridge caps studded with Little League pins, and 
they loudly exhort the team by dusting off a chant-like cheer as dated as 
disco: "Here we go Northridge, here we go!" 
</P>
<P>
 Both men remain involved in youth baseball. McClave coaches his grandson in 
Westlake Village and Breen is a member of the Little League in Tehachapi. 
"These are magical moments," Breen said. "It really is a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have the home plate and three bases from our 1975 team. It's about 
time I hand them over to somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Breen has been something of a Johnny Appleseed of Little League since leaving 
Northridge more than a decade ago, having started leagues in Bedford, Tex., and 
Palm Bay, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used the Northridge bylaws as a framework to start both of those leagues," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McClave recalls his World Series team vividly, pointing out that the 
tournaments all were single elimination, including the World Series, during 
which Northridge lost its first game to eventual champion Lakewood, N.J., 2-0.  
</P>
<P>
 In district play, Northridge defeated Van Nuys-Reseda pitcher Bret Saberhagen, 
2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great year for Northridge because the kids who didn't make the 
all-star team stayed home and worked as extras in the Bad News Bears movie, 
which was shot at our field," said McClave, who carries a picture of his '75 
team, a group of mostly oversized kids with shaggy hair. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's players keep their hair closely cropped, but the differences 
probably end there. They are 14 boys remaining focused on a goal that has taken 
two months to come within one victory of achieving. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Series is the fifth tournament a team must win to become world 
champions, following district, section, division and regional play. The odds 
against one league -- especially a league from Southern California -- having 
three World Series teams are tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Southern California there are so many excellent programs that it's almost 
a fluke thing to get here," Baca said. "You've got a group of kids who have 
played together for years, then boom, you've got a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Boom is how the Northridge bats have gone; the team has outscored opponents, 
207-34.  
</P>
<P>
 A deep pitching staff is also essential, and Northridge has more than 
Nathaniel Dunlap (7-0), the 5-foot-11 right-hander who might be the nation's 
top 12-year-old hurler. Justin Gentile, a right-hander, will start tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile (4-0) allowed three hits in five shutout innings of a 10-0 victory 
over Las Vegas in the second round of the regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting in relief will be Peter Tuber, a 5-9 right-hander who is the grandson 
of late Dodger great Pete Reiser. Tuber (4-0) has allowed two hits in 11 
innings during the regional. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a second game, Dunlap will start, Baca said. Dunlap defeated Utah, 
3-1, Tuesday night and has allowed only one unearned run in eight innings 
during regional play. He has 80 strikeouts in 42 innings of all-star 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 In the pocket of Dunlap's mother, Debbie, will be her son's birth certificate, 
which proves he is indeed 12. A rumor circulating the barracks where the teams 
are staying claims Dunlap is 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of our kids' older brothers started that as a joke," Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, the Northridge players realize, it is time to get serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just play the same way we've been playing all along," said first 
baseman Matt Cassel. "That should be good enough." A Little Way 
</P>
<P>
 * Who: Northridge Little League 12-year-old all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Western Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: 5:30 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Western Regional headquarters, 6707 Little League Drive, San 
Bernardino. Take Highway 118 east to Interstate 210 east to Interstate 10 east 
to Interstate 15 north to Interstate 215 south. Exit at Palm Avenue and turn 
right. Turn left at Little League Drive.

SANDOZ TO STOP SELLING PARLODEL AS TREATMENT TO HALT LACTATION; 
PHARMACEUTICALS: COMPANY DEFENDS THE DRUG, CALLS THE MOVE 'A BUSINESS DECISION' 
IN THE FACE OF CONSUMER PRESSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Sandoz Pharmaceuticals said Thursday that it will stop selling its Parlodel 
drug for the purpose of suppressing lactose in women who have just given birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Used widely for treating symptoms of Parkinson's disease and various endocrine 
disorders, Parlodel had been blamed in consumer lawsuits for fatal strokes and 
seizures in women who took it after giving birth. 
</P>
<P>
 With pressure mounting from consumer advocates, Sandoz agreed to end sales for 
lactose suppression one day after the Food and Drug Administration said it 
would seek to withdraw approval of Parlodel for that use. 
</P>
<P>
 Parlodel will remain on the market for its other approved uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy erupted just three months after Sandoz bought Gerber Products 
Co., the nation's leading maker of baby food, for $3.7 billion. But Sandoz 
discounted speculation that its decision on Parlodel was partly due to a desire 
by the company to avoid an unfavorable reputation among the baby food-buying 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as it announced its action, Sandoz officials -- and some doctors -- 
defended Parlodel as a safe and effective treatment for pain and engorgement 
experienced by some 600,000 women each year who cannot or choose not to 
breast-feed after childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're basically doing here is making a business decision," said Larry 
Bauer, a spokesman for Sandoz Pharmaceuticals in East Hanover, N.J., a unit of 
Swiss-based Sandoz Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no scientific evidence (that Parlodel is unsafe) and there will not 
be," he said, "just as there is no causal relationship that driving a Chevy or 
a Ford (after childbirth) increases the risks of these same kind of problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians can legally prescribe any drug on the market. But given the safety 
questions with Parlodel, doctors would face a considerable liability risk if 
they continued to prescribe it for lactation suppression, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, two consumer watchdog groups, the Public Citizen Health Research 
Group and the National Women's Health Network, filed a lawsuit in federal 
appeals court in Washington, accusing the FDA of "unreasonable delay" in acting 
to block use of Parlodel for lactose suppression. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA said five years ago that lactation suppressants posed a health risk 
and asked companies to stop marketing them. Every manufacturer except Sandoz 
voluntarily pulled their drugs off the market. But consumer advocates said the 
FDA never acted -- until Wednesday -- to force Sandoz to comply with its 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Sidney Wolfe, head of the health research group of Public Citizen, said 
his group repeatedly called on the FDA to take action on Parlodel. "We finally 
decided to sue them because they don't seem to understand anything other than 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA said it is aware of 31 strokes, seven heart attacks and 63 seizures by 
women who took bromocriptine -- the generic name for Parlodel. Ten of the 
strokes and heart attacks were fatal. Another 16 patients were hospitalized for 
severe hypertension, headaches or other reactions, the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Public Citizen said its review of FDA records from 1980 through mid-1994 
showed 32 fatalities associated with the use of Parlodel. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sandoz's withdrawal of Parlodel for lactation suppression, there is no 
prescription drug available for new mothers to alleviate pain related to not 
breast-feeding.  
</P>
<P>
 "In situations like this, women have fewer choices," said Dr. Mary Lake Polan, 
chairwoman of Stanford University's gynecology and obstetrics department. 
"Parlodel is clearly (effective) and I think it's safe." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Naomi Baumslag, a professor at Georgetown University Medical School 
and an expert in breast-feeding issues, said the drug "should have been taken 
off the market in 1985. It's outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Baumslag recommended other methods for reducing discomfort from lactation, 
including binding the breasts by wearing a tight bra, ice packs, hot baths or 
certain over-the-counter pain relievers. 
</P>
<P>
 Parlodel sales for lactose suppression totaled about $12 million annually, 
Sandoz's Bauer said. The firm last year had worldwide revenue of $10.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoz recently settled lawsuits involving the drug with seven plaintiffs, 
although at least six more cases are pending. Last month, the company was 
ordered to pay $2 million to a woman who suffered a stroke while taking the 
drug.

Q & A; WHERE'S MY REBATE?; GARAMENDI WINS -- BUT DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Auto and homeowners policyholders in California could get as much as an 
additional $1 billion in rebates thanks to the California Supreme Court's 
ruling Thursday that upheld state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi's rules 
for refunds under Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you expect to get your rebate check in the mail tomorrow, you'd better 
slow down. The outcome of the court's decision is more complex than that. The 
protracted legal fight over the proposition's reforms -- and the manner in 
which Garamendi is implementing them -- may not be over. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some answers to questions about what you can expect in terms of 
rebates and what you'll pay for insurance in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many insurers have yet to pay Proposition 103-related rebates? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Thirty-five companies so far have voluntarily paid more than $800 million 
to about 7 million auto and homeowners policyholders. That still leaves some 
670 insurers in the state that have not, according to Garamendi's office. These 
include three of the state's largest insurers: Farmers, State Farm and 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's staff estimates that the combined amount of the remaining 
companies' rebate obligations is $1 billion. The industry, without being 
specific, contends the sum is considerably less. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How much might I get? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The amount, of course, varies by company and the amount of insurance each 
policyholder carried. But Proposition 103's author, Harvey Rosenfield, 
estimates rebates might average roughly $200 per insured policyholder. To date, 
the average rebates paid by some of the biggest companies have typically been 
between $100 and $300 for both auto and homeowners insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebates are payable to those with policies in California between Nov. 9, 
1988, and Nov. 8, 1989, as stipulated in Proposition 103. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So, with the court's latest decision, why aren't these insurers now putting 
rebate checks in the mail? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: The ruling itself doesn't become official for another 30 days. Meantime, 
some of the state's biggest auto insurers, including State Farm and 20th 
Century, declined to reveal their plans until they finish reviewing the 
135-page ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 But they certainly didn't rush to cut the rebate checks. Judith Mintel, a 
lawyer for State Farm -- which Garamendi has ordered to pay $235 million in 
rebates, the biggest sum in the industry -- noted that State Farm has always 
maintained it is under no such obligation and "we still believe we owe none" 
despite the latest ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century, which was the Proposition 103 test case on which the court ruled 
Thursday, said it was still "considering all available options." 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies and other insurers fighting the commissioner contend that 
Garamendi's rules amount to, among other things, an illegal confiscation of 
their assets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Doesn't 20th Century have financial problems stemming from the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, which could hamper its ability to pay the rebates even 
if it agrees to? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. The insurer is limping along with a thin reserve of cash after having 
paid $685 million in quake-related claims. Yet Garamendi has ordered 20th 
Century to pay $119 million (which includes interest) in Proposition 103 
rebates. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi told reporters Thursday that he is aware of 20th Century's struggle 
and that his office is working with the company to see "how and when they'll be 
able to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If the industry appeals Proposition 103 further, how much more time might 
elapse before I get my rebate? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It could be four or five months at the least, unless your carrier decides 
not to fight anymore and simply settles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is that likely? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Certainly Garamendi and consumer advocates hope so, even if the insurers 
aren't yet saying. The insurers could still appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, 
and Garamendi said Thursday that he had "supreme confidence" that the industry 
would somehow try to further delay payment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garamendi and Rosenfield also maintained that the state Supreme Court's 
ruling so thoroughly upheld Garamendi's rules for implementing Proposition 103 
that it will persuade the industry to settle the matter quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there any other potential delays ahead? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Voters in three months will elect a replacement for Garamendi, either 
state Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) or Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush 
(R-Cupertino), who is considered more sympathetic to the insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
 If Quackenbush is elected and junks key portions of Garamendi's rules before 
the rebates are paid, the rebates could be further delayed -- although 
Quackenbush on Thursday called on insurers to stop fighting Garamendi and start 
negotiating settlements immediately. Torres said Thursday he fully supports 
Garamendi's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A key part of Thursday's ruling also upheld Garamendi's ability to cap 
insurers' profits. Does that mean my premiums will not rise as much? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It could significantly limit how much rates will go up, assuming 
Garamendi's rules are not dramatically changed by the next insurance 
commissioner. Garamendi noted that the insurers' rate hike requests will "be 
analyzed against the most vigorous criteria" under his formula for keeping a 
lid on rates while maintaining a "fair" rate of return for the companies. 
Paying Out 
</P>
<P>

and homeowners policyholders under Proposition 103. A look at what some of the

STRONG SURGE IN TRADE UNDER NAFTA FOUND; COMMERCE: POSITIVE FIGURES ARE CLOUDED 
BY A SHARP RISE IN THE IMBALANCE WITH JAPAN. U.S. EXPORTS FOR JUNE SET A 
RECORD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Trade between the United States and Mexico continues its strong growth in the 
wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement, with southbound products 
jumping by 17% and northbound goods surging 19% in the second quarter, 
according to figures released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Improved trade with Mexico helped push overall U.S. exports in June to a 
record $58.17 billion, a 3.6% increase from May, bumping the nation's trade 
deficit down 1.6% to $9.37 billion. The rise was led by sales of aircraft and 
telecommunications and computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nation's nettlesome trade deficit with Japan worsened again, shooting 
up $1.13 billion to $5.52 billion in June, the U.S. Commerce Department said. 
That was the biggest gap since March. 
</P>
<P>
 The stepped-up traffic to Mexico was led by auto parts, telecommunications 
equipment, plastics and other products, pushing U.S. exports to $12.6 billion 
over the three months ended June 30. The 17% increase from the comparable 
period in 1993 was similar to the first-quarter gain, evidence of the impact of 
the effects of the accord, which went into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's exports to the United States grew even faster in the latest quarter, 
totaling $12.05 billion, up 19%. Mexico's exports were led by petroleum -- 
reflecting a rise in the price of crude oil -- as well as autos and 
televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade agreement seeks to do away with all trade barriers between the 
United States, Mexico and Canada over a 20-year period. And while producers of 
some products are complaining of snags and bureaucratic obstacles, there seems 
to be little doubt that NAFTA is stimulating trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade between the United States and Canada also grew, by 10% in each 
direction, according to Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who held a news 
conference to tout the North American trade figures. He called NAFTA "a 
win-win-win situation. All three countries have benefited by NAFTA." 
</P>
<P>
 The trade figures were the latest in a string of good economic news preceding 
Mexico's presidential election Sunday. The Mexican stock market has surged over 
the last month and short-term interest rates have fallen, signs of optimism 
that the elections will be orderly and that the Mexican economy will continue 
to open up and modernize. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's manufacturers are shipping more goods not only here but to the world, 
a strong sign that the country is on the verge of major economic growth if the 
elections go smoothly, said Josue Campos Campuzano, an economist at 
CIEMEX/WEFA, a Philadelphia think tank specializing in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA benefits are also being seen in U.S. border states where financial and 
legal services are gearing up for a major post-election surge in trade, said 
Fiona Sigalla, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. producers of bulk commodities, plastics, heavy machinery and 
electronic equipment are already benefiting from NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 "NAFTA is unfolding as we anticipated," said Michael Hissam, a General Motors 
spokesman based in the auto giant's El Paso regional office. "In the first six 
months of 1994, GM exported more than 4,500 cars and trucks to Mexico. That 
compares to 350 during the same period of 1993."

PRIVATE LIVES SHOULDN'T BE BOSSES' BUSINESS, WORKERS SAY; POLL: PSYCHOLOGICAL 
TESTS ARE WIDELY OPPOSED IN NATIONAL SURVEY. BUT 61% SAY EMPLOYERS RESPECT 
EMPLOYEES' PRIVACY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reflecting strong concerns about employee privacy rights, a survey released 
Thursday shows that a vast majority of workers object to psychological tests 
and other efforts by their companies to pry into their personal lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The national poll of 1,000 employees conducted by Louis Harris & Associates 
found that 69% oppose psychological exams that measure attitudes and social 
preferences, a form of testing that many employers use with job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 Also widely opposed are tests that try to gauge how much employees smoke and 
drink when they are off duty -- exams that some employers use in programs 
designed to encourage more healthful lifestyles and thereby hold down medical 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, 61% of the employees surveyed say their own employers respect their 
after-hours privacy "very well." In addition, drug testing is strongly 
supported by workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The survey suggests that employees don't want employers telling them what to 
do when they're not working, particularly when it comes to lifestyle issues," 
said John Tysse, vice president of the Labor Policy Assn., a Washington group 
representing major employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tysse called the support for drug testing a "major exception" to that pattern, 
saying employees apparently agree with their bosses that the practice improves 
safety and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The objections to employers' privacy practices were most prevalent among 
low-income and black workers. For instance, only 40% of African American 
respondents said their employers respect their off-the-job privacy well, 
compared to 61% for the entire group surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among workers from households with annual incomes below $15,000, 25% expressed 
concern that their supervisors see their medical claims before the documents 
are submitted to the company's insurer, compared to 16% for all respondents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Millions of workers fear that employers are now collecting and using health 
and lifestyle information improperly," Alan F. Westin, a Columbia University 
privacy specialist who worked on the survey, told a Washington news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an important social problem," said Robert Ellis Smith, a lawyer who 
publishes the newsletter Privacy Journal, citing the 39% of employees surveyed 
expressing some level of concern about their companies' practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really aren't many protections for workplace privacy, but the poll 
shows an expectation that it should be protected," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, he said, the survey results show the need for laws to assure 
the confidentiality of medical records as part of any national health care 
reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 One proposal, the Privacy for Consumers and Workers Act, is already under 
consideration in Congress, but it focuses mainly on the use of electronic 
surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
 Although privacy-rights advocates have recently focused on such high-tech 
concerns, the types of employer snooping objected to in the Harris survey 
continue to trigger fears. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, for instance, many employers -- worried about issues ranging 
from workplace violence to workers' compensation fraud -- have used 
psychological tests to screen job applicants. Opponents of the tests charge 
they are unreliable and often unnecessarily intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey was commissioned by the Educational Film Center of Annandale, Va., 
which produced a related documentary titled "Off Limits: Your Health, Your Job, 
Your Privacy" to be shown next week on public television. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey's margin for error is plus or minus two to three percentage points. 
Just Checking... 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four in 10 U.S. workers worry that employers are failing to respect 
their after-hours privacy, according to a study conducted by Louis Harris & 
Associates for the Educational Film Center. Among the responses: 
</P>
<P>
 * How well does your employer respect your privacy off the job? 
</P>
<P>
 Very well: 61% 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat well: 29% 
</P>
<P>
 Not very well: 8% 
</P>
<P>
 Not well at all: 3% 
</P>
<P>
 * How has your employer violated your privacy? 
</P>
<P>
 Suspected of collecting or abusing personal information: 11% 
</P>
<P>
 Collected inappropriate information about my health or lifestyle: 8% 
</P>
<P>
 Improperly disclosed medical information to co-workers: 4% 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Responses may not total 100% due to rounding and "don't know" answers; 
1,000 employees in companies with 15 or more workers were polled. Margin of 
error: two to three percentage points.

COMPUTERS WILL WATCH, TALLY MEXICAN VOTE; ELECTION: STATE-OF-THE-ART SYSTEMS 
ARE IN PLACE. BUT OPPOSITION POLITICIANS AND THE PUBLIC REMAIN SKEPTICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A computer crash has haunted President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for six 
years. It has cast doubt on the legitimacy of his administration, and now it is 
undermining confidence that Sunday's presidential election will be clean. 
</P>
<P>
 On election night, 1988, with opposition presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas in the lead, the computer counting the votes went down, taking with it 
any hope that Mexicans would believe the official polling results. Those 
results gave Salinas 50.7% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Mexican government is counting this weekend on two 
sophisticated computer systems to lend credibility to the final tally in what 
is expected to be this nation's closest presidential race in more than six 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 A $730-million computerized voter registration roll will determine who is 
allowed to vote. Another multimillion-dollar system with multiple backups will 
tally the votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If technology can guarantee clean elections, these will be," said U.S. Rep. 
Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) after a recent tour of the electoral computer 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition politicians say that's a big if. And citizens are equally 
skeptical. A recent survey by the citizens group Civic Alliance found that 63% 
of those interviewed believe ballots will be altered, ignored or switched by 
the computer system. Pollsters interviewed 4,790 Mexicans in 16 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the technological effort is impressive, from a state-of-the-art IBM 
network to remote input terminals -- similar to automated teller machines -- 
that would be the envy of most retail banks. Polaroid built a plant in 
Queretaro, 130 miles from the capital, to manufacture voter credentials with 
photos, thumbprints and even hidden bar codes. The bar code reproduces the 
information on each credential, providing an additional check on its validity. 
</P>
<P>
 The multinational corporations involved -- U.S., Japanese and French -- are 
understandably nervous about participating in such a close contest in a country 
with such a checkered electoral history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought a lot about it before deciding to participate," said Rodrigo 
Guerra, general director of IBM de Mexico. "We were exposing our reputation. We 
continue to expose it. But one cannot just work in a country on only the easy 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-year-old voter registration task demanded a system that could store 
information on more than 40 million voters in such a way that it could be 
retrieved easily, either for updating or by politicians who want to verify it. 
Said Guerra: "This would be the largest on-line data base that we had ever 
created. We were starting from nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 IBM based the system on its RS-6000, a computer that is used for everything 
from connecting suppliers to recording department store sales to university 
workstations and government offices. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, 30,000 people from the government, IBM and subcontractors were 
working on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, none of this makes for a trustworthy voter registration list in a 
country with a tradition called "the carousel." That custom entails party 
faithful registering in many precincts and spending election day driving 'round 
and 'round, voting at each of them. This time, computers are supposed to flag 
such duplication. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one of the nine political parties have approved the list, including 
the National Action Party (PAN), whose candidate was in second place in most 
polls taken last week. Based on a test with equipment that duplicates the 
government computer center, PAN officials have said they believe the list is 
more than 95% reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the single holdout -- the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD), whose 
presidential candidate is Cardenas -- has raised embarrassing questions. For 
example, the PRD has found dozens of people listed at the same nonexistent 
addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Once voters signed up, government officials went to great lengths to get them 
their credentials. Villagers in Ibarra, deep in the Chiapas jungle, had to walk 
15 hours to the nearest polling place in the midterm elections three years ago. 
This time, their voter credentials were delivered to the village months ago -- 
making it easier than the voting itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high-tech voter list and sophisticated credentials, balloting 
itself will not be computerized. Voters will mark their choice by hand, fold 
the ballot and drop it into a plastic box -- a clear one so that everyone can 
see that the box was not stuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology does not reappear until the polls close and it comes time to tally 
the votes. This has traditionally been the period of "alchemy," when votes for 
the opposition are spun into votes for the ruling party, like lead into gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays in reporting from rural areas, traditional PRI strongholds, often raise 
suspicions. "Mexico is not Belgium," said one election official. "We have 
telecommunications problems."

 'Hot Zone' Production Shut down: Director Ridley Scott announced that his 
company, RCS/PMP Films, was suspending production of "Crisis in the Hot Zone," 
a $55-million movie about a deadly virus outbreak.The decision came less than a 
week after actor Robert Redford dropped out of the leading role. Scott said the 
production was forced to shut down because 20th Century Fox, "among other 
things, will not honor its contractual obligation to approve available cast." 
Fox could not be reached for comment.

 Unocal Acquires 5% Interest in Pacific Pipeline Systems Inc.: Los 
Angeles-based Unocal said it acquired a stake in the California-based public 
utility, which plans to build a $145-million oil pipeline in Southern 
California from Denver-based Anschutz Cos. Unocal will contribute a total of 
$27 million for engineering, permit and construction costs of the pipeline, 
which will daily carry 130,000 barrels of crude oil 130 miles, from the 
southern San Joaquin Valley to refineries in the Los Angeles Basin.In return, 
Unocal will receive a 10-cents-a-barrel price break on its first 20,000 barrels 
each day. Between reduced transportation costs and its 5% share of the revenue 
from users of the pipeline, the company expects pretax savings of $14.4 million 
a year, said Barry Lane, a spokesman for Unocal.

 Delta-Virgin Atlantic Deal Totters: Four months after Delta Air Lines and 
Virgin Atlantic Airways announced a partnership that would give Delta access to 
London's Heathrow Airport, the two are preparing to abandon linked flights. 
Delta does not have the right to fly passengers there and had hoped to get 
around that by buying blocks of seats on Virgin flights and selling them as 
Delta tickets.The arrangement depended on code sharing, which allows airlines 
to link flights by computer but which also requires U.S. government approval. 
The U.S. Department of Transportation has not given it, blaming Britain's 
refusal to talk seriously about liberalizing air relations. Virgin Atlantic 
said the two airlines intend to proceed with parts of the agreement involving 
merged frequent-flier programs and shared terminal space.

 Euro Disney Says Restructuring Is Complete: The operator of the theme park 
outside Paris said it finished the financial restructuring by paying off part 
of its mammoth debt from the proceeds of a recent capital increase.The 
$1.09-billion payment was the hinge for a complex restructuring package mapped 
out between Euro Disney, parent Walt Disney Co. and bankers. The park also 
announced the departure of its finance director, Michael Montgomery. A company 
source said Montgomery, much respected among industry analysts for his handling 
of the restructuring, had wished to resign to "pursue other opportunities."

PRUDENTIAL'S MORTGAGE ARM CUTS STAFF 23%; LENDING: THE LAYOFFS ARE ATTRIBUTED 
TO A DROP-OFF IN DEMAND AS INTEREST RATES HAVE RISEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing an increasingly sluggish market for its home loans, Prudential Home 
Mortgage Co. is laying off 23% of its work force, or nearly 900 people 
nationwide, including more than 100 at its loan-processing center in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, a subsidiary of Prudential Insurance Co. in Newark, N.J., had 
told employees at its four processing centers last month that staff reductions 
were coming and would be completed by the end of August. Most of those cuts 
were made Thursday, said William Campbell, a spokesman for the Clayton, 
Mo.-based subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage lenders across the country have seen their business decline in recent 
months as interest rates have inched up. An increase in demand for fixed-rate 
mortgages has not made up for a sharp drop in refinancings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simply a matter that the demand has fallen off dramatically in the 
mortgage industry," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential Home Mortgage now has about 2,960 workers nationwide, down from 
3,830 in July, Campbell said.  
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs announced Thursday were at loan centers and other Prudential 
facilities in New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Minnesota as well as 
California, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who have their mortgages through Prudential will not be affected by 
the layoffs, Campbell said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Their loans will still be serviced on a timely basis -- it won't make any 
difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff cuts in the past 10 days at the Costa Mesa facility have reduced 
Prudential's staff there to 82 people from 186 a month ago, Campbell said.  
</P>
<P>
 The company had already laid off 57 people in Costa Mesa earlier this year as 
part of a 12% nationwide work force reduction that involved 600 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell emphasized that the company is not shutting down its Costa Mesa loan 
facility, which serves the western United States, primarily California. 
However, Prudential will move to smaller quarters, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa cuts include a few management personnel but mostly affect loan 
officers and underwriters, Campbell said.  
</P>
<P>
 The layoffs came with four weeks' notice and a severance package that includes 
health care benefits, outplacement services and a continuation of benefits for 
a limited period, he said.

BORDEN'S DAIRY BUSINESS MAY BE OFFERED FOR SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Borden Inc., continuing yet another restructuring, may be considering selling 
its $1.3-billion dairy business, but analysts were asking, "Who would buy it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Borden declined to comment Thursday on a Wall Street Journal report that it 
may sell or shut down its struggling dairy division under increasing pressure 
from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden's dairy business -- which includes milk, cheese and ice cream -- posted 
a loss of $35 million for 1993, and analysts estimate it lost another $30 
million in the first half of 1994, the Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
 Argus Research analyst Terry Bivens estimated that the dairy division lost $25 
million during the first half and that, although it accounted for 20% of 
Borden's $5.5 billion in sales last year, yielded only about 2.5% of operating 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Fahnestock & Co.'s Allan Roness said, however, that Borden might be able to 
break up its dairy operations and sell them to regional dairies.

CAFETERIA JOBS LOOM AS ISSUE FOR DISNEYLAND; LABOR: THE UNION SAYS 100 MEMBERS 
COULD LOSE WORK TO SUBCONTRACTORS. MANAGEMENT CONCEDES THAT BIDS HAVE BEEN 
SOUGHT.

 The union that represents more than 700 food service workers at Disneyland, 
signaling acrimonious labor negotiations ahead, has mounted a campaign against 
what it says are company plans to subcontract out work. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union Local 681 has sent letters of appeal to 
state officials and distributed leaflets at the park, saying Disneyland has 
decided to farm out service work in the employees' cafeteria. Such a move, the 
union says, would cost its members 100 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney management is on an aggressive campaign to subcontract good union 
jobs," states the letter, signed by more than 200 union members and sent to 
Gov. Pete Wilson and others. "The net effect will be to turn good jobs, with 
full health benefits, into minimum-wage, part-time and temporary employment." 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said that there has been no decision on 
subcontracting, though he confirmed that the company has asked for bids from 
food service operators. "I don't expect it will happen at all in the near 
term," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some food vendors, though, said their understanding was that the work at 
Disneyland would begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Gambrell, director of marketing and sales at the Los Angeles office of 
Canteen Corp., said his firm put in a bid earlier this summer. "We expected to 
hear by now," he said. He would not reveal the value of the contract, but said: 
"Believe me, it would be great." 
</P>
<P>
 The union maintains that Disneyland is weighing the "outsourcing" plan as a 
way of reducing labor costs significantly. Most union food service employees of 
the park make between $9.15 and $11.05 an hour and some earn as much as $15 an 
hour, said Angela Keefe, president of Local 681, which is based in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland's McClintock would say only that "we're always looking at ways to 
make business more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Some union members also say that part of Disneyland's motivation is to reduce 
the risk of running afoul of immigration laws. If food services went to 
subcontractors, then they, not Disneyland, would be responsible for the hiring. 
In April, Disneyland agreed to pay $260,000 to settle allegations of poor 
record-keeping that violated federal laws about hiring immigrants.

 Sony Corp. Reports Profit Slump: The Japanese electronics maker and 
entertainment conglomerate said net earnings for its fiscal first quarter were 
off 49% from the comparable period a year earlier.It blamed the weak Japanese 
economy and the yen's appreciation against the U.S. dollar. Sony said it earned 
roughly $39 million in the quarter and that sales rose 4.3%, to about $8.65 
billion. The yen has gained about 12% against the dollar this year, so the yen 
value of profits earned in the United States, Sony's biggest market, has been 
reduced.

 United Artists Nearing a Deal With Showscan: The nation's largest theater 
chain is close to an agreement with Culver City-based Showscan Corp. on 
installing computer-controlled seats in 10 theater multiplexes over the next 
five years. Details of the deal with United Artists Theatre Circuit Inc., 
valued at about $20 million, should be worked out within days, a Showscan 
spokeswoman said.The theater seats can be programmed to pitch and roll along 
with specially projected images so that moviegoers feel the motion of riding in 
a race car, airplane or roller coaster. The technology has been used nationwide 
in theme parks, with rides such as "Back to the Future" at Universal Studios 
Hollywood and "Star Tours" at Disneyland. The United Artists contract would be 
the first for installing so-called ride films in theater complexes.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; NEW INFLATION FEARS JOLT INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Renewed inflation fears and a weak dollar sent bond yields up and stock prices 
lower Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond jumped to 7.48% from 7.40% 
on Wednesday. The yield had plunged as low as 7.36% on Tuesday, after the 
Federal Reserve Board raised short-term interest rates in an attempt to slow 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Following bond prices, the Dow industrial average slid 21.05 points to 
3,755.43 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Triggering the day's rebound in long-term interest rates, and the stock 
market's selloff, was a Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank report on regional 
manufacturing conditions that resurrected worries of inflationary growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly troubling in the report was a sharp jump in what 
Philadelphia-area manufacturers said they paid for commodities and other raw 
materials. The latest survey showed prices paid were at a five-year high, the 
Fed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that figure, taken with other indicators in the report, could 
signal that the economy remains strong enough to fuel inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia survey stoked fears that the Fed's latest half-point hike in 
short-term interest rates won't be enough to curb inflation. Some analysts 
concluded that the central bank will have to tighten credit again, possibly as 
soon as its September meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional Fed survey covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and 
Delaware, but many economists consider it a harbinger of broader economic 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mead Briggs, head of risk trading at Deutsche Bank Government Securities, said 
the report was a catalyst for Wall Street traders to sell stocks and bonds 
purchased two days earlier, following the Fed's rate hike.

 With investors afraid of inflation eroding the value of fixed-income 
securities, traders shed hopes that new buyers would emerge to snap up the 
bonds they bought Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of active professional traders bought up the market, anticipating that 
small investors would buy because there would be no Fed action for three 
months. But they got a party all together and nobody came," Briggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, foreign investors were discouraged Thursday by a renewed plunge 
in the dollar against the Japanese yen. A falling dollar reduces the value of 
dollar-denominated investments such as U.S. government bonds held by 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar appeared to be responding to news that Japan's trade surplus with 
the United States surged in June. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar plunged nearly 2 Japanese yen to 98.58, from 100.18 on 
Wednesday. It was the dollar's lowest rate against the yen since July 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar also slipped against the German mark, closing at 1.543 marks, down 
from 1.552. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, most stock indexes closed modestly lower. In the broad market, 
declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 13 to 9 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The expectation of still-higher interest rates sent economically sensitive 
stocks lower. Among auto makers, Ford fell 1 1/8 to 29 1/2, Chrysler slid 1 1/8 
to 47 1/4 and General Motors lost 1 1/8 to 49 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Other losers included Boeing, down 1 to 45 1/8; Caterpillar, down 1 7/8 to 107 
7/8, and Hercules, off 2 5/8 to 101 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the upside, gold-mining stocks gained as the metal's price rose, helped 
by inflation jitters. American Barrick gained 1/2 to 22 1/4, Echo Bay rose 1/8 
to 11 1/8 and Pegasus Gold advanced 3/4 to 14 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology issues were mixed, as IBM jumped 1 3/8 to 66 1/4. Merrill Lynch 
analyst Daniel Mandresh raised his estimate of IBM's 1994 earnings from $4 a 
share to $4.25 and retained his "above average buy" recommendation on IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other tech issues, Digital Equipment rose 5/8 to 21 3/4 and 
Hewlett-Packard advanced 1/4 to 87 3/8. But Apple fell 1/4 to 34 3/4, Cisco 
Systems was down 1/2 at 23 1/2, and Dell Computer fell 1 1/8 to 34 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many packaged food stocks surged on renewed takeover talk. Quaker Oats 
rocketed 5 7/8 to 82, General Mills jumped 1 5/8 to 55 3/8 and Kellogg leaped 2 
1/8 to 56 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo stocks advanced, with the 225-share Nikkei average up 38.21 
points at 20,862.77. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average closed down 8.73 points at 2,153.56 and 
London's FTSE-100 index eased 7.7 points to 3,182.6. In Mexico City, the Bolsa 
index closed down 1.41 points at 2,698.24.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: PARAMOUNT FUND REOPENS -- WITH COMMODITIES SLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Sams may be one of the sharpest "value" stock players of his day, but he 
admits he's hard-pressed to explain exactly what constitutes value and what 
doesn't. It is, he says, mostly a case of "you know it when you see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for his shareholders in the FPA Paramount stock mutual fund, Sams has 
spotted true value enough over the past decade to place Paramount in the 
highest echelon of stock funds -- even garnering it a spot on the super-elite 
1994 Forbes magazine Honor Roll of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet since 1989, potential investors have been politely turned away; Sams has 
shunned the limelight and barred new clients from the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week. In a surprise switch, Sams agreed to reopen Paramount, a move 
he admits took some of his current clients aback. The decision could help boost 
the fortunes of the small but highly respected FPA (First Pacific Advisors) 
fund family, which is based in West Los Angeles and owned by United Asset 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this week about $6 million has trickled into the now-$360-million-asset 
Paramount, which has an upfront sales charge as high as 6.5% -- no doubt too 
high for many investors' taste. Sams, a plain-spoken 57-year-old based in 
Dallas, says the low-key response to the reopening suits him fine. He has 
already said that the fund will close again if assets reach $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always run money with the attitude that the smaller the amount, the 
better," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then why reopen Paramount at all? Despite what many Wall Streeters describe as 
a fairly valued or overvalued stock market that is primed for trouble, Sams 
still senses opportunity in one controversial market sector: commodity plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's portfolio is overwhelmingly dominated by stocks of companies in 
the metal, paper, and energy businesses, names such as Kaiser Aluminum, Boise 
Cascade and Occidental Petroleum. Sams sees no good reason to abandon most of 
them, even though their share prices have been bid up significantly over the 
past year, and even though the conventional wisdom is that the U.S. economy 
will soon slow markedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board, Sams concedes, didn't do him any favors by raising 
interest rates again on Tuesday. His stocks, he says, may have a rough couple 
of quarters ahead if more investors fear that the U.S. economy will weaken and 
with it commodity producers' pricing power. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the commodity stocks dive, Sams says, he'll just buy more. He looks at 
the momentum building in the world economy, and at the burgeoning demand for 
basic materials in such fast-growth countries as China and India, and concludes 
that the decade-long deflationary cycle in commodities has broken. Prices are 
going up, Sams says, and as with the downside, "these (up) cycles always last 
longer than most people think." 
</P>
<P>
 If Sams has proven anything in his long career with FPA, it's that he 
understands market cycles. In the 15 years through 1993, Paramount's return was 
1,030%, versus 788% for the average stock fund, according to Lipper Analytical 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 For eight of the last 12 years, including this year, Paramount has 
outperformed its average peer fund in the growth-and-income category. For his 
efforts, Sams' fund is one of only 20 on Forbes' 1994 Honor Roll, the annual 
list of funds that have proved their mettle in good markets and bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wall Street would call him a "value" player -- someone who hunts 
stocks selling cheap relative to asset-value -- Sams' true talents seem to be 
old-fashioned intuitive stock picking and savvy day-to-day trading. He 
generally buys what other people don't want, or companies whose true potential 
isn't well understood. 
</P>
<P>
 That still describes many commodity companies, he says -- firms such as nickel 
miner Inco, energy firm Coastal Corp., and Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold. 
Sams concedes he doesn't rely heavily on earnings projections for these 
companies, but on his own sense that their businesses are turning, and that 
most investors haven't yet caught on. 
</P>
<P>
 He is, he says, often too early with the stocks he likes. He's sitting now 
with Champion International, a wood and paper company whose stock has 
disappointed Wall Street for most of the past 15 years. "It's one of the few 
paper companies that never got restructured," Sams says. He figures something, 
eventually, will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point, Sams says, it will be time to sell most commodity stocks and 
move on to other issues. He has begun to nibble in the consumer area, buying 
troubled Woolworth, for example. But for the most part Paramount is a commodity 
bet, and that probably won't change soon, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most portfolio managers hate to buy these kinds of companies," Sams says. 
He's betting that before this cycle is over, that will have changed. Paramount 
Performance

fund in eight of the last 12 years. 03,07,26,10 Total investment return: Year

LITTON WILL ACQUIRE TELEDYNE'S TWO ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS UNITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a deal that would further consolidate Southern California's defense 
industry, Litton Industries Inc. said Thursday that it will acquire Teledyne 
Inc.'s Electronic Systems operations in Northridge and Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills-based Litton said the deal includes the business operations and 
equipment of the two units but not the real estate, raising the prospect that 
some of the 1,200 Teledyne employees involved will be transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the deal, which is subject to approval by both companies' boards of 
directors and government regulators, were not disclosed. The sale is expected 
to close by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Teledyne plants manufacture airborne computers, radar and 
communication systems, "friend or foe" identification systems, and other 
devices for the defense industry, with revenue expected to exceed $150 million 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies said the transaction would enhance their competitive positions. 
The Teledyne units' customer base "is similar to Litton's, the technologies are 
complimentary, and we would gain a large new base of installed equipment 
worldwide," said John M. Leonis, chief executive of Litton. 
</P>
<P>
 Litton executives said most of the Teledyne workers at the two plants will be 
kept on, but they did did not rule out a relocation. "There is capacity in 
existing Litton buildings to handle the increase in business," said Robert 
Knapp, a Litton spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely destination for relocated workers would be Salt Lake City, 
site of Litton's primary manufacturing operation.

PHILADELPHIA FED REGIONAL SURVEY SHOWS GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said Thursday that its index of 
regional business activity rose in August but that it included some signs that 
manufacturing growth was occurring at a slower pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Fed's diffusion index for overall business activity for the 
month rose to 13.9 in August, up from 11.3 the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 But a slip in new orders and measures showing no employment increases indicate 
that the growth might be less robust than in previous months, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also showed that the percentage of firms reporting having paid 
higher prices for supplies in August rose sharply to its highest level in more 
than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a quarter of the companies surveyed said they had raised prices on 
goods they manufactured. Only 3% said they had lowered prices. 
</P>
<P>
 In their forecasts for the next six months, two-thirds of the manufacturers 
surveyed said they expect to pay more for their raw materials. Almost half said 
they expect to raise prices on their own manufactured goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch economist Bill Kan called the rise in price components 
troubling, adding that the trend could show up in the government's consumer 
price index in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hoey, chief economist with Dreyfus Corp., said the increase in the 
regional price index supports the position of policy-makers worried about 
inflation and, to a lesser extent, the Federal Reserve Board's recent rate 
increases. (The Fed raised interest rates this week for the fifth time this 
year.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another leading indicator of the price momentum in the system and is 
part of a broader pattern we should all be paying attention to," agreed 
economist H. Erich Heinemann of Ladenburg Thalmann.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; SHAYE, NEW LINE CINEMA HIT BIG TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ted Turner was negotiating to buy New Line Cinema during a meeting at his 
home last year, Chairman Robert Shaye made a surprising confession. Inside the 
frugal, conservative-minded executive lurked a big-time movie maker just 
longing to break free. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-budget series like "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and "Nightmare on Elm 
Street" were fine, the New Line chief said in so many words. But he wanted to 
also work with Julia and Geena and Renny and Marlon. "It was the one piece of 
our product puzzle still missing," Shaye explained. "And it was what I wanted 
to do with my life. Ted was OK with that." 
</P>
<P>
 He'd better be. In the eight months since Turner Broadcasting System acquired 
New Line for $550 million, Shaye has embarked on the kind of spending spree 
usually reserved for lottery winners and giddy divorcees. Julia Roberts, Jim 
Carrey, Demi Moore, Meg Ryan and Marlon Brando have all joined the "Ninja 
Turtles" in the New Line swamp. More recently, Shaye made a record-setting, 
$4-million deal for screenwriter Shane Black's latest script, "The Long Kiss 
Goodnight," which is earmarked for director Renny Harlin and his wife, actress 
Geena Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of profligacy always turns heads in Hollywood, since it intensifies 
competition and can lead to spectacular financial flameouts. But while Shaye, 
55, concedes that his annual development and production spending has grown by 
"tens of millions of dollars" in the wake of the Turner sale, he insists that 
New Line remains true to its sensible past. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make three to four higher-budgeted films a year," he said in an 
interview this week. "But there's still a finite amount of capital available, 
and we're still accountable to our partners." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shaye's confidence in his own choices has been bolstered by the success of 
"The Mask," the $20-million Carrey comedy that has grossed more than $70 
million in its first three weeks. With the movie expected to surpass $100 
million at the domestic box office alone, criticism of New Line's $7-million 
deal for Carrey to star in "Dumb and Dumber" is fading. 
</P>
<P>
 By putting New Line into the big-league movie business, Shaye has dramatically 
altered the profile of the 27-year-old independent, New York-based production 
and distribution company that made its reputation on niche films such as "Ninja 
Turtles" and others less memorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaye and New Line President Michael Lynne won big fans on Wall Street for 
their cautious, steady management style, earning reputations as "terrific 
corporate citizens," in the words of analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of the Seidler 
Cos. But Shaye says they also boxed themselves in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the healthy performance of New Line's stock, "there was always 
pressure to stick to our knitting," Shaye says. "Plus, we were restricted (on 
the kinds of films we made) by loan covenants. It was kind of onerous, but we 
accepted it because that was our persona." 
</P>
<P>
 The Turner deal unshackles Shaye and allows him to fill his distribution 
pipeline with a wider variety of movies. It also makes it possible for the 
company to expand production to as many as 15 films a year, not counting movies 
from its Fine Line subsidiary and other pickups. Shaye hopes to add even more 
movies to that pipeline after 1997, when Sony's distribution deal with Castle 
Rock Entertainment, the other entertainment company acquired by Turner in 
January, expires. But Shaye said nothing has been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner is said to be honoring his hands-off agreement. Despite outside 
criticism that Shaye is acting like the proverbial kid in the candy store, the 
closest the cable mogul gets to New Line's spending is when his board approves 
the company's annual budget. Shaye says Turner was proud that New Line beat 
Warner Bros. and Columbia Pictures in the $4-million bidding war for "The Long 
Kiss Goodnight." 
</P>
<P>
 Another big New Line project -- "The Women," starring Roberts and Ryan -- was 
literally a gift from Turner. The cable mogul gave New Line the project, a 
remake of an MGM film in the Turner library, as a thank-you for the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaye also likes to point out that he still has more than a passing interest 
in New Line's performance, since his money from the sale of the company is in 
Turner stock. The proxy statement filed in the wake of the sale showed that 
Shaye received more than 3% of Class B Turner stock, which was valued at $86.9 
million at the time. In addition, Shaye got an annual base salary of $1.5 
million and a $750,000 home loan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his big financial score, Shaye, a lawyer by training who met his wife 
while he was on a Fulbright scholarship in Sweden, still acts the part of the 
consummate Hollywood outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls New York home, even though he spends more than half his time in Los 
Angeles now, says he'd rather read scripts at night than attend Hollywood 
parties and still drives a 1972 Oldsmobile convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he hasn't traded up, Shaye responds with a shrug, "I guess it's 
because it has a big front seat." 
</P>
<P>
 Outsider that he is, Shaye has always been openly disdainful of Hollywood's 
old-boys network of major studios. He blames much of the criticism of New Line 
on petty jealousy. "We're not gnats biting on a big white bull, we're real 
competitors," Shaye said. "And I don't think they like to see people vie for 
the talent they think they ought to control." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, Shaye says he considers himself more of an "entertainer" than a 
traditional businessman. He indulged his longtime interest in directing with 
the 1990 coming-of-age movie "Book of Love." And his contract with Turner 
contains an unusual provision that guarantees Shaye the right to direct at 
least two more movies in the $25-million range. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics and admirers alike will find out soon enough if Shaye's strategy makes 
sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides "Dumb and Dumber," next year brings "Don Juan de Marco and the 
Centerfold," starring Brando, Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway; "My Family," 
starring Edward James Olmos; and "Mortal Kombat," based on the popular video 
game. The stakes get even higher in 1996 with "The Long Kiss Goodnight," "The 
Women," "The Mask II," "Gaslight Addition" starring Demi Moore and an ambitious 
feature based on the TV series "Lost in Space." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome, producer Steve Tisch, who has a deal at New Line, says 
Shaye has succeeded on one front.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's made himself a competitor," Tisch said. "Invited or uninvited, he's 
playing at the table with the big boys."

COMPANY TOWN; SPECULATION IS REKINDLED THAT VIACOM, BLOCKBUSTER MAY MERGE; 
ENTERTAINMENT: BUT EXECUTIVE SAYS BLOCKBUSTER CHAIRMAN WAS MISQUOTED IN SAYING 
THAT DEAL LOOKS LIKE IT WILL GO THROUGH. 
</P>

<P>
 The merger between entertainment giants Viacom Inc. and Blockbuster 
Entertainment, once abandoned as a near-dead deal with only the slimmest 
prospects of revival, could be coming back to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Announced in January in the heat of the takeover battle for Paramount 
Communications, the $8.4-billion stock swap merger between Viacom and 
Blockbuster lost momentum as the value of Viacom's Class B shares slipped. In 
recent months, however, Viacom's stock has rebounded, fueling hope that the 
parties may be able to return to the table to forge a definitive agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation that the merger discussions might be back on track began Thursday, 
when a Miami Herald sports reporter quoted Blockbuster Chairman H. Wayne 
Huizenga as saying that "it looks like the Viacom deal is going to go through." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Viacom and Blockbuster declined to comment on the remark. But a 
Blockbuster executive privately denied that Huizenga made the statement, saying 
he was misquoted by the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expressed surprise that Huizenga would have tipped his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of surprised he made the statement," said Jeffrey Logsden, an 
analyst with The Cos. in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Viacom guys on Monday during their conference call took great pains not 
to make any statements because of SEC rules . . . but stranger things have 
happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Logsden said that as Viacom's stock continues to climb, it 
appears increasingly possible that the merger deal could be back on track. The 
merger agreement is scheduled to expire at the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a stronger possibility today that the prices of (Viacom's 
and Blockbuster's) securities are going to get within touching distance of the 
prices they previously agreed to in order to do the transaction," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Logsden said he thinks that Viacom's stock needs to recover to about $38 a 
share for the deal to be revived. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster's stock was about $29 a share when the merger agreement was 
announced earlier this year. Viacom traded at about $41 a share and then 
plunged as low as $21.75 before rebounding. On Thursday, Viacom closed at 
$35.75 on the American Stock Exchange, down 12.5 cents. Blockbuster fell 50 
cents to $27.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Music: The Atlantic Group hopes to boost its U.S. market share almost 2% after 
the ink dries on a new distribution pact with Curb Records, home to such 
country stars as Lyle Lovett, Wynonna Judd and current chart-topper Tim McGraw. 
The five-year agreement, which takes effect in January, was crafted and signed 
this week by the most unlikely of political partners: Mike Curb, a staunch 
Republican who once served as California lieutenant governor, and liberal 
Democrat Danny Goldberg, president of Atlantic Records and former head of the 
Los Angeles chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.Curb's hot Nashville 
label has generated more than $25 million in U.S. record sales so far this 
year, but he joins the Warner Music family dogged by unresolved disputes with 
his last two distributors, MCA Entertainment and EMI Music -- the latter of 
which filed a lawsuit against him this month. Atlantic's venture with Curb -- 
which will include a new label called Curb AG -- marks the latest in a series 
of pacts with promising independent labels, including Matador, Mammoth and 
Rhino Records. CHUCK PHILIPS

COMPANY TOWN; HOUSE TO WEIGH TICKET VENDOR LAW

<P>
 Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), the powerful chairman of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, was expected to introduce today a bill to require 
distributors of tickets to shows, concerts and sporting events to disclose the 
fees they add to the price of each ticket. The legislation would mark the first 
federal regulation of ticket distribution.It would place transactions conducted 
by Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster and other such vendors under the purview of 
the Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department has been investigating reports of anti-competitive 
practices in the industry since the Seattle rock band Pearl Jam filed a 
complaint May 6. Pearl Jam accused Ticketmaster of using its influence with 
concert promoters to thwart the group's plan for a low-priced tour this summer. 
Ticketmaster has denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell became interested in the issue after members of Pearl Jam testified 
June 30 in a House Government Operations subcommittee inquiry into the 
$1-billion U.S. concert industry. A California congressman, Rep. Gary A. Condit 
(D-Ceres), chaired that hearing and is a co-sponsor of Dingell's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee hearings on the proposed legislation are expected to take place in 
the fall. CHUCK PHILIPS

 As Bertelsmann Music Group continues its long search for a North American CEO 
to oversee its film, cable and music divisions, which include the RCA, Zoo and 
Imago record labels, industry speculation is increasing over the future role of 
current RCA President Joe Galante. Galante, who just signed a new BMG contract, 
headed RCA's Nashville division before moving to New York to head the entire 
label.He is rumored to be returning to Nashville to revive the slumping 
division, subsequently leaving a vacancy at the top of RCA. Industry eyes are 
keeping a close watch on BMG Chief Executive Michael Dornemann's next move.

TOO COOL FOR COFFEE?; RELAX. WITH ROOMS POPPING UP ALMOST EVERY MONTH, TEA IS 
HOT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In their search for the Next Big Thing, Southern Californians have been prone 
to designer water, overpriced pizza and wireless communication. 
</P>
<P>
 But this Next Big Thing is something even grandma could cozy up to: 
</P>
<P>
 Tea. 
</P>
<P>
 It's warm, nutritious and mellow -- we know. But sipping a steaming pekoe is 
also as de rigueur these days as downing a double-caffeinated cappuccino. Chado 
Tea Room in West Hollywood, for one, is open till midnight on Fridays and 
Saturdays, serves up four-speaker sound and encourages patrons to "invite 
someone dangerous to tea." 
</P>
<P>
 Laid-back tea-serving establishments are cropping up in Southern California at 
the rate of roughly one per month -- perhaps as part of a health kick that 
prompted the popularity of coffee in lieu of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who frequent the 60 or so tea spots in Southern California are, 
in fact, caffeine refugees: Tea has less than half the caffeine and calories as 
coffee. "Coffee people are more aggressive," says Melissa Robke, a 35-year-old 
tea-room regular who drinks both beverages. "Tea people are more refined." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest wave of tea-sipping spots differ noticeably from Southern 
California's longstanding high-tea salons, where women are ladies, men are 
gentlemen and biscuits are scones: They're artsy hang-outs for the lunch, 
dinner and early-evening crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Chado owner Suity Liongosari, in baby-doll jumper and low-cut combat boots, 
says her small, 2-year-old room on West 3rd Street "is almost like a coffee 
shop." 
</P>
<P>
 At Frills, a combination thrift store and tearoom in Monrovia (and soon in 
Temecula, too) customers are encouraged to play dress-up with hats and feather 
boas. "The occasional gentleman who wanders in seems to like that, too," a 
store manager insists. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the continent, customers of 6-month-old T in New York's SoHo District 
can get sushi with their tea, pastries with tea cream and even chicken infused 
with tea. "It's like a tea galaxy," a worker says. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend has blessed coffeehouses that serve tea, as well as a few 
traditional salons. At Tea and Sympathy in Costa Mesa, where formal, afternoon 
tea has been served for 15 years, sales are up 25% over 1992. "Tea's becoming 
an 'in' thing to do," owner Nancy Williams declares. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon is a long way from the day in 2737 BC when a Chinese emperor 
discovered the drink. A breeze tossed a few tea leaves into his cup of hot 
water, according to legend. The English discovered tea around 1615 and 
monopolized the market. That angered the Colonies in America, especially when 
the British gained sole access to burgeoning Colonial tea sales through the Tea 
Act of 1773. 
</P>
<P>
 What followed might have changed America's drinking habits for the next two 
centuries: The Boston Tea Party -- a revolt that had the locals dumping British 
tea into Boston Harbor. Shortly after that, the Declaration of Independence was 
signed and tea was relegated as a bastard beverage -- save for the ever-popular 
iced variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, tea is the most popular beverage in the world -- drink of choice 
to half its population. And it's the cheapest beverage around, next to water. 
</P>
<P>
 Tea, both hot and iced, comes from the leaves of the tea plant, taxonomically 
known as Camellia sinensis . The plant produces three basic kinds of tea: black 
(fermented and full-flavored), oolong (semi-fermented and slightly bitter) and 
green (unfermented and also slightly bitter). There's also herbal tea (actually 
herbs brewed like tea). And gourmet blends of tea include everything from 
paprika to popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Chado offers 250 gourmet blends -- including rhubarb iced tea for summer -- 
straight out of brown canisters on a mahogany wall rack. "It's like wine," 
owner Liongosari says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly. Even the best tea is relatively cheap. Take a blend favored by 
the Queen of England that was once featured at Chado. It retailed for $11 a dry 
ounce -- enough to make almost four pots. And tea servers can usually clear 
more than $2 profit from a $2.50 cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, because tea is cheap and goes a long way, it's hard to make 
money without a stampede of customers. Many shop owners subsidize their passion 
for the brew with adjacent gift shops, antique stores and -- gasp -- coffee 
sales. "You gotta find a gimmick because these tearooms are popping up 
everywhere," says the owner of the soon-to-open la-TEA-da in Arcadia, another 
place that encourages customers to dress up in hats and boas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure what fueled the fad. The predominant theory says people 
are burned out on high-potency coffee. Another says the trend is one of many 
side effects from the decade-long decline of alcohol intake. One shop owner 
says people are more well-traveled and want to re-create atmospheres they 
experienced in Europe (such as coffeehouses). 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Rosen, publisher of a Westside-based national quarterly called Tea Talk, 
says renewed trade with China -- the tea-growing capital of the world -- is a 
factor. "Connoisseurs are buying rare, legendary tea that is only now 
available," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the coffee crowd -- always alert to these things -- is using a 
join-'em approach. The Novel Cafe in Santa Monica recently added 12 blends to 
its menu of 26 teas: "It's a nice complement to coffee," owner Richard Karno 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach-based Specialty Coffee Assn. of America, a group that 
represents coffeehouses and coffee producers nationwide, is thinking about 
forming a tearoom branch. 
</P>
<P>
 And Starbucks spokeswoman Laura Moix points out that the megachain of 
coffeehouses has served tea since the day the first Starbucks opened in 1971. 
"If we saw an increase in popularity, we would probably offer a wider selection 
of teas," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tea fanatics swear their brew has superior attributes -- everything from male 
vitality to spiritual healing. Yogi Tea -- a health-food store staple that is 
now the rage at area tea and coffee spots -- has a line of herbal "ancient 
healing formulas" that vow to vanquish the flu or doctor the digestive system. 
</P>
<P>
 One coffeehouse worker says tea works as an aphrodisiac. "I bumped into this 
girl, invited her up for tea and . . . hook, line and sinker," says 24-year-old 
Jeffrey Pinchuk of Congo Square Espresso & Tea House in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA nutritionist Judith M. Ashley can't confirm such claims: "We don't have a 
lot of research to back that up." Then again, Ashley can confirm that there is 
a correlation between plain black and green tea and lower rates of cancer. "I 
prefer the tea over coffee," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Chado, sales are slow on a sweltering afternoon. Two people lounge in 
the intimate, purple-walled room, only a storefront window away from traffic 
sounds and parking wars. Customer Angie Bray laments the coming changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very disappointed," she says, "when they put up a sign that said they 
were going to serve coffee."

THE GOODS; AN OUT-OF-OFFICE EXPERIENCE; WHAT WILL THE WORKPLACE OF THE 21ST 
CENTURY BE LIKE? DESIGN STUDENTS ENVISION SMALLER AND DOWN RIGHT PORTABLE 
BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The workplace is changing," declared design student Dominic Sharlette, handing 
out flyers to his audience at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design. "It's no 
longer the desk in the office. It's in the car and it's in the street. People 
today are working in the 'in-between' places." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharlette's response to these changes is the Totem, a trim carrying case 
loaded with cellular phone and photo fax, audio recorder, answering machine and 
rechargeable battery pack. He designed it after studying the work routine of 
free-lance photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are constantly on the move," he said, "making calls and getting called 
for work." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharlette was one of 20 students unveiling products for the changing workplace 
as they wrapped up a term project at the Art Center last week.  
</P>
<P>
 The students had been challenged to invent better tools for the smaller, less 
centralized businesses that are evolving in the information age. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was sponsored by Prince, which designs interior trim systems for 
cars; Herman Miller, office furniture designer, and Stanley, manufacturer of 
home products. The three corporations envision an overlapping of their designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students were asked to define the problem of workplace changes," said Ray 
Smith, one of three faculty instructors on the project, "then create the 
solution -- the tools or products that might be envisioned for the future 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 And what does the future hold? Sweeping aside the traditional prediction of 
isolated workers chained to their electronic cottages, the student designers 
depicted a generation of freewheeling road warriors, liberated from a 9-to-5 
desk routine by flexible transportation and a dazzling new generation of 
electronic office tools. For instance: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Nobody wants to be immobile and surrounded by a bunch of screens," said 
Joao Amorim, whose family auto combined a "traditional furniture feeling" with 
enough computers to keep parents tuned to the office while transporting their 
children to school.  
</P>
<P>
 * "People want freedom to work how they please, when they please and where 
they please," said Troy Arnold III. His solution is a conventional-looking 
briefcase that opens up to offer all the components of a home office -- 
starting with the leather case itself, which is actually a flexible computer 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 * "In the information era we can work wherever we happen to be," said Ming-Jen 
Huang, who designed a set of teleconferencing toolsas basic furnishings for a 
hotel room "so anyone can attend a conference while traveling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With existing technology as a starting point, the students were encouraged to 
stretch their imaginations in applying it. The resulting designs -- illustrated 
by sketches, photographs, cartoons, renderings, paintings, videos and 
full-scale models -- offered many solutions for capturing the 21st-Century 
information flow. 
</P>
<P>
 One major theme was information processing on wheels. "This vehicle is an 
office," said Jae Hur, who studied the daily routine of a UPS delivery driver. 
His redesigned truck moves the packages to the driver in sequence by 
computerized conveyor belt, and has a map screen and refrigerator and beverage 
dispenser ("I noticed they carried food with them and had to stop for soft 
drinks," he said.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Yi, who spent time with a television news van, found a way to use the 
"time wasted while going to a story and coming back" by equipping the vehicle 
with a workstation for editing and relaying video images to the TV station. And 
he added a rooftop camera that could be activated the minute the van approached 
a news scene, such as a fire. Just the thing for drive-by news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tylor Garland endorses the idea of "your car as a little working capsule," but 
noted that people with car phones and note pads on the dashboard seem very 
distracted. His "Adam's Apple" has two parts: an optical recognition scanner 
that can read aloud any document you want to hear while driving, and a tapeless 
recorder that picks up any thoughts you dictate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It lets you work without taking your eyes off the road or hands off the 
wheel," he says. "You can absorb information at will." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others were also concerned with auto safety. Taking security to the limits, 
Hans Moritz designed a "pod with bumpers," intended to absorb extreme stress. 
The advanced impact system coupe incorporates multiple air bags as interior 
design, is protected by oversize front and rear bumpers, and sports a rear fin 
that can flood a 50-foot radius with light. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lim's research yielded this insight, which most parents learn the hard 
way: "A young couple has a hard time managing kids in the car." So, his family 
vehicle lowers the bucketed back seats into an entertainment area with large 
sightseeing windows and equipped with a computer-game screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone foresees a future on wheels. "I don't want to stay in my car any 
more than I have to," said Peter O'Rourke. His pay-per-use satellite module -- 
to be located in airports, convention centers or other busy places -- 
alleviates the need for people to drag around laptops and cellular phones. An 
entry card, programmed with such personal data as software preferences, on-line 
memberships and even seating adjustments, converts the module to a virtual 
branch office. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm Oehl sees no need to hit the road in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on all the information we'll have from Internet and on-line services, 
there will be plenty to work with," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His home-office information module integrates computer pads, speakers, CD-ROM 
and triple-screen into a handsome piece of laminated furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's designed also for a wheelchair," he explained, "so people with 
disabilities can compete in the business world of tomorrow."

 Keep computer disks out of the landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the aim of Eco Discs, a new line of disks made from recycled floppies. 
They're a new listing (billed as "retreads for the information highway") in the 
current Earth Tools, an environmental-products-catalogue business run by a 
Sunland couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw them this year at Eco Expo," Stormy S. Knight says. "They've been 
selling well." 
</P>
<P>
 Eco Discs are recycled floppy disks from the computer software industry whose 
members are stuck with tons of obsolete disks every time they upgrade a 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 So a Texas company has begun recycling the rejects, which are erased, 
pre-formatted for IBM or Macintosh, given new labels printed with a vegetable 
ink, packaged in a recycled box and put on the market. The price is $12 for a 
box of 3.5-inch disks, which includes 10 formatted disks and a bonus disk with 
environmental information to be downloaded into your computer for future 
reference. And although one little disk doesn't look like a landfill threat, 
Knight says, billions are another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to buy something they can picture in their mind helping the 
environment," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband, Marc Harris, started Earth Tools four years ago after 
Earth Day. "We started looking for environmental products and either couldn't 
find them or they were priced on the high side," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 They shop at trade, gift and natural-product shows, she says, and offer dozens 
of environmental products for home, garden, pets and personal care.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the eco market has changed in four years, with mainstream retailers 
picking up some items, people are still looking for green products, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (a product) competes in quality and workability with similar mainstream 
products and has environmental points, consumers will buy it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Earth Tools' most popular items is the cotton mesh GardenSac, used to 
store fruits and vegetables in the refrigerator crisper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers like them because they don't have to throw plastic bags away -- or 
save them, which is what environmental people tend to do," Knight says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other bestsellers, she says, are personal items such as a crystal deodorant 
stone and a shampoo bar that doesn't waste a throwaway bottle.  
</P>
<P>
 "These are high-quality sensible products," she says. "People buy items like 
this over and over again for themselves and to give to their friends." (Earth 
Tools information: (800) 825-6460.) On the Recycling Track 
</P>
<P>
 The California Integrated Waste Management Board has announced that the state 
expects to meet its 1995 mandate to divert 25% of solid waste from landfills, 
thanks to vigorous city and county recycling programs . . . National 
Geographic's recent cover story, a comprehensive look at the national fervor 
for recycling, reports that the average American family of four now recycles 
1,100 pounds of cans, bottles, paper and plastic a year.

 In the news: With the O.J. Simpson and Heidi Fleiss trials starting the same 
day, it could be tough to tell the trials apart as Court TV switches between 
them. Richard Turnage, of the Robert W. Morgan Show (KRTH 101), offers a tip: 
"One trial will focus on DNA, while the other emphasizes T&A."

ARE TODAY'S MATING PREFERENCES PRIMITIVE?; RELATIONSHIPS: THE TRAITS WE DESIRE 
IN THE OPPOSITE SEX ARE THE SAME ONES OUR EARLY ANCESTORS SOUGHT, SAYS A 
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN PROFESSOR. 
</P>

 What men want in a mate: A young, attractive woman who would never be 
unfaithful. 
</P>
<P>
 What women want: A man with status and resources, who is going to stick around 
and spend those resources on her and the children. 
</P>
<P>
 It is primitive. Much as we would like to believe otherwise, however, those 
basic preferences -- the product of evolution over thousands of generations -- 
are still very much driving decisions about who we choose for mates, according 
to David M. Buss of the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Buss, a psychology professor, has extensively studied human mating behavior. 
With 50 collaborators from 37 cultures worldwide, he collected information on 
mating preferences from 10,047 people. Dozens of related studies followed, as 
did "The Evolution of Desire," (Basic Books, $22). 
</P>
<P>
 "Much of what I discovered about human mating is not nice," Buss writes. "In 
the ruthless pursuit of sexual goals, for example, men and women derogate their 
rivals, deceive members of the opposite sex and even subvert their own mates." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's something in the book to upset almost everyone. Men may not want to 
hear they will be considered undesirable if they are without resources or the 
potential of acquiring them. (The preference evolved from women choosing men 
who could best help the family survive.) 
</P>
<P>
 The importance men place on youth and beauty is not great news for women, as 
looks "are undemocratically distributed," Buss notes, "and you're kind of stuck 
with what you have." (The preference evolved from men choosing women who seemed 
likely to have healthy children for many years.) 
</P>
<P>
 Buss' peers, likewise, have reason to be upset. "My social-science colleagues, 
in my view, have been brainwashed," Buss said in an interview. "They've held 
these myths for years and years. . . . Myths that everything is infinitely 
culturally variable; that men and women are identical in their psychology 
except by virtue of the ways they've been brought up." 
</P>
<P>
 The research shows that men and women are vastly different in sexual 
psychology. Common sense says the same thing, Buss says. Yet the lack of 
understanding leads to a lot of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "My book's not a self-help book, but I think an intelligent reader can read it 
and take away some powerful information about what they should do, depending on 
what their values are," Buss says. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, men have a powerful desire for sexual variety. "A lot of men 
remain faithful, but still have that desire," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 A key "mate-keeping strategy" for women, he found, is to enhance appearance in 
order to stay attractive. Then there's fidelity. Men abhor infidelity in mates. 
 
</P>
<P>
 For men, kindness. "Men who tell their mates that they love them, show 
helpfulness when their mates need it, and display kindness and affection 
regularly succeed in retaining their mates," he writes. (It reflects 
commitment.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although our sexual psychology is rooted in the primitive, Buss emphasizes, it 
in no way means that we're "somehow doomed to unchangeable behavior." Mating 
behavior is flexible. Evolution provided us with a variety of ways to solve the 
problems of how to mate successfully. One example is how we tend to choose 
partners who have similar values and interests, and belong to the same social 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women are psychologically similar in most ways, Buss says. They share 
the goal of a happy, lasting marriage. And as couples age, the sexual 
differences recede in importance. (It helps that testosterone levels in males 
decrease steadily with age.) 
</P>
<P>
 An understanding of sexual differences can only help, he says. "I think there 
are a lot of things men and women can do to increase the odds of harmony, by 
understanding there are differences in the nature of their desires."

CAREER DAY SEPARATES COOL JOBS FROM DUDS; PARENTING: HOW IS A BORING OLD 
WORD-CRUNCHER SUPPOSED TO IMPRESS THE KIDS WHEN THE COMPETITION INCLUDES A 
GUN-SLINGING COP AND A GUY WITH A HAWK? 
</P>

<P>
 In Virginia recently, a man was arrested for impersonating a deputy U.S. 
marshal during talks he gave at his children's school. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed up at Hylton High School in Dale City, Va., with a 9-millimeter 
handgun and a bulletproof vest, a cap and a jacket with "U.S. MARSHAL" patches 
on them, and he wowed his children's classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he ever was a U.S. deputy marshal is in doubt. But school officials 
accused him of being a fraud, and now this father faces a possible sentence of 
five years in prison for carrying a gun on school property. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor guy. I know just how he feels. 
</P>
<P>
 It is pretty tough when your kids are unimpressed -- no, embarrassed -- by 
what you do to earn money to pay for all their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the scene in the movie "City Slickers"? Billy Crystal, who buys 
commercials for a radio station ("I sell air time. I sell air. What is that?" 
he asks), visits his son's school for Career Day. Nine-year-old Danny 
introduces his father as a submarine commander. 
</P>
<P>
 During my previous incarnation as a sportswriter, my kids were proud of me on 
Career Day. My son thought it was cool that his mom covered sports, and all the 
kids loved my stuff. You know, my press passes, NFL press guides, a portable 
phone, a portable computer, a tape recorder. I taught them how to score a 
baseball game and told them that I discovered David Robinson, who once played 
basketball for the Naval Academy but is now just the hottest thing in the NBA. 
I was sensational. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that I am a columnist, I am not even going to Career Day. What would I say 
to impress them? "Ummm. They give me this whole, you know, uhhh, column of 
space in the paper, and I, uhh, you know, write stuff I think about. Any 
questions?" 
</P>
<P>
 "National humiliation," is how my 10-year-old son, who often appears in this 
space, describes my job. 
</P>
<P>
 My friend Reid Cherner, who edits sports for USA Today, and I'm sure does a 
darn fine job, shares my feelings. He knows that he is a professional liability 
to his kids. He found that out when he went to their preschool to give a talk 
titled, "Your friend, the First Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 He followed a guy with a hawk. 
</P>
<P>
 When he complained to the teacher about the poor scheduling, she told him: 
"Oh, don't worry. The children are very excited today. As soon as you're done, 
we are going to hear from a policeman." 
</P>
<P>
 There's that gun thing again. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter, Hannah, asked me what I was doing there," Reid says. "I told her 
I came to talk to her class about my job. She's been to my office 50 times, but 
she says to me, 'Oh, you're going to talk to us about being a dentist?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing Reid did after his talk was complain to the school 
administration that live animals should not be allowed in the school. The 
second thing he did was make an appointment for Hannah with a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid and I are miserable showmen for our profession, but somebody should give 
these school kids a look at the world of newspapers. So I sent my husband, 
Gary, fresh from the Olympics, to talk to the kids' physical education classes 
about what he had seen and done in Norway. When I asked how it went, he said: 
"Oh. Fine." That was all. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the obligatory thank-you notes started to arrive from the children. They 
all said pretty much the same thing: "Dear Mihoces. Thank you for teaching us 
about the Olympics. We liked it when you danced. We hope you come back soon 
with your dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dancing?" I asked. "You danced?" 
</P>
<P>
 He mumbled in reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me, but you didn't even dance at our wedding and you are doing some 
kind of Olympic dance for school kids," I said, my voice rising now. "What 
dance?" 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out it was a dance Norwegians did to keep warm while watching Olympic 
events in the bitter cold. My children's father set the school abuzz with this 
Norwegian warm-up dancing. The P.E. teacher stopped me at the grocery store to 
tell me how she had entertained dinner guests with the story of his dancing. 
Great. 
</P>
<P>
 My son wasn't even embarrassed. Well, not too embarrassed. "Dear Dad," his 
thank-you note began. "Thank you for talking to us. My favorite part was, yes, 
the dance. I think you made some people learn a little about Norway. Try to 
keep it more to learning, not dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 I'll never be able to top my husband's Career Day act, I know. Not unless 
columnists start carrying guns.

UNION MOUNTS EFFORT AGAINST SUBCONTRACTING PLANS AT DISNEY; LABOR: 100 
FOOD-SERVICE WORKERS WOULD LOSE JOBS AT THEME PARK, LOCAL 681 SAYS IN PUBLIC 
APPEAL SIGNALING TOUGH BARGAINING AHEAD. 
</P>

 Signaling acrimonious labor negotiations ahead for Disneyland, the union that 
represents more than 700 food-service workers at the amusement park has mounted 
a campaign to fend off what it says are company plans to subcontract out work. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union Local 681 has sent letters of appeal to 
state officials and has distributed leaflets at the park saying that Disneyland 
has decided to farm out the employees' cafeteria-service work. Such a move, the 
union says, would cost its membership 100 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney management is on an aggressive campaign to subcontract good union 
jobs," states the letter, signed by more than 200 union members and sent to 
Gov. Pete Wilson and others. "The net effect will be to turn good jobs, with 
full health benefits, into minimum-wage, part-time and temporary employment." 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said no decision has been made on 
subcontracting, though he confirmed that the company has asked for bids from 
food-service operators. "I don't expect it will happen at all in the near 
term," he said. "There really isn't anything there right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Some food vendors, though, said their understanding is that the work at 
Disneyland would begin soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Gambrell, director of marketing and sales at the Los Angeles office of 
Canteen Corp., said his company put in a bid earlier this summer. "We expected 
to hear by now," he said. Though he would not reveal the value of the contract, 
he said, "Believe me, it would be great." 
</P>
<P>
 The union contends that Disneyland is weighing outsourcing as a way to reduce 
its labor costs significantly. Most of the union food-service employees at 
Disneyland make between $9.15 and $11.05 an hour, with some earning as much as 
$15 an hour, said Angela Keefe, president of Local 681, which is based in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock would say only that "we're always looking at ways to make business 
more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Some union members also say that part of Disneyland's motivation is to reduce 
the risk of running afoul of immigration laws. If food services went to 
subcontractors, then they, not Disneyland, would be responsible for employee 
hiring. In April, Disneyland agreed to pay $260,000 to settle allegations of 
poor record-keeping that violated federal immigration laws. About half of Local 
681's members who work at Disneyland are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock would not comment on that assertion by the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Subcontracting has become an increasingly contentious issue between some 
unions and Disneyland, and the latest dispute comes as Local 681 and Disneyland 
are girding up for contract talks. Local 681's bargaining agreement with 
Disneyland expires Oct. 30, and negotiations are expected to begin in early 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be rough," Keefe said, adding that subcontracting was a 
big sticking point in contract talks earlier this year at the Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland, one of Orange County's largest employers, has long used union 
labor, and the specter of subcontracting has put other unions on guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty ominous," said Dave Stilwell, executive vice president of Service 
Employees International Union Local 399, which represents about 600 maintenance 
and other service workers at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Stilwell said Disneyland subcontracted out some custodial work last year. 
Expressing concern that the company will try to subcontract more maintenance 
jobs in the future, Stilwell said, "Disney has been the biggest and best union 
employer, and if they start subcontracting out work, that's going to mean that 
a bunch of good jobs in Anaheim are going to be sweatshop jobs."

COMPUTERS WILL WATCH, TALLY MEXICAN VOTE; ELECTION: STATE-OF-THE-ART SYSTEMS 
ARE IN PLACE. BUT OPPOSITION POLITICIANS AND THE PUBLIC REMAIN SKEPTICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A computer crash has haunted President Carlos Salinas de Gortari for six 
years. It has cast doubt on the legitimacy of his administration, and now it is 
undermining confidence that Sunday's presidential election will be clean. 
</P>
<P>
 On election night, 1988, with opposition presidential candidate Cuauhtemoc 
Cardenas in the lead, the computer counting the votes went down, taking with it 
any hope that Mexicans would believe the official polling results. Those 
results gave Salinas 50.7% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the Mexican government is counting this weekend on two 
sophisticated computer systems to lend credibility to the final tally in what 
is expected to be this nation's closest presidential race in more than six 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 A $730-million computerized voter registration roll will determine who is 
allowed to vote. Another multimillion-dollar system with multiple backups will 
tally the votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If technology can guarantee clean elections, these will be," said U.S. Rep. 
Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.) after a recent tour of the electoral computer 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition politicians say that's a big if. And citizens are equally 
skeptical. A recent survey by the citizens group Civic Alliance found that 63% 
of those interviewed believe ballots will be altered, ignored or switched by 
the computer system. Pollsters interviewed 4,790 Mexicans in 16 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the technological effort is impressive, from a state-of-the-art IBM 
network to remote input terminals -- similar to automated teller machines -- 
that would be the envy of most retail banks. Polaroid built a plant in 
Queretaro, 130 miles from the capital, to manufacture voter credentials with 
photos, thumbprints and even hidden bar codes. The bar code reproduces the 
information on each credential, providing an additional check on its validity. 
</P>
<P>
 The multinational corporations involved -- U.S., Japanese and French -- are 
understandably nervous about participating in such a close contest in a country 
with such a checkered electoral history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought a lot about it before deciding to participate," said Rodrigo 
Guerra, general director of IBM de Mexico. "We were exposing our reputation. We 
continue to expose it. But one cannot just work in a country on only the easy 
projects." 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-year-old voter registration task demanded a system that could store 
information on more than 40 million voters in such a way that it could be 
retrieved easily, either for updating or by politicians who want to verify it. 
Said Guerra: "This would be the largest on-line data base that we had ever 
created. We were starting from nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 IBM based the system on its RS-6000, a computer that is used for everything 
from connecting suppliers to recording department store sales to university 
workstations and government offices. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, 30,000 people from the government, IBM and subcontractors were 
working on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, none of this makes for a trustworthy voter registration list in a 
country with a tradition called "the carousel." That custom entails party 
faithful registering in many precincts and spending election day driving 'round 
and 'round, voting at each of them. This time, computers are supposed to flag 
such duplication. 
</P>
<P>
 All but one of the nine political parties have approved the list, including 
the National Action Party (PAN), whose candidate was in second place in most 
polls taken last week. Based on a test with equipment that duplicates the 
government computer center, PAN officials have said they believe the list is 
more than 95% reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the single holdout -- the Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD), whose 
presidential candidate is Cardenas -- has raised embarrassing questions. For 
example, the PRD has found dozens of people listed at the same nonexistent 
addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good faith voter registration list," explained one registration 
official. "We record the information the way citizens give it to us. Sometimes 
that creates errors." 
</P>
<P>
 Once voters signed up, government officials went to great lengths to get them 
their credentials. Villagers in Ibarra, deep in the Chiapas jungle, had to walk 
15 hours to the nearest polling place in the midterm elections three years ago. 
This time, their voter credentials were delivered to the village months ago -- 
making it easier than the voting itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high-tech voter list and sophisticated credentials, balloting 
itself will not be computerized. Voters will mark their choice by hand, fold 
the ballot and drop it into a plastic box -- a clear one so that everyone can 
see that the box was not stuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology does not reappear until the polls close and it comes time to tally 
the votes. This has traditionally been the period of "alchemy," when votes for 
the opposition are spun into votes for the ruling party, like lead into gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays in reporting from rural areas, traditional PRI strongholds, often raise 
suspicions. "Mexico is not Belgium," said one election official. "We have 
telecommunications problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Those problems tend to cause differences between early returns -- from the 
cities -- and final results. That appears to be the reason for the 1988 
computer crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The first returns are from cities, where the opposition parties tend to be 
stronger and poll vigilance is stricter. When the PRI vote comes in from rural 
areas, Mexicans are skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened in 1988 was that (officials) promised to give returns precinct 
by precinct," Arturo Nunuz, general director of the Federal Electoral 
Institute, the agency that runs elections, told a group of foreign reporters 
recently. "The flow arrived first from Mexico City and the state of Mexico and 
it was not representative of the nation. Obviously, they opted to crash the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 No precinct-by-precinct results were ever released, and the ballots were later 
burned. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, no results will be announced until at least 15% of precincts are 
reporting, election officials decided. The details of the plans for the vote 
count have been guarded closely, and election officials would only discuss it 
on condition that their names would not be used. About 11,000 technicians were 
involved in setting up the vote-counting system.

CHRYSLER WILL RELAUNCH ITS EAGLE DIVISION; ADVERTISING: A $100-MILLION 
MULTIMEDIA CAMPAIGN WILL TRY TO RAISE AWARENESS AMONG BUYERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp. said Thursday it will spend more than $100 million on a 
multimedia advertising campaign aimed at relaunching its fledgling Eagle 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign, which begins this week with a spot on "The Late Show With David 
Letterman," is geared toward raising the profile of Chrysler's smallest and 
most troubled division, particularly with young import buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problem is awareness," Ed Brust, general manager of Chrysler's Jeep Eagle 
Division, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting the right people; we're just not getting enough volume of these 
people," Brust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, since the start of the year, Eagle sales are off 27%, though the rest 
of the U.S. auto industry is up almost 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline has sparked widespread speculation that Chrysler might dump the 
Eagle brand and allow its 2,250 Jeep/Eagle dealers to sell just Jeeps. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brust said Chrysler intends to keep Eagle, and he said the company is 
tripling its annual advertising budget for the 1995 model year to attract more 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make it easier to find and buy an Eagle," Brust said. "A good deal 
on a product that no one knows about is no deal at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few months, Eagle plans to roll out 18 different TV commercials 
to air during popular programs such as "Seinfeld," "Melrose Place," "Star Trek" 
and nationally televised football and basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign, which was crafted by Bozell North in Southfield, Mich., features 
Greg Kinnear, the host of NBC's "Later" program and E! Entertainment network's 
"Talk Soup" show. 
</P>
<P>
 Brust said the first few commercials will focus on the new Eagle Talon, but 
later spots will promote the Eagle Vision mid-size sedan and Eagle's trio of 
Summit models. Brust said both brands have failed to live up to Chrysler's 
expectations, in large part because the auto maker has not done a good enough 
job advertising them. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I told our dealers last night, we have not begun to see the true sales 
potential for the Vision," Brust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brust said the previous Vision commercials, which featured the tag line "Not 
for the general public" were "a little soft," and did little to broaden Eagle's 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Brust promised that the new campaign, which also features more than 25 million 
magazine inserts, will be more focused and include a toll-free telephone number 
prospective buyers can call to arrange test drives. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the auto maker hopes to sell as many as 100,000 Eagle cars in the 1995 
model year, up from an estimated 60,000 this year. Some of the increase will 
come from higher volume across the industry, but Brust said Eagle also helps to 
increase its share of the market from its current level of 0.4%.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: ROCKWELL TO BID FOR SATELLITE AIR TRAFFIC CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rockwell International Corp. said it will enter the competition for a 
$500-million, multiyear contract to build a satellite-based air traffic 
management system for the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would use the precision navigation capabilities of the U.S. Global 
Positioning System, or GPS, a constellation of 24 satellites that can track 
aircraft accurately anywhere on Earth.Rockwell built the GPS satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is the FAA's first step in switching from its existing 
ground-based navigation aids and radar-based systems to GPS. The basic 
satellite navigation system is expected to be operational by late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach-based Rockwell is leading a contract team that includes GTE 
Government Systems Corp. and Booz, Allen & Hamilton Inc. management and 
technology consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA this year scrapped a microwave-based air traffic control system it 
already had spent $400 million developing, saying that the GPS satellite system 
represented a major technological improvement.

CRIME'S OTHER VICTIMS; DENISE HUBER'S PARENTS ARE GETTING SOME ANSWERS NOW, 
THREE YEARS AFTER THEIR DAUGHTER DISAPPEARED. JOHN AND GENELLE REILLEY OF 
LAGUNA BEACH, WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS SLAIN IN 1986, ARE STILL HOPING FOR A BREAK IN 
HER CASE. BUT, LIKE MANY FAMILIES IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS, THE REILLEYS HAVE 
DIRECTED THEIR GRIEF AND ANGER INTO ACTIVISIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD BONHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John and Genelle Reilley have been coping with a living purgatory of grief, 
frustration and confusion for 8 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Their grief is over the loss of their 23-year-old daughter, Robbin Brandley, 
who was stabbed and left to bleed to death on the campus of Saddleback College 
in Mission Viejo in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 They are frustrated because whoever killed Robbin has escaped detection. 
Although the case is still being pursued by Orange County Sheriff's Department 
detectives, solid leads have become increasingly scarce as the years have 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 And, like many families of crime victims, the Reilleys are confused over why 
violence seems to be tolerated, even celebrated, by American society. They 
wonder why violent criminals are released from prison at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the death of their daughter, the Laguna Beach couple have shared deeply 
in both the heartache and occasional ray of hope -- new evidence, an arrest -- 
experienced by other crime victim families. 
</P>
<P>
 With the breakthrough last month in the Denise Huber case -- the body of the 
Orange County woman missing since 1991 was found in Arizona -- the Reilleys 
revived their hopes for a break in their daughter's case.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the two murders have many important differences, they have certain 
similarities. Both Brandley and Huber were returning home from nighttime 
concerts when they were last seen alive, and both were 23 years old. Both were 
white women who lived in southern Orange County. Huber had graduated from UC 
Irvine a year before she disappeared; Brandley was a college student. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reilleys hope that prosecutors will ultimately be able to prove that one 
person committed both murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That way, there weren't two maniacs out there; there was just one," said 
Genelle Reilley, who had written a letter of commiseration to the Hubers after 
their daughter's disappearance. "I'm absolutely delighted that . . . the 
(Huber) family doesn't have to wonder anymore where their daughter is, if she's 
alive or dead."  
</P>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's spokesman Lt. Dan Martini said that when Denise 
Huber's body was found, a detective was sent to Arizona to investigate if John 
Famalaro, who has been charged in Huber's death, is linked to any other crimes. 
Martini said Famalaro has not been connected to any other case. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no breakthroughs in their daughter's case, but, the Reilleys 
point out, there were none in the Huber case until Elaine Canalia of Phoenix, 
on a hunch, wrote down the license number of a moving van that she said "just 
seemed out of place." Her tip to police led to the discovery of the body and 
the arrest of Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Huber thing turned on just that one woman," John Reilley said. "Thank 
God that this woman put two and two together, gave a damn, told of her 
suspicion and then the police officers followed it up. The clue didn't fall 
through the cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robbin's killer came out of nowhere, killed her in a quick amount of time, 
with such passion, and then disappeared. It's hard to believe that he, or she, 
did not commit a similar type of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Early on the morning of Jan. 19, 1986, the Reilleys were awakened at their 
home by sheriff's deputies who brought them the devastating news. 
</P>
<P>
 The body of their daughter had been found in a dimly lighted parking lot on 
the Saddleback campus, near the Doyle G. McKinney Theatre where she had been 
working as a student usher. There were multiple stab wounds to her upper body; 
there was no sign of sexual assault or robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbin was a communications and fine arts student at Saddleback and a disc 
jockey at the campus station, KSBR. She had planned to to pursue a degree in 
broadcasting at San Francisco State. On the night of her death, she had worked 
as an usher for a jazz performance and attended a small reception afterward. 
She was last seen about 10:30 p.m. as she left that event for home. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Reilleys' hope that their daughter's attacker has boasted of the 
stabbing and that someone who has information will be attracted to the reward 
the Reilleys are offering. At $25,000 two years ago, the reward now stands at 
$50,000. Anyone with information they believe is connected to the case should 
contact the sheriff's department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murderers talk to each other about their crimes, and brag," Genelle Reilley 
said. "I pray that someone will come forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said that after Brandley was killed, "there were hundreds of leads and 
phone calls that developed at the onset of the case. And, as is typical of 
human nature, (the reward offering) did generate more calls. We pass those 
leads around to detectives. Any new lead that comes in, we follow." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reilleys have spent nearly $50,000 on their own private investigation. In 
1988, they took the Sheriff's Department to court in an unsuccessful bid to 
gain access to the coroner's report and complete crime scene information. The 
Sheriff's Department argued that certain aspects of the case are known only to 
the murderer and that the investigation would be compromised if the reports 
were released.  
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Genelle Reilley worked up her courage to confront a woman she 
had suspected in the attack on her daughter and paid her to take a lie-detector 
test. It proved negative. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Genelle Reilley and her son, Jayeson Brandley, joined 
hundreds of other crime victims and their families at a rally on the steps of 
the state Capitol. There, they listened as Gov. Pete Wilson asked legislators 
to support major bills in his anti-crime package. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met the governor the night before the rally and thanked him for what he's 
trying to do for us and for signing the 'three strikes' law," Reilley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it should be only one strike. Why would we even think of letting a 
murderer or a rapist or a child molester out of jail? Over 200,000 people have 
been murdered (in the U.S.) since Robbin's death. That's more than Vietnam. We 
are living in a war zone. America is a war zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the rally, she drove to the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly 
Hills for a fund-raising luncheon to benefit Crime Victims United, a support 
group that lobbies on behalf of victims' rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Blaming their daughter's death in part on what they say was lax security and 
inadequate lighting on college campuses generally, the Reilleys have actively 
lobbied for state legislation to increase illumination in parking lots and 
campus walkways. They also backed legislation that has opened up campus crime 
statistics to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we testified before the Legislature on lighting issues, we went out 
and measured the light in different parts of colleges," John Reilley recalled. 
"Students are out at 12, 1 in the morning, walking around, and we literally 
surprised each other as we came across them. It is that dark." 
</P>
<P>
 "Students have told me that Saddleback is well lit now, and that makes me feel 
good," Genelle Reilley says. "But my daughter shouldn't have had to die for 
something like that to happen."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mental-health experts say that taking activist roles in crime issues is an 
effective way for families of victims to deal with grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murder is such an outrageous way to lose a child. When families take their 
grief to an activist role, it's often an expression of the outrage of losing 
their child," says Carol Waxman, supervisor of homicide victim services for the 
Victim/Witness Assistance Program of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's anger, but there's a deep commitment too among people who use the 
grief in an activist way. They want to take their anger and create some 
benefit. There is altruism there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reilleys contribute to several state and national crime victim groups that 
network and lobby for change, including Parents of Murdered Children, Memory of 
Victims Everywhere and Justice for Homicide Victims. 
</P>
<P>
 A goal of the Reilleys is to make hand-held security devices available for 
students to own or rent for use on campus. They are trying to find a legislator 
to back their idea, which would involve two or three campuses serving as test 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "With these devices, even if there's one guard, he would know where you are 
when you pushed the button," John Reilley said. "One model used at the 
University of Michigan sends out a million-watt strobe light. If our daughter 
had had one of these on her key chain, she might be alive today." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A day does not go by that Robbin is not in her family's thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 Genelle Reilley describes her life as "one big why": "Why did someone do this 
to my daughter, who never hurt anyone in her life, had no enemies? Why don't 
schools care about the safety of their students? Why do we release murderers 
and rapists from prison? To see if they'll do it again? Why wouldn't we want 
bright lights in parking lots?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Reilleys say they are grateful for the support they've received from 
family, friends and victims groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have wonderful family," Genelle Reilley says. "A lot of people don't have 
that, and I don't know how they do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jayeson Brandley, 30, says his sister's death will always be with him.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I think about it, but it's becoming a little easier now that I've 
decided to focus my energies on . . . having tougher penalties against violent 
felons," he said. "It gives me a little bit of an outlet, but the grief is not 
something that will ever decrease."

MSGR. SOTO'S STORY A REFRESHING LOOK AT A GOOD PERSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What an uplifting and refreshing story on Msgr. Jaime Soto ("In Good Faith," 
July 31).In contrast to violent, pessimistic stories on man's inhumanity to 
man, an article featuring a Roman Catholic priest, committed to his goal to 
help those in need, remaining unyielding to popular sentiment that may be in 
contrast to his sense of duty, gently in a steadfast way, is laudable. 
</P>
<P>
 Articles that tell of the good people are wonderful. Thank you.

A WAY TO COMBAT LACK OF SLEEP: NAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your June 21 article, "Workers' Restoration," was one of several recent media 
reports on the serious consequences of lack of sleep in the workplace and 
elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 The problem became a frightening reality to me last fall when I dozed off 
while driving home from the office.Fortunately, the lane divider bumps jarred 
me back to consciousness as I began to veer into another lane, and no one was 
driving next to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I then devised a strategy to preclude a recurrence of this near-accident: 
Before driving home, I put my car seat in the recline position and take about a 
15-minute nap. Although I really don't fall fully asleep, this mini-respite 
from the day's labors is just enough to restore my alertness for the road. 
Since then, I have never had a recurrence and am also less tired in the 
evenings once I arrive home.

 Teen-agers who smoke, eat junk food and lie around watching television are 
increasing their risk of fragile bones, or osteoporosis, in later life, Finnish 
researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers at a Helsinki hospital followed 264 boys and girls age 9 
through 18 until they were 20 to 29, measuring bone mass and watching lifestyle 
factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting regular exercise and not smoking are important in achieving maximal 
peak bone mass in adolescents and young adults, the study showed.  
</P>
<P>
 Smoking greatly affected the bone mass of young men, while calcium intake 
affected it most in young women. 
</P>
<P>
 Osteoporosis, which causes elderly people to literally shrink, suffer broken 
bones and other health problems, is caused mostly by genetic factors. But 20% 
of cases are caused by lifestyle, the researchers said.

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; DOUBLE PLAY; STRIKE OR NO STRIKE, MILLIONS OF 
AMERICANS ASPIRE TO PLAY MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL. WHILE MOST WILL REMAIN 
SPECTATORS, CONTENT WITH PEANUTS AND CRACKER JACKS, A PRECIOUS FEW WILL SIGN 
WITH PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL TEAMS AND LIVE THE DREAM. TWO ORANGE COUNTY 
TEEN-AGERS, BRANDON PUFFER AND PETER ZAMORA, ARE IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF 
MAJOR LEAGUE HOPEFULS. BOTH WERE DRAFTED STRAIGHT FROM HIGH SCHOOL BY 
PROFESSIONAL TEAMS AND WERE RECRUITED BY COLLEGES, TOO. EACH HAS CHOSEN A 
DIFFERENT PATH TO MAKE HIS DREAM A REALITY.; BRANDON PUFFER: INTO THE PROS

 It has long been a dream of Brandon Puffer to play professional baseball. He 
signed his first baseball contract at the age of 12 -- it was a promise to his 
father that he would one day play ball with the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 Puffer has proved to be a man of his word. Following his senior year in June 
at Capistrano Valley, this pitcher was drafted by the Minnesota Twins. For now, 
he has set aside his collegiate prospects in order to play baseball 
professionally. 
</P>
<P>
 Puffer's strategy was practice. "I made sure I was on a team at all times," 
Puffer recalled. "When I'd get burned out, I'd take a couple of months off." 
His determination yielded success by age 7, when he led his first team to a 
22-0 record. His talent also helped his other teams over the years to win city 
tournaments in the minor A division and conquer teams as far away as Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Puffer's desire to remain active in the sport led to two varsity seasons of 
high school baseball. He had a 5-3 record in his senior year. Practices lasted 
up to four hours. Puffer also maintained his stamina as a varsity basketball 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked baseball better because I knew I had a better chance at making 
baseball my career," Puffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recruitment process for baseball players begins by word of mouth. In 
addition, scouts are sent to look for talent at high school games. "The scouts 
don't care how you play in high school," Puffer contends. "They look for 
potential. They may pick a guy who is skinny over one who is all filled-out 
because he has potential. They look for promise." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, Colorado Rockies, Toronto Blue Jays and Twins seem to have spotted 
the promise in Puffer. Letters and phone calls came from the professional 
teams, letting Puffer know they were interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "One team came over to my house and gave me all these tests to check my 
character," the 18-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blue Jays showed the most interest at first. The Twins pursued him more 
persistently in the spring and even telephoned Puffer the night before the 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The professional teams were not the only ones who wanted to get their hands on 
Puffer. Cal State Long Beach and USC were also recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the greatest student. I didn't take the SAT, so I knew I wouldn't get 
a scholarship. I had my mind set on playing professional baseball. I knew I was 
going to play baseball if I got drafted," Puffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is what happened. He signed with the Minnesota Twins and headed to 
Ft. Myers, Fla., to train with a minor league team under the Twins. All players 
rise at 7 a.m. and are on the field by 8. Running and drills are performed 
until noon. Then the players break for lunch, followed by a daily nine-inning 
baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a real job," Puffer said. "Some teams don't treat their new players 
good, but the Twins treat you well. I was surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Puffer has not completely discarded the thought of college. He plans to attend 
a community college during the off-season, and his contract includes payments 
toward college tuition. "If I get injured I can always go back to college." 
</P>
<P>
 A minor league player usually must work through four levels -- rookie, 
single-A, double-A and triple-A -- before actually playing in the majors, which 
players call "The Show." Puffer hopes to spend only four or five years in the 
minors. "I have to put in my time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dream of playing professional baseball is becoming a reality for Puffer, 
and he remains as determined as ever. "I want to make it to The Show . . . and 
have a long career."

 A mural created by Girls Incorporated of Orange County to celebrate the youth 
organization's 40th anniversary has taken to the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-by-16-foot mural, which traveled to the Orange County Fair, is on 
display through August in the food court at Triangle Square in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the mural, the vast stream of all that is woman -- all of her aspects, 
realities, mysteries, hopes and dreams -- ride forward from a backdrop of a 
brilliant sky at sunset," said artist Paul Redaelli, who collaborated with 
Girls Incorporated to create the work. 
</P>

VIDEO GAME REVIEW: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; SATURDAY NIGHT SLAM 
MASTERS; FOR SUPER NINTENDO BY CAPCOM, $59.95  
</P>

 Some folks consider pro wrestling to be the ultimate in athletic competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Others -- make that almost everyone on the planet -- know just about 
everything inside the ring is staged and rarely has any relation to real 
mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 C'mon. How can you take a sport seriously when the competitors dress like 
circus clowns? How can you believe it's a fair fight when the rules are broken 
every second and nobody even gets yelled at? Try to picture the scene if 
football or basketball players could ignore the rules. You'd see some REAL 
mayhem then. 
</P>
<P>
 And that leads us to today's topic: Saturday Night Slam Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other wrestling carts on the market, but if rasslin' is your cup of 
tea, 24-meg SNSM body-slams the competition and gets a pin in 10 seconds flat. 
</P>
<P>
 The game's got to be a winner with such stars as Biff Slamkovich, the Rockin' 
Russkie; Gunloc, nicknamed the Loose Cannon; Great Oni, a former Kabuki actor; 
and 432-pound Titanic Tim, known to his close friends as the Battle Axe. 
</P>
<P>
 There are actually eight of these bruisers, each with his own special 
melt-the-controller moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Biff, for instance. To put his Super Slam into action, you have to "grab" 
your opponent, then blend up, up-right and right on the controller while 
hitting the attack button. 
</P>
<P>
 Sense a bit of Street Fighter II here? Well, Capcom designed that incredibly 
successful fighting cart, and you'll see some of the same controller sequences 
to call up those moves that you first tried to master with SFII. 
</P>
<P>
 And all your favorite pro wrestling "holds" are right there on your TV: 
jumping on your opponent from the corner post, stomping him when he's down, 
crunching his spine like a pretzel, even the ever-popular punch in the nose. 
You can even take the fight outside the ring, where the rules really don't 
apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Slam Masters takes you on a trip around the world; at each stop, the wrestler 
you have chosen takes on one of the seven remaining brutes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several ways to play. You can match your skills against the CPU, or 
you can battle with a friend. You can fight one-on-one or you can select Team 
Battle Royal, in which each team has two Slam Masters instead of one. If you 
can round up three friends and a multi-player adapter, all of you can pummel 
away to your heart's content. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are several ways to win. You can pin your opponent, you can force 
him to yell "uncle" with a give-up hold, or you can keep him out of the ring 
for 20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Options include an eight-stage difficulty range, a three-minute time limit or 
unlimited time and the usual adjustable controller settings. Controls work 
well; the graphics are solid and colorful; the sound is minimal but fun, 
especially the roaring crowd noises, and there's enough going on to keep you 
entertained for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a pro wrestling fan -- and you know who you are -- this is about as 
close as you'll get to climbing into the ring without being dumb enough to 
actually do it.

 Orlando and Orange County (Fla.) officials might be pitting Walt Disney World 
and Universal Studios against each other in efforts to acquire a major league 
baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Top executives at the competing Central Florida theme parks have denied any 
interest in owning a big league team, but sources and official documents 
indicate a renewed interest, The Orlando Sentinel reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Public records indicate Universal and Disney have been talking regularly with 
local officials, principally County Chairman Linda Chapin and Orlando Mayor 
Glenda Hood, about baseball.

NO QUITTING; DESPITE SETBACKS, BASKETBALL PLAYER CINDY BROWN WON'T GIVE UP ON 
RECOVERING FROM AUTO ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cindy Brown's head hit the windshield and snapped down into the steering 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Her thoughts screamed inside her brain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my God, there goes my contract!" 
</P>
<P>
 Her contract. She had played basketball for five months in Japan and, with 
bonuses, earned $125,000. Not bad for a 25-year-old who was three years out of 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 She had been warned. A coach at Long Beach State told her to insure her body 
because it was her living. But she was in her best shape ever. She had already 
won a gold medal in the 1988 Olympic Games, but had skipped the University 
Games and missed the Goodwill Games with a bum knee. Still, there was no need 
to dial Lloyds of London. 
</P>
<P>
 And then she was rear-ended by a drunk driver in the summer of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a prior arrest and fled, but was apprehended. He got two years of 
probation, four days in jail and a fine. He never paid restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's career, for all practical purposes, ended that day in Garden Grove. 
She suffered severe whiplash, a chipped cervical disk and pinched nerve in her 
back that made her right arm numb, and she had no feeling in two fingers of her 
shooting hand. 
</P>
<P>
 She missed the Pan Am Games. 
</P>
<P>
 She forfeited $175,000 of a $200,000 contract in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 She missed the 1992 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very angry, very cheated by the system," she said this week from her 
Villa Park home. "I felt justice hadn't been served. I felt he was totally 
irresponsible -- he not only endangered his life but mine and everyone else's, 
and he also ruined my career. I sustained a great loss because of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing has been the same since." 
</P>
<P>
 It really hasn't. Brown did almost everything that can be done in women's 
basketball. She set an NCAA Division I record with 60 points in a game and 
averaged 21.1 over a 128-game career at Long Beach State. She twice was a 
first-team Naismith All-American selection and a first-team Kodak All-American. 
She was the most valuable player of the 1987 NCAA Western Regionals. She was 
inducted into the 49er Hall of Fame in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 She was good. Really good.  
</P>
<P>
 And nothing has been the same since. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of international competition against the best women on the planet, 
Brown now plays pickup games against the guys down at Mile Square Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But that might change. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 29, mature, and at ease, she's mounting her comeback. She has a workout 
station in her home and a hoop in her driveway and a goal to reach the Pan 
American Games and then, one more time, the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've kind of been out of sight, out of mind," Brown said. "I hope to change 
that because I really have had the strong desire to play. I've never lost that 
drive. I still have a lot of fight to be No. 1. I just hope I have the 
opportunity to show that." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a great comeback story if it takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident, she missed her third international competition in a row, 
the Pan Am Games; she had already missed the 1989 University Games when she 
took a year off to recover from physical burnout, and the '90 Goodwill Games 
with a bad knee. She returned to Japan in 1992, but took a big financial hit -- 
management thought she was either washed up or wouldn't recover from the 
accident. She later had foot surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan changed its policies regarding American players a year later and most 
headed to Europe, but Brown's big-money $225,000 contract made her an 
expendable prospect in the cheaper Italian leagues. She did join Faenza Errieti 
for the final eight games of the 1992 season, helping raise the team from 13th 
to ninth place in the standings, an increase that allowed it to maintain its 
sponsorship, which would have been lost had it finished lower than 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Eastern Bloc countries began allowing players to join the European 
leagues, Brown said, and 6-2, 175-pound power forwards weren't a premium -- not 
when cheaper Czech and Russian athletes were available -- so she never got 
another chance in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 So Brown has waited in Orange County and trained to compete this summer. But 
she was dogged by fatigue. She thought it might be mononucleosis, but doctors 
eventually found a lump on her neck that turned out to be a benign thyroid 
goiter. It was removed in June. There are four others she's keeping an eye on. 
</P>
<P>
 She says she's in shape. The knee and foot are healed. The accident is behind 
her. The Pan Am Games are in March, and Brown will seek a position on the team. 
She grew up in Portland, Ore., and will play for a Portland AAU team that will 
face NCAA competition this winter. She will take another shot in Europe and 
explain that, yeah, she's affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 She will try to prove she can play again. 
</P>
<P>
 She will try to prove she can be an Olympian again. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I try," Brown said, "the harder it is to get ahead, but I'm ready to 
face whatever's ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 She is asked a question she has not heard before. It's about the defining 
moment of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder if I've even hit that point," she said. "I still feel very young of 
mind and open and eager to learn. I don't know if I can honestly answer that. 
It's a darn good question, but I don't know if I'm there yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've overcome so much and can still overcome a lot more."

FORMER DUCK SKALDE SIGNS WITH THUNDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jarrod Skalde, who had two game-winning goals during a stint with the Mighty 
Ducks last season, has signed with the Las Vegas Thunder of the International 
Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 Skalde, 23, had nine points in 20 games with the Ducks after being called up 
from minor league San Diego after an injury to center Anatoli Semenov. 
</P>
<P>
 Skalde -- who scored an overtime goal to beat St. Louis Dec. 12 in his first 
game as a Duck -- became an unrestricted free agent after the season. Though 
the Ducks made a contract offer, General Manager Jack Ferreira said he expected 
Skalde to sign elsewhere, in part because he could probably make more money 
playing in the minors. ROBYN NORWOOD

IN THE MAJORS AT LAST; AFTER SEVEN YEARS, FORMER TITAN GARY BUCKLES MAKES THE 
BIG TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary Buckles walked slowly from the St. Louis Cardinals' bullpen; the beating 
of his heart and voices in his head all he could hear. Hoping to calm his 
nerves, Buckles took a deep breath on reaching the mound at Busch Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice try, but a Club Med vacation wouldn't have relaxed Buckles. Buckles, a 
career minor league reliever, appeared in his first game for the Cardinals on 
July 23 after being promoted from triple-A Louisville that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours after pitching mop-up for the Redbirds in a 6-0 loss at 
Oklahoma City, Buckles faced the powerful Atlanta Braves in the seventh inning 
of a 4-4 tie. What's more, his debut occurred in front of a crowd of more than 
52,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Nerve-rattling time, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buckles did his job despite the swell of emotion. He was removed after 
pitching a scoreless seventh in a game the Braves won, 8-5, in 12 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (first game) was incredible," Buckles said. "Never did I believe I'd 
pitch in the big leagues. It had been so long, I just gave up hope it would 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 After struggling through seven mostly nondescript seasons -- including one 
year in which no team wanted him -- Buckles, 29, broke through this season. And 
although the baseball strike has curtailed Buckles' progress, the former 
Huntington Beach High, Golden West College and Cal State Fullerton pitcher now 
has hope and, many believe, a future. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckles, a right-hander, was 0-1 with a 2.25 earned-run average in 12 innings 
in 10 appearances with St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any good middle reliever, Buckles (6 feet, 185 pounds) maintained the 
status quo -- which kept the Cardinals in games. Buckles allowed the go-ahead 
run only once. A surprising accomplishment, considering the source. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Buckles didn't even have a team . 
</P>
<P>
 As a college senior in 1987, Buckles was 3-3 with one save and a 4.24 ERA. 
That completed his mediocre two-year career with the Titans, and he wasn't 
selected in the 1987 amateur draft. But the Angels signed him as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckles pitched in the Angels' organization for five seasons. In 1988 at 
single-A Quad Cities, Iowa, Buckles relieved in 46 games and was 14-3 with 
eight saves and a 3.18 ERA. He struck out 109 in 79 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Good times ahead, he thought, and two quick promotions followed. But things 
began to unravel in 1990 at triple-A Edmonton. Buckles' ERA grew in proportion 
with the hitters' skill at the top minor league level. By 1991, he feared for 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
 His suspicion was confirmed when Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi, then the 
minor league director, told Buckles he was not in the organization's plans. He 
was released in 1991 after a winless season (0-7, 4.15 ERA). 
</P>
<P>
 "Bavasi told me they needed to look at younger prospects," Buckles said. "It 
bothered me because I thought I did a pretty good job over there. It was really 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 And it was only beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckles said he was offered a coaching position in the organization's lower 
levels, which he immediately declined. He figured he would quickly sign with 
another team. But several tryouts later, Buckles was still out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Without any prospects, Buckles returned home to Fullerton as the 1992 season 
opened. His disappointment might have become depression had it not been for his 
wife, Gina. 
</P>
<P>
 They had met while students at Cal State Fullerton, and Gina always knew the 
right things to say to lift Gary's spirits. Gary returned to Fullerton to 
finish his degree in physical education. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked as a teacher's aide in the Westminster School District and started a 
car-detailing business while Gina worked as an accountant. They enjoyed being 
together, something not previously possible during the baseball season. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, though, Gina knew something was wrong. Although Gary tried to hide his 
pain, Gina saw how much he missed the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when he thought I wasn't looking, he'd go into a pitching motion or 
pretend to make a pick-off throw," Gina said. "It killed me because he was just 
kind of moping around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd call him all the time from work and say, 'Gary, did you call any teams 
today?' His answer was always, 'Well, ah, not really.' It was tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Gina's prodding paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary started making calls and was invited to spring training in 1993 for an 
audition with the Florida Marlins. Just before he left, Gina learned she was 
pregnant. The couple did not have medical insurance, which provided more 
incentive, and pressure, for Gary. 
</P>
<P>
 The tryout did not go well. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckles knocked on a few more doors in Florida, but no one was buying. Buckles 
was heading home when he passed the Cardinals' spring training facility and 
decided to plead for a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked -- and so did his pitching. St. Louis signed Buckles and assigned 
him to Louisville. The Redbirds picked up the medical bills for the birth of 
Megan Diane Buckles, now 10 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 But Buckles was not in the clear. The Redbirds considered releasing him after 
he went 4-2 with a 5.42 ERA in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary called at the end of last year and told me don't be surprised if he got 
released," Gina said. "I thought it was my fault for making him try. I cried 
for two days." 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville didn't release him. Buckles' job security, however, wasn't great. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't fit into our plans," Louisville General Manager Dale Owens said. 
"He was left in extended spring training (at St. Petersburg), which is not a 
good sign. That usually means they don't have a spot for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Against a wall again, Buckles responded with outs. He also helped the younger 
pitchers without being asked. 
</P>
<P>
 That combination earned Buckles another chance with the Redbirds. And he 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on an improved breaking ball and a knuckle-curve, which is as hard to 
hit as it sounds, Buckles at last found a groove despite not throwing more than 
86 m.p.h. Buckles was so tough on American Assn. hitters he was selected to the 
triple-A all-star game. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 5-1 with two saves and a 2.95 ERA for the Redbirds. He had pitched 64 
innings, the third-highest total in his career, when he was summoned to St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buck was outstanding," Louisville Manager Joe Pettini said. "He was the most 
consistent reliever we had. With a lot of guys, you don't know what's going to 
happen when they come in a close game. We never worried with Buck, and he did 
the same in St. Louis." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is where Buckles would still be had the major league baseball season not 
stopped Aug. 12. Wanting Buckles to continue pitching, the Cardinals optioned 
him to Louisville on Aug. 11. Cardinal Manager Joe Torre said Buckles will 
return if the strike doesn't wipe out the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckles took a few days to get settled and has had little work since 
returning. That will soon change because the Redbirds are suddenly battling for 
a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckles is eager to again contribute for the Redbirds, but he's hoping the big 
boys work things out -- soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look back on all that has happened to me, it's just amazing," Buckles 
said. "All the times I could have just said, 'Forget it.' It makes it even 
better."

BESTOWING A LOOK AT BRITAIN'S BENEFACTOR; ARTS: J. PAUL GETTY JR. HAS DONATED 
MILLIONS FOR A VARIETY OF CAUSES. NOW, A FLAP OVER HIS REASONS FOR GIVING HAS 
THROWN THE MOSTLY RECLUSIVE OIL MAGNATE INTO THE SPOTLIGHT. 
</P>

<P>
 The media here are fond of describing J. Paul Getty Jr., Britain's most famous 
living philanthropist, as a recluse. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also quick to brand some of his philanthropic gestures as slaps at an 
unloving and unloved father, the late J. Paul Getty Sr., whose fortune founded 
the Getty Museum in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempers flared over just this issue this week. Getty Jr. had pledged $1.53 
million to keep Antonio Canova's neoclassical sculpture "The Three Graces" in 
England and away from the Getty Museum, which was trying to purchase it for 
about $11.6 million. But the philanthropist threatened to rescind his offer 
when a museum official claimed in a televised interview that Getty's generosity 
was motivated by animosity toward his father. The official, Timothy Clifford of 
the National Gallery of Scotland, quickly apologized, and it now appears that 
Getty will donate the promised funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has brought this mostly reclusive man into a media spotlight he 
usually tries to avoid. Like the late billionaire Howard Hughes, Getty, 61, 
rarely grants interviews and rarely appears in public. Yet unlike the 
super-secretive Hughes, he lives openly in an apartment in London's fashionable 
St. James Place, overlooking Green Park, and is driven in a Bentley to his 
3,000-acre estate, Wormsley, in Buckinghamshire, 45 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he watches his favorite sport, cricket, with friends such as actor 
Michael Caine, played on a pitch he reportedly installed for more than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 And he occasionally attends parties with his companion, Victoria Holdsworth, 
in black tie -- sporting an abbreviated gray mustache and beard and wearing 
slightly tinted, aviator-style glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Getty is on friendly terms with the likes of Baroness Margaret Thatcher, Prime 
Minister John Major and singer Mick Jagger. Indeed, Thatcher, then prime 
minister, recommended Getty for an honorary knighthood -- honorary because he 
is still an American citizen -- which he received from Queen Elizabeth in 1985. 
Getty has lived in Britain since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Getty only makes the papers through his philanthropies. To the increasing 
annoyance of the Getty Museum, those gifts are sometimes designed to keep in 
Britain works of art that the museum is interested in acquiring. 
</P>
<P>
 A public campaign already had raised about $8.8 million to match the Malibu 
museum's offer for the Canova and keep it in Britain. The government last week 
ordered a three-month extension of the time allowed under British law to equal 
the museum's offer; with Getty's gift, only approximately $1.22 million remains 
to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past decade, Getty's philanthropy has become increasingly visible. 
He had previously given money to prevent a crucifixion painting by Duccio from 
leaving Britain for the Getty. His largest gift to date is $64.5 million in 
1985, made to help London's National Gallery finance an extension, and he has 
given about $25 million to the British Film Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also contributed to areas apart from the arts: $150,000 to striking 
miners' families in 1984, $4.4 million for a new grandstand at Lord's Cricket 
Ground in London in 1986, $3.5 million to London's Imperial War Museum, 
$750,000 to Ely Cathedral, and money to a fund for the Special Air Service 
regiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of his better-known donations are publicized, Getty also gives 
quietly to other causes. For instance, reading in 1986 that a Royal Air Force 
hero was forced to auction his medals to raise funds for a memorial to his 
Dambuster squadron, Getty immediately offered to pick up the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul Getty Jr.'s history has been a troubled one. He was actually 
christened Eugene Paul Getty, the first child by his father's fourth wife. His 
mother, Ann, married three more times, and young Getty and his brother Gordon 
were raised mainly by their maternal grandmother in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied at San Francisco State but did not graduate. He was drafted into 
the Army and served briefly in Korea. At 23, he married Gail Harris; they had 
four children, the eldest of whom was J. Paul Getty III. The others are Aileen, 
Mark and Ariadne. 
</P>
<P>
 Getty joined the family oil business and received his father's permission to 
change his name to J. Paul Getty Jr. The senior Getty's personal assistant, 
Claus von Bulow, remembers young Getty as a man of "charm, conversation and sex 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 He was divorced from Gail and married Talitha Pol, of Dutch parents, in 1966 
and became part of the international social set. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1968, Talitha had a son, whom they named Tara Gabriel Galaxy 
Gramaphone Getty. Then, while living in Rome, J. Paul Getty Jr. quit the family 
business in a chilly exchange with his father, who disapproved of his lack of 
enthusiasm for the business and involvement with drugs. The couple, discussing 
divorce, separated. Talitha moved to London from Rome into an exquisite house 
on Cheyne Walk in Chelsea. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that year she flew to Rome in hopes of a reconciliation, but under 
mysterious circumstances died overnight, apparently of a drug overdose. Getty 
left Italy -- while the case was being investigated -- for the house in London. 
Two years later, his son J. Paul III, then 16, was kidnaped in Italy and held 
for $3.35-million ransom. Getty Jr. hadn't enough cash to comply, and Getty Sr. 
at first refused to pay on the grounds that all his grandchildren would then be 
vulnerable to kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 After five months, when the abductors cut off a piece of the boy's ear and 
sent it to a Rome newspaper, the oil magnate loaned his son the additional 
money for the release of the grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, J. P. Getty III suffered a drink-and-drug-induced stroke that left 
him paralyzed and almost blind. He now gets around in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Getty Jr. rarely ventured from his Cheyne Walk home. But one 
neighbor remembers taking her dog walking late at night and chatting with him 
on a nearby park bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very pleasant, polite and informed," she recalls. "I never knew who he 
was until later." 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor recalls him at her door early one morning, in a disheveled 
state, asking to use the phone because his was out of order. She tried to help 
him with his disintegrating address book, but he finally left without making 
the call. Two hours later she received six dozen roses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, Getty entered London Clinic, where he stayed for more than a 
year for treatment of phlebitis. There, he pursued his main hobby of collecting 
antiquarian books, with particular interested in illuminated manuscripts. 
</P>
<P>
 He has purchased several at auction for more than $1 million each, and they 
form the core of a vast library of precious books that he is establishing at 
his country home, in a castle-like building made from flint stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Getty makes few statements about his relationship with his father and sons. 
But friends say the enmity among them has been overstated by the media -- that 
the old man and his son did not hate each other, though they were never close. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, they say, J. Paul Getty Jr. has no special interest in keeping works of 
art away from the Getty Museum out of spite. "It's the other way around," says 
a museum official who knows him. "He simply wants to keep the stuff in 
Britain." 
</P>
<P>
 Getty has given an estimated $210 million away in the past 10 years. His 
current annual income from trusts and other sources is estimated at nearly $50 
million.

ONE YEAR LATER, LACMA STILL SEEKS DIRECTOR; FINANCIAL AND STAFF CHAOS HAS 
SCARED AWAY APPLICANTS, BUT THE ECONOMIC PICTURE SEEMS TO BE STABILIZING; NOW 
THE SEARCH MAY BE GETTING DOWN TO THE FINAL STAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A year ago this weekend Michael E. Shapiro announced his resignation as 
director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. "I have reached the 
conclusion that it is time for another leader whose strengths might better fit 
the pressing financial needs of the museum to take the helm," Shapiro said, 
after less than 11 months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 His abrupt departure appeared to be the inevitable result of his own 
administrative inexperience and a countywide fiscal crisis that wreaked havoc 
on the museum. Shapiro's brief tenure was marked by reductions in the museum's 
funding, staff and programs. Some galleries were closed on a rotating basis, 
and the entire museum went dark on Tuesdays in addition to regular Monday 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
 These difficulties were exacerbated by an exodus of curatorial talent and a 
lawsuit filed by senior curator Maurice Tuchman, whom Shapiro effectively 
demoted. (After Shapiro left, Tuchman was reinstated.) Amid the turmoil, a 
LACMA-commissioned study revealed that the museum doesn't begin to measure up 
to its peers nationwide in endowment funds and trustee support. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed that things couldn't get much worse at the Wilshire Boulevard 
institution, and indeed they haven't. But now -- long after headlines about the 
disasters have faded -- LACMA remains director-less. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "That museum is tainted," says one prominent cultural leader who declined to 
be identified but expressed profound concern about LACMA's ability to attract 
inspired leadership and move vigorously into the future. Moreover, he said, the 
longer the museum goes without a director, the more it reinforces a perception 
that nobody wants the director's post. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who needs it?" asks one Southern California art dealer, reciting LACMA's 
well-known litany of problems. "Anyone who might be predisposed to the position 
doesn't want to deal with the trustees, who are notoriously difficult and have 
a reputation for pursuing their own interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, skeptics throughout the arts community ask why any seasoned 
professional who is up to LACMA's challenge would want the job. Museums all 
across the country -- including the venerable Museum of Modern Art in New York 
-- are going begging for directors in a climate of reduced public and private 
support, so top candidates can afford to be choosy. And, although LACMA is a 
high-profile museum that grew at a phenomenal rate in the 1980s under Earl A. 
(Rusty) Powell's leadership, it needs a director with enormous energy and 
talent to turn it around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a job for somebody who's willing to roll up his sleeves and plow into 
it, not for somebody in his last five years before going out to pasture," one 
local museum director says. "They have a lot of competition, but I think they 
will be able to get a first-rate director. LACMA is still one of the premier 
museums in the United States, and I think they have done a good job of putting 
a lot of their problems behind them. Most of the problems that remain are 
endemic to the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the challenges, William A. Mingst, president of the museum's board of 
trustees and chair of a 12-member trustee search committee, expects the museum 
to have a new director by the first of the year. Although the committee has yet 
to formally interview a single candidate, Mingst says he expects the search to 
reach its final stages by the end of September. He attributes the long delay in 
appointing a new leader to a process of putting the museum back on track so 
that desirable candidates will be attracted to the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is that I have talked to many people who are enthusiastic about 
coming to Los Angeles," Mingst says.  
</P>
<P>
 The process didn't even begin until February -- after Museum Associates, 
LACMA's private support group, negotiated a new contract with the county to 
stabilize the museum's public funding and after Mingst succeeded Robert F. 
Maguire as president of the board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Mingst and his committee are working with consultants from Korn Ferry, an 
executive search firm that has helped find directors for two other Los Angeles 
County cultural institutions -- Shelton g. Stanfill at the Music Center and 
James Powell at the Natural History Museum. The consultants, staff and 
committee have compiled about 150 names of potential candidates and advisers, 
Mingst says. Although he says that no short list exists, he expects to begin 
formal interviews within the next two weeks. As to specific individuals who may 
be under consideration, he declines to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates must be well grounded in art history and museums, he says. But the 
committee will consider "renaissance individuals" from foundations, 
universities and other institutions, as well as people in the museum community. 
However, the job will not be restructured now that county funding has been 
secured. "We still need a strong director and a deputy director who works with 
the county because there are many county issues to be dealt with, concerning 
maintenance, buildings and grounds," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the museum needs a chief who can inspire the staff and rally 
community support, Mingst says. "In all our discussions with staff and 
trustees, the word leader keeps coming up -- almost to the point of charismatic 
leader . We have a large staff that needs a unifying force." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Barron, curator of 20th-Century art and coordinator of curatorial 
affairs at LACMA, agrees: "We need someone who can generate enthusiasm. No 
matter how great an art historian you are, if you don't have leadership 
qualities, it won't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the museum appears to be in better shape now than it was a year ago, 
most of its gains come with strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-December, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge approved the settlement of 
a $100-million legal dispute involving Christian Science literature, which 
awarded $23.5 million to the museum, but LACMA has not received the money 
because the suit is under appeal. If the original decision is upheld, the 
entire award will go directly to the museum's endowment, Mingst says. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in January, the County Board of Supervisors approved a new contract with 
Museum Associates, establishing an annual base amount of $14.2 million in 
county support for the museum but requiring the private backers to contribute a 
sum equal to 80% of the public funding. Although the contract represented a 
$2.1-million drop in county funds from a peak of $16.3 million contributed in 
1991-92, it provided much-needed stability. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Board of Supervisors agreed to provide interim funding 
for the museum's acquisition of a vacant May Co. facility adjacent to LACMA, as 
the first step in developing an expanded art complex. The deal entails a bonded 
indebtedness of $25 million for the museum -- $18.3 million for the purchase of 
the property and the remainder for construction. 
</P>
<P>
 LACMA expects to use part of the property for its own programs and operations, 
while renting space to complementary cultural organizations. Proposals are 
being entertained, but no plans have been adopted and development costs have 
not been estimated, Mingst says. As it stands, the project is both an enticing 
opportunity and a daunting fund-raising burden for the museum and its new 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a $5-million county bond issue has launched a sculpture garden 
surrounding LACMA and the George C. Page Museum, which is expected to break 
ground this fall. And plans are afoot to reopen the museum on Tuesdays. To that 
end, LACMA's 11 volunteer councils have joined forces to sponsor "The Art of 
the Palate," a series of 46 fund-raising dinners on Sept. 29-30.

Q&A WITH CHUCK D.; 'WE'LL TRY TO STRETCH THE BOUNDARIES OF RAP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public Enemy is under siege. In the late '80s, the New York group with the 
innovative beats and samples and searing black-nationalist messages ruled the 
rap roost, the darling of critics and fans.  
</P>
<P>
 But things have changed. In the '90s, with gangsta rap blasting away all 
competition, some are arguing that Public Enemy's "white devil" rap is old hat. 
Public Enemy first stumbled with its 1992 album of outtakes, "Greatest Misses." 
And it hasn't been smooth sailing for the new album, "Muse Sick N Hour Mess 
Age," due Tuesday . 
</P>
<P>
 Detractors -- in particular Rolling Stone magazine and the prominent rap 
journal the Source -- started taking pre-release potshots at it last month. As 
expected, Chuck D., the group's cagey, 34-year-old leader, is striking back. At 
a West Hollywood hotel recently, he came out blasting.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What are your feelings about the reviews in Rolling Stone and the 
Source? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: They bother the hell out of me and when I see those writers I'll damn 
well let them know it -- and I won't pull any punches. They think they know me 
but they don't. They're totally ignorant about where I'm coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have those reviews done much harm? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They've been very damaging. There've been positive reviews but the big 
negative reviews have gotten all the attention. There's been a negative 
perception about the album -- a wrong perception. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With rap so youth-oriented, do you think your age works against you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I won't say it works against me, but I can't say what some 20-year-old 
rapper can say. I'd sound like a damn fool. I can relate to the young audience 
but not as a peer -- more like an older brother. Kids don't always want to hear 
what their peers have to say. They want to hear what older people say too -- as 
long as it seems relevant to them in some way. That's where we come in. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Since most rap artists are here today and gone tomorrow, how has Public 
Enemy managed to stay popular since the mid-'80s? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We stay true to our stance. They can criticize me but I won't compromise 
just to please the fans or the critics. I'm not a follower. I'm not going to 
jump on some bandwagon just to sell some records. People like what we do -- 
which is being provocative and entertaining at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you say to people who argue that your message isn't relevant? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We get knocked for talking about black genocide and the same old white 
supremacy issues. Has the problem improved? Hell no. It's still relevant to all 
black people -- and will be until it changes. The problem is that some younger 
people choose not to recognize that. They're busy hanging out and partying and 
they have fewer responsibilities. They don't want to deal with blacks being 
oppressed. It's not until they're out struggling in the real world -- working 
for peanuts and trying to feed a family -- that this ugly situation will really 
hit them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What don't you like about gangsta rap? 
</P>
<P>
 A: First of all, I don't like the term. Black men aren't gangsters -- they're 
people trying to survive. But really I don't like the fact that the music 
reinforces the negative side of the black experience. There's a positive side 
that gets lost. Listen to that music and you think nothing happens in the black 
community but shooting and killing and chasing women and smoking dope. There's 
no balance. There needs to be some positive, intelligent thinking in rap too. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you change gangsta rap? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It starts at the record companies. The real problem is with the white 
executives. They put the music out there and don't care about the impact or the 
message. It's the same old exploitation thing. All they care about is making a 
buck. I'd like to get some of them in a boxing ring in the middle of 
South-Central and box their heads off. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can Public Enemy still be a trend-setter? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, but in a different way. We're among the first rappers to last long 
enough for people to question whether we're still relevant. We'll set trends in 
other areas -- which ones we don't know yet. We'll try to stretch the 
boundaries of rap just like we always tried to do.

FIRST ROCK, THEN BLUES, NOW COUNTRIFIED FARE; RESTAURANTS: CITYWALK'S COUNTRY 
STAR IS PART DINER, PART MUSEUM AND PART ARCADE. IT JOINS THE ENTERTAINMENT

<P>
 It's getting so that when you want to dine out, you don't just have to decide 
what kind of food you want, but what kind of music you like. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, a recent survey showed that by far, country music is the 
favorite of the nation's regular restaurant diners. Robert Schuster and Peter 
Feinstein are banking on it. 
</P>
<P>
 They're the chairman and president of Country Star, a restaurant opening on 
Universal City's CityWalk on Monday that's part down-home diner, part country 
museum and part music video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the latest in the trend of music-oriented eateries a la the Hard Rock 
Cafe and the House of Blues, as well as the latest step in the infiltration of 
country music into the pop mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuster and Feinstein would argue, though, that country isn't infiltrating 
the mainstream -- it is the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "Country is a real family thing," says Schuster, sitting with Feinstein at a 
leather-toned booth in the restaurant while workmen scurried around putting 
finishing touches on the facility. "This is a restaurant that adds an 
entertainment component directly related to family values." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it will be hard to escape entertainment at Country Star, with a 
state-of-the-art sound system, interactive stations with artist information and 
profiles, displays of country memorabilia and 96 video screens -- including 
small monitors in the restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hard Rock and Planet Hollywood have proven that people are looking for 
entertainment to go with their hamburger," says Feinstein. "If you are 
delivering an entertainment element that goes with food, everybody wins."  
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, though not a live music venue per se, Country Star will be 
available for record and film companies for album and movie release parties and 
a portion of the club can be converted into a stage for special performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a lot of Hollywood sensory-overload for down-home country music, 
but the partners say that the concept has been embraced by the country 
community, both here and in Nashville. Country stars Wynonna Judd, Vince Gill 
and Reba McEntire and TV talk-show hosts Lorianne Crook and Charlie Chase have 
signed on as "celebrity representatives" of the venture (as well as 
shareholders), and numerous other performers have loaned the restaurant stage 
clothes and other items for their displays.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those representatives will be on hand for an invitation-only grand opening on 
Sunday, a night of countrypolitan cross-pollination with Hollywood that is 
expected to draw a number of film and sports stars. For fans who want to do 
some star-gazing, bleachers will be set up outside and celeb interviews will be 
conducted by Crook and Chase.  
</P>
<P>
 J.D. Freeman, general manager of L.A. country radio station KZLA-FM -- which 
will be broadcasting from Sunday's opening -- notes that "Southern California 
is the largest market for country music in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Schuster, 51, and Feinstein, 50, have never represented themselves as country 
born-and-bred. Milwaukee native Schuster, a lawyer, started in the music 
business in the '60s as partner with Albert Grossman, managing Bob Dylan, the 
Band and others. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '70s he moved away from music, representing authors and others, but 
five years ago he discovered country as he started negotiating book deals for 
several stars, including Naomi Judd and Garth Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been listening to classic rock stations, but when I heard new country 
music I realized that it was a continuation of the kinds of music I'd always 
liked," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, realizing his own discovery mirrored the growing popularity of 
country, he started developing the idea for a country restaurant chain. Last 
year he recruited L.A.-reared Feinstein, co-owner of the Spectrum health clubs 
chain, who admits that he wasn't a country fan until Schuster took him to a 
Garth Brooks concert last year in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 For restaurant expertise they turned to Robert Morris, who founded 
Gladstone's, among other ventures, and brought in executive chef Layne Wootten, 
whose way with the likes of chili and ribs is well known in the country 
community -- he recently served as tour chef for the group Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of their grand opening, the executives are already planning moves 
into other regions. Groundbreaking is scheduled for Las Vegas in December, with 
a June opening targeted, and London is being considered for the first 
international expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can tap into the family values theme so often expressed by country 
artists, they say, the venture will be a success. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a family, dance halls and honky-tonks are not the place where you 
take your 8-year-old daughter," Schuster says. "This is a place you can."

TV ADVOCATES TO THE RESCUE IN 'THE CRUSADERS'; TELEVISION: THE SERIES HAS BEEN 
CRITICIZED FOR SENDING DO-GOODER REPORTERS TO RIGHT ALLEGED WRONGS. 'WHAT IS 
WRONG WITH TRYING TO HELP PEOPLE?' ASKS A CRUSADER.

 Look, up in the sky. It's a bird, it's a plane, it's . . . a journalist? 
</P>
<P>
 The real-life reporters on "The Crusaders" neither fly nor wear capes as they 
roam the country battling red tape and bureaucracy, but they act like Supermen 
and Superwomen nonetheless, using their journalistic savvy and the power of TV 
cameras to right wrongs on behalf of the little people. 
</P>
<P>
 There's one looking into health insurance fraud -- confronting the alleged bad 
guy on the street with her camera rolling, cajoling a government agency to take 
action against him and then finding a doctor and a hospital to perform a 
sight-saving operation for free on a woman who was allegedly defrauded. 
</P>
<P>
 There's another getting a couple of Florida teen-agers released from Haiti 
after a U.S. immigration mix-up that kept them from their homes for months. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's still another persuading the National Wildlife Federation to file 
a lawsuit demanding that Amtrak cease its routine policy of dumping human waste 
on the railroad tracks in Glacier National Park because the scent attracts 
grizzly bears to the rails, where they are all too frequently run down by 
speeding trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Airing locally on Saturdays at 7 p.m. on KNBC-TV Channel 4 and seen in about 
90% of the country, the syndicated series, produced by Disney, uncovers real 
problems and injustices through what its producers and reporters insist is 
sound journalism, and then goes one step further -- a step most journalists are 
taught and expected not to make: The reporters get personally involved as 
advocates in an effort to solve the problem for the victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this great frustration in this country that things just don't 
function like they used to," said John Butte, who helped launch the show a year 
ago as its first executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with the notion that 'Shoot, we're America!' and if there was a 
problem, you solved it. Now we don't have that attitude any longer and, 
instead, we have a fear that nothing is going to get solved and things are only 
going to get worse. So we wanted to see if we could do an investigative news 
program where we identified problems and then showed that problems can be 
solved." 
</P>
<P>
 Butte, a former TV news director in Tampa, Fla., left the show earlier this 
year. The series has gone through a number of upheavals and personnel in its 
quest for higher visibility and higher ratings in the last six months, but, as 
it prepares for its second season, staffers say the main business of the show 
is unaltered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And that's a business -- crusading rather than simply reporting -- that gives 
some news purists the willies. They don't condemn what "The Crusaders" does -- 
as long as the producers don't call what they do "news." Warren Olney, for 
example, a veteran local television journalist, insisted that once a reporter 
crosses the line and becomes an advocate, he or she ceases to be a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The distinction is important because reporters are supposed to find truth, to 
present things in a fair and balanced way and let their readers or viewers make 
up their own minds," said Olney, who currently moderates a daily radio program 
about local issues on KCRW-FM (89.9). He said he declined an invitation to 
audition for "The Crusaders" last year. "When you become an advocate, you're 
not doing that, and I'm not sure that TV viewers watch critically enough to 
know the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Olney said that as long as more traditional reporting thrives, a show like 
"The Crusaders" has a place and can be of benefit. But he expressed concern 
"for the fate of my profession as shows like this proliferate, because it 
changes the expectations of viewers, so that instead of looking for information 
or even provocative analysis from the media and then looking to themselves for 
answers, they look to TV to be fed an opinion and told what to think." 
</P>
<P>
 Producers and reporters at "The Crusaders" say they don't find going to the 
person who can fix a problem and asking them to do so either inconsistent with 
journalism or confusing to viewers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, journalists shine a light on some problem, and, hopefully, the 
people who see it will care enough to change it themselves," Butte said. "But 
our ability to shine the light on problems has far exceeded society's ability 
to solve those problems. The list of problems is too long for anyone to do 
anything about, and that has led to the frustration. So for us to say these 
problems can get solved, and get people off the dime to do it, seems like a 
positive step, even if it's not for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Crusaders" reporters, most of whom came from local stations around the 
country, concede that it was tough at first to cross the line and become an 
advocate, but now they find it more rewarding than their previous jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us felt a little strange the first few times we got involved," said 
reporter Mark Hyman. He recalled a story he did about a sheriff in Three Forks, 
Mont., who was battling the town's elite because of his crackdown on drunk 
driving, which required Hyman to go before the City Council to help save the 
man's job. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I, as a reporter, didn't want to do that," Hyman said. "But I had to do 
it to get my point across. In the old days, I covered the story, and then I 
went back to the station and reported it. Now, I'm only half done. The other 
half is finding a resolution -- and to do that, I have to get involved. It's 
not for everyone. And this show is not for everyone. It's a good niche, but it 
doesn't replace local news." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Gingold, assistant professor of journalism at USC, said that as long as 
the audience perceives it as entertainment with a dash of information thrown in 
for good measure, providing the public with a powerful TV advocate is 
commendable in many ways. He nonetheless shares the concern that the format of 
the show forces the reporter to become a prosecutor, rather than someone who 
simply provides information. And that's a treacherous role, he said, because 
anyone who has worked in news for a while knows that most situations are not 
simply black and white, good guy against the bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's become this gonzo journalism where the reporter becomes the star and 
suddenly takes on the role of both the judge and jury determined to make some 
guy pay for his crime," Gingold said. "That's not what a reporter has ever 
really been supposed to do, except maybe for Clark Kent -- and even he had to 
change into another person in order to right the wrong. It's dangerous because 
at some point the reporter can make a mistake or a misjudgment, especially if 
he is under pressure to find a solution simply to suit the show's format." 
</P>
<P>
 Such admonitions are far overblown, according to Howard Thompson, another 
"Crusader" reporter, who is unashamed and unrepentant about being a 
self-appointed public do-gooder. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is wrong with trying to help people?" he asked. "The media are a very 
powerful institution in this country, and if we first adhere to all the basic 
tenets of journalism and tell both sides of the story, and then we become 
advocates and try to help people fight City Hall, what is the problem with 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who previously worked as a news reporter in New York, said he got 
tired of defending his profession at parties, tired of having garbage thrown at 
him when he went into certain communities by people who thought the media were 
making things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt like I was just piling on -- here's another shooting, here's 
another racial attack, here's another senseless death," Thompson said. 
"Everything negative that happened, we're going to give you some more. Nothing 
was changing. It was just a big sausage grinder. Here, I really feel like I can 
accomplish something."

CAUTION AND CONTROVERSY; DIRECTOR STEELS HIMSELF FOR ANY RESPONSE TO 'AUNT DAN 
AND LEMON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 South Coast Repertory realized it was juggling a hot one when the company 
staged "Aunt Dan and Lemon" in 1988. Orange Coast College's Repertory Theatre 
Company feels the same heat as its production of Wallace Shawn's controversial 
drama opens tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing full well that "Aunt Dan and Lemon," with its spate of graphic sex and 
Nazi-glorifying monologues, has created uproar after uproar since premiering in 
1985 at the Public Theater in New York, SCR warned audiences ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 The playhouse even stuck Shawn's own eight-page essay, "When Morality Fails 
Us," in the program to explain the ideology and satire at the core of "Aunt Dan 
and Lemon." That may have helped some, but not much. The run was greeted with 
dozens of walkouts and a passel of angry letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Golson, who's directing the student production, admitted he's worried and 
prepared for anything. Golson, the drama department chairman, said that, as a 
precaution, OCC may follow SCR's example and include some of Shawn's writings 
on the piece in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always concerned about this one because we don't want to offend anybody, 
(but) also we want to stay true to what Shawn is saying," Golson explained. 
"Shawn said he wants everybody to be forced into confronting the destructive 
ideas (in the play) and be challenged by them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't want anybody to be too comfortable, (and you) wonder how the 
audience will react." 
</P>
<P>
 The play focuses on Lemon, a young woman, and her older mentor, Aunt Dan (for 
Danielle). A series of soliloquies lets us know what these two honest but 
not-so-lovable characters are all about. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemon, anorexic and talkative, denounces hypocrites, then extends the argument 
to a sort of perverse respect for the Nazis. At least they never apologized for 
the Holocaust, she says. Lemon adds off-handedly that she's only felt sympathy 
for fictional characters, not for real people who have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Aunt Dan, she raises Henry Kissinger to the highest pedestal, arguing 
that he saved the American way of life during the Vietnam years. She's the 
ideal conservative revisionist, painting the world in a way that agrees with 
her principles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aunt Dan's take on things is sure to rankle some, but Lemon's seemingly 
anti-Semitic ramblings rocked the house at SCR. It may do the same at OCC, 
Golson said, but he wants audiences to understand that Shawn is making valid 
points about how we view life. 
</P>
<P>
 "By taking a 24-year-old (Lemon), someone who's pretty and we'd think probably 
has high morals, and then exposing her evil side, Shawn wants us to see" how 
evil can spring from the most ordinary of people, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "In his writings, he's gone even further, saying that we can't be hypocrites 
and accept an easy life. We have to look at what Hitler did versus what we did 
in our own history, that we (victimized) the American Indian (and that we 
should question) our own foreign policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Golson said he and his cast will stick with what Shawn intended, choosing not 
to eliminate or change any of the dialogue. But some of the drama's sexual 
fireworks will be toned down, mainly to conform to the college's policy of no 
nudity. 
</P>
<P>
 Flashbacks recounting Aunt Dan's sexual interludes from her youthful days in 
London break up the lengthy series of monologues. In more explicit productions, 
there were frank simulations of oral copulation and death-by-strangulation as a 
climaxing moment. 
</P>
<P>
 At SCR, this particular scene was staged with a prostitute in a black slip and 
her customer in his underwear. At OCC, the view will be even less provocative, 
with the action more muted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The actors are fully dressed; that's one thing," Golson said. "Another is 
they start but the woman stops him from continuing. We have to soft-pedal it 
(because) the college won't let us go that far." 
</P>
<P>
 Golson said the play is obviously difficult, but it can be fascinating as 
well. He first saw it produced in San Francisco in 1988 and said he couldn't 
get it out of his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very bewildered and very intrigued at the same time, not knowing really 
what it was all about," he recalled. "It stuck with me, so it wasn't typical. I 
like plays about ideas and words, and this is certainly one of those plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The college never said anything to me about not doing 'Aunt Dan and Lemon' 
(because of the potential controversy), and the students were very enthusiastic 
about it. They said stuff like 'Wow, this is an intriguing, challenging work!' 
That's what they look for." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an indirect way, "Aunt Dan and Lemon" also has topical import, he said. 
Because of "Schindler's List," the drama appeals to students who are learning 
more about the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 Golson said any interest in recent history is valuable because so many of his 
students seem ignorant about what has come before them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit that I'm often surprised to have to explain to them aspects 
of the Holocaust," he said. "Many of them just aren't aware of it. Some haven't 
even heard of it. It's startling." 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange Coast College's production of Wallace Shawn's "Aunt Dan and Lemon" 
opens tonight at 8 in the Drama Lab Studio, 2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. 
Performances continue Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. and Sundays at 3 p.m.

THEATER; THAT'S THE TICKET FOR ATTENDANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The credo of that grand old dame, the Laguna Playhouse, might well be: "Give 
'em what they want and they will come." On the eve of its 75th season, Orange 
County's oldest theater company has shown remarkable growth, particularly at a 
time when many troupes are glad just to be holding their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Playhouse attendance at the Moulton Theater in Laguna Beach has increased 21% 
over the last five years, according to executive director Richard Stein, with 
total annual income rising 42% for the same period. Meanwhile, last season's 
subscribers are flocking back at a record pace. And he expects a younger, 
larger, more diversified audience of non-subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit playhouse sold a total of 64,000 tickets in the 1993-94 season 
and had overall income of $1.24 million -- $8,500 more than expenditures -- 
Stein said earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 That contrasts with 53,000 tickets and $875,000 for the 1989-90 season, when 
the playhouse ran a $96,000 deficit. The playhouse's preliminary budget for 
next season is $1.36 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had our highest rate of subscription renewals since I've been here," 
said Stein, who took over in 1990. "That is a vote of confidence from our 
existing audience." Eight out of every 10 subscribers have signed up again. 
</P>
<P>
 But new subscriptions have lagged, confirming signs that 1) many playgoers 
want greater flexibility in picking shows than the traditional season 
subscription and 2) theaters may have to adjust their season-ticket policies if 
they want to thrive, no matter what the appeal of their shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a shift from the heavy subscriber audiences of the '70s and 
'80s to more single-ticket buying," Stein noted. "It's partly a function of the 
economy. People seem reluctant to buy now for something they will get later. 
It's also a function of younger audiences with a more spontaneous lifestyle. 
They prefer to pick and choose shows as the whim strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 The playhouse still depends on subscribers for the overwhelming majority of 
its audience, though last season's subscription base of roughly 7,700 season 
ticket-holders (the same number anticipated for next season) was down from a 
record high of 8,800 three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But single-ticket buyers more than made up for that decline, and Stein sees 
future growth increasingly tied to theatergoers who don't necessarily want to 
see every production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, the playhouse now offers a season ticket called the FlexPass, 
which entitles patrons to a variable combination of admissions instead of a 
traditional subscription for the same seat on the same night for each play. 
What the FlexPass sacrifices in seating preference it gains in user-friendly 
scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
 "More creative thinking has to go into developing audiences," Stein said. 
"Changing trends in society dictate more diverse audiences, and we have to 
realize some of those people will not subscribe to the customary season tickets 
offered by most companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we still need to forge a link between the audience and the theater, as 
opposed to a one-shot ticket buyer," he added. "Over and above the financial 
security that subscriptions provide for the theater, they establish an extended 
artistic relationship with the audience. You miss that if most of your patrons 
come on a sporadic basis." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 PLAY IT AGAIN, ART: Despite its name, the Alternative Repertory Theatre offers 
mainstream plays almost exclusively. Next season, for example, it will produce 
"Macbeth," "The Death of a Salesman" and "The Effect of Gamma Rays on 
Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, however, ART will launch a New Play Festival (to run 
tonight through Sunday) at its storefront theater in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been five years since we've done readings of any new works, and we've 
never done a whole festival before," ART artistic director Patricia L. Terry 
said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Three original scripts will receive staged readings, all at 8 p.m.: S. Michele 
McFadden's "Circles," (Friday); Bill Barnett's "Sometimes a Cigar Is Just a 
Cigar," (Saturday); Laurie Freed's "Saucer City" (Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
 Terry describes the first as "a character exploration" of five women who meet 
for a 50th birthday party, the second as "a very funny multicultural ethnic 
piece" about a Jewish family and a black family, and the third as "a 
psycho-mystery" about a government conspiracy to hide UFO phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket proceeds will go to ART's air-conditioning fund. So far the troupe has 
raised $2,500 toward a much-need cooling unit in its small venue. It is looking 
to raise another $2,500. Single-ticket admission is $5. The troupe is also 
offering a "New Play Festival Package" for $50. 
</P>
<P>
 Come again? 
</P>
<P>
 The package price includes admission to all three plays, a $20 donation for 
the fund and a down payment on a "pay-as-you-go" subscription for next season.

 GOING, GOING . . . : The imminent fate of the Irvine Barclay Theatre does not 
hang in the balance. But representatives of its three owners -- the city of 
Irvine, UC Irvine and the nonprofit Barclay management company -- met Thursday 
night behind closed doors to discuss the theater's long-term financial 
self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Irvine now contributes $425,000 to the Barclay's annual operating 
budget. UCI contributes $212,000. Both would like to see the day when they 
don't have to put up that kind of money. Barclay President Douglas C. Rankin 
said earlier this week he did not expect any immediate changes.  
</P>
<P>
 Deanna Manning, manager of Irvine's department of community services, agreed: 
"The city is committed to the theater. But it wants to take a look at the 
agreement to see if there is any way for all three parties to position 
themselves better. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning said she did not expect to see "any definitive decision" about future 
city contributions "until next spring at the earliest," when the city 
formulates its budget for fiscal 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's meeting, held at the Taco Bell headquarters in Irvine, "is just the 
beginning of discussions," she said.

THEATER REVIEW; 'PAJAMA GAME' LAPSES INTO LULLABY OF BROADWAY

<P>
 When Richard Adler and Jerry Ross' "The Pajama Game" opened in New York in 
1954, it was the brightest, brashest, freshest musical Broadway had seen in 
many seasons.

 Despite solid work from the cast, the Lake Forest II Showboaters' production 
of this show, about union and management shenanigans at the Sleep-Tite Pajama 
factory, is quite tired, not at all brash or fresh.  
</P>
<P>
 Leesa DiLallo is a fine Babe, head of the union grievance committee. She has a 
sure voice with a burnished tone that's just right for her powerful songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Peter Deutschman sings well as new superintendent Sid, at times it 
sounds as if he would be more comfortable in a lower key. But they're a good 
Babe and Sid, who eventually find love in spite of being on opposite sides of 
the struggle.  
</P>
<P>
 Rita Turchetta's Gladys is often funny, as she should be, but Turchetta would 
be more effective playing her comedy at a less histrionic level. The light of 
her love, "time-study man" Hines, is played by Roy Fussell with more restraint, 
and he gets his laughs more honestly: through character. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the company tries hard, but they are at the mercy of Neal Visser's 
turgid direction, with pauses you could drive a bus through. They are also 
hampered throughout by leisurely tempos taken by musical director Jeffrey 
Nottke, who forgets that Broadway ballads need pep and that bright tempos help 
singers immeasurably. 
</P>

<P>
 Sid's and Babe's "There Once Was a Man" is the only number that ever gets up 
to steam, and DiLallo and Deutschman seem grateful for finally being able to 
give their all. Toni Colley's admirable choreography is a plus, in spite of 
slow tempos. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's biggest problem is its uncredited scenic design. The group is 
simply unable to reverse its large walls in an efficient amount of time. Waits 
between scenes are longer than most of the musical numbers, and the show's 
three-hour length could have been considerably shortened by simplifying the 
design. A whole room does not have to be built to let the audience know where 
they are.

 UCLA hospital -- In an article in Sunday's editions, the UCLA Medical School 
was incorrectly included among a group of elite teaching hospitals responding 
to changes in health care. The article should have named UCLA Medical Center, a 
private Los Angeles hospital closely affiliated with the medical school.
