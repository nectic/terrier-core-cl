OFFER BY SAVE THE RAMS NOT IN THE BALLPARK, TEAM PRESIDENT WARNS; PRO SPORTS: 
OTHER CITIES' PROPOSALS MUCH MORE LUCRATIVE, HE SAYS. HOMETOWN LOYALTY COUNTS 
LITTLE.

 When Rams President John Shaw huddles with Save the Rams task force leaders 
next week for the first time since they gave him their pitch for keeping the 
team in Anaheim, one thing will be clear: Their deal doesn't measure up. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Friday that the much-hyped proposal, presented to team officials on 
Aug. 24, is "optimistic" about where the cash will come from to sweeten the 
deal and remains financially inferior to offers from other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we maximize the dollars out of the proposal in Anaheim, it is not equal to 
what was being offered in newer facilities in Baltimore and St. Louis," said 
Shaw, whose accountants have been researching the proposed deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In a wide-ranging interview with The Times, the team president said that while 
he feels for longtime Rams fans, hometown loyalty will play little part in the 
franchise's decision whether to stay or leave. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city and the team long ago "made it clear that our relationship is 
strictly a business relationship. . . . I would say (Anaheim's) obligation at 
this point is to offer us a competitive deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The enigmatic Rams executive also said for the first time that he would not 
rule out a controversial admissions tax on sporting and amusement venues -- 
which the Rams have historically opposed -- to broker a deal in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 And Shaw indicated that the final sprint in the race to win the Rams may have 
started, as he also plans to meet with Baltimore Orioles owner and Rams suitor 
Peter D. Angelos in Los Angeles "sometime in the next two weeks." Shaw had told 
The Times recently that Baltimore "stands willing to do a deal. . . . If we 
wanted to proceed in that case we could proceed rapidly." 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, Shaw, who says he has been given "full discretion" to negotiate 
the team's move by owner Georgia Frontiere, said the Rams are nowhere close to 
making a decision. And he admits his talks with Baltimore could be complicated 
by the recent death of Tampa Bay Buccaneers owner Hugh Culverhouse. The team is 
now owned by a trust and is rumored to be for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think that if Peter Angelos could buy the Bucs and own all of it and 
do that soon that, that would be very attractive to him," Shaw said. "But I'm 
not sure he could do any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams plan to move in time for the 1995 season, they must give the 
National Football League notice 30 days before the start of the March NFL 
winter meeting, where the other owners would vote on the relocation. Shaw said 
it may be possible to call a special meeting after that date. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Shaw said that if a deal is not inked in time for the 1995 season, 
the team just might stay put for another year of stadium shopping. The Rams 
gave notice May 3 that they were activating a 15-month escape clause in their 
30-year stadium lease, but the clause can be rescinded at any time before 
August, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing that says we have to move for the '95 season," Shaw said. "We 
could revoke our notice with the city of Anaheim and do this again sometime in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw made it clear that the proposal by the Save the Rams task force -- a 
group of local business leaders and politicians working to keep the team in 
Anaheim -- needs a lot of work to be viable. Unlike previous deals brokered for 
other teams that have moved, such as the Indianapolis Colts' departure from 
Baltimore, the offer included no ticket guarantees, Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also lacks the one element Shaw has previously demanded: a new 
stadium. But he said that not having a new stadium would not be a "deal 
breaker." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're still of the mind that with the remodeled stadium . . . they will be 
able to put a financial package together that is as competitive as these other 
cities," he said. "I'm not sure that a remodeled stadium could get there, but 
they keep telling me that they will get there." 
</P>
<P>
 One key bargaining chip that hasn't been brought up in negotiations is terms 
of the Anaheim Stadium lease. The team currently pays the city up to $400,000 a 
year in rent, 7.5% of ticket revenue, 20% of luxury box revenue and about half 
of parking and concessions. In Baltimore, for example, the team has been 
offered a sweetheart lease of $1 per game and all revenues from sky boxes, club 
seats, parking and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said that he expects the Anaheim lease to be renegotiated as part of any 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said an amusement tax would "not be out of the question," although 
such a tax, which would add fees to admission to entertainment venues, 
including Disneyland and stadium events, has long been opposed by the Rams, 
California Angels and Walt Disney Co. Disney officials, in fact, have warned 
that such a tax could kill the company's planned $3-billion theme park 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the Save the Rams task force hasn't addressed such key issues as 
whether a baseball stadium will be built for Anaheim Stadium's co-tenants, the 
Angels, and, if so, where the Angels will play while it is under construction 
</P>
<P>
 "Those larger type of issues . . . we're going to address in this next meeting 
and then talk about some sort of financial projections," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Steinberg, Save the Rams co-chairman and Newport Beach sports agent, 
said in a later interview that the task force would be ready and, in fact, had 
anticipated some of Shaw's questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working feverishly the last three weeks and we have a clarified 
and stronger position," he said. "I think next week's meeting will be a 
promising one." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Steinberg declined to detail all the new elements of the deal, he 
said the task force is prepared to "take over" the marketing of all the Rams' 
season tickets and luxury boxes, has refined the stadium renovation proposal 
and is considering establishing an Orange County Sports Authority that would be 
charged with retaining professional sports franchises in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said task force members are "less concerned with the necessity of 
exactly matching proposals from other sites than presenting a competitive and 
financially sound package that would enable the Rams to stay here profitably." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Steinberg said, the offer from other cities may be financially 
reckless. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody on our committee has any intention of putting Orange County or Anaheim 
in financial jeopardy to match the fiscal irresponsibility of every 
sports-starved municipality in the country," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said he thought hometown loyalty should play a big part in 
negotiations for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fan loyalty, which is so necessary to support professional franchises, 
presumes that franchises will not move as long as there are local buyers or 
local resources made available to keep the team," he said.

IRVINE UNIFIED SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT TO RESIGN; EDUCATION: DAVID E. BROWN'S 
DECISION TO MOVE TO NAPA VALLEY UNIFIED STUNS ASSOCIATES. DISTRICT FLOURISHED 
UNDER HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 David E. Brown, who has overseen some of the county's best schools for the 
past seven years as superintendent of the Irvine Unified School District, 
unexpectedly announced Friday that he will resign his post and leave the 
district in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 53, said he has accepted the top job at Napa Valley Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 "This job meets a personal interest I had in getting a different quality of 
life," Brown said in an interview Friday. "But I didn't seek a position. This 
was a recruitment. I've been in Orange and Los Angeles counties for 25 years, 
and the notion of being in a rural environment has always been an interest of 
mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown leaves a school district widely praised for high test scores and 
nationally distinguished schools to go to a less well-known district 
headquartered in Napa with 29 schools and 16,000 students. He said that money 
is not an issue in the move and that he will be earning roughly the same 
$105,000 annual salary he receives in Irvine, which has 31 schools and 22,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is the second superintendent of a high-profile county school district to 
leave in recent months. In August, Rudy M. Castruita, superintendent of the 
Santa Ana Unified School District, the county's largest, departed to take over 
the top post at the San Diego County Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Irvine Unified, where classes began Thursday, parents, teachers and 
school officials were stunned by Brown's surprise announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a large degree of shock and disbelief," said Deputy Supt. Paul 
Reed, a former teacher in the district and protege of founding superintendent 
A. Stanley Corey, the only other superintendent the 21-year-old district has 
had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven years is a sign of a pretty solid track record," added Tom Burnham, a 
trustee since 1992 who was a member of the executive search firm hired by the 
district to recruit Brown in 1987. "Today, if you have a superintendent for 
more than four or five years, you're doing pretty well. It is a loss for the 
district, but it's also a chance for reflection and renewal." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacquie Boslet, president of the districtwide Parent Teacher Assn. Council, 
said, "As a community, I think parents will be disappointed and hurt that he's 
leaving, but I think they'll understand. There will be a lot of thank yous and 
a lot of praise." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he has tentative plans to leave his post by Nov. 1, or soon 
thereafter. He will continue to serve as superintendent full time until then, 
he said. The Irvine school board is to begin discussions on a search for a new 
superintendent at its next regular meeting Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Napa Valley school district officials, who visited Irvine schools this week as 
part of reviewing Brown's qualifications, said Brown was selected in the past 
few days from a field that began with 60 candidates. He will replace former 
superintendent Jack Gybes, who left the district in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown "really stood out," said James L. Teplin, interim superintendent of Napa 
Valley Unified. "We like his leadership style, his integrity and honesty. We 
think he's an outstanding educator. Whomever we contacted in the state, they 
were complimentary of his management style and his knowledge of good 
instruction." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, however, refused to take much credit for the success of the district, 
where schools and students are accustomed to being at the top of academic 
accolade lists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We continued to improve, but any notion that it was my doing would not be 
appropriate," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, University High School's Class of 1994 posted scores of more than 
200 points above the state and national average on the Scholastic Aptitude Test 
for college-bound seniors. Eighty percent of the class took the admissions 
exam, nearly double the participation rate of California and the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 All three Irvine Unified high schools have been named National Distinguished 
Schools, the highest academic accolade a secondary school can earn. District 
schools routinely place among the county's top performers on various 
standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
 While many agree that Irvine Unified's stellar academic reputation preceded 
Brown, they said he maintained and enhanced it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a community of professional people who value education, you're 
bound to have strong support for the schools, said John F. Dean, superintendent 
of the Orange County Department of Education. "But you take that interest and 
you combine it with (Brown's) kind of leadership, and you have a winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Corey, the first superintendent, individual Irvine schools had a great 
degree of autonomy from central decision-making. Although Brown reluctantly 
increased some centralization of operations to cope with budget shortfalls, 
teachers and administrators say he preserved the independence of individual 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Cops, who has been principal of Woodbridge High School since it opened in 
1980, said, "This is not a top-down-type district where the superintendent sets 
everything in motion. Dave Brown certainly accepted that philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he plans to continue his style of decentralized management in Napa 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a native of Lennox in Los Angeles County, was superintendent of the San 
Marino Unified School District in Los Angeles County for seven years. He was 
previously a high school principal and cross-country coach.

FRENCH NAMED PERMANENT CHIEF OF ORANGE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the troubled Orange Unified School District ended a wide-ranging 
search for a permanent superintendent Friday when they named Robert L. French, 
acting head of the district, to the post. 
</P>
<P>
 French, a 63-year-old career educator, will stay on as head of a 
26,000-student district that has not had a permanent leader since May, 1992. 
During the interim, trustees have faced mammoth budget woes, a strike by 
non-teaching employees, sexual harassment lawsuits and a revolving door of 
interim superintendents. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members, who personally interviewed scores of French's former 
employers and colleagues before making the selection, said French's ability to 
work with various factions in academic environments was the key to his getting 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has the capability of taking very difficult problems and explaining them 
to everyone and bringing them all together," said board member Robert H. 
Viviano. "He is an excellent mover of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders said they have been impressed with French during his short stint 
as interim superintendent, which began July 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been honest with me. He appears to be wanting to solve problems," said 
David Reger, president of the teachers union. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hard school board to work with. It's going to take every skill he has 
to work with this board," Reger added. "That will be his true test as a 
superintendent: how he can give direction to the school board." 
</P>
<P>
 French, who was assistant dean for the School of Education at USC before 
becoming interim superintendent, said he has had no problems with the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find them very cooperative, very open and very willing to learn," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 French said he has been attracted to the district for years because of the 
staff and the community. "I had always held Orange on a pedestal," he said. 
"For all factions in that community, education is very important to them." 
</P>
<P>
 French came to the interview process with 38 years of educational experience 
behind him, a resume that helped him win the post over 24 other candidates, 
said board President Maureen Aschoff. 
</P>
<P>
 He began his career as a chemistry teacher in the Whittier Union School 
District in 1956 and went on to work in Huntington Beach and Fullerton before 
becoming superintendent of the Piedmont and then the Beverly Hills unified 
school districts.  
</P>
<P>
 The district's $105-million budget is balanced, but only after trustees made 
cuts of more than $11 million in the past three years. Its reserve fund is 
still shy of the state-mandated minimum level by $170,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy also continues over three administrators the district accused of 
sexual harassment in December. The three officials filed countersuits against 
the district. One administrator, Chief Fiscal Officer Joyce Capelle, filed a 
lawsuit in Superior Court in August to force the district to hold a hearing or 
drop the case. Those lawsuits are pending. French will have a strategic 
planning workshop with the school board at 6 p.m. Monday. A preliminary 
analysis of the current budget has led him to conclude that it is possible to 
boost salaries of teachers and staff.

WOMAN, 20, DISAPPEARS; LAST SEEN AT BUS STOP; CRIME: PLACENTIA POLICE ARE 
INVESTIGATING. THEY FEAR THE FULLERTON COLLEGE STUDENT, A RECENT IMMIGRANT FROM 
IRAQ, MAY HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police said Friday that a 20-year-old woman last seen Tuesday afternoon 
waiting for bus may have been abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are treating the disappearance of Mahtab Ghalandar, a Fullerton 
College student, as a "suspicious missing persons case" and are asking the 
public for help in locating her, said Corinne Loomis, a spokeswoman for the 
Placentia Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappearance comes seven months after another Placentia woman, Cal State 
Fullerton student Cathy Torrez, vanished while on her way home from work. 
Torrez's body was found a week after her disappearance, and the homicide 
remains unsolved. She had been stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they know of no connections between the two cases. But for some 
residents, Ghalandar's disappearance has revived the trauma of the Torrez 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction is that my stomach turned," said Mayor Norman Z. Eckenrode. 
"We've already had one incident like this and I'm praying we don't have another 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they remain baffled by the Ghalandar case four days after she was 
reported missing by her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "She vanished. . . . She had maybe $20 in her purse, the clothes she was 
wearing and her books from school," Loomis said. "We know of no motive for her 
to run away. This is very out of character for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Ghalandar lives with her parents and a younger sister in a Placentia 
apartment. The family moved to the United States from Iran about a year ago, 
Loomis said. Like her parents, Ghalandar speaks little English. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Ghalandar is 5-foot-5, weighs about 140 pounds and has dark brown 
hair and brown eyes. She was last seen Tuesday about 2:15 p.m. standing at a 
bus stop on Chapman Avenue across the street from Fullerton College. She was 
wearing an oatmeal-colored shirt with flowers on it and a gold chain with 
Arabic letters, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghalandar's family said they knew something was wrong when she did not return 
home Tuesday afternoon. Ghalandar had plans with her sister to pick up some 
photos from a drug store later that day, police and family members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family went to the Placentia Police Department Tuesday evening and filed a 
missing persons report. A detective was assigned to the case within hours, 
Police Chief Manuel Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that when we put this out . . . (it) conjured up (memories of) Cathy," 
Ortega said. "That's why we're doing everything and will follow up on 
everything until we run out of leads." 
</P>
<P>
 Loomis said that the detective's first task was to determine whether Ghalandar 
ran away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators became convinced Thursday that foul play was involved after they 
tracked down a Fullerton College classmate who said he walked Ghalandar to the 
bus stop on Tuesday at 2:15 p.m., Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before going to the bus stop, Ghalandar called a family friend to see if 
he could pick her up, police said. But the friend could not drive her home 
because he was en route to Laguna Beach to buy a car, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend was in Laguna Beach at the time police believe Ghalandar 
disappeared and is not considered a suspect in the case, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the phone call, Ghalandar and her classmate walked to the bus stop, 
where they parted company, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just vanished from there," Loomis said. "She never made it home and no 
one has heard from her." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and family members said Ghalandar acted normally on the day she 
disappeared and did not appear to be burdened by troubles. She does not work 
and does not have a driver's license, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never had any problems. She was never mad at my mother or mad at my dad," 
said Ghalandar's 12-year-old sister, Mahsa, the only member of the family who 
speaks English fluently. "I hope she is fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Tuesday was a "normal school day" for Ghalandar. She arrived 
at Fullerton College at 10 a.m. and left at 2 p.m. after attending an 
English-as-a-second-language class, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know of nothing that would have precipitated this kind of thing," Loomis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ghalandar case brought "feelings of deja vu" to the Placentia Police 
Department, Ortega said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know full well the similarities between the Torrez case and this young 
lady," Ortega said. "Suddenly everybody . . . (was) saying, is there some 
tie-in? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no reason at this point in time to believe that we are dealing with 
the same (perpetrator). They were both 20, they were both single and they both 
attend college. And they both live in Placentia. But that's all the 
similarity." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' disappearance last Feb. 12 prompted friends and family members to 
launch a highly publicized search for her. But their hopes were dashed when her 
body was found in the trunk of her car, which was discovered in a hospital 
parking lot a week after she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia police have requested that anyone with information about the case 
call them at (714) 993-8164.

REBUILDING AFTER DRUG SWEEP BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of one of the city's toughest police crackdowns, officials and 
community activists are making plans for the formerly gang-torn stretch of West 
3rd Street, hoping to keep the area free of gunfire and spur resident 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 On the table are an expansion of the city's gang-prevention program into the 
area, efforts to help residents start a neighborhood association, and a push to 
renovate houses that were taken over by gang members and are now abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I can tell you is the city has made the commitment," Councilman Miguel 
A. Pulido Jr. said. "It is our plan to come in and do something about it. I've 
requested staff to develop a series of concepts through the neighborhood 
improvement program. We're going to continue to push." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's multi-agency "Operation Roundup" netted more than 130 arrests, 
dealing what officials and residents alike hope is a decapitating blow to the 
city's 6th Street gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, property owners in the area have been calling council members to 
express their gratitude, and Police Lt. William Tegeler, in charge of 
enforcement for the targeted area, has heard from several residents who want 
their neighborhoods "swept" next, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the question pressing on most minds now is, what next? 
</P>
<P>
 "The magnitude of these arrests to me is so significant," said Helen Brown, 
president of the nonprofit Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp., which owns an 
apartment building in the heart of what was only recently a battle zone. "If 
the city will continue to follow up in this same fashion, it's going to send a 
message that Santa Ana has put their foot down." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said gang members would fire semiautomatic weapons from their cars as 
they screeched down West 3rd Street playing "chicken," and she used to call 
Tegeler several times a day begging for police action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so bad that kids in our apartment complex were picking up shell 
casings off the ground in bags because they take them down and sell them as 
scrap metal," Brown said. "There were that many." 
</P>
<P>
 To Brown, it is crucial that police keep up the pressure. But that alone won't 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incumbent on our organization and every other organization doing 
business in the city to try to bring about change with the younger people," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said her organization is poised to receive an Americorps Grant on Monday 
-- a National Service Award that will pay for 24 college-bound students who 
will help her devise gang-prevention programs around the county, including the 
West 3rd Street area. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, the neighborhood improvement program run by the city's 
Housing Department began working with residents who have been organizing a 
"parent patrol" near Carver Elementary School with the help of a group called 
Project SABADO. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is attended by many children who live in the area directly 
controlled by the 6th Street gang until the recent spate of arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia C. Whitaker, the city's housing manager, said her office has obtained 
some bright vests for the parents to wear on their patrols. She pledged her 
department's support of any organizing efforts in the neighborhood. Her staff 
will help residents form a neighborhood association that could put them in 
closer contact with city services, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Pulido said he has also asked Whitaker's staff to help find owners 
and low-interest rehabilitation loans for the houses on West 3rd Street that 
were overrun by gang members in recent months and have been abandoned even by 
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ted R. Moreno said he is pushing for more recreational facilities 
for youth in the area, and a new facility is planned for Rosita Park. He 
particularly wants to see soccer fields where youngsters can vent their 
energies in a positive manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best preventive measure right there," he said. "It's the best way 
of policing, to make sure kids are occupied and doing what they enjoy."  
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, police suggested expanding the city's gang prevention 
Project PRIDE into the West 3rd Street area, said Jenny Rios, senior recreation 
supervisor of the city's Recreation and Community Services Agency and head of 
the PRIDE program. 
</P>
<P>
 Flower Park, in the heart of the neighborhood, is just a field, with no 
buildings on it, but Rios said it doesn't take much to get a PRIDE club going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any little patch of grass or dirt will do," she said.

CHURCH TO EVICT PRESCHOOL, CITES BIBLICAL MANDATE; EDUCATION: SIX-MAN COMMITTEE 
SAYS SCRIPTURES MAKE IT CLEAR THAT CHILDREN SHOULD BE REARED BY THEIR PARENTS. 
ONE WOMAN SAYS ELDERS ARE 'LIVING IN ANOTHER AGE.' 
</P>

<P>
 The return to so-called traditional family values is getting more than lip 
service from officials at Placerita Baptist Church: They have decided to evict 
a preschool operating on church property, saying children should be reared by 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The responsibility for the care of children from the biblical mandate is very 
clear, and that is that it belongs to the family," said Mike Long, chairman of 
a six-man church committee that decided against renewing the lease of the Santa 
Clarita Valley Learning Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, I think that is true," said Gene English, a Newhall resident who was 
picking up his 5-year-old grandson from the preschool while his daughter, a 
single mother, was at work. "On the other hand, parents have to earn a living 
and many have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Area church and religious officials say they know of no other congregation 
that has taken similar action. Many parents at the preschool are upset, saying 
the decision is unrealistic and meant to encourage women to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents say finding child care is especially tough in Santa Clarita, where a 
1990 city study found that most licensed programs have waiting lists because of 
high demand by working parents. 
</P>
<P>
 A 38-year-old woman whose two children attend the preschool 10 hours a day, 
five days a week, said the decision sounds as if it were made "by a board of 
elders living in another age." 
</P>
<P>
 "I put my husband through law school," said the woman, who asked not to be 
identified. "What was I supposed to do? Say, 'No, I'm going to stay home 
because that's my responsibility?' That probably would have led to a divorce." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that even if she stayed at home, she probably would place her 
children in a preschool for a few hours every day so they could play with other 
children. The implication that only bad parents leave their children with a 
third party for day care is wrong, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a working mom you have so much guilt laid upon you in life as it is," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is not passing judgment on parents who place their children in 
preschools or day-care facilities, but the church should not encourage the 
practice, Long said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to prevent ourselves from making a message to the community 
at large that we're not authorized to make," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious officials said the Placerita decision is uncommon among 
theologically conservative churches, many of which operate day care or 
preschool facilities if they are large enough to afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jess Moody, senior pastor of the Southern Baptist-aligned Shepherd of 
the Hills Church in Porter Ranch, said his congregation runs a preschool to 
help parents who need a safe place for their children and to introduce 
youngsters to a Christian environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good number of Foursquare Gospel churches have preschool or day-care 
centers because of the positive results from parents who wind up going to the 
church as well," said Ron Williams, a spokesman for the Los Angeles-based 
denomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Baptist Churches in the U.S.A., a 1.5 million-member 
denomination, adopted a resolution at its 1989 national convention that 
encouraged church-run day-care centers because of the increase in single-parent 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said the decision by Placerita church leaders was reached largely because 
the congregation is searching for a new pastor and "we know that there are men 
within the evangelical Christianity community who would not be able to accept 
the pulpit at this church because of the preschool." 
</P>
<P>
 The church oversight committee is made up exclusively of men because 
"biblically, we believe in male leadership and male authority over the family," 
he said. However, he added that the church is not singling out the mother as 
the parent who should stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Placerita church committee had originally asked preschool operators to 
leave at the end of the 1994-95 school year. But they now say the preschool can 
continue to operate until its lease expires in the summer of 1996 -- enough 
time, Long said, for it to find another facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators of the preschool declined to be interviewed. One worker -- who asked 
not to be identified -- called the church's decision "pretty crummy." The Santa 
Clarita Valley Learning Center had operated for several years elsewhere before 
leasing space at the church for the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Christian scholars said they are not aware of any specific biblical 
references that would directly apply to day care and single-parent families. 
But they said inferences can be drawn from various passages, although there is 
disagreement whether the Bible prohibits parents from leaving their children 
with caretakers while they work. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old Testament places the responsibility for child-rearing on parents, said 
Wayne Mack, a professor of biblical counseling at the Master's College, a 
Christian college adjacent to Placerita Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack said children need their parents most during the first few years of life, 
which is probably what influenced the church's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that they're trying to be nasty or mean, I'm sure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Crossley, a professor of religion at USC, agrees that the Old Testament 
places an emphasis on the family. "What was expected was the husband and father 
worked out in the field, and the mother and her servants took care of the 
children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, portions of the Bible also allow polygamy, and in some 
instances the family was not always placed first, Crossley added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The apostles are terrible examples because they left their homes to follow 
Jesus around the countryside," he said.

CITYSCAPES / REBECCA BRYANT: GROUP HELPS WRITERS INDULGE PASSION FOR ALL THINGS 
ROMANTIC; 'AS WE EARN MORE RESPECT, PEOPLE ARE NOT AFRAID TO COME OUT OF THE 
CLOSET AND ADMIT THEY READ ROMANCES.'

 On wet winter mornings, ah, the romance novel, where the women are blessed 
with small, perfect teeth, slender legs, full breasts and silken hair, where 
heroines are ever virtuous, intelligent, witty, independent and impetuous. 
</P>
<P>
 And their men. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, their dangerous men. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad shoulders, well-defined chests, leanly sculpted tan faces and masculine, 
lean hips. Where can a girl find such a stud? 
</P>
<P>
 In Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Palmdale -- at the meetings and in the minds of the High Desert Romance 
Writers of America, a group of authors trying to break into the sweet, or 
steamy, world of smoldering gazes and electric embraces. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, you elitist literary types, go ahead and mock their genre. Turn up your 
noses, you celebrity insta-book authors, you haughty crime novelists and 
science fiction space cases. Call it fluff. Call it silly. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a billion-dollar industry. Nearly half -- 49% to be exact -- of all 
paperbacks produced are romances. And these writers want a piece of that 
publishing pie. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We all want to be published, whether it's because we want to see our name in 
print, or that we need to tell that story that only we can tell, or we 
fantasize about being rich like Danielle Steele, or we simply love to write," 
Beverly Clark, the group's librarian, said during a recent meeting at the Old 
Country Buffet in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The writers also want their outdated image corrected -- unfrumped and 
unfrilled. No one at this meeting wore chiffon. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not lie in bed in pink peignoirs, eating bonbons and writing with a 
peacock quill, as talcum-white, pug-nosed dogs yip at their feet. Nor are they 
all bored housewives lost in fantasies of chisel-chested hunks. 
</P>
<P>
 They often write in home offices and whenever they find the time, fitting 
paragraphs filled with romance and sexual tension in between full-time jobs, 
husbands and children. 
</P>
<P>
 They do , however, revel in the unabashedly romantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love romance. I read romance," said Tanya Stowe, president of the Romance 
Writers. Stowe's first novel, "Time's Embrace," involved time travel to the 
Egypt of the pharaohs. 
</P>
<P>
 For Stowe, a full-time writer for five years, the fluff/formula stereotype 
stings. "It's just a way for people to label us and put us down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a way to mock those who pass up the New Yorker in favor of books 
with titles like "Betrayal" and "An Old-Fashioned Affair." 
</P>
<P>
 "If three women are in a line and one is reading Grisham, one is reading a 
romance novel and another is reading Louis L'Amour, who do you think is going 
to get the flak?" asked Chelley Kitzmiller, 48, a Tehachapi writer and reviewer 
who recently published her second book, "Fires of Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the romance novel is perceived as it is because it is an industry for 
women and by women," she said. "There has been this perception that the women 
reading this aren't as valuable, not as well-educated." Actually, most romance 
readers are college-educated and employed, contends Kitzmiller, who credits a 
book called "Sweet Savage Love" with changing her life. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, on a camping trip to Bishop, Kitzmiller was marooned in a 24-foot 
motor home with two other adults, five children and two dogs during a blizzard. 
While the children colored and her husband fumed about missed fishing time, 
Kitzmiller and her sister-in-law holed up in a bedroom and read aloud from the 
one book in the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitzmiller was hooked. When the weather cleared, she remained in the camper 
alone, reading. Years later, she started writing her own books and founded the 
Orange County chapter of Romance Writers of America, which now boasts 400 
members. She's now program coordinator for the High Desert chapter, which after 
only a handful of meetings has about 30 members, including two men. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere at the group's meetings is like that of a sorority. Members 
hold raffles for candy-filled crystal bowls and baskets of writing implements. 
They give awards for various publishing accomplishments, but the red hearts are 
reserved for published romance authors -- only three or four to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of them are never going to make it," Kitzmiller said. "Others will 
struggle for years like I did before they ever sell a book." 
</P>
<P>
 Romance writers can dish up emotion in any setting they can imagine: Western 
theme, hold the steam please; time travel, backward or forward; Westerns with 
Native American themes; gothics littered with vampires and werewolves; outer 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 And they've got a loyal and growing group of readers waiting for their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the romance readers have always been there," said Stowe. "They've 
been closet readers. As we are given more respectability, as we earn more 
respect, people are not afraid to come out of the closet and admit they read 
romances." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, reading romance novels isn't going to save the world, the writers agree. 
But then neither is sitting on the couch stuffing peanuts in your face watching 
the Rams or the Angels lose, again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Men could learn a lot by reading these," Kitzmiller said. "They'd learn a lot 
more about what women really want. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think that will happen in my lifetime," she said, laughing.

BEAUTIFICATION OR BLIGHT?; MERCHANTS SAY BENCHES ONLY AGGRAVATE PROBLEMS ON 
HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC GUZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 33 years on Hollywood Boulevard, Jack Amber has called it quits. Months 
of slipping sales and customer complaints about rowdy, panhandling youths in 
front of his family business have forced him to close up shop and move south to 
a new location on Robertson Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The street has come down to its lowest level since I've been here," Amber 
said a few days before he moved out of his men's clothing store last weekend. 
"This was the cleanest corner for 30 years. We never had any trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 The last straw, Amber says, was the benches. 
</P>
<P>
 He used to be able to deal with the panhandlers and skinheads who wandered the 
boulevard, but about five months ago, the Community Redevelopment Agency -- 
inviting yet another skirmish with the Hollywood business community -- gave 
them a good reason to hang out in front of his store. 
</P>
<P>
 In what officials termed an effort to beautify the famous boulevard and 
attract more shoppers, the agency installed about 30 benches along a six-block 
corridor between Mann's Chinese Theatre and the Pantages Theater.  
</P>
<P>
 Beautification programs are increasingly popular ways to spruce up urban 
business areas. At the beginning of the year, the CRA and local business 
unveiled a fifth face lift for beleaguered Pershing Square. On Thursday, Mayor 
Richard Riordan announced a $4-million program to improve blighted 
thoroughfares with trees, benches and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 But installing amenities in public places is often a delicate process: Poor 
site selection can attract unwanted occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 At Venice Beach two weeks ago, residents smashed public picnic tables with 
sledgehammers after protesting that they attracted unruly nighttime crowds. On 
Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, shoppers complain that homeless people 
use the benches as a home base for panhandling. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago in San Diego, benches were removed from a downtown plaza to 
alleviate rampant drug use and other criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is precedent for the problems along Hollywood Boulevard. Four years 
ago, the Hollywood Economic Recovery Effort installed benches there. Complaints 
from business owners led to their rapid removal. They have since been donated 
to the Hollywood Bowl, a local senior citizens home and other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just beautifying is not enough," said Pompea Smith, who oversaw the first 
bench program as the Hollywood Economic Recovery Effort's project director. 
"I'm not opposed to benches, but you have to look at the environment. (The CRA 
is) fully aware of the problems we had. I guess they have been preoccupied with 
other problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Feuding with the CRA has become a way of life for Hollywood businesses and 
other organizations. Lawsuits and bureaucratic disputes caused a five-year 
delay in the city Planning Commission's approval of the 30-year, $922-million 
budget for the Hollywood Boulevard Urban Design Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Other controversies centered on claims that the CRA intentionally was freezing 
out independent businesses as it dealt secretly with then-Councilman Michael 
Woo and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. In 1991, a CRA consultant entrusted 
with organizing the independents was forced to resign after critics said she 
was failing to make progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the bench locations along Hollywood Boulevard, Steve Davies of the 
Hollywood and New York-based Project for Public Spaces said: "I know that area, 
and that's where those people have been hanging out for years. That's a tough 
area. I would never put a bench there. If you give someone a bench, they can 
establish turf." 
</P>
<P>
 Amber fought for the turf in front of his store from the day the benches were 
installed. He watched the street people sitting on the benches and kept a 3 
1/2-foot dowel he called a "baseball bat" ready in case of trouble -- and 
frequently there was. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, a young man with a red Mohawk kicked in one of Amber's front 
windows. It remains boarded up, a memorial placard in front of the now-vacant 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber is not alone. Other business owners along the boulevard have similar 
complaints and are considering moving. 
</P>
<P>
 At Venezia Shoes across the street from the old J.C. Amber location, owner 
Dikran Tcheboukian said a woman he sees on the benches defecated in the doorway 
of his store during business hours after she was denied access to restrooms in 
a nearby restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But the CRA and community officials say they are unaware of significant 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a number of meetings on the boulevard about our security program 
and that issue (the benches) never came up," said CRA project manager Len Betz. 
</P>
<P>
 "But our focus is to help the businesses. If there really is a problem, then 
we would certainly take a look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA spent $300 to $500 for each bench, custom made with rails between the 
seats so that people can't sleep on them, said Jerry Gross, the CRA's director 
of engineering. Another $100,000 per site was spent for six "bump-outs" where 
sidewalks have been enlarged and trees planted for a park-like atmosphere along 
the street. Stores such as Amber's are behind the bump-outs. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said only one letter of 
complaint has been received by the office, from Larry Edmund's Bookshop. 
Although the complaint has been passed on to a security company, there appears 
to be no clear solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know that removal of the benches would not be the immediate reaction," 
said spokeswoman Veronica Gutierrez. "We'll try to improve the security first 
and then go from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Luboviski of Larry Edmund's bookstore acknowledged Thursday that security 
people had contacted him, but he was skeptical about change. "Right now I'm 
looking out the window, and there are still some guys out there. I can see all 
kinds of clothes hanging from the bench. They're always spread out there, 
taking up all three benches. They're eating and throwing food on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department officers familiar with patrolling the boulevard 
also express doubts about dealing effectively with people abusing the benches. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the worst idea they ever had," said Barry Moore, LAPD's community 
patrol officer. "All it is is another place for the homeless kids, punk rockers 
and transients to hang out." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Sgt. Kim Ward noted: "We have a lot of complaints from merchants, but 
(the street people) aren't breaking a law. We can't tell them to move because 
they're scuzzy looking." 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Morado, who heads the private International Services Inc. security team 
hired by the CRA and Metropolitan Transportation Authority to patrol the 
boulevard, said her officers would concentrate on problem areas over the next 
week to alleviate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But the street youths who frequent the benches in front of the darkened J.C. 
Amber store say they are harassed by security officers, Guardian Angels and 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "They go by people's appearances, and they make derogatory comments about our 
looks," said Jamie Plantz, 15. "We do panhandle, but we're not robbing 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Although some street youths protest, others admit that their behavior is often 
unruly."We are awfully rowdy here," said one teen-ager to the groans of her 
compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Edery, owner of the Top Western apparel store, said he has come to 
blows with some aggressive youths. "I got into a fight with a kid on a bench 
who was screaming at people to give him money. These benches bring a lot of 
problems and bring my business down because the skinheads hang out and scare 
people away."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; TWINS HIT CLASS -- IN TRIPLICATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ginny Cocco will be seeing double for awhile, but her vision is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher at Dr. A.J. Cook Elementary School has the statistically 
improbable distinction of having three sets of identical twins in her 
kindergarten class this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And a fourth set is coming soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the school district is giving me a new eye test," she joked on 
Thursday, the first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not alone. Two sets of twins also are starting first grade, said 
Principal Frank Branda. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the years I've been a principal I've never had this many twins," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cocco's students all wear name tags now, the challenge will be to get 
the names right without them. She said she will try to identify individual 
differences to help her learn, because "I want them to know that they're each a 
total individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating matters is that identical twins often dress identically too, 
which happened on the first day of class. 
</P>
<P>
 The four boys, Alexander and David Tran and Phong and Quang Phan, dressed to 
match their brothers. The girls, Diem and Bich Nguyen, wore identical pink 
dresses with pink bows in their hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, everyone's saying that they don't envy me," Cocco said. "I really 
try to make a point of learning all their names on the first day of school, and 
I did pretty good I think." 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Tran, Cocco's bilingual aide, said she knows the challenges that twins 
can cause for instructors. Last year, she mistakenly chastised one child for 
something his twin had done.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Tran, 19, added that she was happy to have the twins around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're cute. They sort of look out for each other and they're closer 
than brother and sister. Sometimes I wish I had a twin," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During class, Cocco kept the twins separated, but during recess they stayed 
close, often holding hands as they played on swings and ladders. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first day of school drew to a close, it became apparent that however 
much the twins may look the same, they don't always think alike. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; DECISION DELAYED ON NEW TACO BELL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission, short two members at ist meeting this week, postponed 
a vote on a plan to build a Taco Bell across Coast Highway from the Balboa Bay 
Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission members Thursday night told company officials to meet with 
neighbors to work out potential problems, such as noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Taco Bell Corp. wants to raze a vacant restaurant at 1400 W. 
Coast Highway and open a dine-in, take-out and 24-hour drive-through 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are concerned about anticipated noise and security problems caused 
by all-night customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The noise level has nothing to do with the (drive-through) speaker board, it 
has to do with the people that will show up there and the types of vehicles," 
said Snug Harbor Road resident Bill Dunlap, who was worried about noise from 
motorcycles and cars blaring loud music. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've got seven gang members . . . who want tacos, do you think the 
18-year-old (in line) is going to get out of his car and go tell them to turn 
it down?" he asked the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yeager, whose home is on Kings Road on the bluff directly over the 
site, repeated some of Dunlap's sentiments but said she wanted good corporate 
neighbors to take over the former site of the Grinder, Guido's and Melee's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to look at a different rooftop than the dilapidated one on a 
building that has been vacant for most of the last five years," she told the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted to hold another public hearing on the project Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners Norma Glover, Thomas Edwards and Tod Ridgeway all said they were 
inclined to at least limit hours of operation to opening at 6 a.m. and closing 
at 1 a.m. Sunday through Thursday and 2 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays, as a senior 
planner recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners Gary DiSano and Gary Pomeroy said they would support the project 
as proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are residents who don't want this type of project at all, but that's 
not how we decide these things," Pomeroy said. "This is permitted use." HOLLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; VOTE ON SCHOOL BUS RIDER FEES DELAYED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees have deferred a decision on whether to raise fees for riders of the 
aging bus fleet that serves the Orange Unified School District, despite a plea 
from the district's teachers union to find a way to raise money for the 
financially strapped district. 
</P>
<P>
 District finance officials recommended that annual fees for each child riding 
the bus be raised from $180 to $225, beginning July, 1995. For families with 
more than one child, fees would be reduced proportionately. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also suggested that trustees eliminate funding of transportation to 
sporting events and consider contracting out the entire bus service to a 
private company. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the proposals would save the district more than $250,000. The 
district now spends more than $1.2 million to bus about 4,000 students who make 
up 10% to 15% of the school population. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Thursday's meeting, school board members decided to wait until Sept. 
22, noting that they were seeing the material for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey to determine reaction to changes in bus service was sent to 22,000 
</P>
<P>
 parents in the spring, and 1,300 responded, Supt. Robert L. French told the 
board. The response to the idea of eliminating free transportation to athletic 
events was split about evenly between supporters and opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Bill Lewis, whose three children ride the school buses, 
said the district might have received different responses if it had asked 
different questions. "If you ask parents, 'Do you want to lose microscopes or 
books so someone else's kid can take the bus?' you'd get a different response," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another transportation problem looming is the advanced age of the 78-bus 
fleet, which has an average age of 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 David Reger, president of the teachers union, reminded the board that district 
teachers have the second-lowest average pay in the county. "There is so much 
money being lost," he said, urging them to raise the fees. "You have got to 
quit playing politics with some of these issues." LESLEY WRIGHT

ABORTION DOCTOR'S CASE IS REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Medical Board of California on Friday reopened the case of a Los Angeles 
abortion doctor whose license was suspended for a year for negligence in the 
deaths of two patients, at the request of officials who now want to revoke the 
license altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual order came at the request of the state attorney general's office 
and Medical Board Executive Director Dixon Arnett, who urged panel members to 
consider harsher action against Dr. Leo F. Kenneally. 
</P>
<P>
 One month ago, the board agreed with a decision by an administrative law judge 
to suspend Kenneally's license for one year and place him on probation for 
another 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneally operates clinics under the name Her Medical Clinics in central Los 
Angeles and in Pacoima. Two young women died after undergoing abortions at the 
Los Angeles clinic, allegedly because of gross negligence and incompetence.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
MONORAIL PROPOSAL CHEAPER THAN SUBWAY, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A long-awaited report released Friday on the cost of two proposals for a rail 
link to the San Fernando Valley shows that a monorail would be nearly a quarter 
of a billion dollars cheaper than a subway.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, running an elevated monorail line along the median of 
the Ventura Freeway would cost $1.76 billion or more. 
</P>
<P>
 But a subway line identical to the one under construction on the other side of 
the Cahuenga Pass would cost at least $2 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 Completion of the cost analysis probably will put the issue on the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority's front burner again. It has languished 
as board members tried to deal with a $126-million deficit for this fiscal 
year.  
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board is expected to vote on which route to take and on which 
technology to use at its Oct. 26 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich, one of the most ardent boosters of the elevated 
rail line on the MTA's board, said the report vindicates his support of the 
monorail plan.  
</P>
<P>
 "But the monorail's lower cost isn't its only advantage over the subway," 
Antonovich said. "It will have 15 stations instead of 10, so many more people 
will be served."

 Doomsday (cont.): A prediction by a Pennsylvania religious group that the 
world will come to an end this month prompted Val Rodriguez to recall one of 
Earth's previous brushes with danger. When Rodriguez was a teen-ager in East 
L.A., Pasadena prophet Charles G. Long drew national attention by forecasting 
that an atomic blast would blow the planet to smithereens on Friday, Sept. 21, 
1945. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few of us lads arranged a ditch day for that date," Rodriguez wrote. "It 
was the second week of school (at Roosevelt High) and we needed a break. Since 
it was my idea, I got stuck for the pumpkin seeds and the beer. Eastside Beer 
-- now that was a beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Sept. 21, 1945, came and went, uneventfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday morning called for excuses at the attendance office," Rodriguez 
continued. "I told the truth: 'I stayed home to prepare for doomsday.' I told 
them that I was concerned about my pets. The attendance counselor called the 
boys' VP, who in turn called the principal to hear my excuse. They bought it! 
No swats." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, by the way, grew up to become a schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
 That's easy for them to say: After purchasing a humidifier, reader B.D. of 
Whittier noticed that it came with a direction manual whose grammar blows hot 
and cold.

<P>
 This is no lawyer joke: The L.A. Trial Lawyers Assn. says it is misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the members concern themselves with civil cases, they are "too often 
confused with criminal trial lawyers," the association says. Its officers 
complain of receiving "numerous phone calls from media people and others 
seeking information and interviews concerning the O.J. Simpson case, the 
Menendez case, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 The solution: The group has called a meeting to discuss changing its name. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers, this is an opportunity too good to pass up. Send us your suggestions. 
The best one will merit the award of one of the most treasured items in Only in

 We are sending out a copy of Dr. Cynthia Watson's "Love Potions -- a '90s

inasmuch as the city ignored Guerrero's proposal to replace the black armband 
around City Hall with a condom-shaped cover to symbolize the importance of safe 
sex.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; FUN PARK IN FLIGHT PATH IS APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new family amusement park in Irvine is planned for eight acres considered a 
potential crash zone because of the 200 military flights that pass overhead 
each day from nearby El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Marine Corps recommendations against the project, the Planning 
Commission unanimously approved construction of the Irvine Family Fun Center 
last week on land south of the Santa Ana Freeway in the Irvine Spectrum area.  
</P>
<P>
 A 1981 Marine Corps study identifies the site as an "accident potential zone," 
an area where 70% of potential aircraft accidents around the El Toro Marine 
base are expected to occur. But the $8-million project complies with Marine 
Corps guidelines, according to Planning Commission Chairman Ken Bruner, because 
it limits the occupancy of amusement park buildings to 200 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "It meets the letter of the law," said Bruner, a former Navy pilot. "There are 
few places for youth and families to go to recreate in the area and one would 
expect it to be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 City Council approval is not needed for the project to go forward, but 
Councilman Greg Smith said he is reviewing letters written by Marine Corps 
officials listing their concerns. The council would be involved if an appeal is 
filed.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for me to review this," Smith said. "If there are some valid 
concerns, this should be appealed so we can take a look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Dan Pender, an El Toro Marine base representative, told planning 
commissioners last week that the site is under the approach corridor for 
aircraft landings. The Marine base is expected to close in July, 1999, and 
Pender said the Marines will not appeal the commission decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The fun center, planned by the William Scott Golf Corp. of Aliso Viejo, will 
include miniature golf and a "virtual reality flight simulator." It would be 
the second amusement park in Irvine. The seven-acre Palace Park, owned by the 
Irvine-based Camelot Park Family Entertainment Centers Inc., opened July 1 at 
Harvard and Michelson avenues. RUSS LOAR

 A carwash from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. today at a local gas station will help raise 
money for Estancia High School's Key Club, an organization that helps the 
elderly and the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The washes will cost $2.The club, which has been in existence for 25 years, 
gets 50 cents per vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Zaslavski, the owner of Your Neighborhood Service Station at El 
Camino and Mendoza drives, said students will be volunteering as driers to 
service the cars as they come out of his automated wash and wax. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will raise some money for a good cause," said Zaslavski, a Russian 
immigrant who came to the United States 16 years ago and is trying to make it 
in the gasoline station business. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school's principal, Peggy Anatol, praised the club members. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives them a purpose and a chance to work in the community," she said. 
"It helps them to realize the bigger picture in life. Working on the weekends 
is commendable."TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; BOY SENTENCED AFTER PLEA BY VICTIM'S KIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donna Chounlamany never thought tragedy could strike twice in her family. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday she sat before a Juvenile Court judge and urged him to hand out 
the harshest sentence possible to 15-year-old Gregory Callison, convicted of 
stabbing her brother to death on March 8 when a fight on a Garden Grove street 
over a Volkswagen bug escalated out of control. About a year before, another 
brother, B.C., was killed in a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought we would have to go through the second loss of a family 
member," Chounlamany, 19, told Judge Ronald E. Owen during the sentencing of 
Callison for the killing of 18-year-old Moukda Chounlamany, a football star at 
Rancho Alamitos High School in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Callison, whose own family shed tears during the hearing, sat without visible 
emotion as he was sentenced to the California Youth Authority for an 
indeterminate sentence that cannot last past his 25th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen, who convicted him in July of second-degree murder, rejected his claims 
that he acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is Moukda didn't deserve to die," said Donna Chounlamany. "My 
dad is so angry and depressed that he couldn't express his feelings. . . . He 
asked me to speak for him because he said when he talks about what had happened 
to Moukda, the anger was caught in his throat and he couldn't talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Molko said he hoped the sentence might help 
Callison, who was 14 at the time of the stabbing, change his life, control his 
temper and take responsibility for the act that claimed the life of someone who 
"did nothing wrong and had everything to live for." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always sad," he said. "We're talking about a 14-year-old who should be 
out bicycling and playing in the park with other kids. . . . His life is just 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Molko said Callison had a history of aggression, including an incident in 
which he stabbed a classmate with a pencil. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 14-year-old boy couldn't be more aggressive than this boy," he told the 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Julian Bailey, however, urged the judge to reconsider the 
second-degree murder conviction, saying the youth believed he was acting in 
self-defense, even if that belief might seem unreasonable to some. 
</P>
<P>
 While Owen said he believed Callison probably did not intend to kill, he 
described the youth's actions as showing "wanton disregard" for that 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just didn't care, I think, at the time," the judge told Callison. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police and prosecutors, Callison mistakenly believed that two 
teen-agers, including the victim's younger brother, Tootoo, were trying to 
steal his uncle's dune buggy parked in the 12700 block of Louise Street in 
Garden Grove, and ran out to confront them, punching one in the face and 
running them off. 
</P>
<P>
 Moukda and Tootoo Chounlamany and a friend were again in the neighborhood 
about 9 p.m., and Callison approached their vehicle and punched the older 
Chounlamany in the face as he sat behind the steering wheel, authorities said. 
Callison stabbed Moukda Chounlamany in the chest when he stepped out of the 
car, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Callison fled but returned several hours later and turned himself over to 
police. ANNA CEKOLA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN PEDRO; CRUISE SHIP 
PLAGUED BY ILLNESS RESUMES OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cruise ship Viking Serenade left its berth in San Pedro on Friday for a 
three-day voyage to Mexico -- just about a week after more than 600 people on 
the vessel became ill during a similar trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship pulled away from the dock at 6:15 p.m. and a few minutes after 
federal health inspectors gave the crew authorization to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning last week, the ship has been thoroughly cleaned, all food that 
was on board was thrown out, and mattresses and linen used during that voyage 
were burned, Royal Caribbean officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Royal Caribbean, which owns the San Pedro-based ship, has said the kitchen and 
dining areas have been cleaned, and everything is safe. But there apparently 
was no word on how the shigellosis virus, which caused the wave of illness, 
found its way on the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Assurances by the cruise line officials, however, apparently quelled the fear 
of passengers on the cruise that will taken them to Catalina Island and 
Ensenada before returning to San Pedro.

 Opening statements in the trial of Douglas J. Iversen are expected to get 
under way next week, said Deputy Dist. Atty.Hank Goldberg.  
</P>
<P>
 Iversen, 45, maintains that he saved lives when he shot John L. Daniels at a 
service station on Crenshaw Boulevard and Florence Avenue on July 1, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran police officer says he was trying to check the tow truck's 
registration because he suspected that the vehicle was unregistered. He claims 
that Daniels refused to allow him to do the inspection and drove off, and 
appeared to be on a collision course with pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathy Mader contends that Iversen had a vendetta against 
tow-truck drivers.

 A Roman Catholic priest who surrendered to Los Angeles County sheriff's 
detectives was booked on suspicion of sexual battery and released on $25,000 
bail Friday, a sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terence Joseph Farrell of St. John Vianney Catholic Church is scheduled to be 
arraigned next week, said sheriff's Sgt. Ron Spear.

<P>
 An 18-year-old man told detectives that Farrell tried to molest him Aug. 25 in 
the church rectory at 1345 S. Turnbull Canyon Road, Spear said.

 "Investigators are continuing their investigation in an effort to identify 
possible unreported victims in this community, as well as the priest's former 
parish, located in Northridge," Spear said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORWALK; TORRES CALLS 
FOR CLOSURE OF JET FUEL STORAGE DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-Pico Rivera) has called on the secretary of defense 
to close a jet fuel storage depot in Norwalk, saying the facility is no longer 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Norwalk Tank Farm -- a facility with a capacity to store 36 million 
gallons of highly toxic jet fuel -- has outlived its usefulness," Torres wrote 
in a letter to Defense Secretary William Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said the Defense Department should consolidate its operations and begin 
storing the fuel at its production site in the San Pedro area or at bases where 
the fuel is used. He added that the Defense Department has conceded that the 
tank farm is leaking toxic chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the people I represent, the Norwalk Tank Farm is more than a costly relic 
-- it is a source of fear and danger," Torres wrote.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; HUMAN RIGHTS PANEL NAMES CHAIRMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Huntington Beach resident Kenneth Inouye this week was elected chairman of the 
Orange County Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice chairman is C. William Wood of Laguna Beach.They will serve one-year 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Inouye is managing partner of Inouye, Shively and Longtin, an accounting firm 
in Laguna Hills. He is internal vice president of the Orange County Japanese 
American Assn. and a past district president of the Japanese American Citizens 
League. He is active with the United Way and the Orange County Hate Crime 
Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Inouye was appointed to the Human Relations Commission by the Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, who was appointed to the commission by the League of California Cities, 
is vice president of community relations for PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. in 
Cypress. He serves on the boards of the American Cancer Society, Cypress 
College Foundation, Orange County Food Distribution Center, United Way, 
Goodwill Industries, Orange County Partnership for Children and Boys and Girls 
Club of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Kennedy, director of the Human Relations Commission, characterized 
Inouye as a dedicated board member who plans to take "a very active" role as 
chairman. Kennedy described Wood as a corporate executive who is personally 
involved with community causes rather than someone who just writes checks to 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana-based Human Relations Commission was created by the Board of 
Supervisors in 1971 and charged with the mission of helping eliminate 
prejudice, intolerance and discrimination in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said the most difficult challenge facing the commission "is how to 
build sensitivity toward our diverse residents." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some feel quite left out and discriminated against, and some people don't see 
that at all," he said. "We want diversity to be a source of our strength, 
rather than our undoing." ALAN EYERLY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike McGroarty, an expert in rescues in large-scale disasters, started his new 
job Friday as chief of the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 McGroarty was appointed to take over from Benjamin R.E. Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now responsible for the department's $3.2-million budget, 36 
firefighters and two fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lee Risner said McGroarty, who has worked for La Habra for the 
past 19 years as a firefighter, captain and battalion chief, is known 
throughout the country for his expertise in heavy equipment rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 McGroarty serves on several state and federal task forces that respond to 
major disasters throughout the country. He also writes for training manuals and 
is a lead instructor for advanced rescue training for the state Office of 
Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 He has led rescues of victims trapped under buildings or heavy structures 
because of earthquakes and other disasters, including hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been around a little bit," McGroarty said. "Every time there's a major 
disaster in the country, I'm advised." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, 55, retired Thursday after eight years in the department's top job. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins, who began his firefighting career 30 years ago, said it is time to do 
"other things." He plans to devote more time to his woodworking and 
glass-staining hobbies with his wife, Patricia. MIMI KO

PROPERTY NOT SO HOT AFTER ALL; CITY CAN'T FIND BUYER FOR LANDMARK SILVER LAKE 
FIRE STATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe they should have a fire sale. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be the only way to find a buyer for a historic Silver Lake fire 
station that has stood vacant since its firefighters answered their final alarm 
five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Auctions certainly are not working, Los Angeles public works officials 
acknowledged Friday, as they tried unsuccessfully for the second time to sell 
the landmark firehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one potential buyer showed up at City Hall when Bureau of Engineering 
real estate officers put 70-year-old Fire Station 56 under the auctioneer's 
hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 And he decided at the last second that he was not willing to cough up the 
$271,500 minimum bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking around the room and seeing I was the only one here scared me to 
death," said Michael Kellerman, a Hollywood resident who owns Hollywood Fantasy 
Tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm wondering if other people know something I don't. Like whether the 
plumbing is shot or the wiring is bad or maybe I'd be buying a building full of 
bodies or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1924 to blend in with bungalow homes along Rowena Avenue, the 
Mediterranean Revival-style firehouse has a red tile roof, buff-colored brick 
walls and a cream terra-cotta trim. It was abandoned in early 1989 when a fire 
station was built half a block away. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials had figured that old Fire Station 56 would quickly be snapped 
up by someone interested in converting it into a trendy restaurant, architect's 
office or artist's studio. 
</P>
<P>
 But their first auction attempt three years ago fizzled when the winning 
bidder changed his mind and withdrew his $500,000 offer. 
</P>
<P>
 A bidding war among about 10 interested buyers had broken out that time and 
officials were hoping the same thing would happen Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the firehouse needs about $80,000 in earthquake retrofitting and some 
interior repairs, "it's a diamond in the rough," said Steve Rosenberg, a city 
real estate officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg said he will try again next year to auction it off. He said he is 
not certain whether he will lower the asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Kellerman, he did not know whether to kick himself or pat himself on 
the back for passing up the fire station. So he promised to return for the next 
auction -- looking for other bidders as well as for a deal.

BOARD REPRIMANDS LIBRARY PRESIDENT; MONTEREY PARK: PANEL REACTS AFTER OFFICIAL 
MADE RACIALLY TINGED COMMENTS AT A MEETING. SHE IS ASKED TO APOLOGIZE TO THE 
COMMUNITY OR RESIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Monterey Park's library board called on its president to apologize or resign 
Thursday after she threw a cup of water at a Chinese American activist and 
threatened others with her walking stick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watch out. I have a club and I am apt to use it," board President Kathleen 
Brzozowski warned as she left the crowded meeting room after throwing the cup 
in the direction of Laura Lee, chairwoman of the Chinese American Civil 
Liberties Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee later filed a police complaint against Brzozowski. 
</P>
<P>
 The board president was under attack for racially tinged comments she made in 
July concerning fellow library board member Marina Tse, a prominent member of 
the city's sizable Asian community. According to the 1990 census, 56% of 
Monterey Park's residents are of Asian descent. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was the latest in a racially charged dispute that began in April 
with the resignation of Jeanette Cheng, the city's first Chinese American 
librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute escalated in July when the board president denied allegations that 
trustees were trying to oust Tse for her lone opposition to Cheng's 
resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Brzozowski said Tse had been misrepresenting her position, 
adding that Tse had a "problem understanding English," was not suited to be a 
trustee and should take a "low position until she can speak the language." 
</P>
<P>
 Tse is a special education teacher with a master's degree from USC. She was 
recently appointed to a state special education commission by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
"This is the worst insult I have ever had," she said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 members of the city's Asian and Latino communities attended 
Thursday's meeting to hear the debate over the racial issue. But when the board 
came to that item on the agenda, Brzozowski said she could not stay. A member 
of the audience accused her of trying to "chicken out." At that point, she 
threw the cup and stalked out, wielding her stick in front of her. 
</P>
<P>
 Several police officers later arrived at City Hall to question witnesses. 
Police are investigating Lee's complaint, Capt. Jim Strait said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 After Brzozowski's departure and speeches from community activists demanding 
her resignation, a motion was approved stating that the president's comments 
were not the board's view and that she should be asked to apologize or resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "She owes an apology to the community and if she can't bring herself to do 
that then she should resign," said trustee Joseph Ruben, who authored the 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzozowski did not answer calls to her home Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does she want (Tse) to be a maid, a cleaning lady, a bus girl?" Lee asked. 
"This kind of remark is not only an insult to Ms. Tse, it also offends me and 
many hard-working, first generation immigrants."

GROUP'S FUNDING OF IMMIGRATION MEASURE ASSAILED; POLITICS: CRITICS SAY 
PROPOSITION 187 DRIVE IS GETTING MONEY FROM FOUNDATION THAT BACKS RACIAL 
RESEARCH. PROPONENTS COUNTER THAT CHARGES ARE A SMEAR TACTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of Proposition 187 stepped up their rhetoric Friday, blasting what 
they described as an ominous link between a foundation that has supported 
inflammatory racial research and a co-author of the November ballot measure 
that would deny most government services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The connection was branded as ludicrous by proponents of the ballot measure, 
who said the allegations by Taxpayers Against 187 are a desperation tactic 
against an initiative that has registered consistent support among likely 
voters in pre-election polls. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is the relationship between Proposition 187 co-author Alan C. Nelson, 
the Federation for American Immigration Reform and the Pioneer Fund, a New 
York-based organization that has supported research by scientists including the 
late William B. Shockley, who held that blacks are inherently intellectually 
inferior to whites. 
</P>
<P>
 When former federal immigration chief Nelson helped write the initiative last 
year, he was a Sacramento lobbyist for the Federation for American Immigration 
Reform, a national organization that advocates sealing the nation's borders and 
reducing immigration. The federation receives an annual donation from the 
Pioneer Fund, which has amounted to more than $600,000 since 1988, according to 
tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Los Angeles news conference, Taxpayers Against 187 news director Scott 
Macdonald said the set of facts establish a "very direct link from the Pioneer 
Fund to Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 "They somehow expect us not to believe that there is a link of ideas and money 
and people?" he asked.  
</P>
<P>
 Passage of the proposition, Macdonald charged, would further the goals of the 
Pioneer Fund, which was described in an accompanying press release as a "white 
supremacist" organization. When asked for clarification, however, Macdonald 
carefully refused to explicitly characterize proponents of the ballot measure 
as holding racist or white supremacist ideals. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the provisions of Proposition 187, illegal immigrants would be denied 
education, non-emergency health care and other government benefits. Although 
the measure has popular support, it is opposed by an array of education, 
medical and law enforcement groups, including the California School Boards 
Assn., California State PTA and Congress of California Seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at the news conference, Max Turchen, chairman of the Los Angeles 
chapter of the seniors' organization, charged that the measure fosters a police 
state mentality by requiring the investigation of people suspected of being 
illegal immigrants. "What are the criteria? The color of your skin? The way you 
speak? Your last name?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 But proponents of the initiative contended that the opposition was engaging in 
undemocratic smear tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just trying to tar and feather the messengers because the message is 
too strong to attack," said initiative co-author Harold Ezell, who served as 
western regional chief of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under 
Nelson. "FAIR was never a player at all in the initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson and federation Executive Director Daniel A. Stein also insisted Friday 
that the federation had nothing to do with the drafting of Proposition 187. 
"The last year with FAIR I was on a half-time contract when I worked on the 
initiative," said Nelson, who no longer works as a federation consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein added that his organization has no qualms about accepting donations from 
the Pioneer Fund, a publicly registered charitable foundation formed in the 
late 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund, he said, has provided support for research at such institutions as 
Cornell and the University of Illinois. "We take our place proudly behind other 
grantees." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the philosophical roots of the Pioneer Fund has drawn criticism 
from sources ranging from former U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas to CBS. On Friday, 
Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said in an 
interview that the organization has "been involved in funding racist activities 
for decades." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper cited a portion of the fund's original charter calling for the 
encouragement of "reproduction of individuals descended predominantly from 
white persons who settled in the original 13 states or from related stock." 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer Fund President Harry Weyher, contacted later, said the charter 
provision referred to a program under which less well-to-do parents with such 
attributes as courage and strength could receive financial assistance in order 
to have an additional child. The word white , he said, was stricken from the 
charter in 1985.

HOLLYWOOD PARK TO BACK COMPTON CASINO; GAMING: THE RACETRACK FIRM WILL 
CONTRIBUTE UP TO $10 MILLION, SHOWING ITS EXPANSION PLANS ARE NOT DEAD DESPITE 
A SETBACK WITH BICYCLE CLUB DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A controversial Compton card club that was approved for construction but has 
not been built for lack of funds received a boost this week when backers 
announced a new deal with Inglewood's Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park will provide up to $10 million for construction of Compton's 
Pyramid Club, both parties said. Compton Entertainment, the corporation 
applying for the state club license, hopes the cash will attract $20 million in 
additional financing needed so construction can begin in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal also shows that Hollywood Park's expansion plans are not yet dead 
even though its bid to buy into the Bicycle Club card casino in Bell Gardens 
was recently denied. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have certainly expressed an interest in partnership," said Michael 
Finnigan, chief financial officer of Hollywood Park and president of its gaming 
and entertainment division. "We see this as a good long-term investment." 
</P>
<P>
 What is keeping Hollywood Park from becoming a full partner with Compton 
Entertainment is the same law that blocked it from buying into the Bicycle 
Club. State law says no publicly traded company, such as Hollywood Park, can 
operate a card club in California. The $25-million card casino that opened last 
month at Hollywood Park is leased to another company, which runs the gaming 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 That law could be changed if legislation to create a state gaming commission 
and allow public companies to own casinos is resurrected in Sacramento. A 
measure that would have accomplished that died last week in the final hours of 
the legislative session. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Hollywood Park cannot yet claim partnership in the planned Compton 
casino, the company is putting $10 million into construction of the Pyramid 
Club building, which will be leased to Compton Entertainment. This is similar 
to its relationship with Pacific Casino Management, operator of the club at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park will provide an additional $5 million to help defray startup 
costs, Finnigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal may seem as though Hollywood Park is helping create stiff competition 
for the card club at the track because the Pyramid Club in Compton would be 
easily accessible from the Redondo Beach Freeway and Hollywood Park's club is 
more difficult to reach. But the participants said they are not concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They understand there is a greater market out there than is currently being 
tapped," said Jerold B. Neuman, attorney for Compton Entertainment and 
architect of the Hollywood Park deal. "Besides, if you're going to have 
competition, you might as well be involved in all of it." 
</P>
<P>
 What remains to be seen is whether Compton City Council members, who fought 
bitterly over the Pyramid Club before narrowly approving it, will accept the 
involvement of Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Entertainment President Rouben Kandilian will probably seek the 
council's permission to add Hollywood Park's name to the development agreement 
sometime this month, Neuman said. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, there are several other bureaucratic hurdles, such as state 
licensing, that the Pyramid Club must navigate. A license is not granted until 
all investors pass state background checks. So far, Kandilian is the only 
investor. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the club was given a city license in December, 1992, strong 
anti-casino feelings remain in the community and on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "This adds a new twist to the whole project," said Councilman Ronald J. Green. 
"I'm waiting for our staff to bring back a full report." 
</P>
<P>
 Green, who was not on the council when the casino vote was cast, is considered 
a possible Pyramid Club ally because of his political alliance with Mayor Omar 
Bradley, the proposal's chief supporter.

AL MARTINEZ: ON THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've written this column before. It was about young people, about school, 
about death and about rainbows. The date was January 26, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A student named Demetrius Rice had just been killed at Fairfax High by the 
accidental firing of a gun brought to school for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 I visited the campus and heard the kids talk about how haunted the place felt 
after the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 They were afraid to go to school, parents were afraid to send them, teachers 
were afraid to teach and everyone else was afraid for all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns were everywhere, the kids said. "I know I'm going to die in school," an 
11th-grader told me. 
</P>
<P>
 I quoted a poet back then, I can't remember who, saying that youth is a time 
to clothe oneself in rainbows, not to stand in bitter darkness and ponder 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 But pondering it they were, these kids whose lives had barely begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the death of Demetrius Rice, gunfire has killed or wounded students at 
schools in Chatsworth, in Reseda and in Southwest L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 And now a bullet has claimed the life of a 10th-grader at Hollywood High. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is familiar: flowers and candles on the lawn, sadness and fear in 
the classrooms. Not just at Hollywood High, where they grieve for a 16-year-old 
named Rolando Ruiz. The grief is more widespread than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Our children everywhere are in jeopardy. Their rainbows are growing dimmer 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I write this column with special passion, because on the day murder came to 
Hollywood High, two very important children in my life went back to school at 
the end of their summer. Their names are Travis and Shana, and they're my 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Shana is in the second grade and Travis in the fifth, and the first day of 
school was a heady time for them. Metaphors abound in the ritual of returning 
to the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The passage of summer represents another step toward growing up, toward change 
and, through knowledge, to the lessening of childhood's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis and Shana, brother and sister, seemed to sense that as they donned new 
clothes, helped pack their lunches and left, with glances backward, to the 
adventures that awaited. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw anticipation in their eyes, and I heard sadness in the goodbys they said 
to the toys of summer still scattered on their lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Time passes so quickly, and only toys and teddy bears never age. 
</P>
<P>
 I understand their emotions. The first day of school at any level was always 
an ordeal for me. The end of summer was like the death of a friend. I was 
walking into a room full of strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least there were no guns in school when I was growing up. There were no 
candles and flowers on the lawn, no tears in the classroom, no metal detectors, 
no murders on the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sweeter world for kids in my youth. The most violent we got was to 
engage in wild-swinging fistfights behind the bleachers. No one won, no one 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 We had rainbows back then. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In researching this column, I spoke to teachers who suggested we have good 
reason to be afraid. Drugs and violence, passed from high school to middle 
school, are reaching down to the elementary level. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find marijuana in the pocket of some kids," one fifth-grade teacher told 
me. "Others come to school smelling of the stuff. They all talk about finding 
drug paraphernalia in the rooms of their brothers and sisters." 
</P>
<P>
 Another teacher said that even little girls are joining gangs, because that's 
where strength and safety lie. That's where tomorrow is. 
</P>
<P>
 Less sensitive observers were quick to point out that Rolando Ruiz was a gang 
member, and his murder in front of Hollywood High was a result of his own 
decision to be a partner to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 But it really doesn't matter, in that sense, who the victims are. We all 
become victims when schools become too dangerous for our children. Fear is an 
equal opportunity emotion. It affects all cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 As time passes, it also won't matter where you live. The devil will come to 
the deepest suburbs and breach the barriers of the most protected communities. 
Your parks and your patios will be no safer than an inner-city street corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Your schools will become extensions of the urban battlegrounds that already 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 I worry about my grandchildren, and I worry about your children. We're 
responsible for a generation wrapped, not in rainbows, but in funeral shrouds. 
</P>
<P>
 We can only stand and wonder, Good God, how did we let that happen?

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; NEW SIGNALS WILL GO UP NEAR CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a large number of traffic accidents near Sts. Simon and Jude 
Catholic Church, the city has agreed to install left-turn arrow signals on two 
streets and build left-turn lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and clergy at the church have pressed city officials for the 
improvements, claiming the intersection is dangerous to the large number of 
schoolchildren who walk the streets in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 There were three car accidents in two days in late July at the Indianapolis 
Avenue and Magnolia Street intersection near the church. According to police, 
there were 29 accidents at the intersection between August, 1992 and July 30 of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Administrator Ray Silver said Thursday that left-turn arrow 
signals on both Magnolia Street and Indianapolis Avenue will be in place by 
Feb. 16, 1995. Left-turn lanes in both directions on Indianapolis Avenue will 
be installed by Sept. 30 of this year, Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25 church members attended this week's City Council meeting to urge the 
council to make the intersection improvements a top priority. More than 50 
people from the church congregation attended the Aug. 1 meeting to make the 
same request. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my greatest fears is that one of our children will be killed at this 
dangerous intersection as a result of our inaction," said Father Gus Krumm. 
</P>
<P>
 Krumm said there are eight public and private schools in the vicinity of the 
intersection. The council agreed Tuesday to make the intersection the top 
priority among the 23 intersections that are in need of signal improvements. 
The decision places the intersection first in line for funding and moves up 
installation of the signals from May, 1995, to February of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson said this week she was disappointed that the 
signals won't be installed until February. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want them in as soon as possible. For the safety of the children, I 
want to see our staff expedite it as fast as they can," Moulton Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver said that staffers are examining ways to speed up the installation of 
the signals and will suggest options at the council's Sept. 19 meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 The cost for the left-turn arrows will be about $60,000. The council is 
expected to approve the expenditure when it adopts the city's budget for the 
next fiscal year later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Krumm said everyone is pleased with the council's decision installed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means fewer accidents on the corner and a lot safer intersection at 
Indianapolis and Magnolia," he said.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; SCOUTS TO CLEAN UP LAND IN LIEU OF 
RENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A small army of Boy Scouts is expected to descend on six acres of city-owned 
land today to clean it up so they can camp there next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In an arrangement approved by the City Council, the Scouts will be allowed to 
use the city land just west of Camino Capistrano near Trabuco Creek for their 
labor in lieu of rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scouts plan to put on a large display of activities Sept. 17. The public 
is invited. Later that night, a campfire program and camp out is planned. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 400 to 700 Scouts from South County are expected to participate.  
</P>
<P>
 The group is the first to receive city permission to use open-space land 
obtained through a local bond measure. The land the Scouts will camp on is part 
of a former citrus grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going in as a service to clean up the property and prepare it," said 
Paul Watkins, program chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins, a volunteer, said about 100 Scouts will work from 8 to 10 a.m. today, 
picking up old wood, metal pieces from what used to be smudge pots and litter.  
</P>
<P>
 Watkins said the Scouts will receive service credit for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 During next Saturday's "Scouting on Display" program, youths will show off 
skills and hobbies.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PETERS PLACES SON IN HOME STUDY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After clashing with Ocean View School District officials this week over where 
his learning disabled child would attend school, Jim Peters enrolled him in a 
home study program, district officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the latest twist in an ongoing battle over the inclusion of 
special-education students in mainstream classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters has insisted that his 6-year-old son, Jimmy, attend regular class. But 
he was dissatisfied with the preparations the district made at Circle View 
Elementary School, where Jimmy was scheduled to start school on Wednesday and 
where he had attended preschool and kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a 180-degree turn from full inclusion," said Supt. James Tarwater. 
"It's ironic. We have done all of the training and are fully prepared in terms 
of a team, then (Peters) does not enroll his child" at the planned school. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters tried to enroll Jimmy in two other schools on Wednesday, but the 
district refused to allow the switch, saying the other schools were not 
prepared for the child, who they contend is disruptive and prone to violent 
outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy did not attend school all week and will be considered truant if he is 
not in class or enrolled in a home study program by Monday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a temporary solution," Peters said of the decision to enroll in home 
study. "My priority is Jimmy's safety and setting up an appropriate program for 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 In a locally unprecedented move, the district filed suit against Jimmy in May, 
seeking his ouster from Circle View school. 
</P>
<P>
 But a federal judge sent Jimmy back for the final days of school amid protests 
from parents of his classmates, some of whom pulled their children from school 
when Jimmy returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters said Golden View and College View elementary schools, where he 
attempted to enroll Jimmy this week, are closer to his home and may include 
parents more sympathetic to the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a situation where (the district) is not giving us any assurances 
that the same situation isn't going to happen all over again," said Peters' 
attorney, Joan Honeycutt. "That's the real problem. We want assurances that 
Jimmy will not be subjected to the same emotional abuse that he was subjected 
to last spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the stalemate between Peters and the district can be resolved, Jimmy 
will remain in home study where the district will provide speech and academic 
instruction for two hours a day. GREG HERNANDEZ

8 IN BIKER GANG ARRESTED IN 5-CITY SWEEP; CRACKDOWN: ABOUT 200 OFFICERS SEIZE 
WEAPONS AND DRUGS IN EARLY MORNING RAIDS. TWO FEDERAL AGENTS HAD INFILTRATED 
THE TIGHTLY KNIT HESSIANS CLUB.

<P>
 Federal authorities arrested eight members of the Orange County-based Hessians 
motorcycle club on drug and weapons charges in a pre-dawn raid Friday that 
spanned five cities in three counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents said they targeted the group for investigation about a year ago and 
hope the arrests send a signal to motorcycle gangs across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't ignore them," said Agent Chris Sadowski of the federal Bureau of 
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. "We (are sending) a message to motorcycle gangs 
from coast to coast that they are vulnerable to the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the 3:30 a.m. sweep across Anaheim, Bellflower, Stanton, 
Garden Grove and Riverside culminated an eight-month undercover operation in 
which two ATF agents infiltrated the motorcycle gang's 20-member local chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 officers from 10 federal, state, county and local law 
enforcement agencies seized 21 firearms including pistols, rifles and sawed-off 
shotguns and about 10 ounces of methamphetamine. Federal agents displayed the 
firearms and drugs as they announced the arrests at a press conference here. 
ATF officials estimated the street value of the narcotics at $5,000. Officials 
said they also dismantled a methamphetamine lab in the 10000 block of 
Brookhurst Street in Anaheim. Officials could not say how much of the drug was 
produced at the lab, which was not in operation at the time of the raid. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney representing one defendant wondered whether federal agents 
unfairly singled out the motorcycle club and invested an enormous amount of 
resources for a relatively minor return. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears they were out to get the Hessians," said federal deputy public 
defender Craig Wilke, who is representing Neal Ames Gustafson of Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson, 48, was arrested on suspicion of possessing a sawed-off rifle. "And 
it seems like the best they could do is get a 50-year-old man in a camper in 
Stanton with a modified rifle," Wilkes said. "I don't feel any safer." 
</P>
<P>
 More notable than the drug and weapons seizures, ATF officials said Friday, 
was the agency's penetration of the tightly knit gang. In July, an undercover 
agent was tapped as a probationary gang member and awarded a group patch -- an 
insignia with a skull impaled by a dagger. A female undercover agent also 
attended gang gatherings.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's only been a handful of instances where agents were able to become 
(motorcycle gang) members," Sadowski said.  
</P>
<P>
 ATF officials said they began the arrests Friday in part because of mounting 
concern that the cover of their undercover agents would be blown. A gang member 
told the male undercover agent that a gang member would "kill him and any 
family members he could find and . . . would put a grenade in (the agent's) 
mouth" if he turned out to be a federal agent, according a criminal complaint 
released by ATF officials Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests included Danny Lynn (Tombstone) Qualls, 47, of Garden Grove, 
president of the Hessians chapter. Qualls was charged with unlawful possession 
of a firearm and faces up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Orange County arrests included Steven Denton, 33, of Stanton on 
suspicion of unlawful possession of a sawed-off shotgun; and Don Hudson, 44, of 
Anaheim, on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm. If convicted, 
the pair, along with Gustafson, face up to 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Others arrested included Jack Burns, 66, and Edith Burns, 59, of Riverside on 
suspicion of possession of narcotics for sale; and Gerald Ridenour, 47, and 
Linda Bagley, 32, of Bellflower, also on suspicion of possession of narcotics 
for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, the Burns couple could face prison sentences of up to seven 
years, while Ridenour and Bagley could receive four years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hessians received widespread attention in June when the club's co-founder, 
Thomas F. Maniscalco, was sentenced to 46 years to life in prison for the 
execution-style slayings of two bikers and the daughter of a Los Alamitos 
police officer. The sentencing of the Westminster attorney marked the end of 
Orange County's longest-running criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hessians club was founded in 1968 in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa, and 
quickly gained notoriety for such crimes as rape, robbery, beatings and illegal 
drug transactions, police said. In 1972, the group boasted as many as 500 
members, but today, officials estimate, there are little more than 60 members 
in Southern California, Oregon and Nevada.

SUN CRUSADE SEEKS CROWD REFLECTING L.A. DIVERSITY

<P>
 For the first time since the Rev. Billy Graham preached to hundreds of 
thousands in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum 31 years ago, a major Christian 
crusade will open in the newly renovated landmark next weekend with an appeal 
for reconciliation among racial and ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Gospel message of salvation remains unchanged from when it was 
preached in the Coliseum in 1963 by Graham, Los Angeles' ethnic and cultural 
identity has undergone a dramatic transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the upcoming Christopher Sun Crusade is aimed at drawing 
crowds that reflect the ethnic diversity of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is as successful as hoped, backers say the rally could become the 
largest multiethnic Christian crusade ever held in the United States.

 Sun, who has held crusades in Taiwan, Canada, Australia, Malaysia and 
Singapore, said he didn't know how many would attend the Los Angeles event. 
Graham's 1963 crusade drew 134,000 on its single biggest night, Sun said. 
Seating capacity at the remodeled Coliseum is 67,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to cost $580,000, the Sun crusade has attracted widespread curiosity 
with its banners and billboards in ethnic neighborhoods throughout the city. 
The Christopher Sun Evangelistic Assn. is based in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We preach the Gospel here because we really have a burden for our city," Sun 
said, referring to the 1992 riots and a series of recent natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time Christian brothers and sisters come together to be reconciled . . . 
to transform this city to a city of reconciliation, a city of God, a city of 
peace," the evangelist told reporters this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The crusade, to be held Sept. 16-18 beginning at 7:30 p.m. each night, will be 
conducted in English and simultaneously translated into Mandarin, Korean and 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure broad ethnic representation, Sun began meeting monthly with African 
American, Anglo, Chinese American, Latino and Korean American religious 
leaders. He was invited to preach at their churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first crusade of this magnitude planned by spiritual leaders of 
such diverse, ethnic backgrounds. Its purpose is really to heal," said the Rev. 
Harold Helms, pastor of Angelus Temple in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is quite different today," Helms added. "We may be the most 
cosmopolitan city in the world. Our racial and ethnic diversities can explode 
or serve as a model for the world." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a question, Minister Calvin Brown of the West Angelus Church of 
God in Christ said Sun's crusade differs markedly from the Promise Keepers 
crusade in May that drew 50,000 predominantly white men to Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has come to the community, ate in the community, driven the streets at 
night. He has felt the heartbeat of the city," said Brown, who is minister for 
evangelism at the predominantly African American congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 While he said Promise Keepers was "an excellent crusade to . . . the middle 
class, the very wealthy, Caucasian Americans," Sun was reaching out to all 
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the difference. This is what the Body of Christ is like. There is no 
race barrier," said Brown. "Until large crusades stop becoming exclusive and 
begin to reach out the way Dr. Sun has," Brown said, "then we will always be 
divided." 
</P>
<P>
 Promise Keepers is a men's ministry. Its founder, University of Colorado head 
football coach Bill McCartney, has repeatedly called for stepped-up efforts by 
Promise Keepers to break down racial barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun and his wife, Shirley, said they were warmly greeted when they began 
calling on various ethnic groups in preparation for the Coliseum event. But he 
said they were surprised to learn how little dialogue exists between ethnic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine that it's even harder to preach in L.A. than foreign 
countries," said Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Sun noted that the population of Los Angeles County exceeds that of 
some foreign countries. Within that figure are ethnic groups with large 
numbers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles today belongs to all ethnic groups," she said. "It's no longer a 
one-race community." 
</P>
<P>
 Sun, 41, who grew up in the Lutheran church but now describes himself as 
interdenominational, began thinking about holding his first U.S. crusade in 
1988. In 1992, after a smaller evangelistic meeting in Anaheim that drew 7,000 
people on each of two nights, he began planning for next weekend's Los Angeles 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Sun, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in Taiwan, said he made a commitment to 
become an evangelist after attending a Billy Graham crusade in Taipei in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Before entering the ministry, Sun was a licensed California architect. He 
received his bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture from UC Berkeley, 
a master's in theology from Fuller Theological Seminary in 1984, and a 
doctorate from the California Graduate School of Theology in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The crusade has been endorsed by pastors of a variety of churches within the 
African American, Latino, Chinese American, Korean American and Anglo 
communities. Among them are Campus Crusade for Christ President Bill Bright, 
who is honorary chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Others include the Rev. Lloyd Ogilvie of First Presbyterian Church of 
Hollywood, Pastor Jack Hayford of the Church on the Way in Van Nuys, the Rev. 
Cecil Murray of First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles, Bishop 
Charles E. Blake of the Church of God in Christ, Dr. Emory C. Campbell, 
executive minister of the Los Angeles Baptist City Mission Society (American 
Baptist). 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Hee M. Park of Young Nak Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles, the Rev. 
Joel Torres, superintendent of the Pacific Latin American District of 
Assemblies of God; Dr. John E. Whan Kim of Los Angeles Christian Reformed 
Church and president of the International Theological Seminary; and the Rev. 
Andrew Kwok of the Chinese Life Lutheran Church.

A SPIRITUAL OASIS APPEARS ON LAS VEGAS STRIP; CHURCHES: WHAT IS A NEW 
2,000-SEAT RELIGIOUS FACILITY DOING IN THE MIDDLE OF SIN CITY? NOT MUCH AT THE 
MOMENT, BUT LOCAL CLERICS HAVE NOT LOST FAITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's Roman Catholic diocese has built a $3.5-million shrine just for 
tourists at this booming gambling and entertainment mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The gleaming white spiritual oasis -- adorned with $300,000 worth of religious 
art -- can seat 2,000 people in its upholstered pews, making it the largest 
church building in Nevada, regardless of denomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shrine of the Most Holy Redeemer, which opened in February last year, is 
close to a newly valuable intersection of casino hotels on the glitzy Las Vegas 
Strip -- across the street from the pyramid-shaped Luxor Hotel, just south of 
the Tropicana and not far from the giant MGM Grand. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, despite being within walking distance of 18,000 rooms at six major 
hotels, few out-of-towners seem to know it's here. So far, the largest of three 
Sunday Masses averages only about 300 in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should tell more people about this -- it's so well-done and so clean," 
said Stella Kadlec of LaGrange, Ill., one of 40 people who attended the 11:30 
a.m. Mass one weekday in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The 75-year-old woman may be typical of Roman Catholics who want to include 
worship along with playing the slot machines, finding bargain buffet meals, 
catching the nighttime shows and watching the pirate ship battle and fiery 
volcanic display outside two nearby Strip hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Kadlec said she and her sister come to Las Vegas two or three times a year, 
and they make it a point to attend services -- not to pray for good luck, but 
to enjoy "a sort of retreat" off the busy Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, she has gone to Mass at Guardian Angel Cathedral, located behind the 
Desert Inn. But that church serves a parish as well as tourists, and despite 
its recent expansion, the cathedral is overcrowded with 8,000 to 9,000 
worshipers every weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Strip) is so materialistic that people want to step back a bit, and some 
people just like to go to church," said Bishop Daniel F. Walsh, who has headed 
the Reno-Las Vegas Diocese since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Word about the new shrine has been given to taxi drivers and hotel concierges, 
but the job turnover is considerable and with the constant influx of tourists, 
"every Saturday you start from ground zero," as one priest put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Separated from Las Vegas Boulevard by a parking lot for Excalibur Hotel and 
Casino employees, the church is set back from the Strip. But it is visible if 
you know where to look. * 
</P>
<P>
 The white stucco shrine is built in an A-shape that rises to the equivalent of 
three stories, dwarfing a seven-foot statue of Jesus with outstretched arms. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no neon angels are there to compete with the obelisk and giant sphinx 
entrance to the Luxor, or to share the spotlight with the brightly colored 
turrets on the castle-like Excalibur.  
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Morelli, office secretary at the church, adds good-naturedly: "(And) 
we have no cross revolving high in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 The shrine does, however, have its own noteworthy features, albeit on a 
relatively modest scale. In addition to a 300-year-old painting of Our Lady of 
Guadalupe and a mural depicting Roman Catholic pioneers in the Americas in the 
church's chapel, another bronze statue of Christ seated on a rock outside the 
entrance offers visitors the chance to photograph themselves with Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when the temperature outside is 110 degrees, Jesus' lap is 150 degrees, 
so we don't advise parents to let kids sit in his lap then," said Father James 
Bevan, until recently the shrine's rector. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the bishop, who regards a show at the Luxor featuring ancient Egyptian 
gods as "just entertainment," Bevan does not see Las Vegas as an evil and 
degrading place but rather as a vacation spot where most tourists simply come 
to have fun. "People basically behave themselves and go home," the priest said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, Las Vegas is a holy place," Bevan said with a smile."You see 
people praying in the casinos, and trust me, when they pray in the casinos, 
they really mean it." 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the shrine's low profile, Bishop Walsh is looking toward 
long-range needs and is encouraged by strong financial support in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate it will take three to five years before we get filled with 
people," said Walsh, 57, who previously was an auxiliary bishop in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh cannot be faulted for lack of foresight. 
</P>
<P>
 Running out of time in 1989 to find a worship site at the growing north end of 
the Strip, Walsh said he bought five acres for $2.6 million at the corner of 
Giles Street and Reno Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Major donors for church construction have included MGM Grand's Kirk Kerkorian, 
the Hilton Hotels, Caesars Palace and the family that owns the Palace Station 
casino-hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people who have made their money off tourism wanted to show their 
gratitude by giving something to the church," said William Turbay, president of 
Martinez & Murphey, the Las Vegas religious art company that is still adding 
sculptures to the church interior. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Roman Catholics have been pleased to "present our local church in such 
a visible and attractive way," Walsh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Shrine of the Most Holy Redeemer opened, Walsh turned down a 
developer's offer of $13.5 million to buy the land and to move the church 
building about two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some things are worth more than money," the bishop said.

ART IMITATES LIFE TOO MUCH

<TEXT>
<P>
 When a $90,000 sculpture depicting Jesus' Last Supper was planned for the 
shrine built for Roman Catholic tourists, Bishop Daniel F. Walsh wanted the 
faces of the disciples to be based on photographs of some of his priests for a 
natural, rather than idealized, look to Jesus' followers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the artistic rendition of the priests by Martinez & Murphey Inc., was too 
accurate in one case, said Richard G. Rock, president of the religious art firm 
that moved its headquarters here from Alhambra in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could clearly recognize the priest whose face we used for Judas," said 
Rock, referring to the betrayer of Jesus in the Gospels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We changed his features," Rock said. JOHN DART

STATE COURT TO REVIEW REFUSAL TO RENT TO COUPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Revisiting a clash of religion and civil rights, the state Supreme Court 
agreed Thursday to decide whether property owners with religious objections can 
refuse to rent to unmarried couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the seven justices, all except Marvin Baxter, granted review of an 
appeal by two would-be tenants and a state civil rights agency. They were 
appealing a lower court ruling that granted a Chico landlady a religious 
exemption from the state's ban on housing discrimination based on marital 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 No hearing date has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which has attracted nationwide attention from conservative religious 
organizations, has the potential to create a broad religious exemption from 
California's anti-discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the Chico tenants say the exemption recognized by the lower court 
would also allow exclusions of same-sex couples and could apply to any 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case, Evelyn Smith, owner of two duplexes, refused in 1987 to rent to 
Kenneth Phillips and Gail Randall because they were unmarried.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Employment and Housing Commission fined Smith $954 for violating the 
state law against housing discrimination based on marital status. But the 3rd 
District Court of Appeal in Sacramento ruled in May that enforcement of the law 
against Smith violated her religious freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith "cannot remain faithful to her religious convictions and beliefs and yet 
rent to unmarried couples," Presiding Justice Robert Puglia said in the 3-0 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the state violated Smith's freedom of speech by ordering her to 
post a notice saying discrimination based on marital status was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the appeals court's rationale, said Thomas F. Coleman, a lawyer for 
would-be tenant Phillips, restaurant owners with religious objections to 
homosexuality could refuse to serve "two people holding hands or coming in from 
a gay rights rally with a slogan on their T-shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 "If a single woman lives alone in an apartment and gets pregnant, eviction 
could be right around the corner," Coleman said.

TAPED EVIDENCE OF DRUG SALES A VITAL WEAPON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Video and audiotape capturing drugs sales during a massive undercover 
crackdown in one of Santa Ana's most crime-ridden neighborhoods will be 
difficult -- if not impossible -- to challenge in court, prosecutors said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even defense attorneys predict that the more than 130 adults and juveniles 
charged as part of "Operation Roundup" will probably plead guilty to felony 
drug charges. Jurors need only check to see whether the suspect in the 
videotape is the same person sitting at the defense table before returning a 
conviction, they concede. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendants in these cases are going to be hard-pressed to say, 'Not me, I 
didn't do it,' because we can say, 'What about this videotape, or what about 
this videotape?' " said Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph P. Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the way police and prosecutors wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
 Before police swept through Santa Ana's neighborhoods Wednesday looking for 
suspects indicted by a secretly impaneled grand jury, prosecutors had trouble 
gaining convictions against drug dealers and 6th Street Gang members who 
control several areas. Residents were simply too terrified to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Operation Roundup" began earlier this year, undercover police officers 
made audio and videotapes of the drug transactions to use in court, eliminating 
the need for civilian witnesses, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana police made the job easier, but more importantly (they) made the 
job of jurors easier," Smith said, adding that the police, not gangs, will now 
control the streets. "The Santa Ana Police Department is the biggest 'gang' in 
town and they are the toughest and they're not going to be afraid to testify." 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 30 men and women so far have pleaded not guilty to felony drug 
sales, and many are additionally charged with selling drugs near schools, 
selling drugs to further gang activity or face life in prison if convicted of 
yet another felony under the new "three strikes" sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 15 juveniles are also facing charges, and police are still 
searching for about 40 others named in felony indictments but not yet arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are still preparing for the arraignments of dozens more defendants 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants face up to five years in prison for selling drugs and additional 
prison time for other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Michael Brenner said the court system will 
do what it takes to handle the influx of new cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready for it, that's what we're here for," Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Public Defender Brian Ducker, whose office will be 
handling many of the cases, agreed that videotape evidence can be persuasive 
with jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that videotapes can mean a lot of (guilty) pleas," Ducker said, 
stressing that his office has only begun reviewing evidence in the cases and 
will be considering a variety of defense strategies. "I don't think you can 
assume anything at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials have hailed the arrests as a successful first step 
in taking back control of the neighborhood in the 1000 to 1100 blocks of West 
3rd Street, which was overrun by drug peddlers and hard-core gangbangers who 
terrorized residents.

STILL MORE LUMPS FOR 'ROGUE' BROKERS; GAO URGES REDOUBLING OF ATTACK ON 
INVESTMENT MALPRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new report from the General Accounting Office is highly critical of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the nation's stock exchanges for not 
being more aggressive in weeding out unscrupulous stockbrokers. The most 
disturbing fact in the report is that "rogue" brokers who supposedly have been 
permanently banned from the securities industry often resurface at brokerages 
or in banking, insurance or other financial services. In one case, the report 
said, a broker barred by the SEC because of fraudulent selling of securities 
was allowed to remain in the business as long as he sold only mutual funds and 
annuities. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of brokers with records of dishonesty is small; most stock brokers 
are reputable. However, investors need better protection from the problem 
brokers. The GAO said the seemingly mild punishment meted out to rogue brokers 
"may give investors the perception that violators are tolerated." The 
investigative arm of Congress recommended that the SEC go beyond the tougher 
enforcement efforts it announced in May when the commission completed its own 
inquiry into the broker problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC conducted the investigation in response to a 1992 series by Times 
staff writer Scot J. Paltrow, who reported that many of the nation's biggest 
brokerages knowingly hired or retained brokers with records of disciplinary 
problems, lawsuits and customer complaints. The agency found evidence of 
serious rule violations at 25% of the brokerage branch offices it inspected. It 
has taken a number of steps to crack down on firms that employ dishonest 
brokers, including formal enforcement actions and calling on the exchanges to 
step up their inspections and supervision of brokerages. 
</P>
<P>
 In recommending that the SEC take further steps, the GAO suggested that the 
commission become involved in redesigning the Central Registration Depository, 
which keeps records of disciplinary problems of brokers. The system currently 
cannot be used to identify which securities firms take on brokers with a 
history of customer complaints and discipline problems. The system also does 
not provide a means for users to identify the 100 brokers nationally known to 
be most often named in complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the GAO recommended that the Treasury Department lend a hand to 
help the SEC track banned brokers after they leave the securities business, 
often moving on to jobs in insurance or banking. 
</P>
<P>
 These recommendations deserve the close attention of SEC Chairman Arthur 
Levitt Jr., who will not discuss the GAO report until he appears next week at 
hearings on problem brokers to be held by the House subcommittee on 
telecommunications and finance. That panel commissioned the GAO report.  
</P>
<P>
 The potential prey for unethical brokers has increased in recent years as many 
people have transferred their money from safe, low-yield accounts in banks to 
stocks or mutual funds, which have a higher return but are riskier. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry self-policing efforts have not adequately addressed the problem of 
unethical brokers. The SEC move to step up oversight back in May was the first 
step in that direction. Incorporating the GAO recommendations is a logical next 
step.

CUBA ACCORD: A WELCOME BEGINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In diplomatic terms, the announcement that U.S. State Department negotiators 
have reached agreement with the government of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro on a 
joint plan to stem the chaotic flight of refugees from that island is 
encouraging. But the announcement is sketchy on some key details, so it remains 
to be seen whether it is as promising as the White House claims. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be several days, for example, before the agreement has any visible 
effect on the latest exodus of desperate Cubans to this country, most of whom 
make the dangerous journey in small rafts or even inner tubes. The Coast Guard 
is currently picking up about 1,000 Cuban refugees each day in the Florida 
Straits. How many may have departed in the last day or so and remain at sea is 
simply not known. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement requires that the Castro government "take effective measures in 
any way it possibly can" to prevent the unsafe departure of Cuban citizens for 
the United States, according to a joint communique issued by the two 
governments in New York, the site of negotiations. Castro clearly has the 
police he would need to keep his country's citizens from undertaking dangerous 
sea journeys to the United States. But when one recalls the harsh tactics 
Castro has used to keep a tight rein on his island nation in the past, a term 
like "effective measures" sounds scary. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, Cuban officials have promised to take no repressive measures against 
would-be refugees -- even those who return to Cuba. But after 35 years of bad 
relations and mistrust between Washington and Havana, it is understandable if 
many U.S. citizens, especially Cuban Americans, are dubious about how good 
Castro's word is. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for Castro's cooperation in halting the exodus, Washington agreed 
to increase the number of Cubans granted legal entry visas to at least 20,000 
per year from the current annual average of slightly more than 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agreement says nothing about letting Cubans who live in this country 
send U.S. currency to relatives on the island, a practice that had become 
commonplace in recent years but which was prohibited by the Clinton 
Administration when the latest refugee flow reached crisis proportions. While 
the flow of dollars into Cuba was small, it helped relieve the genuine hardship 
many Cuban families faced as Castro's state-run economy crumbled. Their 
privation also fed the desperation that caused the latest surge of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer of dollars and other steps that could be taken to relieve 
suffering in Cuba as the Castro regime implodes must be on the agenda in future 
U.S.-Cuba negotiations -- and there indeed must be more talks to follow up on 
this successful start. The end clearly is near for Castro. It is only prudent 
for the Clinton Administration to be prepared for whatever comes next. The best 
way to be prepared is to keep the lines of communication to Havana open.

U.S. TRADE RELATIONS WITH CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Todd Carrell's views (Commentary, Sept. 1) on the limits to U.S. missionary 
and capitalist zeal in China are the most sensible to appear in The Times for 
many moons. He identifies but does not explain the cultural thresholds across 
which both Chinese and Americans view and bargain with each other in a world 
that is rapidly filling up. We, raised in an exaggerated secular expression of 
Calvinist predestination of the individual that was made affordable by the 
conquest of the American West, protect the person at the expense of the 
community. The Chinese protect the community at the expense of the individual. 
Both systems have their excesses and costs along with their benefits; the point 
is that they are and will remain different. 
</P>
<P>
 These basic differences are reflected in many ways. In China, law and 
government are the same; here we love the law and hate the government. The 
hierarchical Confucian model assumes trust and harmony in a cooperative system 
of command and control; our free-market democracy is one where trust is an 
earned competitive advantage. There are many other distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems evident to Carrell that mutual acceptance of these realities is 
inevitable. There is some urgency in this. I believe it will lead to 
cooperation that will increasingly rule over competition in a shrinking world 
where wars for resources and markets will be succeeded by conflicts over 
riparian rights to pollute. It will be more efficient to adapt to cultural 
differences than to try to eliminate them.

 * How ironic the article (Aug. 31) on China and its "progress in human rights" 
just below a photo of two leggy dress-up dolls symbolizing China's treatment of 
women. How continually ironic the U.S. policy toward Cuba, where, as opposed to 
China, it is still not believed that "commercial engagement has a greater 
impact than the threat of commercial disengagement." If only we could learn 
from our lessons, and really live by our ideals.

 * The Clinton Administration's non-policy on Cuba is a total disgrace and the 
epitome of hypocrisy. At the same time when Commerce Secretary Ron Brown is 
dispatched to Beijing to initiate talks on increased trade with China, the 
largest remaining communist country and which has been granted MFN status, the 
Administration pretends that a small decrepit island nation in the Caribbean is 
still the threat that we were all led to believe it was during the Cold War and 
states that further suffering by its people is the only solution to the Castro 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era that has seen mortal enemies such as the PLO and Israel, the IRA and 
Britain, Mandela and De Klerk engaged in peace talks, why then does this 
Administration insist on continuing a 35-year-old policy that has obviously 
failed? 
</P>
<P>
 Open trade with Cuba will hasten the demise of Castro's government faster than 
any embargo will.

CLEAN AIR PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Smog Plan Would Harm Economy" (Sept. 30) seriously misrepresents the Wilson 
Administration's recognized leadership on air quality improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to this complicated issue is that the proposed Federal Implementation 
Plan (FIP) -- drafted by the federal EPA -- is under legal authority from the 
1977 Clean Air Act amendments, a law subsequently superseded by the 1990 Clean 
Air Act amendments. In 1991, over the combined objections of the U.S. EPA and 
California, the Los Angeles Coalition for Clean Air convinced a federal court 
to compel the U.S. EPA (not California) to apply the old law here -- and only 
here -- in California. California has continued to work in Congress to clarify 
that the 1990 act superseded the provisions of the 1977 act. Regrettably, the 
federal EPA chose not to take a leadership role in the fighting for its 
previous position. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to emphasize that the U.S. EPA's 1977 FIP exercise will not 
enhance air quality. U.S. EPA has repeatedly stated its legal obligations under 
the 1977 FIP will be satisfied by California through a satisfactory state 
implementation plan (SIP) drafted under the 1990 Clean Air Act. The Air 
Resources Board has, therefore been hard at work developing a SIP to meet 
federal requirements. Given that U.S. EPA is far behind in completing numerous 
air regulations under the 1990 act that directly relate to California -- 
including interstate transportation -- they would also be well-advised to move 
their resources to meet real environmental needs.  
</P>
<P>
 While the 1977 FIP is a federal obligation relating to issues of an earlier 
decade, we have worked directly and intensively, filing timely formal comments 
and maintaining a continuing technical dialogue with U.S. EPA. Some critics' 
real objection is the fact that we continue to simultaneously work to eliminate 
the legal confusion that led to the U.S. EPA's obligation to draft the 1977 FIP 
now at issue. 
</P>
<P>
 California is making tangible progress in cleaning its air. By far the largest 
share of the credit must go to the millions of citizens who make it possible, 
even though the challenge can be difficult. This 1977 FIP process -- based on 
controversies long past, on authority of a superseded law -- manages to 
threaten our economy while not adding value to our environmental protection 
efforts.

CLINTON HEALTH PLAN COLLAPSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Blame for Health Plan's Collapse Falls Everywhere" (Aug. 28) fails to give 
credit to the American public for its wisdom. As time went on, America realized 
several things: 
</P>
<P>
 * The bill was taking us down the road to socialism -- the very thing that the 
rest of the world was running from as quickly as possible. Socialism is a 
failed philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 * America already has the best health delivery system in the world. Why 
destroy it? 
</P>
<P>
 * Do we really want our health delivery system controlled by 50-100 new 
federal bureaucracies? We have seen that government is the problem. Why allow 
it to totally screw up our health system? 
</P>
<P>
 * The so-called "health crisis" is at least partially a figment of the 
President's imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 * Why should the public trust anything put together under a cloak of secrecy 
by a body of people accountable to no one? 
</P>
<P>
 JAMES G. KREDER 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * As one who spent much of 1993 and 1994 traveling around the country debating 
representatives from the White House on the merits of the original Clinton 
health plan and offering an alternative without the excessive governmental 
costs and bureaucracies, I particularly enjoyed the article by Karen Tumulty 
and Edwin Chen (Aug. 28).  
</P>
<P>
 Your reporters did an excellent job of pointing out some of the flaws in the 
Clinton plan and laying out the reasons why it has not been popularly received, 
either in Congress or by the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 One major problem with the Clinton plan was overlooked in the article and also 
missed in the comments by Prof. Uwe Reinhardt. The real reason the Clinton plan 
was such a failure was that it didn't take into account the practical workings 
of today's health care system and the views of the America people who are 
served by the health care system. I believe the plan was fatally flawed when a 
narrow group of so-called experts, most from within the Beltway, joined with 
special interests to try to develop in a vacuum the "perfect" governmental 
solution for all of our health care problems. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned in traveling around my state and in other states what the problems 
were and the views of the people. They pointed out practical solutions that the 
inside-the-Beltway group ignored. It was for this reason that the original 
Chafee plan (John Chafee, R-R.I.), which I helped draft, and the subsequent 
"mainstream" compromise plan put forward by a bipartisan group, reflected a 
much less intrusive, less expensive, and non-bureaucratic solution to the 
problems in the health care system today. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not accurate to say that special interests were responsible for killing 
the Clinton health care plan and the Clinton-Mitchell (George Mitchell, D-Me.) 
substitute. The fatal flaws and misconceptions were built into the plan from 
the start. The American people, who looked at the plan and did not like what 
they saw, were the reason it has gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 There still are some major flaws that we need to correct in the health care 
delivery system in America. I hope that we will be able to listen to the people 
we are supposed to serve and draft appropriate legislation to fix only that 
which is wrong with the system. 
</P>

POLICE LEARN IDENTITY OF MULTIPLE-SHOOTING VICTIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have identified the body of a man found Thursday by a county work crew 
as Carlos Huerta Villavicencio, 28, of San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Villavicencio had been shot several times in the upper torso with a 
small-caliber gun, according to Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. The 
body was found at the base of a 25-foot dirt embankment along La Pata Road, 200 
yards east of Ortega Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said police do not know if Villavicencio, who was fully clothed, was 
killed where his body was found, or whether he was shot elsewhere and taken to 
the site.

NEWPORT MAY HAVE ANSWER TO DOG MESS: IT'S IN THE BAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to help dog owners do their duty after dogs do theirs will go before 
the Newport Beach City Council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for installation of "doggie walk bag" dispensers at up to 15 
locations around the city, general services director Dave Niederhaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Primarily you're going to see these in the areas where the people walk their 
dogs: the sandy areas, the parks where people don't want their children running 
through that," he said. "The problem was crucial on Balboa Island. There's only 
so many places you can walk there." 
</P>
<P>
 Three neighborhoods -- Balboa Island, Little Balboa Island and Newport Island 
-- have had the dispensers for about six months with successful reduction in 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine resident Chris Crosson came up with the idea for pole-mounted 
dispensers after a bad experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he stepped in a dog nuisance one day on Balboa Island and I think he 
saw the circumference of the problem," Niederhaus said. "This is just a little 
hobby invention of his." 
</P>
<P>
 He also recruited sponsor businesses that will pay for the installation and 
bag supplies, most in exchange for sponsorship credit posted beside the 
dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's anti-nuisance ordinance makes dog owners liable for fines if they 
are not armed with cleanup apparatus while walking their dogs in public places, 
but some areas have persistent problems, Niederhaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members have been reluctant in the past to allow sponsorship 
signs, fearing it would create the appearance of a product endorsement, so 
Niederhaus is seeking approval before ordering the installations.

CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY TO ADD LAW SCHOOL; EDUCATION: INSTITUTION COULD BECOME 
COUNTY'S FIRST TO BE ACCREDITED BY AMERICAN BAR ASSN. LAWYERS HAIL IDEA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman University will establish what could become Orange County's first law 
school accredited by the American Bar Assn., university officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials will not discuss details until next week, but they said that 
administrators have been exploring the possibility of a law school on the 
campus for about a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Chapman President James L. Doti will announce the creation of the school on 
Monday. Western State University College of Law Prof. Jeremy Miller will become 
acting dean of the school, Chapman officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredibly wonderful," Tustin attorney Kathryn E. Terry said about the 
prospect of an accredited law school in the county. "And Jeremy (Miller) is 
dedicated, hard-working and brilliant. I think he'll be an excellent dean." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has been at Western State since 1983, and teaches at its Fullerton 
campus. He lists several published law books and tapes for students on his 
resume, and is a former columnist for the Los Angeles Daily Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the editor of Orange County Lawyer magazine and also helped create 
Western State's celebrated program that requires new students to do free legal 
work for the poor and needy to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry said she has spoken with Miller -- who was once her professor at Western 
State -- about becoming an instructor at the new law school.  
</P>
<P>
 "Young people coming out of college will have an option now," Terry said. If 
Chapman succeeds at getting American Bar Assn. accreditation, she said, it 
likely will attract a different student base than Western State -- the county's 
main law school. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Craft, a spokeswoman for Western State, said the college is accredited by 
the Committee of Bar Examiners of the State Bar of California, but not by the 
American Bar Assn. Western State unsuccessfully had sought American Bar Assn. 
accreditation for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The association accredits only schools that satisfy set standards in 
student-teacher ratios, library size and other academic areas.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know people like myself, who could have qualified for an ABA school because 
of grades and academics, but had to stay in Orange County," Terry said. "Some 
of us were mothers and working and married -- we couldn't commute up to 
Pepperdine (University) or other law schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Other attorneys praised the idea of a new law school in Orange County. 
Representatives of the county's bar association say their organization is 
California's third largest -- with 9,700 lawyers -- behind Los Angeles and San 
Francisco bar associations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County is a big enough community and growing fast enough that it could 
easily use another law school," Orange County Bar Assn. President Steve 
McCracken has said. "That's despite the fact Western State's provided a great 
service to the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach lawyer Andrew J. Guilford said a new law school would provide 
the county with a good local research library, as well as competitive law 
students who could become clerks in local courts. It would also benefit 
Chapman's growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Virtually every major university in the country has a law school," Guilford 
said. "A law school strengthens a university and gives it a bigger alumni 
base." 
</P>
<P>
 Guilford noted that UC Irvine also had explored the possibility of creating a 
law school, but that plans are on hold. Other attorneys pointed out that 
officials at Loyola University, in Los Angeles County, were considering 
establishing a law school in Orange County -- but decided against it.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A BOOST FOR MINORITY COLLEGE STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A college campus can be a daunting place at first, even for a student living 
at home and commuting. The classes are tougher than in high school, the other 
students are strangers, the instructors can appear distant. Entering higher 
education can be especially tough for those who are the first in their families 
to attend college: There is no parent, brother or sister at home to share 
experiences and offer hints on coping. That's why mentor programs of the type 
at Orange Coast College and Irvine Valley College are valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past few years, the two campuses have had groups of student and 
faculty advisers to help minority students to make the transition from high 
school to college. A counselor who founded one of the programs aptly compared 
it to a family providing role models. Students can get hints on where and how 
to seek financial aid, how to use their study time and simply how to feel more 
at home in college. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials say that as Orange County becomes more ethnically diverse, 
they are seeing more students who are the first in their families to attend 
college.

 A University of California survey last year found that nearly three-quarters 
of the white applicants for admission had fathers who had some college 
experience. The number dropped to 54% for Asian American applicants; for 
Mexican Americans who applied the number was 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an economic correlation as well: Median income of the parents of the 
Mexican Americans was $29,000 a year; for Asian Americans it was $38,000; for 
whites, $70,000. The more education a person has, the more money he or she is 
likely to earn in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the poorer the family, the harder it will be to come up with 
the tuition. Although scholarships and loans are available, a large percentage 
of students still cannot afford to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students benefiting from the mentor programs at Orange Coast and Irvine 
Valley said they plan to continue their education at major universities. That 
is a sign the program has helped them adapt and widened their horizons, a key 
aspect of higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 It is heartening also to see students in the programs presenting themselves as 
role models and spreading the word to friends and family members who are 
considering college that they indeed can continue their education. Opening the 
college doors to people from all ethnic backgrounds helps everyone, as does a 
better-educated society.

BALANCING ETHNICITY AND THE TV LINEUP

 Howard Rosenberg's column " 'M.A.N.T.I.S.' Racial Flap Sign of a Double 
Standard?" (Aug. 26) distorts the situation of African Americans on television. 
Although several of the new series this fall have African Americans in lead and 
co-starring roles, African Americans are not over-represented, as Rosenberg 
implies.Television is more than just prime time. There are cable networks, 
syndicated shows and movies of the week. And African Americans are certainly 
not 24% of all the roles on television, as Rosenberg cites for the Fox 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The casting off of two African assistants of "M.A.N.T.I.S.' " -- Dr. Hawkins 
and the black female coroner -- was part of a larger shift away from the 
African American-centered context of the pilot. What the Rainbow Commission on 
Fairness finds unacceptable is the assumption that a nearly all-black action 
fantasy couldn't attract a crossover audience. Certainly the success of "The 
Cosby Show" revealed that audiences weren't intimidated by the all-black cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Who holds the decision-making power? Fox is a contender among the networks 
because it won a younger, racially diverse audience coveted by advertisers 
through hip, urban, African American shows. How and why it decided to move in 
another direction deserves more analysis than dismissing Jesse Jackson and the 
Congressional Black Caucus as ethnic police. We need more diversity in front of 
the camera and in network and studio programming development departments and in 
the purchases of goods and services associated with the industry.

VALUED OPINIONS; APPRAISERS PUT IN TWO CENTS' WORTH TO HELP DETERMINE WHAT'S 
PRECIOUS, WHAT'S NOT 
</P>

 For Roberta Gauthey, a Laguna Beach appraiser, it was the case of the 
coffeepot that almost got away. 
</P>
<P>
 Gauthey had just finished examining the furnishings inside a San Clemente 
residence when the owners mentioned that they had a pile of stuff sitting in 
their garage that they were about to give away. Gauthey immediately asked if 
she could take a look. There, among the discards, sat an old pewter coffeepot 
filled with "greasy, plastic flowers." Gauthey inspected the pot, then flipped 
it over and studied the manufacturer's stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 "That pot was an Early American coffeepot. It was worth more than anything in 
their house," Gauthey says. She later estimated the pot's value at $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tales of hidden treasure are common among appraisers. Individuals, they 
say, often have no idea how much their possessions are worth. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where appraisers come in. They act as sleuths to track down the 
identity and value of objects in the home. Sometimes their digging unearths 
unexpected booty. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Litwack, an appraiser in Corona del Mar, remembers one couple's delight 
upon learning that a collectible fountain pen they owned was worth more than 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had no idea," she says. "They would have been happy if it was worth 
$3,000." 
</P>
<P>
 More often, however, people overestimate the value of their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think they have real Chippendale furniture and it turns out to be an 
anniversary piece that was made 100 years later," Gauthey says. "Or they think 
they have a Tiffany lamp that turns out to be plastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Family gossip is usually to blame for the inflated estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times it's hearsay," Gauthey says. "They'll call and say, 'This 
piece has been in my family for 200 years,' and I'll say, 'But it's an electric 
lamp. I don't think so.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Litwack once appraised an etching that the owners assumed was a valuable 
original by Salvador Dali. It turned out to be a worthless fake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Small pieces can be brought into an appraiser's office to be evaluated, but 
often appraisers go the the client's home and study its contents. They record 
each piece's condition, characteristics, size, history of ownership, 
manufacturer and other details that affect its value, Litwack says. 
</P>
<P>
 They look for clues to establish the age of the object, such as the piece's 
construction, shrinkage of the fabric and even the color of the wood, Gauthey 
says. They check if the furnishing has been refinished and has all of its 
original hardware. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more original the piece, the more valuable," Gauthey says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they dig through research materials to calculate the object's value. Most 
appraisers have libraries of antique trade publications, price guides for 
specific collectibles such as Depression glass and records from major auction 
houses. Sometimes they call on experts in specialized areas such as fine arts, 
jewelry or pottery. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one person can know everything. I call on the best people in the field," 
says Gauthey, who has turned to members of the Gemological Institute of America 
when confronted with a large gem or to museums when appraising a fine painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Colby, a San Clemente appraiser, studied obscure books on pottery to 
uncover the identity of a vase that a young woman had planned to sell at a 
garage sale for $35. Colby's search paid off. She found out the vase was made 
in the early 1900s at a sanitarium in Fairfax where tuberculosis patients were 
renowned for their pottery. The vase was worth $750. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been appalled by the things people throw away," Colby says. "Art pottery 
that people think is junk can go for $8,000." 
</P>
<P>
 After researching the items, appraisers issue a written report with a detailed 
description of each object and an estimate of its value. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Appraisals do not come cheap -- fees for the service average $100 an hour. Yet 
there are situations that make an appraisal a wise investment for people of all 
income levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people think they'll save money by not having an appraisal. They 
figure, 'Why should we pay?' But they can give away things worth hundreds or 
thousands (of dollars) for nothing," Gauthey says. "You should find out what 
you have before you sell something." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who inherit an estate should have it appraised if they do not know the 
value of the items, Gauthey says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I appraised one estate and in among the things they were going to discard 
were two very fine paintings," she says. "I said, 'My God, those are worth 
hundreds of thousands of dollars.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners use written appraisals when insuring one-of-a-kind furnishings such 
as antique bedroom sets or handmade quilts. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things you can't go to the department store and replace," Gauthey 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Appraisals can prove beneficial in the wake of catastrophes such as theft, 
fire and earthquakes. They provide documented proof to insurance companies and 
the Internal Revenue Service when claiming the loss of valuables, Litwack says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often after a loss people don't remember what they had," she says. "They can 
do their own inventory but many times they don't know the value of their 
objects." 
</P>
<P>
 People call on appraisers when they want to donate an item to charity and 
write it off on their tax returns. Appraisals are recommended by the IRS if the 
item is worth over $500 and required if it is over $5,000, Litwack says. 
Appraisers can also be called in when property is being divided in a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those who need to hire an appraiser should choose one with care. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no state license required to become a personal property appraiser. 
Consumers should look for appraisers who are certified by a nonprofit 
professional association such as the American Society of Appraisers, whose 
members must complete an education program and follow a code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 They should also choose an appraiser who specializes in their type of 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't have an Early American art dealer appraise your Oriental 
furnishings," Gauthey says. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheapest appraiser is not necessarily a bargain; an unscrupulous or 
unqualified appraiser can cost one money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Gauthey suggests avoiding those appraisers who charge a percentage of the 
total value of the items appraised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately there are unscrupulous people who put high prices on items and 
take a percentage" to reap a bigger fee, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the appraisal, consumers should receive a contract from the appraiser 
that specifies the payment schedule and estimated number of hours the appraisal 
will take based on the number of objects to be examined, Litwack says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are curious about just one or two items can often get a free 
unofficial estimate of its worth from a willing appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Little John's Antique Arms in Orange offers verbal ballpark estimates of an 
item's value if one brings the item (or, in the case of a large furnishing, a 
picture of it) into the store, says Peter Oppenhuizen, a researcher at Little 
John's. 
</P>
<P>
 People often find that pieces are not as valuable as they thought, but that 
does not mean they are not worth keeping.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you have Grandma's sugar and creamer and you think it's rare but it turns 
out to be worth only $10, keep it," Oppenhuizen says. "It has a lot of 
memories." 
</P>
<P>
 And no one can put a price on those.

GARDENING; COLORFUL VINES UNTANGLE PROBLEMS WITH BARE, BORING, UNSIGHTLY WALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vines provide color in otherwise unused vertical spaces. They're excellent 
camouflage for unsightly buildings, tree stumps or boring expanses of walls or 
fences. And, to top that off, most vines thrive in this region. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the word "vine" refers to woody, fruiting climbers like kiwi 
fruit or grapes, according to the American Horticultural Society. However, they 
are more commonly understood to be flexible shrubs that just keep growing in 
all directions. 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase "reach out and touch someone" takes on special relevance when you 
consider planting vines in a garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a vine at your house is just like having a child; they both need 
attention," said Shirley Kerins, a landscape architect based in Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerins has long sung the praises of vines and laments their underuse by most 
gardeners, probably because they seem to demand too much time and effort. But 
Kerins thinks otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vines are no messier than other plants, and once trained aren't that hard to 
grow," she said. "Some vines bloom just about all year long, can be used to 
block out unwanted views or harsh sun, and can produce breathtaking effects.  
</P>
<P>
 "But you can't just plant a vine and walk away from it, because they grow in 
all directions." 
</P>
<P>
 The secret to success with vines is selecting the right vine for the space, 
training it and removing excess growth regularly during its growing season. 
There are hundreds of vines. Some, such as passion fruit, kiwi or berries, have 
the bonus of yielding edible fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Most, however, are ornamental, often evergreen and frequently have long 
periods of bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some simple methods of training them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Attached to a fence like chain-link, the simplest and most often used. 
Simply plant the vine in the middle of the fence, guide it as it grows and 
enjoy as it fills in. Select vines that will cover 30 or more feet, depending 
on the length of fence. If the fence is wood, you may need to attach heavy 
twine or line for the plant to attach itself, especially when it's still young. 
</P>
<P>
 * Attach to a trellis against a house, garage or other structure. Vines soften 
architectural lines such as large blank expanses of walls. Dense vines such as 
Vigna caracalla (snail vine) cool a structure by keeping out the hot rays of 
the summer sun. 
</P>
<P>
 * Attach to an arbor, pergola, tuteur or other ornamental structure. Used in 
this manner, vines become a decorative element in the garden, a shady oasis 
that forms the canopy for a pleasant seating area. Long used in Europe, tuteurs 
are free-standing ornamental shapes to which vines are attached. Look for them 
in mail-order catalogues specializing in garden supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can also use vines to create unusual designs on fences or walls. Nylon 
fishing line, small-link chain and strong twine are all materials that can be 
used to guide the vine. 
</P>
<P>
 To create an "X" design on a fence, attach a length of fishing line to the 
fence top. Secure the other end at the bottom of the fence, making a diagonal 
line. Repeat, crossing the diagonal to form an X. Repeat across the length of 
fence. Plant the vine in the middle and, as tendrils grow, guide them along the 
lengths of line. Remove excess growth to keep the pattern. This method works 
best with light, lacy vines like jasmine or potato vine. 
</P>
<P>
 Another design Kerins likes to use is "bushy eyebrows" -- so-called because it 
trains vines to provide cover above a window as bushy eyebrows cover the eye.  
</P>
<P>
 Kerins uses the technique to screen out harsh summer sunlight and to block the 
unwelcome view of two-story neighboring houses. 
</P>
<P>
 To create a vining eyebrow for a window, carefully insert sturdy nails on the 
inside of the roof fascia (the horizontal board at the edge of the roof) or 
rafters. Nail at a slant, about 3 feet apart. Attach a 12-inch length of small 
chain to each nail, and let chains hang. Attach a length of green nylon tie or 
very strong twine to the bottom of each length of chain. Then fasten the tie or 
twine to the bottom of the chain next to it. This creates a horizontal surface, 
above the windows, where the vines can grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant a vine in the middle of the wall, and let it grow up the trellis or 
stake to which it is attached. Depending on the size and type of vine, it 
should take about one year for the vine to grow tall enough to reach the chain. 
When it does, train the tendrils to grow horizontally. In another year or so, 
the vine will fill out, creating the bushy effect. Tendrils will also cascade 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerins likes to use Trachelospermum jasminoides (star jasmine) because of its 
fragrance and texture. She also recommends Solanum jasminoides (potato vine), 
because of its profuse flowering. Training a Bougainvillea 
</P>
<P>
 Bougainvillea is probably the most popular vine in Orange County. Although 
there are many varieties, most popular are the tall ones in iridescent colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the aggressive canes are covered with sharp thorns, experts advise 
pruning the base completely and training the vine to clamber up a support and 
then cascade along the top of the structure -- fence, wall, pergola or house -- 
where bystanders can admire the striking colors without being impaled.

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; BEST RABBIT REPELLENT: CHICKEN-WIRE FENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. My garden is infested with dozens of rabbits. I've read that orange and 
lemon peels will repel cats from a garden. Will they work the same way with 
rabbits? 
</P>
<P>
 F. R., Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
 A. You can try it, but your rabbits may end up eating the peels, says Jim 
Kitano of Kitano's Garden Center in La Palma. Probably your best repellent is 
some old-fashioned chicken wire, or some other decorative-type of fencing that 
will keep them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Get some wire, about three to four feet wide, then dig a small trench, six 
inches to a foot deep around the area you want to protect. The fencing should 
be put in that deep to keep them from burrowing underneath. That leaves a two- 
to three-foot shield around your garden, which should prevent the rabbits from 
jumping inside. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We have a window shade in our bedroom, and we're planning on putting up a 
blind instead. I'd like to use the shade on another window that is the same 
width, but is much shorter in length. How can the shade be shortened? I know it 
adjusts to any length just by pulling it down, but I'm concerned about leaving 
a big roll of extra canvas at the top, making it look like it's not matched 
with the window. 
</P>
<P>
 D. D., Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's fairly easy. You just need to leave enough material for the springs to 
work properly, says Gidon Adlan of Bob's Shades & Linoleum in Orange. Measure 
the length of the window and add 12 inches, then cut the shade across, from the 
top of the roll down, at the right length. Staple or sew a pocket for the rod 
at the bottom, and you're done. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I made the mistake of getting new carpeting before I tackled painting our 
interior. I know I need to lay out tarps or drop cloths in the rooms I'll be 
painting, but I'm leery about using plastic sheeting on the new carpeting. Will 
it create moisture when it's hot and get the carpeting wet? 
</P>
<P>
 P. Y., Brea 
</P>
<P>
 A. Unless you're leaving the plastic on the floor for weeks, don't worry about 
it, says Jim Craig of Decratrend Paints in Anaheim. You may want to get the 
canvas drop cloths, which he says will give you better protection. They're not 
going to tear when you walk on them and they can be easily reused. Cloth will 
absorb the paint drops and they will dry quickly. With plastic sheeting, the 
drops just sit there waiting for you to step on them and track them through the 
rest of the house. Another alternative is to use paper drop cloths, which are 
not as expensive as cloth but provide good absorption. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I spilled some liquid silver polish in my stainless steel sink and some 
spots have been left behind. I've tried different solutions to get them out but 
none have worked. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 T. C.,Corona del Mar 
</P>
<P>
 A. Not many substances can leave spots on stainless steel, says Rich Haagsma 
of Faucets 'n Fixtures in Orange. Certain acids that etch the surface of the 
steel can do it. 
</P>
<P>
 You may want to take a pad of fine steel wool or a fine, wet-dry sandpaper and 
try to rub the spots out. You'll probably notice as you're rubbing that the 
areas you're doing become shinier. You're not damaging the steel, just 
polishing it. Doing this should fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Last winter we had a problem with our rain gutter leaking down on our front 
step. It was full of gravel from our asphalt roof. I've cleaned out the 
gutters. Is there anything I can do to prevent them from filling up again? 
</P>
<P>
 C. K., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A. You can try attaching a screen across the top of your gutters, says gutter 
installer James O'Brien of Anaheim. That won't necessarily keep out the dirt 
and gravel, but it will keep leaves out, and they're usually the cause of 
blocked gutters. Before the rainy season starts, you may want to carefully 
sweep off your roof, removing things that will be washed into the gutter when 
it rains.

 The magic of this Mission-style candle lantern is found in its simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by Dave Thomas, Rene Burton and Kevin Mundt, owners of Areo, a home 
accessories store in Laguna Beach, the San Juan lantern ($160) has a hinged 
door for easy access and a perforated bottom for air flow. 
</P>
<P>
 The lantern, which can be used inside or outdoors, is handmade of iron and has 
an antique black finish. It holds a 6-by-6-inch pillar candle, which has three 
wicks for a dramatic effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The lantern, part of Areo's HomArt collection, measures 10 inches by 10 inches 
by 22 inches tall and is a popular item for the store, which opened about two 
years ago and is expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sell about two or three a day," said Burton, who worked for 10 years at 
Crate & Barrel before becoming a partner at Areo last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, whose background is in commercial interiors; Mundt, a marketing 
specialist, and Burton create their works for everyday use from all-natural or 
recycled materials.

 Just when you thought you knew the right time to use the salad fork and the 
dessert spoon, your host or hostess throws in a fish knife and a baked-potato 
fork. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there is a source to help you find out where and when to use such 
eating utensils. "Forks, Knives & Spoons," is a book by Peri Wolfman and 
Charles Gold on the history of such settings. 
</P>
<P>
 The book also addresses cleaning and storage of silverware and includes some 
recipes that will give you an excuse to bring out your fancy forks.

 Using a patented vacuum technology, the Thermos Thermal Electric Grill seals 
in moisture and heat while using about the same amount of energy as a 
1,500-watt blow dryer. Because it runs on electricity, the grill also reduces 
polluting emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the double-walled vacuum dome, the temperature reaches about 600 
degrees and cooks as quickly as traditional charcoal grills. For a smoky 
flavor, wood chips can be added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The element is encased like that of a waffle iron," said Jim Fitzgerald, a 
spokesman for the Illinois-based company. The die-cast heating element resolves 
a problem that existed with early designs for the grill -- it did not get hot 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Thermos' electric grill (about $279) is non-polluting and is an alternative 
for those who live in apartments and condominiums that restrict the use of gas 
barbecues. The heating element and grill come apart for easy cleaning.  
</P>
<P>
 The team that designed the grill did extensive research throughout the 
country, including studies in Orange County. The grill is sold at home and 
garden centers throughout the county.

RECOMMENDED VINES; PERENNIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bougainvillea. It's hard to beat the bright or iridescent red, orange or newer 
pastel hues of this tropical vine. Bougainvillea is frost-tender and needs to 
be protected inland. Hard frost can kill canes, but frequently cutting back 
will regenerate the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandevilla. Produces large, showy flowers. One of the most popular is Alice du 
Pont. Glossy dark green leaves and flowers from early spring through fall make 
this a popular plant. This vine is more restrained and can be used on decks or 
patios when planted in a large container with an attached trellis. It can also 
be trained on fishing line to arch over an entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Solanum jasminoides. Evergreen vine that can grow to 30 feet. The flower 
clusters of white or white tinged with blue bloom in profusion most of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunbergia gregorii. Orange clock vine produces tubular bright orange flowers 
in great abundance, almost all year. This is a vigorous vine, reaching 20 to 25 
feet, and can even be grown in a hanging basket or cascading over a wall. It's 
also a good ground cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Trachelospermum jasminoides. Isn't a true jasmine but is a popular vine 
because of its sweet fragrance and restrained growth. A moderate grower that 
can reach 20 feet. It can be kept smaller with regular pruning. 
</P>
<P>
 Vigna caracalla. It's known as snail vine because the fragrant, light lavender 
flowers are shaped in snail-like whorls. This is a rampant grower with vigorous 
tendrils reaching out in all directions. It explodes in the summer heat with a 
mass of delicate leaves and flowers. Excellent for covering large expanses. 
Although the tendrils will twine on themselves, it needs initial support 
through trellising or filament wires. Cut it back in winter, and the vine will 
regenerate in spring. Annuals 
</P>
<P>
 Ipomoea (morning glory, heavenly blue). The summer annual, planted from seed, 
put on a vigorous, showy flower display without invading the garden, as does 
the rampant perennial morning glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ipomoea alba (moonflower). Seeds for this summer annual should be planted in 
late fall so the heavily fragrant flowers have time to form by summer. Fast 
growing, to 30 feet, they can be trained along vertical lengths of fishing line 
or on arbors or fences. Flowers open in the evening. For continual flowering, 
interplant with heavenly blue morning glory, which blooms only in daylight. 
</P>
<P>
 Lathyrus odoratus (sweet pea). These annual flowering vines grow best from 
seed. Plant in early fall to enjoy flowers by the end of the year. Can easily 
be trained along trellis or netting. Be sure to provide support as soon as 
tendrils form several inches above soil level. Pinch out tips when plant is 
four to six inches long to encourage side shoots to create fuller plants with 
more flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarlet Runner Beans. Showy vine producing bright scarlet flowers, followed by 
pods of beans that are edible while they're very young. Plant these 
fast-growing vines from seeds in March or April. KAREN DARDICK

IMPROVEMENTS; SAND, SWEAT ARE MAJOR INGREDIENTS IN DO-IT-YOURSELF BRICK PATIO 
PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A brick patio is an old-fashioned and attractive addition to a yard, a perfect 
spot for outdoor dining or entertaining. When it's done, it has a way of 
looking like it should always have been there. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, brick patios are perfect homeowner projects. 
</P>
<P>
 They're not at all hard to build -- as long as you don't mind a little 
digging, hauling and sand stomping. Start by figuring out a design. There's 
nothing wrong with a simple square or rectangle, and those spaces are generally 
the most versatile when it comes to placing furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is to decide on a brick pattern. This is the fun part; the 
pattern can be straight courses, up-and-down or diagonal herringbone or 
whatever strikes your fancy. If you're not experienced in working with bricks, 
however, it's a good idea to choose a pattern that doesn't require a lot of 
brick cutting. You split a brick by tapping a groove on both sides with the 
chisel end of a brick hammer. Then you hit it sharply with the hammer, and it 
should split along the grooves. It should -- but there's a knack to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've decided on the pattern, figure out how many bricks you'll need. If 
you have some spare bricks, try laying out a section of your pattern so you can 
count how many bricks cover a square foot. If that doesn't work, figure five 
bricks per square foot; or ask the brick purveyor for help. Be sure to get a 
few extra. When you choose bricks, remember that old bricks look nice, but may 
not be glazed, so they can absorb water and can also crack. 
</P>
<P>
 The other major raw material is sand. Brick patios can be laid in mortar over 
a concrete base. A brick patio laid over concrete won't move or sink, and if 
the slab is straight, the bricks will be, too. However, it's a lot more 
difficult, and you may need professional help to pour the slab. 
</P>
<P>
 The simpler choice is to place the bricks on a two-inch bed of sand. Sand-bed 
patios may not be perfectly straight, and may need to be adjusted -- a brick or 
two may settle -- but they're a lot easier to build. The sand supplier should 
be able to help you figure out how much sand you need.  
</P>
<P>
 Mark the outlines of the patio with stakes and string, making sure the corners 
are square. Then dig out the dirt inside to a depth of six inches. Once the 
dirt is gone, tamp down the surface of the hole with a hand tamper (a metal 
plate on a stick), or a roller. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not using a concrete base, the patio needs some sort of border to 
help hold the bricks in place and to keep the sand in. The border can be 
concrete, pressure-treated wood or a small concrete footing with bricks set 
into it on end. 
</P>
<P>
 The simplest is the pressure-treated board. Set boards in the hole and drive 
pressure-treated stakes along the outside every four feet or so, driving stakes 
below ground level. Then use a drywall screw to secure the stake to the board. 
Fill in the outside gap with dirt, covering the stakes. Use a level to check 
the border edges; you want the patio to slope away from the house, so water 
runs off. 
</P>
<P>
 To help keep weeds out, put a layer of landscape cloth over the dirt at the 
bottom of the excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour in a layer of sand, dampen it and tamp it down. (Think of it as a day at 
the beach.) Continue filling until the sand is two inches deep and thoroughly 
tamped down. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure the surface is level, pull a long board across the sand at the right 
depth to set the bricks. You can notch the ends of a board so it rests on the 
edges of the border. If the patio is too wide for a single board, install a 
temporary center board, level it and run the long board along each section 
separately. Then remove the centerboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's time to place the bricks. Start at one corner, putting each brick 
down and tapping it into the sand with a rubber mallet. If you've tamped the 
sand sufficiently, moving around on it won't disturb it much. If you get a 
divot, tamp the sand back in place as you go. 
</P>
<P>
 When all the bricks are in place, scatter dry sand over them, then wet it down 
and sweep it into the joints between the bricks. Keep spreading sand, 
sprinkling and sweeping, until all the joints are full. 
</P>
<P>
 You can put the lawn chairs out immediately. Don't throw out unused sand; in 
the first few weeks there will be some settling. You may need to repeat the 
scattering, sprinkling and sweeping routine several times.

BOARD BRILLIANCE; SPORTS: VENTURA YOUTH, 14, UNCOILS HIS BEST EFFORT TO WIN 
WORLD SNAKEBOARDING CHAMPIONSHIP IN ENGLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After just 1 1/2 years of trying his hand at a new sport called snakeboarding, 
14-year-old Jay Beatty of Ventura has won the world championship in England and 
become a star of the fledgling sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay was flown to London by Snakeboard USA, the country's only snakeboard 
manufacturer, and beat out 34 competitors last weekend to win the 1994 World 
Snakeboarding Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport, which is big in Europe and was invented eight years ago, tests 
snakers' skill and balance on a skateboard-like apparatus featuring two 
connected, pivoting boards that riders strap to their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 While competing in England, Jay carved, slid, spun and jumped against more 
experienced snakeboarders. It was Jay's first competition ever. 
</P>
<P>
 To the shock and chagrin of his rivals -- some six years older than he is with 
years more experience -- Jay knocked off the field "in a landslide." All of the 
other contestants had to qualify through competitions in their countries. Jay 
was the only wild-card entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really surprised," said Jay on Friday, standing on his black snakeboard 
which sports a surfing-style sticker that says Mad . "I didn't really believe 
it myself until they announced it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Buena High School freshman won a $1,000 check and two $500 watches from 
European and American sponsors. An announcement of his victory was broadcast on 
British television. 
</P>
<P>
 During the competition, Jay landed the only 720-degree spinning jump of the 
day. He also said he spun 900 degrees in a practice jump -- but failed to 
"stick the landing." Jay said he has never seen anyone else spin 2 1/2 times 
around, even during unsuccessful jumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar to a figure-skating contest, snakeboarding is judged on style, 
expression, height and difficulty of jumps, said Jay's unofficial coach and 
mentor, Brandon Eifrid, 22, who works for Brand X, Snakeboard USA's California 
distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay attributes his rise in the sport to a good-old fashioned work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Practice," he said. "I just really like doing it, I do it every day." During 
the summer months, Jay snakeboards around Ventura as much as eight hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can get a skateboard and ride it," Jay said, between 10-foot-high 
launches off a neighborhood ramp. "This is way more fun. . . .. You have to 
take time to learn how to do it. It's harder than skateboarding." 
</P>
<P>
 Riders can make tightly wound, side-winding turns at high speeds on the 
apparatus by twisting their upper bodies, like surfers do, Eifrid said. The 
boards are easily manipulated with a foot-long, pliable fiber strap that 
connects the two foot plates. While skateboarders often lose control of their 
boards at about 10 m.p.h., snakeboarders can reach speeds of 18 to 20 m.p.h., 
Eifrid said. 
</P>
<P>
 In England, Jay said, some of his competitors were clocked at 50 m.p.h. 
speeding down a steep hill.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically a lot of big air, more speed," Eifrid said. "It's a whole 
different rush. . . . There's not any obstacles too big -- handrails, flights 
of stairs, hills. It's like snowboarding (around) Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with seven teen-age teammates, Jay is carted off many weekends to 
statewide exhibitions and halftime shows to promote the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Jay's competitors at the world competition was the reigning champ, 
Ashley Morgan of South Africa, who Eifrid said is about 20 years old and has 
been practicing his swirling high-wire act for about seven years. Morgan was a 
friend of a young South African surfer named James Fischer, who was bored with 
conventional skateboarding, and developed snakeboarding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jay is pretty much a natural as far as an athlete goes," said Jay's mother, 
Renee Beatty. "As long as he likes it, he gets really obsessed, he's a 
perfectionist." 
</P>
<P>
 If it weren't for Renee Beatty, Jay may have never seen a snakeboard. Two 
years ago, Jay's younger brother, Brian, asked their mother to buy him a 
skateboard for Christmas. But while shopping for a skateboard, she met Eifrid 
promoting his product at a Camarillo bizarre and bought the snakeboard instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like it was going to be the wave of the future, so I took a chance 
on it," Renee Beatty said. "Jay just lives to go and do this now. . . . Those 
other kids (in Europe) had never even heard of Jay, and then he blew everybody 
away."

RESIDENTS FEAR RENOVATION MEANS RELOCATION; OXNARD: AN $11-MILLION PROGRAM TO 
REPAIR PUBLIC HOUSING UNITS IS ABOUT TO BEGIN. SOME FAMILIES WILL BE 
PERMANENTLY RELOCATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lined with asbestos, enveloped in lead-based paint, the cracking walls of the 
Colonia Village housing project show years of neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 So do the rotting, termite-plagued kitchens, the dilapidated bathrooms and 
roofs, and the slumping fences surrounding the 40-year-old buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But later this month, Oxnard housing officials will launch a massive 
five-year, $11-million renovation program of the city's 530 family public 
housing units. They will begin on Sept. 19 with a particularly run-down section 
of Colonia Village known as Felicia Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have known about this for a long time, and we have wanted to do something 
about it," said Oxnard Housing Director Sal Gonzales. "We just haven't had the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 While the work is being done, residents will be relocated from their homes, 
and many are worried that they will never be allowed to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Their fears may be justified: Oxnard officials are using the opportunity to 
evaluate who belongs where in the city's weathered web of public housing. They 
are encouraging families to accept federal Section 8 housing vouchers, which 
would allow them to rent apartments elsewhere in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity to readjust the people of those buildings," said Ruben 
Andrade, who is in charge of the relocation. "In some cases, the (changes) will 
be permanent." 
</P>
<P>
 Confused about their future, and uncertain about who will be living beside 
them, the 100 families who live on Felicia Court say they don't trust city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Ramirez of Channel Counties Legal Services Assn., who is representing 
the tenants, said that Oxnard housing officials failed to inform residents of 
what would happen to them until recently, exacerbating the tenants' mistrust. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were in an uproar," said Ramirez of a meeting between housing 
officials and the tenants last month. "One lady stood up and said: 'My kids are 
starting school in a few weeks. I need to know when this is going to happen. I 
need to know where to receive my mail.' It wasn't some abstract thing. It had 
to do with where people were going to sleep at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard housing officials maintain that they have been forthright with the 
residents from the beginning. The restoration will be a building-by-building 
effort, and each family will be moved to other public housing for six weeks 
while the work is performed, Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will either move into other public housing or into the Section 8 
program," he said. "We are working to make the relocation as easy as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents will be allowed to return to their original homes, Andrade 
said. But families who have become too large or too small for their old 
apartments will be placed in more appropriate dwellings, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 City housing officials hope to persuade 20 tenants to sign up for federal 
housing subsidies available under the Section 8 program. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said that most families wish to return to their old apartments. At her 
urgings, Oxnard officials are drafting a document that will outline the 
renovation program's goals and rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure there are going to be 20 people who want (Section 8 vouchers)," 
Ramirez said. "The people of Felicia Court like their community. They are very 
involved and want to stay where they're at." 
</P>
<P>
 Herlinda Lopez said she has refused a request by housing officials to 
voluntarily move to another city public housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to move from here, but our opinion does not matter," Lopez said. 
"We're being forced out of here. They're the authorities, they have the money, 
and we have to do what they say. We're the Mexicans lying beneath their feet."  
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Nunez lives on Felicia Court in a decaying three-bedroom apartment 
with his wife and six children. Despite rampant vandalism and gang problems, he 
prefers to stay in his neighborhood, with his neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have a sense of family and community here on their blocks," said 
Nunez, "They want that to stay the same."  
</P>
<P>
 But Nunez acknowledged that the renovation is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that they're going to do this I hope they do it right, not a superficial 
job like they have done before," he said. "There are apartments here not fit 
for dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Castro said she repeatedly notified maintenance workers about the peeling 
lead paint above her shower. But, she said, city workers never did anything 
about it -- a common complaint among the project's residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here for 30 years, and many of the things that are bad now were 
bad then," said 60-year-old Eusebia Yanez. "These problems were here for years 
before they started doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Housing officials say that they have never had the resources necessary to fix 
all that is wrong with Oxnard's public housing, and this relocation project 
will be no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would probably take $50 million to do all the work that needs to be done 
throughout the city," Andrade said. "But there's no way we can get the money 
for that. We only have $11 million, so we are going to do all we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing outside her family's current home, Griselda Barreto said that she and 
her neighbors are resigned that the renovations are out of their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're counting on their word," Barreto said. "We'll see if they can live up 
to it."

PARK CLOSED AFTER COUGAR ENCOUNTER; WILDLIFE: HAPPY CAMP CANYON NEAR MOORPARK 
WILL BE SHUT DOWN AT LEAST A WEEK WHILE OFFICIALS ASSESS THE THREAT.

 Responding to a mountain lion stalking incident, state officials closed a 
Moorpark-area park as a precaution Friday -- but decided not to hunt down and 
kill a pair of lions that threatened two horseback riders this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incident does not indicate that these cats are a danger to public 
safety," said Capt. Roger Reese, who heads the Ventura office of the California 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither the horses nor riders were hurt in the incident," he said. "Of 
course, there was a potential that something much graver could have happened, 
so we'll have our field investigators out to assess the situation before we 
recommend reopening." 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park will be closed at least a week, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two horseback riders -- Sharon Virzi, 41, of Simi Valley and Robin Phipps, 
27, of Moorpark -- ran across the pair of mountain lions Wednesday afternoon at 
Cathedral Grove, an area of old oaks near Happy Camp Creek about a mile north 
of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the lions came under Virzi's horse, baring its teeth. When the riders 
tried to turn back, another cat, standing on the trail behind them, blocked 
their way. The women then doubled back and rode up the trail. At least one of 
the cats followed them, Virzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear they were stalking us," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 But park officials speculate that the two cats were probably startled by the 
horses while waiting for deer that come out of the hills to water at the creek. 
Because the two predators were spotted on such a popular trail, officials want 
to keep the public out for at least a week while they look for further signs of 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rangers will be out there as well as mounted volunteers, checking for 
tracks or any unusual occurrences," said Rorie Skei, assistant executive 
director of the East County Conservation Authority, which oversees the park. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, park rangers posted signs that informed visitors of the closure and 
warned about the threat of mountain lions.  
</P>
<P>
 In cougar country, hikers are advised to walk in pairs. If a chance encounter 
occurs, experts suggest that people raise their hands above their heads to 
appear larger, make loud noises and walk away slowly. Do not run, they said, 
because that could trigger the cats' predatory instinct. Parents are advised to 
pick their children up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know how long we'll be closed for," said Drew Mashburn, a 
supervising park ranger for Ventura County. "When we reopen, people should just 
be aware that this is mountain lion territory, and that they should act 
accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Sightings of mountain lions are common in Ventura County this time of year 
because they are following prey that has left the parched hills and mountains 
seeking food and water, experts said. Mountain lions have been seen in Happy 
Camp park on two or three other occasions in the last month, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they are not aware of any attacks on people in recent years 
in Ventura County.

THEIR CITRUS AND AVOCADO GROVES.

<P>
 Santa Paula farmer Randy Axell says he would rather see Metrolink trains 
whizzing through his citrus and avocado trees than a bunch of people on 
bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of a group of several dozen farmers opposing plans for a 32-mile 
bike path along the old Southern Pacific railroad tracks from Ventura to Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch of railroad is a key component in a trail system proposed by the 
county to link cities for commuters and recreation lovers. The county is 
negotiating to purchase an easement along the tracks for the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The countywide network of trails would be open to bikers, hikers and 
equestrians, and is due for consideration by the Ventura County supervisors in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the railroad tracks bisect Axell's property, they do not bother him 
-- trains were passing by back when his grandfather was farming in Santa Paula. 
Trains are more reliable than people, from his point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to make this an improved Metrolink path I would have no problems 
with that whatsoever," Axell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He understands the appeal of cycling or hiking through acres of blossoming 
trees and trim rows of vegetables. But agricultural production should be 
strictly business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't stop in somebody's orchard and say, this is where I want to have a 
picnic," Axell said. "Are we going to have to put up six- to eight-foot fences? 
And if we do, who is going to pay for them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Blakemore, program administrator for the Regional Trails and Pathways 
Program, said the farmers have represented the only opposition he has 
encountered during a series of public presentations of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these people feel that the city people who aren't familiar with 
country living are going to tear the rural area apart," Blakemore said. "I 
think that is a false assumption." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County Farm Bureau head Rex Laird disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an inherent incompatibility between agricultural areas and 
recreational development," Laird said. "The purpose of these concerns are just 
to be realistic, not to rain on the parade of the people who are trying to put 
in the trails." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the major concerns of the agricultural community, Laird said, are that 
farmers will pay the price if anyone strays off the trail onto their land and 
then hurts themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing you bet the farm," Laird said. "It could put you out of 
business if someone steps in a hole or something and sues." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Pinkerton, a Santa Paula farmer who grows lemons and avocados, said 
farmers fear their insurance rates will increase because of the bike path. 
</P>
<P>
 "One insurer has already told people their rates will double," he said. 
Largely because of the liability issue, the Farm Bureau has been against the 
concept since discussions began last year, Laird said. They declined to be part 
of the 40-person committee that originally developed the plan but did send two 
growers to talk to the committee about problems they encountered due to their 
proximity to trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar Terry of Terry Farms in Ventura was one of those growers. A bicycle path 
runs through his vegetable fields, paralleling a dirt farming road between 
Harbor Boulevard and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry said a fence of his that borders the bike path has been cut in the past, 
that his sprinkler system has been vandalized and that motorcycles and even an 
occasional small car sneaks onto the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the helicopter pilots he hires for pest control sometimes have 
to halt spraying because of passing bikers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The helicopter has to land and that costs money," Terry said. "Ninety-five 
percent of the time it isn't an issue, as life goes. But that 5% of the time 
can really be a bear." 
</P>
<P>
 The people who are planning the trail are responsible, level-headed types, 
said Laird. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were just the committee members that were going to be utilizing it, it 
wouldn't be a problem," he said. "But this is like inviting several hundred 
people you've never seen before home to utilize your back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 The Farm Bureau has lawyers looking into growers' legal rights to stop the 
county from building trails right next to their fields and orchards, Laird 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakemore said he wants to come to a compromise with the farmers before it 
comes to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could file a lawsuit," he said. "But I really don't think they could 
stop it (trail construction) if it was the best thing for the community.  
</P>
<P>
 "We feel trails are really good neighbors. They enhance property values and 
it's almost like having a Neighborhood Watch."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ACCUSED KILLER TO STAND TRIAL AS ADULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Ventura gang member accused of shooting a Santa Paula man four 
times in the back of the head last year was ordered Friday to stand trial as an 
adult -- even though he was a juvenile at the time of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren set Jerrimi Hampton's 
arraignment for Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampton is charged with shooting 24-year-old Alfonso (Sammy) Garza Sanchez 
execution-style in an alley between Vince and Flint streets on Jan. 27, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Perren cited the nature of the crime, Hampton's criminal record and previous 
failed attempts at rehabilitating him as a juvenile as reasons for sending the 
case to adult court. 
</P>
<P>
 Hampton has been convicted in Juvenile Court for an assault that occurred less 
than a week after the Sanchez shooting, Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger A. Inman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sanchez murder was part of an unusually violent week in the Ventura Avenue 
area. Two days after Sanchez was killed, 17-year-old Ventura High School 
football player Jesse Strobel was stabbed to death in an unrelated incident in 
the same area, police said. And two other serious stabbings also occurred there 
the day before the Strobel murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The rash of casualties prompted a town-hall meeting in which nearly 700 
Ventura residents gathered to show an unprecedented display of concern about 
gang violence and devise a strategy to put a halt to the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been charged with stabbing Strobel, but Ventura police arrested 
Hampton two months ago and charged him with taking Sanchez's life. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; RAPIST ALSO MAY BE LINKED TO ROBBERIES

<P>
 Detectives investigating the rape of two women in a Camarillo frozen yogurt 
shop said Friday that they have identified no suspects but believe the attack 
may be connected to other robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old girl and 19-year-old woman were raped by a man who robbed the 
Carmen Drive yogurt shop Aug. 29.After taking cash from the register, he forced 
the two store employees into a back room, where he sexually assaulted them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Sheriff's Detective Dan Thompson said the description of the 
assailant appears to match the description of a suspect in several restaurant 
robberies in Thousand Oaks and Goleta. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is described as a white male between 18 and 23, approximately 6 
feet tall and weighing about 200 pounds. During the attack at the yogurt shop 
he was wearing a long-sleeved green shirt, dark baggy trousers and black combat 
boots. 
</P>
<P>
 A reward of $1,000 is being offered by the Ventura County Crime Stoppers 
Program for information leading to an arrest and criminal conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information may call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 987-TALK or 
494-TALK. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; COUNCILMAN LASHES OUT AT COLLEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest outburst in a simmering feud, Port Hueneme City Councilman James 
Daniels lashed out at council colleague Toni Young for releasing what he called 
a confidential memo in which the city manager chastised Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels ended the Wednesday night council meeting by reading a lengthy 
statement in which he denied that the council had treated Young, a first-term 
councilwoman elected on a reform platform, as a council outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding calmly, Young faced Daniels and apologized for offending him. But 
she said she does consider herself a political outsider on the council and that 
tension does exist between her and the other four council members, all of whom 
have served at least eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 In an additional salvo Thursday, Young sent City Manager Richard Velthoen and 
the council a memorandum accusing Velthoen of hiding city business from 
residents and saying that any information exchanged between city officials 
should be made available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you write letters, or memos, or any other correspondence to the council 
or copies to the council, or send it in the mail, it becomes a public 
document," Young wrote. "It is our local government in action." 
</P>
<P>
 Young's memorandum to Velthoen and Daniels' criticism came a week after 
Young's release of a Velthoen memo in which the city manager threatened the 
councilwoman with "unpleasant" consequences if she continued to discuss his 
possible firing publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 She has said she was joking about that. 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen, who declined to comment about Young's latest memo, did say that he 
was not surprised with Daniels' action and was thankful for his support.

<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of wrangling over the cost of providing Amtrak service to 
Camarillo, the rail carrier has agreed to stop at the station free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Amtrak withdrew its request for $150,000 in track and station improvements 
after a series of discussions with members of the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission began working to bring Amtrak trains to Camarillo shortly after 
a temporary station was built to serve commuters riding Metrolink trains in the 
wake of the Jan. 17 earthquake. SARA CATANIA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; FREEWAY ROMP LEADS TO NEW HOME FOR DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chomping happily on an avocado, the dog that successfully dodged traffic on 
the Ventura Freeway for 40 minutes last week surveyed her new home in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Big lawn, nice-looking golden retriever in the yard next door, plenty of 
citrus, apple and avocado trees -- and most important, a good fence encircling 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
 As the little black dog turned the avocado into guacamole, her new owner, 
Angie Casco, smiled at her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at her already," Casco said. "Can you beat that? Boy, are you going to 
have a ball with avocados." 
</P>
<P>
 Casco adopted the cockapoo from the Camarillo Animal Shelter, where she was in 
danger of being put to sleep after five days of being unclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 A newspaper story about the dog's travels on the freeway brought her to the 
attention of Casco and eight other would-be owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Casco, who was waiting at the shelter when it opened Friday, had to draw 
straws with one other early arrival hoping to adopt the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 The adoption was fate, she said. Three years ago, Pepper, her pet cockapoo, 
tried to take a jaunt on the Pasadena Freeway while Casco's daughter was 
dog-sitting. Pepper was intercepted on the on-ramp and has since passed on from 
unrelated causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This struck a familiar chord with me," Casco said. "Maybe I was meant to have 
this dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Casco, who was recently widowed, said she is looking forward to having the 
little dog for company. 
</P>
<P>
 Her house is already equipped with a dog-door, and she still has Pepper's bed 
and bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her face is almost exactly" like Pepper's, Casco said. "She's got a lot of 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 She told the dog to sit, and it immediately flopped at her feet, panting. 
</P>
<P>
 "She obeys and everything," Casco said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the name, how could Casco resist? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to name her Freeway," she said. "But if she doesn't like that, 
maybe Scraps." MARY F. POLS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CABLE PROVIDER TO RAISE RATES $2.75 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Customers of Ventura's Avenue TV Cable will pay $2.75 more a month for basic 
cable service beginning Oct. 1, company officials said this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers who are now charged $16 monthly for 22 channels will receive an 
October bill for $18.75, said Steve George, vice president of Avenue TV Cable. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, he said, they will receive five new channels: C-SPAN I and II, 
which broadcast Congressional sessions; USA Network, which shows movies, some 
sports and some reruns of network series; Bravo, an arts and cultural channel, 
and the Trinity Broadcasting Network, a religious station broadcast out of San 
Bernardino.  
</P>
<P>
 Those customers who already pay for the "full basic" package, which includes 
51 channels, will not see an increase in their bills, George said. They will, 
however, gain three new channels -- the Trinity Broadcasting Network, ESPN II 
and the "Cable Health Club," George said. 
</P>
<P>
 George said the basic subscriber rate is rising because the company's 
operating expenses are increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some customers said the latest rate hike irritated them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really think we need those channels," said Vinnie McNeely, 18, who 
lives on Poli Street. "We don't need to pay that extra $2.75. We're having hard 
times now, and . . . it doesn't seem right." 
</P>
<P>
 This increase will be the fourth time rates have risen since 1990, company 
officials said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; BANK TELLER ROBBED 2ND DAY ON THE JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old bank teller during her second day on the job was robbed by a 
well-dressed man who simulated having a gun Friday morning at a Bank of America 
branch in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to the bank business," said Sgt. Bob Gardner of the Simi Valley 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, dressed in slacks, dress shirt and tie and wearing a baseball cap and 
sunglasses, entered the bank at 5821 Los Angeles Ave. about 10:20 a.m., Gardner 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he stepped up to the teller, he put a fanny pack on the counter and 
placed his hand inside as if he had a weapon, the sergeant said. The man, 
believed to be in his early to mid-30s, received an undisclosed amount of money 
before fleeing on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber was described as black, about six feet tall and weighing 180 to 200 
pounds, Gardner said. GREG RIPPEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PROPERTY ASSESSMENT APPEALS DUE SOON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County property owners dissatisfied with the county's assessment of 
their property values have until Thursday to file an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The requests to lower taxable values must be filed with the clerk of the 
Assessment Appeals Board at 800 S. Victoria Ave. by 5:30 p.m. or be postmarked 
by Sept. 15.Forms may be obtained from the appeals board or the county 
assessor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the county has received nearly 2,000 appeals -- more than twice the 
number filed last year. Many of those appeals were filed by oil companies and 
the Bank of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank filed 515 appeals on parcels it owns in the financially troubled Wood 
Ranch development in Simi Valley. The bank contends the county assessor has 
overvalued the lots, most of which sit vacant. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MOORPARK BACKS BID FOR VOTE ON LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council voted 4 to 1 to support a bid to put the Weldon 
Canyon landfill initiative back on November's ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark is the first city to vote in support of the appeal, filed by Taconic 
Resources of San Diego, of a Superior Court ruling that removed the initiative 
from the ballot.The judge ruled that the initiative was being misused to grant 
land rights to a private firm and would create inconsistencies in county zoning 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Scott Montgomery, who voted with the majority, said he expected 
other cities to take similar action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only Ojai and Ventura supported taking that off the ballot," he said. "There 
are eight other cities and I expect all eight or very close to that number to 
vote for an appeal." SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; SETTLEMENT REACHED IN DEVELOPMENT SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To end a costly lawsuit, the Moorpark City Council has approved a plan to 
exempt a 552-home development from any future growth-control laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 1 Wednesday night on the plan that will settle a 
lawsuit filed by Carlsberg Financial Corp., a Santa Monica developer. 
Councilman Patrick Hunter voted against the settlement and councilman Scott 
Montgomery was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 552-home development will be exempt from future controls, the 
company will have to abide by a current slow-growth law -- known as Measure F 
-- even after it expires at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsberg sued the city in 1991 over the fact that it was allowed to build 
only 405 homes on the site, contending that that number made the project 
economically unfeasible and that the zoning for the site allowed for much 
higher densities. 
</P>
<P>
 Various versions of the development have been before the City Council since 
1986, said Councilman Bernardo Perez. At that time, he said, Carlsberg had 
wanted to build a large industrial area and had proposed constructing as many 
as 900 houses.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember someone from the company saying even though their request was 
denied that they would get what they wanted," Perez said. "This has been a long 
process. We've come a long way since then. You always have second thoughts, but 
my conclusion is that this is a good plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsberg President Ron Tankersley said his company was satisfied with the 
compromise worked out with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm relieved. It's been such a long process," he said. "I think the city and 
residents will be satisfied with the results." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is not expected to begin until the spring of 1996, Tankersley 
said. The company plans on drawing up more detailed plans with the builder, and 
those plans will have to be reviewed by the city.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now the real work begins," Tankersley said. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TOP LAW OFFICIALS ENDORSE GALLEGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of Ventura County's top law enforcement officials have joined together in 
endorsing Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) in his bid for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who is seeking his fifth term, will face Democrat Kevin Ready of 
Ventura, a Santa Barbara County deputy counsel, in the Nov. 8 general 
election.Gallegly's 23rd Congressional District covers all of Ventura County 
except for most of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly received the endorsement of Sheriff Larry Carpenter and the Ventura 
County Law Enforcement Coordinating Committee, which he heads. The committee 
includes Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury and the police chiefs of Oxnard, Port 
Hueneme, Santa Paula, Simi Valley and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Carpenter praised Gallegly for assisting local 
agencies in securing federal help after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't hidden in some distant office watching the events unfold," 
Carpenter said in his statement. "He was on our streets, standing in our lines, 
experiencing the disaster firsthand. As a consequence of his real-life exposure 
to those events, he was able to request and direct federal assistance where it 
was needed most." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly welcomed the endorsement, saying it underscored the strong 
relationship he has established with the law enforcement community since his 
first election in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had support from law enforcement," he said. "But I think it's 
even more important to get that support once you've established a record. It 
indicates that you have a real pledge to provide all the help you can conjure 
up to make our streets safer." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Gallegly, the law enforcement committee has endorsed former 
Simi Valley Police Chief Paul Miller for the Simi Valley City Council.

CORONER AGAIN BRINGS PAINFUL NEWS TO FAMILY; OXNARD: THE VENTURA COUNTY 
OFFICIAL TELLS PARENTS OF THEIR SON'S FATAL CAR CRASH. HE IS FOURTH MALE IN 
FAMILY TO DIE.

 Dale Zentzis was the last man Molly Smedley wanted to see Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Zentzis, a Ventura County deputy coroner, had appeared on her doorstep in 
Oxnard four years ago to tell her that one of her sons was dead, the victim of 
a stabbing. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7:15 a.m. Friday, Zentzis returned to her house to tell her that another 
son, Dante Smedley, had been killed in a single-car accident three hours 
earlier near Mugu Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he came up, I knew something was wrong," said Smedley, 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Smedley, 41, was her third son to die violently, the other having been 
killed in a 1992 car accident near Las Vegas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said a fourth son died as an infant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so hard to see a dead person," Zentzis said after leaving Smedley's 
house Friday. "What's hard is going to a live person, a family member, to tell 
them one of their loved ones has died." 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Smedley, 66, said he tried to console his wife after their son's death. 
"No one can know what it's like. . . . It's been pretty tragic for us. But 
we've got to accept it, that it's God's will." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Dante, a diabetic who lived with his parents and worked part time for 
their security company, often could not sleep and would go for drives during 
pre-dawn hours. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what he did Friday, the father said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zentzis, citing a California Highway Patrol report, said Dante Smedley was 
killed when his 1988 Plymouth Reliant drifted out of the southbound lanes of 
Pacific Coast Highway near Mugu Rock and plummeted to the rocks about 70 feet 
below. There his car burst into flames. Smedley died instantly, about 4:20 
a.m., Zentzis said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not known why the car swerved off the road, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smedley, who was divorced and the father of a 12-year-old son and a 6-year-old 
daughter, is survived by two sisters in Maryland and one in Texas, who was 
planning to get married today, Molly Smedley said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She said the sisters were making arrangements to fly home to Oxnard on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Smedley, 37, the first son to be killed, was stabbed near an El Rio bar 
on New Year's Eve in 1990, Molly Smedley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He died while trying to reach his parents' home, in a field where Zentzis 
ended up examining the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Smedley said the killer has never been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Another son, 38-year-old Warren Smedley, was killed in a head-on car accident 
May 2, 1992, near Las Vegas, the father said.

ELECTIONS / BOARD OF SUPERVISORS; LOH, SCHILLO EXCHANGE BARBS ON TALK SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisor candidates Frank Schillo and Trudi Loh butted heads 
Friday in their first debate since the primary, exchanging verbal blows on 
everything from development to trash issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, a Thousand Oaks city councilman, and Loh, an attorney, squared off on 
a local morning radio talk show broadcast by KNJO-FM. The two are competing for 
the seat being vacated by retiring Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, whose district 
includes Thousand Oaks and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start of the hourlong program, the two candidates attacked each 
other's positions on a wide range of issues, while questioning one another's 
judgment and ability to serve as a county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 In one exchange, Loh criticized Schillo's support for the Dos Vientos housing 
project planned for Newbury Park, saying it violated environmental regulations 
and would cause severe traffic problems on Wendy Drive and Potrero Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Schillo nevertheless voted in favor of the project," Loh said. "I think 
it would be a mistake to put somebody on the Board of Supervisors that has no 
intention of enforcing the laws that the county has on the books." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo accused Loh of not coming to City Council meetings to voice her 
protests against the Dos Vientos project, which he said complied with the 
city's General Plan for development. He said the project originally called for 
3,000 units, but was eventually scaled back to 2,350. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mrs. Loh has a lack of understanding of what a General Plan is," 
Schillo said. "As far as the environment and planning are concerned, I don't 
think we need someone on the Board of Supervisors who doesn't understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Loh then proceeded to list her credentials as a corporate attorney and her 
experience handling legal issues for developers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I do understand what general plans are, Mr. Schillo," she said. "I have 
a doctorate degree and that degree says I can read laws, and I can understand 
statutes. In fact, I can even write them, Mr. Schillo." 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates also clashed over the issue of a proposed west county 
landfill at Weldon Canyon near Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh suggested that the county explore other alternatives for disposing of its 
trash, including more aggressive recycling programs or possibly even shipping 
its waste elsewhere by rail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unreasonable and unsound for people in the east county to support a 
landfill in the west county," said Loh, noting that the U.S. Supreme Court 
recently ruled that counties cannot tell landfill operators where they can take 
trash from. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we open up a landfill in Weldon Canyon, the people who own it and operate 
it will need to fill it up to make money," Loh said. "They're going to have to 
import a whole lot of trash to do this . . . and we will eventually become a 
regional and possibly a statewide trash facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo argued that if a new west county landfill is not developed, the Simi 
Valley Landfill would eventually become the county's sole dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opponent says that our trash is going to be sent to Utah or someplace," 
Schillo said. "Nobody is going to take our trash. It's going to end up at the 
Simi Valley Landfill. That means there are going to be 400 dump trucks a day 
filled with trash coming right through (Thousand Oaks). I challenge anybody to 
tell me that this is environmentally sensitive." 
</P>
<P>
 In another exchange, Loh criticized Schillo's support for allowing the 
Ahmanson Land Co. to extend its development agreement with the county. In 
return for the right to develop a mini-city in the Simi Hills, Ahmanson agreed 
to turn over thousands of acres of privately owned mountain land to park 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal has been stalled by lawsuits filed against the developer, which 
initially had until 1995 to complete the land transactions. Ahmanson is now 
asking that the deadline for acquiring two ranch properties owned by Bob Hope 
be pushed back three years. 
</P>
<P>
 After pressuring the county to fast-track its giant housing project, Loh said 
Ahmanson should not be allowed a three-year extension without firm guarantees 
that it will acquire Hope's properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Loh said she fears the developer will eventually try to back out of 
its pledge to acquire Hope's land. "They'll say, 'Gee, here's some money 
instead of open space,' " Loh said. "And they will nickel-and-dime us and 
negotiate us out of what we bargained for." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo noted that the environmental group Save Open Space, which has endorsed 
Loh for supervisor, was one of the parties that filed suit against Ahmanson 
over environmental concerns from its project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has put (Ahmanson) on the defensive," he said. "And as time goes on they 
can't perform (their obligations). . . . So I support the extension. I think 
it's only fair to give them more time until the lawsuits are settled." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels and Moorpark City Councilman Scott 
Montgomery, candidates for the other east county supervisor seat being vacated 
by Vicky Howard, were also guests on Friday's radio talk show. Their 
question-and-answer session, however, was a much more low-key affair.

SIMI VALLEY DAYS KICKS OFF WITH BARN DANCE; FESTIVALS: EIGHT-DAY CELEBRATION 
'BRINGS OUT THE WESTERN FLAVOR.' IT OPENS TODAY WITH A CHILI COOK-OFF AND CAR 
AND HORSE SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harking back to Simi Valley's small-town, Western heritage, the annual Simi 
Valley Days country celebration kicks off today with a chili cook-off, horse 
show and barn dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Days, which runs intermittently for the next eight days, includes 
a series of family-oriented events that will be capped off with a parade, 
carnival and rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the festivities, including today's chili feast and car show, are put 
on by local charities and service clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, organizers have credited Simi Valley Days for raising as much 
as $70,000 for local charities. 
</P>
<P>
 They predict the event will continue to grow, with more than 30,000 people 
expected to attend this year's carnival, which will run today through Sept. 17. 
Up to 5,000 are expected at this weekend's activities, event organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a chance for the whole city to come together, just as it did when it 
was a much smaller town," said organizer JoAnn Macek. "It really brings out the 
Western flavor that still exists here." 
</P>
<P>
 That flavor is particularly abundant at the annual barn dance, a high-kicking, 
spirited country-Western musical event that for 13 years has raised money for 
the city's historical society, Macek said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dance will be held at 6 p.m. at the restored barn at the Strathearn 
Historical Park, and includes two country-Western bands, a barbecue and a 
horse-shoe competition. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the dance, most of the Simi Valley Days events find their roots in 
Pioneer Days, a short-lived but long-remembered town festival organized by the 
area's founding families in 1932. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, the local Jaycees revived the event, setting up the parade, carnival 
and rodeo. And in 1985, the festival was moved from the spring to the fall and 
took its current form, occasionally adding new events, such as the car show, 
craft fair and bingo game. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the third year that an independent nonprofit group will head up 
Simi Valley Days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closer we get to the start, the crazier things get, but I have the sense 
that this year will be a big success," Macek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Delman, who is overseeing the auto show that will coincide with today's 
chili cook-off, said he thinks this year's turnout will be higher than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just from the interest in the auto show, I can tell things are going to go 
well," he said. "We've got every kind of car and motorcycle imaginable coming 
out this year." 
</P>
<P>
 "Simi Valley Days is the kind of thing that the whole family enjoys," Delman 
said. "It makes adults feel like kids again." 
</P>
<P>
 While nearly all of the events charge admission as part of the the 
fund-raising effort, organizers of the chili cook-off said they will waive 
their $2 fee for anyone who comes with five gallons of chili. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a lot of people will show up the day of the event with their chili 
and participate," said Michelle Foster, a chili cook-off organizer. "It's not 
just for the so-called professionals."

CONFERENCE AIMS FOR GLOBAL SPIN; THOUSAND OAKS: LEADERS WANT TO INTRODUCE WORLD 
TO THE COUNTY AND HOPE CITY COUNCIL WILL DONATE SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daring to think global, Thousand Oaks will host an international seminar on 
how to use the information superhighway next month, welcoming foreign 
dignitaries and Washington bigwigs to a daylong expo at the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 You thought David Copperfield and Liza Minnelli were big? 
</P>
<P>
 This conference aims to attract Dan Quayle and Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 But first off, organizers hope to get the Thousand Oaks City Council on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members on Tuesday will consider sponsoring the gala event by 
providing $4,350 worth of services. The conference's chief backer, the World 
Affairs Council of Ventura County, has asked the city to donate the labor 
needed to produce a video record of the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the city's contribution, the World Affairs Council promises to 
shove Thousand Oaks into an international spotlight. Executive Director Cindy 
Cooke has invited 350 foreign journalists to the conference, plus dozens of 
diplomats based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And though the conference has plenty of substance -- including debates, panel 
discussions and speeches -- its primary purpose will be to introduce the world 
to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign reporters and bureaucrats "are very familiar with the Los Angeles 
Basin and Orange County, but they have no idea we're up here," Cooke said. 
"We'd like the world to know we're around." 
</P>
<P>
 Every journalist who writes about the conference will reach thousands of 
overseas readers, Cooke said. Among them, she hopes, will be well-heeled 
jet-setters and entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have 20 press people here, their audience is 100 million," Cooke said. 
"To buy that exposure would cost a lot more" than the proposed $4,350 donation. 
So for Thousand Oaks, she added, sponsoring the conference "is a very cold, 
hard business proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Schillo, for one, is willing to shake on it. 
</P>
<P>
 All that cheap publicity sounds like a good deal, he said. That is especially 
true since the Oct. 27 conference will take place less than a week after the 
Civic Arts Plaza's grand opening, when the city will be trying to spread news 
of the facility, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I would seriously doubt that we would be giving in-kind donations of this 
type one year from now," Schillo said. But as a kick-off to the maiden season, 
he added, this "will show everyone that we've got an outstanding place here." 
</P>
<P>
 In a city where politicians proudly boast of a small-town atmosphere, however, 
such mass marketing raises questions. Most pressing is whether Thousand Oaks 
can retain its vaunted quality of life despite an influx of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, we're at a transition now," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said. "Our 
Civic Arts Plaza has been compared, at times, to the Washington Monument and 
the Eiffel Tower, so in some people's minds it is a very worldly (attraction). 
What does this mean to our comparatively small town?" 
</P>
<P>
 To Zukowski's question, conference organizers offer a one-word answer: 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourism, of course, generates revenue for city coffers through the sales tax. 
But the conference will also seek to lure businesses and industries to Ventura 
County through a trade show in the Civic Arts Plaza and a tour of the region 
for foreign guests. 
</P>
<P>
 And the topics discussed -- such as "How to do Business in the Global 
Information Age" -- are designed to help both local entrepreneurs and city 
bureaucrats adapt to changing times, Cooke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given all those goals, Zukowski said she too would support the conference. "We 
can't isolate from the rest of the world," she said. "If we can be educating 
visitors and exchanging information with other parts of the world, that can 
only be positive."

PARENTS PROTEST TRANSFER OF SEVERELY DISABLED PRESCHOOLERS 
</P>

 Protesting the transfer of four special education students from Ladera 
Elementary School, a handful of Thousand Oaks parents have accused the Conejo 
Valley Unified School District of discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials decided to move four severely handicapped preschoolers to 
Horizon Hills Elementary after enrollment at Ladera surpassed school 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents were notified last week that their children would be moved to Horizon 
Hills, which houses preschool and adult education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, parent Nina Priebe criticized the move. "It is discrimination if 
one is only moving handicapped students," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a school board meeting Thursday, seven parents expressed concern over the 
move, saying the last-minute decision to transfer the 3- and 4-year-olds was 
poorly handled. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids don't adapt to change very well," said parent Diana Duggan, who 
picketed in front of Ladera earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Duggan's 11-year-old child is not one of the special-education 
students being transferred, she was angered by the district's sudden action. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we trust the school district?" she asked. "It seems like there was no 
thought in this." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supt. Jerry C. Gross said the decision resulted from an unexpected surge 
in enrollment at some east Thousand Oaks schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an enrollment boomlet along the east border of our town," he said. 
"We're not sure (why)." 
</P>
<P>
 The district expected about 595 students to attend Ladera this year, but 
enrollment peaked at about 630, Principal Kristine White said. 
</P>
<P>
 To accommodate the increase, school officials opted to move the preschoolers 
and use their classroom for a mainstream class. Two other special-education 
students were moved from that room, but will remain at Ladera, White said.

NEW TALKS YIELD NOTHING, BUT DEADLINE DATE EXTENDED; BASEBALL: OWNERS REJECT 
PLAYERS' TAXATION PROPOSAL AND POSTPONE ANNOUNCEMENT ON CANCELING THE SEASON 
UNTIL NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe nobody wanted to be the bad guy. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for canceling the rest of the baseball season came and went 
Friday, with still no decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball owners rejected the players' proposal for ending the month-old 
strike, but postponed until next week a call on whether to give up on one of 
the most memorable seasons ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there's much of it left, anyway. The season is scheduled to end three 
weeks from Sunday, and still the strike drags on. 
</P>
<P>
 Union chief Donald Fehr said restarting the games "becomes progressively 
harder with each passing day, but we're not going to shut the doors until they 
shut them." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting commissioner Bud Selig, who imposed the deadline last week, didn't even 
mention it in his opening statement to reporters after a one-hour meeting 
between the sides. Then he was evasive about it during the question-and-answer 
period that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said all week long that common sense should prevail," he said. "We'll have 
no announcement on the season until very early next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Friday's events caused him to change the deadline, Selig said: "I 
don't think so really." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if owners would say it was too late to complete the season if a deal is 
reached, Selig said: "It depends when the deal is made." 
</P>
<P>
 Some union officials and player agents had speculated that Selig's deadline 
wasn't firm. 
</P>
<P>
 If there isn't a deal, Selig said his name would be on the announcement to 
cancel the World Series for the first time since 1904. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take the responsibility. It will be mine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In rejecting the union's proposal, Selig said it didn't address the owners' 
desire for cost containment, which in management's proposal took the form of a 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to establish a common ground, and tragically we have failed to do so 
at every level to this point," said Selig, who entered the talks for the first 
time Friday. "Nobody dreads these circumstances more than I do, or is more 
dismayed by them." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners still insist on a salary cap and players say they'll never agree to 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they maintain the salary cap, this will go into the off-season, into next 
season and as long as there is a salary cap," Texas Rangers pitcher Kevin Brown 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 No talks were scheduled during the weekend, though Fehr said he thought there 
would be contact between the sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig also said he thought there would be communication between the sides, 
"but if not, we will have an orderly announcement early next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Players said at least part of their bargaining team will remain in New York, 
but owners said they were unsure if they would stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick announced in the meeting we will be meeting again," Fehr said. "None of 
us are quite sure why." 
</P>
<P>
 The union's proposal called for teams to split 25 percent of their gate 
receipts instead of the current 20 percent in the American League and 4 percent 
in the National League. 
</P>
<P>
 It called for the teams with the 16 highest payrolls to pay a 1 1/2 percent 
payroll "tax" and the 16 teams with the highest revenue to pay a 1 1/2 percent 
revenue "tax." That money would be distributed to the other 12 clubs, but no 
club would be on the receiving end for more than two consecutive years. 
</P>
<P>
 Management negotiator Richard Ravitch said the union's plan would redistribute 
only $50 million to small-market teams instead of the $75 million in the 
owners' plan. He said owners wouldn't agree to a deal that didn't contain 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're still stuck on the same old stuff they've been stuck on seemingly for 
a generation," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing grim-faced behind Selig during his news conference were Atlanta 
Braves president Stan Kasten, Colorado Rockies chairman Jerry McMorris, Braves 
chairman Bill Bartholomay and former St. Louis Cardinals CEO Stuart Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, who had been involved in earlier 
discussions this week, was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was clear that the salary cap is still their primary consideration," Fehr 
said. "It does not appear at this point that anything we said was given serious 
consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig and Fehr continued to disagree about whether relevant information on the 
owners' revenue-sharing plan had been withheld from the union. Selig also 
denied that some clubs hadn't been provided the union's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser, speaking on behalf of the players, 
said he believed most pitchers wouldn't be able to throw for more than 
three-to-five innings in their first starts if the strike ends. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he never would accept a deal with a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm prepared to sit out . . . . as long as it takes," he said.

COMMENTARY; HORSEMEN LEARNING WHEN LESS IS MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe De Francis, president of Pimlico and Laurel, manages to sound positive and 
upbeat when he talks about virtually any aspect of his tracks' operation. But 
one question about Maryland racing will elicit a muted response from him: Do 
the tracks have enough horses so they can put on good racing programs 
throughout the year? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, for the fall season, it's shaping up pretty good, relative to other 
tracks," De Francis said. "Lenny Hale (vice president for racing) has done an 
excellent job in recruiting horses, given the limited supply. But it's no 
secret that our product in the winter will not be as good." 
</P>
<P>
 De Francis knows his customers want competitive, bettable races with full 
fields, and he wishes he could offer an attractive product year-round. If it is 
any consolation, even the nation's most famous and affluent tracks have trouble 
putting on a consistently good show. 
</P>
<P>
 At Saratoga this summer, five- and six-horse fields abounded; with as much as 
35 minutes between races, a day at the Spa could be excruciating. At least 
Saratoga had the excuse that rain and sloppy tracks marred its season; Del Mar 
has sunshine and fast tracks every day, and a lucrative purse structure as 
well, yet its cards have been disappointing too. 
</P>
<P>
 The explanation for these small fields is well known by now. Owning a 
racehorse is a bad investment; expenses are too high, purses are too low, tax 
incentives are minimal. Because fewer and fewer people want to breed or buy 
thoroughbreds, the number of horses foaled in the United States has been 
declining steadily since the mid-1980s. The effects of this horse shortage are 
being felt with full force, yet the number of races run in this country has 
declined only slightly. There simply aren't enough horses to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it is not possible to increase the horse population instantly, the only 
way to bolster the size of fields is to run fewer races. 
</P>
<P>
 De Francis has often argued for a cutback in the Maryland schedule -- perhaps 
four-day-a-week racing, or a hiatus during the winter months -- in order to 
strengthen the quality of the races. He has always been rebuffed by horsemen. 
But it seems to me this would be the perfect time to make the argument again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryland tracks have overpaid purses during the last two years, and when 
Laurel opens Sept. 27 it will cut purses by 8 percent. Horsemen aren't thrilled 
about this, of course. So it might seem logical for De Francis to make this 
offer: Instead of cutting purses, we'll cut back on the number of races. 
</P>
<P>
 Horsemen will receive the same number of total dollars, spread over fewer 
races. The smaller number of races will produce fuller fields, better racing 
and more fan interest. All of this will generate more wagering -- which will 
create more money for purses. Everybody benefits. When I thought of this idea 
the other day, I felt I deserved to be tabbed the new czar of racing. 
</P>
<P>
 When I mentioned it to De Francis, he said: "I've suggested something like 
that on numerous occasions, yet I have yet to receive any positive response. 
I've tried to make the case that by taking a hiatus in the winter we'd be able 
to put on a much better product and give away more money. But I think when you 
make that argument you're dealing with some of the horsemen's most deep-seated 
fears." 
</P>
<P>
 What horsemen fear is that intertrack betting, off-track betting and tracks' 
embrace of other forms of gambling will make live racing expendable. So they 
adamantly oppose any cutback in the live product. In Maryland, the horsemen's 
deal with the track calls for 47 races a week, and they consider that number to 
be non-negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Richard Hoffberger, president of the Maryland Thoroughbred Horsemen's 
Association, if it wouldn't make sense to accept fewer races to avert a purse 
cut and he said, unequivocally, no. 
</P>
<P>
 "What everybody is afraid of is that racetracks are going to turn into 
gambling casinos," Hoffberger said. "We need that guarantee of the number of 
live races per week. We never want to get into a deal of eliminating races and 
setting a precedent. If you close the track for a week, what's to keep them 
from closing for two, three or four weeks? Then they put in the (casino) and 
they don't need us at all. But if they have those 47 races a week, they will 
figure out how to card those races." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the realities of the horse shortage as well as such pressure from 
horsemen, tracks from Maryland to California have indeed figured out how to 
card those races: by offering six-horse fields that their customers don't want 
to bet.

JAPAN CRITICIZES U.S. FOR ITS STRATEGY ON BALANCING TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the countdown to a U.S. sanctions deadline, Japan criticized the United 
States on Friday for pursuing a managed-trade strategy that has helped stir 
"frustration and distrust" between the world's richest economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto issued his attack -- along with plenty of 
promises to reform the Japanese economy -- as negotiators completed two days of 
talks in Los Angeles in pursuit of an elusive trade truce to ward off a Sept. 
30 showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei 
Kono met Thursday, and lower-level U.S. and Japanese officials met Friday. 
Neither side reported advances during this week's talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hashimoto arrived in town Friday for talks between the four big economic 
powers -- the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union -- whose 
trade ministers were to meet Friday evening and start debating how best to 
advance the cause of global free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 But those "Quad" meetings, to begin in earnest over the weekend, were all but 
overshadowed by the transpacific standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue: Japan's $131-billion trade surplus and how to crack open the world's 
No. 2 economy. Tokyo accuses the U.S. team of trying to micro-manage business, 
a strategy it says is anathema to free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan says the U.S. insistence on yardsticks to measure how far it opens 
markets will lead to quotas for U.S. exporters and amounts to trade by 
government decree. 
</P>
<P>
 Hashimoto, pledging "the birth of a new Japan," said his coalition government 
is committed to reform and delivering consumers a better deal. Both sides, he 
said, must battle the "frustration and distrust" spawned by the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has threatened trade sanctions if Japan does not make 
substantial progress on opening its markets by the Sept. 30 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, officials on both sides said the discussions were on track and 
friendly -- or as friendly as can be expected given the U.S. deadline for 
progress or possible sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a major breakthrough, a Japanese trade official said, the allies 
have now agreed to shoot for a partial agreement in late September, just ahead 
of the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Quad talks, Friday's agenda was largely social. Weekend sessions 
will touch on the status of world trade talks, prospects for liberalization and 
the traditional sparring over commerce that splinters the world's powerhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan and Canada's Roy MacLaren were due to 
arrive in late afternoon. Dinner with Hashimoto and Kantor was to follow.

'LOVE CHANNEL': IT'LL JUST GET BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As producer of Poorman's "The Love Channel," I want to thank Randy Lewis for 
not ripping us apart in his review ("Poorman's 'Love Channel' Needs to Censor 
the Sponsor-Kissing," Aug. 31). 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, what he saw was a dress rehearsal, live on TV. Our first night was 
a first for many involved in the show, and at the end of the night, I thought 
it might be the last. I had much less kind things to say after the show than he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nice thing about doing a program five days a week is that you have a 
chance to redeem yourself the next day, and with the Baka Boyz on, I think we 
rebounded fantastically. 
</P>
<P>
 The first show was very cluttered and unorganized, which I almost expected. In 
response to the comment about our sponsorship -- which can seem overloaded, but 
it pays the bills (almost) -- we actually have only six minutes of taped spots 
compared to the usual 12, so we incorporate the rest into the show, making our 
advertisers feel they're a part of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Our whole idea for the program is to make it feel like it's the people's show 
-- the only late-night, live show where viewers can interact with the people 
they're watching, while also, at times, being informative and giving 
opportunities for unsigned bands and other acts. 
</P>
<P>
 I had to laugh about the part of Poorman surrounding himself with a competent 
crew because basically our staff includes me, who works 50 hours a week at my 
regular job at Fox TV, and a girl named Amber, who just went back to school and 
also works as a waitress. 
</P>
<P>
 So stay tuned, because you never know what can happen on live TV, and I think 
we have already gotten much better. But then after that first show, that's not 
saying a hell of a lot.

ARTIST 'FRAUD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two photographs accompanying "At Newport: Into the Limelight," Cathy 
Curtis' review (Aug. 9) of the current exhibition at the Newport Harbor Art 
Museum, highlight the fraud that is perpetuated by modern "artists" on gullible 
art aficionados. The inner tube is clever, but is it art? 
</P>
<P>
 The painting of a hand by Philip Guston is a typical example of fraud 
masquerading as art. Conrad draws more realistic hands in his political 
cartoons. If a hand has to be painted, let's have the hand of a baby with all 
of the tenderness, love and delicacy that it invokes, or that of an aged person 
signifying the trials and tragedies that have been suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 But the shakily delineated outline that is neither a glove nor a hand is 
ridiculous in the extreme. The three lines on the back of the object would lead 
one to believe it is a glove, but the appearance of a nail on the outstretched 
finger suggests a bare hand. To further compound the foolishness of the image, 
the suggestion of a thumb at the lower level of the painting would indicate 
that it is a left hand, but if that were so, the shirt button should be on the 
other side of the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 All round, the artist is either a poor observer of life, or one of the 
latter-day hoaxers who are the subject of "Column Right" (Commentary, same 
edition) in which it is suggested that the federal government's sponsorship of 
the arts through the NEA cease at once!

'FRAGILE ECOLOGIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the exhibits at all the festivals, galleries and studios etc. in 
Laguna, there is only one that must be experienced by people who profess 
opinions about and concerns for our environment. That show is "Fragile 
Ecologies: Artists' Interpretations and Solutions" at the Laguna Art Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that the protective-reactive attitudes of those of us concerned 
about the invasion of development have blocked our abilities to think 
creatively in making an evolving urban area somewhat compatible with, and 
mitigated by, our beautiful natural environment and the resources at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 One hopes that this stultified vision can be awakened somewhat by the "Fragile 
Ecologies" exhibition so that new possibilities may enter the thinking of the 
environmentally concerned. All the transformation that can be mustered, as well 
as resolve, are going to be needed.

LUCKY, UNION DEADLOCKED AS STRIKE LOOMS; LABOR: NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE IN ORANGE 
AGAINST A SUNDAY DEADLINE. TEAMSTERS COULD WALK OUT AGAINST 235-STORE CHAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Working against a Sunday night deadline, negotiators for the Teamsters union 
and Lucky Stores Friday remained locked in a contract dispute centering on job 
security for workers who warehouse and deliver goods to 235 Lucky supermarkets 
across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Teamsters leaders say their 1,695 members could strike as early as 12:01 a.m. 
Monday, when the existing labor contract expires. Other possibilities, union 
officials said, are a boycott of Lucky, which is the region's No. 2 supermarket 
chain, or an extension of the current contract until a new agreement is 
reached. 
</P>
<P>
 But the union said it is unwilling to bend on job security, the issue in 
dispute, and both the company and the Teamsters continued to make preparations 
in case of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75 leaders of Teamsters and other food industry unions across the state 
converged Friday in Orange County, where Lucky's three main warehouses are 
based, in a show of solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had dialogue, but we're still far apart," said Ed Mireles, head of 
Teamsters Local 952 in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky Stores spokeswoman Judy Decker said the company, a unit of American 
Stores Co. of Salt Lake City, remained hopeful. "We want a solution," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, Lucky employees at the company's three Orange 
County warehouses were assigned to work overtime Friday, as they have in the 
past week, setting aside extra pallets of food for easy delivery in the event 
of a strike. Union members, however, said they have slowed down the pace of 
work in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky said it also has a contingent of replacement workers on standby. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's contract dispute with the Teamsters focuses on the company's 
ability to move distribution and warehouse work in Orange County elsewhere. For 
many years, Lucky operated three distribution centers -- in Buena Park, Irvine 
and Fullerton -- to service all of its Southern California stores and 20 in 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 But earlier this summer, Lucky opened a fourth warehouse in Fontana, and soon 
after that the company shifted liquor products there from its facility in Buena 
Park. Lucky workers in Fontana have a separate contract with the company and 
make $4.60 an hour less than those in Orange County, whose hourly pay is about 
$16.60. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky says it needs the flexibility to move work among its Southern California 
warehouses to operate efficiently. But Teamsters officials say the shift in 
liquor products will cost at least 22 of its members their jobs and, moreover, 
threatens the long-term job security of its members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teamsters have not struck a big grocery chain in Southern California since 
1985, when the union walked out at Vons in what turned out to be an eight-week 
strike. But workers at Lucky warehouses Friday were bracing for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody I've talked to here is trying to line up temporary jobs just in 
case," said one 12-year employee at Lucky's warehouse in Irvine.

CRASH DEALS ANOTHER BLOW TO AILING USAIR; AIRLINES: ANALYSTS SAY TRAVELERS MAY 
STEER CLEAR OF THE CARRIER. THE COMPANY SAYS ANY FALLOFF WILL BE TEMPORARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fatal crash of a USAir jet near Pittsburgh -- the carrier's fifth in five 
years -- threatens to cause further financial harm to an airline that is 
already struggling against massive losses and severe competition from rivals 
offering cheaper fares, analysts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will not help," said Michael Lowry, president of Aviation Forecasting & 
Economics Inc. in Arlington, Va., where USAir is also based. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a good possibility that (USAir's) bookings may fall off, and that 
would exacerbate an already serious financial condition" for the carrier and 
its parent company, USAir Group Inc., which has lost $2.6 billion since 1988, 
Lowry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the news of the crash could prompt a sizable number of passengers to 
steer clear of USAir -- whose system includes California but is concentrated on 
short-haul routes in the East -- at a time when the industry is already 
entering the slow autumn travel season. 
</P>
<P>
 Some consumers were already changing reservations Friday to avoid USAir, the 
nation's sixth-largest airline, travel agents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some people ask to change their arrangements," said Jim Roberts, 
president of Uniglobe Regency Travel in Rancho Cucamonga. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, echoing others in the industry, said he does not consider USAir to be 
any less safe than other airlines. But he said the carrier's string of crashes 
"becomes a little scary to the customer because of the media attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
 USAir spokesman Mike Clark said the airline expects "some drop" in traffic. 
But he added that "we really don't think it will last," because the crashes 
have had different causes, including bad weather and air traffic control error. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of Thursday's crash, which killed all 132 people aboard and occurred 
in clear weather, is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir still has strengths to help it weather this disaster. It remains a 
dominant force in several Eastern markets, notably Pittsburgh, Charlotte and 
Baltimore-Washington. As of June 30, the company also had $521 million of 
available cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the financial markets registered their concern about USAir's 
prospects. The company's stock, which has already shed more than half its value 
in the past year, lost another 50 cents Friday to close at $6.125 a share in 
New York Stock Exchange trading. Volume was heavy at 2.7 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of USAir's junk bonds also tumbled. The airline's 10% senior notes, for 
example, were quoted at about $700, down about $20 for every $1,000 in face 
value, and their yield shot up to 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir is the product of an amalgam of airlines, including several acquired or 
merged during the 1980s, such as Piedmont Aviation in the Southeast and Pacific 
Southwest Airlines in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although USAir's passenger traffic this year is up about 10% from year-earlier 
levels, the airline has not sharply lowered its operating costs, particularly 
its labor expenses, to keep pace with its lower-cost rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir's cost to fly one passenger one mile -- the industry's standard gauge of 
operating expense -- is about 11.2 cents, well above the 9.2-cent average for 
major carriers and the 7.2 cents spent by low-cost powerhouse Southwest 
Airlines, said John Pincavage, an analyst with the research firm Transportation 
Group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 To be competitive, USAir has said it must get its cost down to at least 9.5 to 
10 cents a mile, which would save the airline about $1 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir is also facing growing competition from Southwest and another low-cost 
carrier, Continental Airlines' Lite. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir's biggest stockholder, British Airways, which owns a 24.6% stake in the 
carrier, has said it won't add to its $400-million investment until USAir 
restructures and returns to steady profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 But British Airways' chairman, Sir Colin Marshall, told reporters during an 
appearance in Atlanta on Friday that this week's crash would have no effect on 
the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Pincavage said it remains "critical" that USAir and its labor unions reach new 
pacts to slash USAir's costs. Ironically, the latest disaster might accelerate 
that effort, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If USAir's "traffic weakens significantly and the cash runs out faster" 
because of travelers' concerns, Pincavage said, "it puts more pressure on both 
sides to come to an agreement sooner rather than later."

WHOLESALE INFLATION LEAPS 0.6% IN AUGUST; ECONOMY: THE INCREASE, THE SHARPEST 
IN NEARLY FOUR YEARS, RAISES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANOTHER INTEREST RATE HIKE BY 
THE FED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inflation at the wholesale level took its biggest jump in nearly four years 
last month, touching off waves of selling on Wall Street and raising the 
specter of yet another Federal Reserve Board hike in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesale prices surged a surprisingly sharp 0.6% in August, led by food, 
gasoline, automobiles and tobacco, the Labor Department said Friday. Excluding 
volatile food and energy costs, the producer price index rose 0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 The news sparked fears that the Fed has failed to contain inflation this year, 
despite five interest rate increases so far, and it sparked expectations that 
the central bank will move again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The price report "is a cause for concern, mostly because of the intolerance 
the Fed has shown for any type of inflation," said Alan Levenson, a money 
market economist with UBS Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, the government's gauge of wholesale or producer prices, 
which detects inflation before it reaches consumers, has gone up at a 2.9% 
annual rate.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 33.65 points at 3,874.81, its 
biggest loss since June 30. At one point, the index was down 50.13. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds also were hammered in their worst day in four months. The Treasury 
Department's benchmark 30-year bond slumped in value, and its interest rate 
rose to 7.70% from 7.56% the day before. 
</P>
<P>
 Private analysts generally had expected the wholesale price rise to be lower, 
perhaps in the range of 0.4% or 0.5%. Now many analysts are guessing that the 
Fed will hike rates at the November meeting of its policy-setting Open Market 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Federal Reserve cannot be pleased" by Friday's report, said Lynn Reaser, 
chief economist at First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, virtually no analysts foresee the return of 1970s-style 
runaway inflation. The picture that emerges, rather, is a gradual step-up of 
prices from an annual rate of below 3% at the consumer level last year toward a 
level of 3% to 4% in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit: a growing national economy that has made workers, basic materials 
and unused factory capacity less available and, in a growing number of cases, 
more expensive, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we saw today is perfectly consistent with a moderate, cyclical increase 
in inflation," said Chris Varvares, an economist with Laurence H. Meyer & 
Associates in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The 0.4% rise in the "core" index of wholesale prices for August follows a 
0.1% increase in July. The 0.6% overall jump, including all components, follows 
a 0.5% rise in July. The index was stable in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said food prices rose 0.7% in August, the biggest advance 
since a 0.8% spurt in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists on Friday described the latest price report as a genuine sign of 
rising inflation rather than a monthly fluke. A gauge based on the prices of 21 
commodities, published by the Commodity Research Bureau, surged earlier this 
week, for example. In addition, surveys of industrial prices by the National 
Assn. of Purchasing Management have been signaling higher prices for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are leading indicators of inflation historically," said Paul L. 
Kasriel, an economist with Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "I don't know why 
there's any reason to suspect they aren't leading indicators now." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some economists contend that today's economic climate makes it unlikely 
that the emerging inflation will resemble painful episodes of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate's Reaser, for example, said corporate efforts to hold down 
wages and a range of cost savings brought by technology will help keep 
inflation below 3.5% next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The August price report was affected by certain temporary factors, such as a 
6.9% surge in beef prices and smaller increases for pork and fish. Analysts 
were more troubled by the 0.7% hike in auto prices, which seemed to reflect 
fewer discounts by dealers.

CHARGING PLUGS FOR ELECTRIC CARS: A FORK IN ROAD; AUTOS: MANUFACTURERS DON'T 
AGREE ON THE VITAL EQUIPMENT. TWO SYSTEMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEVELOPED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world's big auto makers can't agree on how electric cars will be plugged 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and four major Japanese car companies decided 
this week to use plugs similar to those on household clothes dryers. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. is holding out for a system developed at its Torrance 
subsidiary, Hughes Power Control Systems. That method uses an electromagnetic 
connection that looks something like a compact disc with a handle attached. 
</P>
<P>
 The disagreement could result in two kinds of charging systems for electric 
cars, which are due to become available in 1998 as mandated by the California 
Air Resources Board. Electric power utilities could be forced to invest in 
duplicate systems, with consumers left to sort them out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be more efficient from society's standpoint if the industry and 
stake holders sort that out, but it may end up being a market decision," said 
Lawrence Simmerling, manager of Ford's electric vehicle component and system 
engineering department. 
</P>
<P>
 Investor-owned electric utilities have asked the state Public Utilities 
Commission for permission to use more than $200 million of ratepayer funds over 
six years to prepare for the introduction of electrically powered vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison Co., which expects to run most California electric 
cars, wants to spend $12 million to $14 million of ratepayer funds over six 
years to build roughly 200 demonstration charging stations. It would prefer 
that the car makers agree on a standard recharging apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully that decision will be over by then," said William R. West, Edison 
manager of regulatory and legislative affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Though both sides deny having economic anxiety about the rivalry, Hughes has 
already invested more than $10 million in developing its system. Three states 
currently have laws requiring that electric cars be made available in the next 
few years. One or two chargers per car will be needed, so there could be demand 
for more than a million units by 2003, said Dick Bowman, Hughes program manager 
of electric vehicle infrastructure. Hughes estimates that its charging units 
will retail for about $1,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "After 1998, there would be a significant waste to have more than one system," 
Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford and Chrysler were joined by Honda Motor Co., Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan 
Motor Co. and Mazda Motor Corp. in agreeing on a so-called conductive system, 
which works much like a conventional plug. The Hughes charger uses 
electromagnetism to pass along power via what is called an inductive system. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers see advantages and drawbacks to both systems. The more conventional 
plug would require that each car carry its own charging system, but installing 
the garage connection would be inexpensive. The Hughes system would put much of 
the charging mechanism on the garage wall, which would reduce the costs of 
buying successive electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that they are going to have to compete for the market," said 
Cece M. Martin, deputy director of the California Electric Transportation 
Coalition, which represents the investor-owned utilities.

TIME BOMB; ANALYSTS SAY MEXICO WAS RIPE FOR CABAL'S APPARENT BANK FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Mexican banking fraud like the one alleged this week against high-flying 
billionaire Carlos Cabal Peniche was all but inevitable because of the rapid 
growth of the nation's banking system and the difficulty inherent in 
supervising it, analysts and banking experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari made it a top priority 
to open up, privatize and expand the banking system in a bid to feed the 
economy's desperate need for credit, an essential element in enabling 
businesses to expand and consumers to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the number of open or authorized banks in Mexico is now at 37 -- 
more than double the 18 that were operating in 1991 when the privatization 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 And those banks that in the 1980s were forced to reserve 95% of their assets 
for the Mexican government's use in repaying foreign debt now have a green 
light to do business. As a result, total loans by Mexican banks have nearly 
doubled to $142 billion in March from $75 billion in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgages at Bancomer, Mexico's second-largest bank, now total $8 billion, up 
from $1 billion in 1990, despite interest rates of 23% that might seem 
prohibitive to U.S. borrowers. Still, loan demand remains way ahead of supply, 
and a balance may not be achieved until 1996, says Susanna Ornelas, a bank 
analyst with Baring Securities in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage is set for still more rapid growth. Forty-one foreign concerns -- 
including such U.S. firms as Bank of America, Ford Motor Credit Co. and 
Citibank -- have applied for licenses to open banks in Mexico. The new players, 
if admitted, will dramatically expand the range of financial services available 
to Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But rapid growth, as was shown by the U.S. savings and loan debacle of the 
1980s, often comes at the expense of bank supervision and loan quality, leading 
to failures and fraud as banks in their eagerness to lend money take on less 
than credit-worthy customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S.-based analysts also faulted the link between banks and industrial 
companies that characterizes Mexico's grupos , or conglomerates, such as the 
banking, agricultural, timber and retailing empire at the center of this week's 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Autoprestamos , or self-loans, were allegedly a principal occupation of Cabal, 
38, chairman of Grupo Financiero Union, whom Mexican officials charged Monday 
with fraudulently loaning as much as $700 million to himself -- from his Banco 
Union and Banca Cremi -- to buy stock in other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabal is now a fugitive, the target of a worldwide manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you have industrial companies connected with banks, you run the risk 
of loans being taken into the industrial sector, which is why in the U.S., 
commercial banks are not allowed to own an industrial concern," said a Wall 
Street-based analyst of Latin American banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, foreign observers gave Mexico high marks for stepping in at Grupo 
Financiero Union this week and, in jailing several of Cabal's lieutenants, 
sending a tough message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here the Mexican bank authorities look pretty good. We are getting a First 
World response to a potential crisis, and this can be reassuring to Mexican and 
U.S. investors, the fact that they moved in and said they weren't going to 
allow banks to be viewed as personal piggy banks," said analyst Peter Treadway 
of Smith Barney in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But apart from the alleged fraud by Cabal and the government's seizure of 
another banking conglomerate -- Grupo Havre, for alleged embezzlement earlier 
this year -- Mexico's banking industry faces its own set of problems. The main 
one is an economy that hasn't cooperated. The buyers of the government banks in 
1991 were figuring on economic expansion to boost their banks' performance, 
which hasn't occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, bad loans have been rising steadily since privatization began and 
reached 9.8% of Mexico's outstanding loans in June. An industrywide average of 
10% could presage a step-up in government takeovers, said Jose A. 
Garcia-Cantera, Latin American bank analyst at Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican banks are also struggling to install and integrate the technology 
needed to trace credit quickly and ensure better loan quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican mortgage market is like the Chinese airlines," said Treadway. 
"There's tremendous demand but not enough people, service and planes. . . . 
There's no mortgage loan history. You could default on a house, move next-door, 
and the bank making the new loan would never know you had defaulted." 
</P>
<P>
 Although privatization of the 18 formerly state-owned banks is well under way, 
banking experts say enormous power remains concentrated in the hands of bank 
branch managers, giving them the authority to approve loans that in U.S. banks 
is usually shared by a loan committee. That process is changing only slowly.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus, while the government promised this week that Cabal's depositors are safe 
and no other bank scandals are about to surface, observers such as 
Garcia-Cantera have other worries. He said smaller banks could run into 
problems unless the economy recovers strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation of asset quality is quite scary," Garcia-Cantera said. "My 
concern is not about the ability of the supervisors, but that bank managers are 
sufficiently conservative in (identifying) bad assets." Loans Rising, Defaults 
Too 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid expansion of Mexico's banking system has not come without costs. 
Banks are reporting an alarming rise in non-performing loans, a result of the 
country's weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Total outstanding loans held by Mexican banks in U.S. dollars: 
</P>
<P>
 March 1994: $142 billion 
</P>
<P>
 Percentage of loans past due: 
</P>
<P>
 June 94: 9.8%

WESTERN FED SOLD TO HOME SAVINGS, OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Resolution Trust Corp. said late Friday that it sold Western Federal 
Savings Bank of Marina del Rey to Home Savings of America and two other 
financial institutions for a combined $88.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Irwindale-based Home Savings agreed to pay $87.2 million for Western Fed's 
headquarters office in Marina del Rey and 22 other branches scattered across 
Los Angeles and Orange counties.Together, the offices have $1.7 billion in 
deposits, the RTC said. 
</P>
<P>
 Founders National Bank, one of the few Los Angeles-based financial 
institutions that is owned and managed by African Americans, will pay the RTC 
$880,000 for the $22.5 million in deposits at the Western Fed branch on the USC 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift's remaining office, in Panorama City, was sold to Pan American Bank 
of San Mateo. Pan American will pay $808,026 to take over the branch and its 
$68.2 million in deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 All the branches will reopen with their buyers' names on Monday, the RTC said. 
All told, the sales will cost U.S. taxpayers about $239.2 million as a result 
of federal assistance, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal will help Home Savings expand its branch network in Southern 
California, particularly in more affluent areas that were served by Western 
Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators seized Western Federal Savings & Loan, which was owned by an 
investment group headed by former Treasury Secretary William Simon and former 
Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Preston Martin, last year after it suffered 
millions of dollars in loan losses caused by Southern California's prolonged 
real estate slump. The thrift was renamed Western Federal Savings Bank and has 
been operated by the federal government.

SWINDLER AGREES TO ABIDE BY SECURITIES LAWS IN FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local man who bilked 125 investors out of $11 million signed an agreement 
Friday prohibiting him from future violations of securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Carl Huitt, 41, had already been sentenced to eight years in prison 
after pleading guilty to fraud in connection with a bogus second trust deed 
sales program.He was also ordered to pay $8.7 million in restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting guilt, Huitt signed the consent decree, thus ending an 
investigation started last year by the federal Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1993, federal investigators arrested Huitt at his Newport Beach 
home on suspicion that his company, also in Newport Beach, bilked investors 
whom he had promised returns as high as 18% on real estate investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say that Huitt told investors their funds were invested in 
promissory notes secured by second trust deeds. Instead, he used the money to 
pay off obligations to other investors and to buy personal property, including 
two boats and musical equipment, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huitt and his attorney were not available for comment Friday.

 Labor Board Charges Sprint: The National Labor Relations Board will fine the 
long-distance company for the alleged illegal firing of 235 Latino workers who 
were seeking to form a union, the telephone workers union said.The 
Communications Workers of America said the board recommended a federal court 
injunction be sought to reinstate the workers. The union said the workers, all 
employees at Sprint Corp.'s Spanish-language, San Francisco-based marketing 
subsidiary, La Conexion Familiar, had been fired to prevent them from becoming 
the first Sprint long-distance unit to unionize. Sprint replied that the 
board's action "is not a finding that LCF or Sprint has violated any labor 
laws."

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW DROPS 33.65 POINTS ON SURGE IN WHOLESALE PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Renewed inflation fears gripped the financial markets Friday after a sharp 
jump in August wholesale prices, sending stock prices sharply lower and 
long-term bond yields to a two-month high. 
</P>
<P>
 The news prompted piles of sell orders on Wall Street and sent the Dow Jones 
industrial average down 33.65 points to close at 3,874.81. It was the biggest 
one-day decline since June 30 and put the best-known stock average barometer 
back to its levels of mid-August. For the week, the blue chip average lost a 
modest 10.77 points. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the afternoon, the Dow was down more than 50 points, prompting 
automatic restrictions on high-volume computerized trading. A bounce in the 
last hour helped trim the losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining shares outnumbered advancers by 3 to 1 on New 
York Stock Exchange volume of 294.32 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Treasury bond market, the bellwether 30-year bond, whose yield stood at 
7.56% on Thursday, closed at 7.70% on Friday. It was the bond's highest yield 
since it shot up to 7.73% on July 11, the peak of the Treasury bear market that 
began in February. Its price, which falls when yields rise, dropped 1 5/8 
points, or $16.25 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell against most major currencies, as investors worried that a new 
round of inflation would erode its buying power. In New York, the dollar closed 
at 99.20 Japanese yen from 99.50 on Thursday, and at 1.538 German marks from 
1.556. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department reported a surprisingly big 0.6% jump in the producer 
price index, following a strong increase of 0.5% in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase "very much supports the view" that the Fed will raise short-term 
interest rates again within the next few months to cool the economy and keep 
inflation from skyrocketing, said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa 
Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The report "was a cold shower," said Paul Kasriel, money market economist at 
financial services giant Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "It certainly has 
sensitized the market to the view that maybe inflation is not going to be quite 
as tame or move up quite as gradually." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * USAir Group Inc. ended off 1/2 to 6 1/8. The crash of a USAir jetliner 
outside Pittsburgh could lead travelers to fly on other airlines, analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mercantile Stores jumped 7 5/8 to 54 1/2, adding to a gain of 6 5/8 on 
Thursday. It said it is in talks with a third party, which it did not identify, 
regarding a possible merger. 
</P>
<P>
 * Xyplex, which makes and supports high-performance data-communications 
networks, surged 9 1/2 to 27 3/4 after a $28-a-share takeover offer from 
Raytheon Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transportation stocks were broadly lower. Federal Express fell 1 3/8 to 69 
1/4 and trucking company Roadway Services lost 1 to 60 3/4 on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks, sensitive to interest rates, were also among Friday's 
losing issues. Morgan Stanley declined 2 1/4 to 65 7/8 and Chase Manhattan Bank 
was down 1 to 36 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft dropped 1 1/16 to 56 7/8 after an executive of the software 
company said it plans a 50% increase in research and development spending, 
prompting some investors to fear profit erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualcomm gained 1 7/16 to 24 11/16. Shares of the maker of digital wireless 
communications gear rose for the second day after long-distance company Sprint 
said it will use Qualcomm's technology. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Mobile Systems rose 1/2 to 11 after it reported that Nextel, a 
provider of mobile services, made a buyout offer equaling $10.80 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, stocks closed lower in foreign trading. London shares collapsed 
during the afternoon session, with the FTSE-100 average closing down 40.7 
points at 3,139.3. That was 83.4 lower from a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the blue chip DAX-30 average closed 12.78 points up at 2,185.15. 
In Tokyo, the Nikkei-225 average closed down 19.90 points at 19,897.88, a fall 
of 755.95 points on the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index finished down 6.81 points at 2,755.35.

POSSIBLE INSIDE TRADING AT LOCKHEED PROBED; REGULATION: PACIFIC EXCHANGE 
EXAMINES OPTIONS DEALINGS LEADING UP TO MARTIN MARIETTA MERGER ANNOUNCEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 Stock market regulators are examining possible insider trading in Lockheed 
Corp. stock the days leading up to the announcement of a $10-billion merger 
with Martin Marietta Corp., officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Stock Exchange, which trades options on Lockheed's common stock, 
examined "a handful of trades and customers" before the Aug. 30 merger 
announcement, spokesman Dale Carlson said. He would not discuss further 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did preliminary work and forwarded it to the SEC," Carlson said. Aerospace 
Daily, an industry newsletter, reported the investigation in its Friday 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission neither confirms nor denies the 
existence of its pending investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insider trading" refers to the illegal practice of buying or selling 
securities based on non-public information -- in this case it would have been 
advance knowledge of the Lockheed-Martin Marietta merger announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed stock surged the morning after the merger was announced. Investors 
who had purchased Lockheed stock or stock options beforehand would have 
profited enormously by selling afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Options give investors the right to buy or sell securities at a specified 
price at some time in the future. Call options enable investors to bet on the 
anticipated price rise of securities, and these were the types of options under 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators are exploring a possible correlation between Lockheed trading and 
the widening circle of people brought into the merger talks. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no significant trading in Lockheed options until Aug. 24, about the 
time the boards of Lockheed and Martin Marietta, as well as Defense Department 
officials, were briefed about the merger. Also before the announcement, certain 
officials at General Electric Co. were contacted about the merger and its 
possible tax consequences to GE's 23% stake in Martin Marietta. 
</P>
<P>
 By Aug. 30, the price of one class of Lockheed options, the September 65 
contract, rose more than elevenfold, said Rep. John Dingell, chairman of a 
House oversight and investigations subcommittee. Trading volume more than 
doubled from 30 contracts traded on Aug. 23 to 80 contracts on Aug. 24. Volume 
skyrocketed the day before the merger, with 348 contracts changing hands, a 
Dingell staff member said. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said regulators are in 
the process of identifying the individuals who traded the options and what, if 
any, relationship they had with the individuals who knew of the deal before the 
public announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been advised by the SEC of an informal inquiry related to Lockheed 
call-options trading, and we are cooperating fully," Lockheed spokesman Paul 
Haney said.

STOCK REPORTING ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A stock trader's error on part of the Nasdaq computer system Friday led to 
reporting of incorrect prices on more than two dozen major stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Trades are expected to be correctly priced, but incorrect figures were 
transmitted to computer systems, newspapers such as The Times and other 
reporting agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 (Figures on the Times' TimesLine phone service will not be corrected until 
Monday.) 
</P>
<P>
 The error marks the latest in a series of technical glitches that have plagued 
the Nasdaq market this summer, ranging from software problems to an errant 
squirrel that chewed through a Nasdaq computer system power cable. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem Friday involved a trader's misuse of the Automated Confirmation 
Transaction system. 
</P>
<P>
 The trades, which took place away from the New York Stock Exchange and the 
Nasdaq market, are displayed on the ACT system to fulfill reporting 
requirements under securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks from the NYSE and other markets can be traded via the electronic Nasdaq 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the stocks are in the Dow Jones industrial average, the 
errors did not affect the average because it is calculated on the basis of 4 
p.m. closing prices on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasdaq's market surveillance officials, who alerted Associated Press to the 
problem, supplied an unofficial list of the affected stocks and correct late 
trades recorded for each issue: 
</P>
<P>
 American International Group, 90 5/8; Ameritech, 40 3/4; Amoco, 58 3/4; 
American Express, 30 1/2; Atlantic Richfield, 105 7/8; Boeing, 45 3/4; 
BankAmerica, 48 5/8; Bell Atlantic, 53; Bristol Myers Squibb, 57.

JAPAN CRITICIZES U.S. FOR ITS STRATEGY ON BALANCING TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the countdown to a U.S. sanctions deadline, Japan criticized the United 
States on Friday for pursuing a managed-trade strategy that has helped stir 
"frustration and distrust" between the world's richest economies. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto issued his attack -- along with plenty of 
promises to reform the Japanese economy -- as negotiators completed two days of 
talks in Los Angeles in pursuit of an elusive trade truce to ward off a Sept. 
30 showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei 
Kono met Thursday, and lower-level U.S. and Japanese officials met Friday. 
Neither side reported advances during this week's talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hashimoto arrived in town Friday for talks between the four big economic 
powers -- the United States, Japan, Canada and the European Union -- whose 
trade ministers were to meet Friday evening and start debating how best to 
advance the cause of global free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 But those "Quad" meetings, to begin in earnest over the weekend, were all but 
overshadowed by the transpacific standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue: Japan's $131-billion trade surplus and how to crack open the world's 
No. 2 economy. Tokyo accuses the U.S. team of trying to micro-manage business, 
a strategy it says is anathema to free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan says the U.S. insistence on yardsticks to measure how far it opens 
markets will lead to quotas for U.S. exporters and amounts to trade by 
government decree. 
</P>
<P>
 Hashimoto, pledging "the birth of a new Japan," said his coalition government 
is committed to reform and delivering consumers a better deal. Both sides, he 
said, must battle the "frustration and distrust" spawned by the dispute.

A RETURN TO TUNES THAT FEEL SO GOOD; JAZZ: CHUCK MANGIONE AND HIS BAND WILL 
PLAY NEW MATERIAL FROM 'THE HAT'S BACK' AND SOME OF HIS OLDER WORK TONIGHT AT 
ORANGE COAST COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the '70s, more than 2 million copies of fluegelhornist Chuck Mangione's 
album "Feels So Good" were sold, making him among the most visible instrumental 
musicians of that decade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Mangione, who never came close to repeating that achievement, sees that 
success as something of a fluke in a world where record companies and the 
buying public want vocals, with instruments subservient to the voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have a record as huge as 'Feels So Good' is the exception in instrumental 
music," the 53-year-old fluegelhornist-composer said from his New York City 
home. "You can count on one hand the songs that have been that big, like 'Take 
Five' and 'Mercy, Mercy, Mercy.' Songs like that just don't come around every 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the rarity of a successful instrumental song explains Mangione's near 
invisibility over the past few years. After his enormous success with tunes 
such as "Feels So Good," "The Land of Make Believe" (from his 1972 recording 
"The Chuck Mangione Quartet") and his 1978 score for the film adaptation of 
Oscar Lewis' novel "The Children of Sanchez," Mangione's spent less time in the 
spotlight, recording only a few albums in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean he has disappeared. He returned to the road in 1994 
after a four-year hiatus, making tours of the United States and South America. 
Tonight he and his band stop at the Robert B. Moore Theatre on the Orange Coast 
College campus. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's shopping a new album ("The Hat's Back") among several record labels. 
The title refers to the stovepipe hat Mangione was famous for wearing during 
performances. The album was co-produced by Steve Gadd, Mangione's fellow 
crossover pioneer. Though it consists of new material, some of which he 
promises will be played tonight, the approach is the same as it was in the 
"Feels So Good" days: memorable melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instrumental music is a different kind of sell these days, but I feel 
positive about the music and the chances of finding a label. The melodic 
ingredient is one that I've always been a fan of, one that I wanted to keep in 
the music. The people who hear us play will be impressed with the individual 
performers, but they'll go home remembering the melodies. That's what's 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that emphasis on pretty, accessible melodies that earned Mangione the 
disdain of jazz purists at the height of his career. But he paid heavy dues to 
get where he is, compiling an impressive list of credentials and associations 
along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Rochester, N.Y., in 1940, the young Mangione, whose father was a big 
jazz fan, had a chance to jam with visiting musicians, including Dizzy 
Gillespie, Sam Jones, Ron Carter and Kai Winding, while in his teens.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the early '50s, there were numerous small clubs in Rochester where the 
greats would come and play these intimate places. My dad would take us to the 
Sunday matinees to hear people like Art Blakey, Dizzy and Horace Silver and 
sometimes we would have a chance to get up and play with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes (the musicians) would come by our house after the gig. Word had 
gotten out it was a place to get a good dish of spaghetti and homemade Italian 
wine, so the house kind of became a pit stop for the musicians traveling 
through town. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were also a lot of great local musicians in town, like Frank Strazzeri 
(the pianist now based in L.A.) who kept the interest going. So we got a heavy 
dose of the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Mangione studied at Rochester's respected Eastman School, though he says jazz 
was a "four-letter word" there at the time and not represented in the courses 
offered. So he and his brother, pianist Gap Mangione, moved to New York and 
formed their own band, a post-bop outfit dubbed the Jazz Brothers. (The Jazz 
Brothers, incidentally regrouped in 1986 for a U.S. tour.) 
</P>
<P>
 Mangione's reputation as a stylish, lyrically smart trumpeter spread in New 
York, and he was hired to work with Maynard Ferguson and Woody Herman in 1965. 
But his big break came when Art Blakey called him that same year to join the 
Jazz Messengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got lucky with that gig. Art called Dizzy for a recommendation when he 
needed a trumpeter and Dizzy asked him, 'Do you remember the kid from 
Rochester?' I was very fortunate to be in (Blakey's) band at that time. Both 
(pianists) Keith Jarrett and Chick Corea came through that band. Frank Mitchell 
was the tenor player." 
</P>
<P>
 Mangione spent 2 1/2 years with Blakey, touring the country and recording two 
albums, including "Buttercorn Lady" which was done live at the Lighthouse in 
Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, Mangione formed his own quartet, which included saxophonist Gerry 
Niewood, a boyhood friend. The soft, pillowy sound began to catch on. The 1972 
Mercury recording, "The Chuck Mangione Quartet," which included "The Land of 
Make Believe," took off, and suddenly he was outselling many of the pop bands 
of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Mangione is hoping that "The Hat's Back" will return him to the charts. 
To get inspiration for his songs, he turns to old favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still love to listen to what I call the Zen masters of the music, the 
people I grew up admiring: Billie Holiday ("Lady in Satin," "Clifford Brown 
With Strings"), Dizzy and Miles Davis. That's the kind of music I turn to most 
of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 And though he promises new material at tonight's concert, fans of his older 
work won't be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll do things from 'The Hat's Back,' but we'll also do some older things. 
Sometimes they won't let you out of town until you play a certain song. But 
that's OK. Those songs are like my children. I remember and love them for what 
they mean to me and others." 
</P>
<P>
 * Chuck Mangione plays the Robert B. Moore Theatre, Orange Coast College, 2701 
Fairview Road, Costa Mesa, at 8 tonight. Tickets $25 in advance, $29 at the 
door. (714) 432-5880.

LOOKING TO REMODEL THE EMMYS; TELEVISION: NOMINATED FOR 'HOME IMPROVEMENT,' 
PATRICIA RICHARDSON CO-HOSTS SUNDAY'S AWARDS. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN SHE'S 
BUYING INTO IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thanks for everything, TV Land. The Emmy nomination for best lead actress in a 
comedy series was fun. The gig as co-host of the 46th Annual Emmy Awards show 
Sunday night is certainly flattering. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that any of it really matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like real gravy, but I distrust it," says Emmy co-host and "Home 
Improvement" nominee Patricia Richardson. "There's a part of me that's like, 
'Don't let that be important because that's not what it's about.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the whole L.A. mentality that nothing really matters unless it's a 
success . . . is such a shallow and dangerous attitude to have." 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that one of America's feistiest TV moms is also one of its more 
outspoken actresses. Her Jill Taylor character, who takes Tim Allen's 
caveman-esque quips and zings them back at him, isn't too far removed in 
feminist brio from Richardson herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women have been embraced by a country of TV watchers bored with the 
namby-pamby mothers-know-best of the pre-"Roseanne" era: ABC's sitcom "Home 
Improvement" was the No. 1 show last season, and Richardson/Taylor was chosen 
America's second favorite mom after Kathie Lee Gifford in a USA Today poll last 
year. (The small screen's mother of three and wife to tool jock Tim Taylor 
(Allen) is, in real life, a mother of three and wife to the far more 
enlightened actor Ray Baker ("Places in the Heart").) 
</P>
<P>
 So it shouldn't be too surprising that as Richardson picks at her cold salmon 
at a cafe near her Santa Monica home, she's also chewing over the fact that she 
will be co-queen of the Emmys with comedian Ellen DeGeneres. Their distaff rule 
over this year's show follows Angela Lansbury's over last year's Emmys, Whoopi 
Goldberg's command of this year's Oscar ceremony and Roseanne's stint at the 
helm of the MTV Video Music Awards on Thursday night.  
</P>
<P>
 Does the recent flurry of female award-show hosts signify something up in 
Hollywood? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're trying to lie to the public and pretend that Hollywood is a 
place women are running," Richardson says, then hoots. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in a world where everything is relative, Richardson, 43, finds it 
fitting that two actresses are helming the Emmy telecast. Television, unlike 
film, welcomes women over 40, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's nice that they're doing that because I believe television is 
still ruled by women," says the former New York stage actress. "I mean, all of 
the TV movies are women-driven. Even our show, which is such a male-oriented 
show, is watched by more women than men. Television is a real woman's medium . 
. . but what's disturbing is, still even in television, women have so little to 
do with what's going on behind the scenes." 
</P>
<P>
 Zing . 
</P>
<P>
 Don Mischer, executive producer of the Emmy Awards, said women were 
deliberately recruited to steer the show, but not to make any kind of 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's less predictable," he said. "I think often in these shows you 
kind of expect to have a single male host out there. It's just a different 
direction. . . . On my part, there's no effort to create the illusion that 
women are running Hollywood. I think Hollywood is still very much of a boys' 
club." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, Richardson, an established ABC star, was selected to balance out 
her up-and-coming co-host, the edgier ABC comedian DeGeneres. (As you may have 
guessed, ABC is airing this year's Emmy show.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I think viewers will be comfortable with Pat as the host," Mischer said. "She 
has a natural charm and down-to-earth graciousness, and when you combine that 
with her likability, it will make her a really good host." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson also sees a certain harmony to co-hosting with DeGeneres. 
</P>
<P>
 "She sees this as something to look forward to, as fun. I see it as major 
surgery. . . . Everything that happens in my life that's a change or new, my 
first reaction is abject terror. My second reaction is to examine the terror 
and figure out if it's justified. If it's not, then I try to do it anyway, 
which is why I'm hosting." 
</P>
<P>
 The other reason is to appease her advisers, who've fruitlessly tried to get 
Richardson to broaden her profile with "the hundred cheesy appearances at 
parties and openings and all the stuff that I guess people do that I don't 
really do. . . . They think I need to be seen away from Tim's tool apron 
strings. Most people don't know who I am unless I'm standing next to Tim. They 
say, 'If you do this, then we will stop bugging you about the other stuff.' 
Fine." 
</P>
<P>
 But standing next to Tim Allen has helped make Richardson a model for American 
women; her smart retorts to his character's Cro-Magnon jibes lend Jill Taylor 
an enviable degree of power in the marriage. Their chemistry has propelled the 
show through three years of prime time, and Richardson's contract calls for 
three more. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I really have to watch out for on the show is that there 
are times when I would really respond to something in a hurt way, which I would 
in my life," Richardson said. "I can't afford those colors as Jill, because if 
I do, it's like suddenly he seems abusive. Jill almost always comes back at him 
after he's hurt her, because if she comes back at him with anything else you 
lose the comedy. It becomes a little scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, the keeper of the feminist flame on "Home Improvement," provides 
input into some of the more retrograde writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to protect the feminist viewpoint on the show as much as I can. So much 
of the time, it's protected anyway -- Tim says some jerk stupid thing, and Al 
holds up a sign that says 'Right,' so there's an acknowledgment on the part of 
the show that they know that what he's saying is stupid. But sometimes I let 
things go by and then I feel terrible about it. Every once in a while I go, 'Oh 
my God, I should have stopped that one.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who's no longer starlet material, believes she won't be able to 
parlay her growing recognition into a career in film, bailiwick of the better 
scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot to overcome there. I'm not a guy. It's a lot easier for men to 
make that transition from sitcom to film than it is for women. And what I keep 
getting offered are (TV) melodramas where it's Jill, only Jill has an autistic 
child, or it's Jill and she's exposing corruption in Louisiana, or it's Jill 
and she's running from the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got one script where the character was a public defender who was actually 
very interesting because she was totally screwed up. I was so happy to finally 
see somebody who wasn't Jill again. When I do end up doing something, it will 
probably be really sick. I live in such a sweet world in the world of 'Home 
Improvement' that I tend to be drawn to stuff that's really on the other end of 
the spectrum entirely."

THE MAKING OF 'CORRINA' A REAL LABOR OF LOVE; MOVIES: IT TOOK JESSIE NELSON 
NINE YEARS TO GET THE FILM MADE. ITS STORY IS TAKEN FROM HER LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 On Wednesday, "Corrina, Corrina" was chosen by the United Nations as the film 
to be screened in the General Assembly Hall this year -- joining a group of 
past recipients that include "Rain Man," "Terms of Endearment" and "E.T." 
Although the $11-million movie is unlikely to match these blockbusters in terms 
of box office or prestige, that it made it to the screen at all is a testament 
to the resolve of first-time feature director Jessie Nelson, a native Angeleno 
who also wrote and produced it. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the 1950s, "Corrina" -- which was selected over such mega-hits as 
"Forrest Gump" and "The Lion King" -- is the story of a child (Tina Majorino) 
acting as a matchmaker between her recently widowed father (Ray Liotta) and her 
nanny (Whoopi Goldberg), a college-educated free spirit who transforms their 
lives. During the nine years since she first wrote the tale, Nelson waitressed 
off and on -- and watched in frustration as the similarly themed "Clara's 
Heart," "The Long Walk Home" and "Sleepless in Seattle" got to the starting 
block first. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The late director) Hal Ashby once said that films don't get made . . . they 
are willed into existence," says Nelson, a down-to-earth, very pregnant 
38-year-old. "I knew that, if I gave up, this movie would never happen or, even 
worse, would emerge in diluted form. 'Cut back the father and bring up the 
kid,' one studio advised. 'Make it a black "Mary Poppins," ' another said. I 
comforted myself with the knowledge that 'Platoon,' another intensely personal 
film, took a decade to make." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is loosely based on Nelson's own life. Nelson, who is white, lost 
her mother, a labor organizer, in a car accident when she was 3 -- an incident 
that left her with a sense of abandonment and, later on, an enhanced 
appreciation for life. A 70-year-old black nanny (Nelson lopped off 35 years in 
the film to inject dramatic and romantic tension) helped her work through her 
grief. Although her father ("an atheist who talks to God") didn't write jingles 
like his cinematic counterpart, he did make his name in advertising -- most 
notably in Prudential's "piece of the rock" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Young Jessie dreamed that her father would marry her beloved nanny -- no 
matter the racial and age differences. It was the innocence of that vision, 
Nelson says, that drew her to the story -- as well as the hunger for 
spirituality that has always done battle with her innate cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
 "A tragedy like that both makes you need God and makes it impossible to 
believe in him," Nelson says. "In the movie, when Ray (Liotta) says that heaven 
is just something people make up so they won't feel sad, the child replies: 
'What's wrong with that?' Without the notion of an afterlife, I had no 
connection to my mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson began her professional career as an actress, winning an Obie for her 
work with the experimental theater troupe Mabou Mines, performing with the New 
York Shakespeare Festival and landing an ongoing role on "Archie Bunker's 
Place." While waiting tables, she began to write, scribbling a script about 
five waitresses on her pad between orders. When Disney bought the material and 
gave it to six male writers for rewrites, Nelson came to the conclusion that 
only by directing could she effectively protect her work. 
</P>
<P>
 "My First Time" -- a documentary about people's first sexual experiences -- 
was completed six years ago. Although that paved the way for Nelson's 
acceptance into the prestigious Chanticleer program for first-time directors, 
it was "To the Moon Alice" -- a half-hour short about an indigent family that 
sneaks onto a sitcom set -- that landed her a writing and directing deal at 
Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, getting "Corrina" off the ground was an uphill battle. European 
financing came through but was predicated on casting a conventionally beautiful 
actress or model in the lead. When the money men met Goldberg, however, they 
were moved by her approach: "If you cast me , it will really be a love story," 
she told them. "When people fall in love with me, they fall in love with my 
soul." Even so, it took four more years before New Line Cinema stepped in and 
agreed to finance and distribute the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Their faith, it seems, has been vindicated. Last weekend, the movie had third 
highest per screen average after "Forrest Gump" and "Natural Born Killers" and 
has been among the top 10 grossers for two weeks running. With its gross of 
under $10 million so far, it's premature to label it a "hit," New Line 
concedes, but the movie certainly qualifies as a "sleeper." 
</P>
<P>
 "If this film continues to perform well, it will be a triumph of consumers 
over critics," says Chris Pula, president of theatrical marketing for New Line. 
"Many reviews dismissed the movie, but people love it. Word-of-mouth screenings 
have been an important part of the marketing mix." 
</P>
<P>
 So, says Nelson, was Goldberg, who worked well below her post-"Sister Act" 
salary. The actress's comedic touch, the director maintains, helped 
counterbalance the sentimentality. And those who lashed into her for taking on 
another "maid" role -- on the heels of "Clara's Heart" and "The Long Walk Home" 
-- were totally off-base. 
</P>
<P>
 "To reduce this part -- a victim of racism who couldn't find her place in the 
work force -- to that of a 'maid' is racist, in itself," says Nelson. "Besides, 
Hollywood's notion of Whoopi is very limited. Last time I looked, she wasn't 
being offered 'The Client.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Since the release of the film, Nelson has been swamped with screenplays -- a 
lot of them the "dead mother" variety. One of her projects, dealing with the 
therapeutic effect of dolphins on autistic children, is at Warner Bros. She 
also co-wrote a TV pilot, "A Mom's Life" -- an exploration of the juggling act 
required to combine work and motherhood -- that Rob Reiner will produce. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is of particular relevance these days since Nelson and 
screenwriter-director Bryan Gordon, whom she plans to marry in October, expect 
a baby girl two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the stresses of motherhood, she says, movie making was good 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shot during the fires and edited during the earthquakes," Nelson recalls. 
"I didn't sleep at all the first week . . . or during the entire shooting 
process, for that matter."

COMMENTARY: THE AWARDS BROADCAST HASN'T SEEMED SO BIG OR SPECIAL FOR A LONG 
TIME. THIS YEAR'S SHOW COULD PROVE TO BE A PIVOTAL ONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The television industry will be studying the ratings of Sunday night's Emmy 
Awards with perhaps more than the usual interest. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tune-in is disappointing again, it may be time to take dramatic steps 
to revive audience attention. 
</P>
<P>
 After six years on Fox-TV, during which the once-popular awards show sank 
severely in viewer tune-in, the Emmy telecast returned to one of the Big Three 
networks -- ABC -- in 1993, and there were hopes that the popularity of the 
annual event would be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't happen. Thanks in part to counterprogramming by other networks, 
ABC's 1993 Emmy rating of 13.8 was actually lower than the 13.9 of the previous 
year on Fox. What was even more embarrassing, the show drew smaller numbers 
than the Daytime Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether the Emmy Awards -- the biggest annual income producer 
of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences -- were undermined irrevocably by 
being licensed to Fox for a few shekels more. At the time, the virtually new 
Fox network was especially weak in its station lineup compared to ABC, CBS and 
NBC, and thus a smaller audience was almost a given. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years is a long time, and plenty of magic can -- and did -- disappear from 
a once-special night and broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fox deal was not all that was happening during this time to affect 
tune-in. The network audience was diminishing each year because of cable, 
pay-TV and other viewing alternatives that were siphoning off audiences from 
the Big Three. And these defecting viewers thus figured to have less interest 
in the shows honored on the Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the Emmys finally embraced cable shows; but the increasingly 
fractionalized audience, with its accompanying tune-out of the networks, was 
bound to have an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, even though popular entertainment series -- such as "Roseanne" 
and "Seinfeld" -- are getting smaller shares of the audience than hits of past 
years, there is no reason that a big, special night like the Emmy Awards can't 
show some real clout. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the Emmy show hasn't seemed so big or special for quite a 
while. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, so long as the show is tape-delayed here in the West -- with 
winners being revealed on other broadcast outlets even before the program 
begins -- the TV industry's biggest event will remain a poor cousin to the 
Academy Awards, which airs live coast-to-coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible to breathe new life into the Emmys? If the ratings are good 
enough to avoid panic after Sunday's show, the industry will probably just 
shrug and forget about it until jolted again, as it was by the Fox debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter what, would it hurt to think of some added pizazz -- for 
example, some really splashy pre- and post-awards network specials, as cable's 
E! Entertainment Television channel is planning? ABC's local station, KABC-TV 
Channel 7, is also planning a pre-Emmy show. 
</P>
<P>
 Having Bette Midler sing a number from "Gypsy," in which she starred for CBS, 
is on the agenda for Sunday night's Emmy show, and that's fine, but not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 After the six-year decline on Fox, there was some talk, not taken very 
seriously, about having all the networks broadcast the Emmy show simultaneously 
-- at least once -- to make a huge splash and bring the audience back in 
dramatic fashion. Maybe it's not such a crazy idea. Cable's ACE Awards have 
aired live on a number of channels. 
</P>
<P>
 There are surely bound to be other, perhaps better, ideas out there in a town 
built on showmanship. If they don't emerge soon, it may be too late to rekindle 
audience interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV academy has had some rocky years: the Fox deal; the previous banning of 
"The Simpsons" from eligibility for best comedy series; the argument over how 
guest stars should be recognized in the competition; and, finally, another 
fiasco when ABC was given the Emmy Awards exclusively in a multiyear pact, 
again for a few shekels more -- a move that infuriated the other competing 
networks, who boycotted last year's show and pulled their ads from Emmy 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 The academy reversed itself on the ABC pact in March, and the Emmys now will 
be rotated annually among all the networks starting in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Counterprogramming the Emmys, however, remains a fact of life. It didn't just 
start last year against ABC. The other networks have to put on something , but 
they might remember that this, after all, is a program that is supposed to 
showcase virtually the entire industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on Sunday, CBS is counterprogramming with a preview of a new sitcom, "The 
Boys Are Back," followed by a rerun of "Steel Magnolias." Fox has scheduled 
first-run episodes of such hits as "The Simpsons" and "Married . . . With 
Children." And NBC will broadcast the film "Other People's Money." 
</P>
<P>
 How far back do the Emmys have to come to regain major viewer attention? 
Consider some numbers: 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the year before Fox began showing the awards, NBC earned a 23.1 
rating. In 1987, Fox's rating was 8.8. In following years, Fox got a 10.7 in 
1988, an 11.4 in 1989 and finally had the industry throwing up its hands when 
it plummeted to an 8.2 in 1990, attracting only 14% of TV viewers. By 1992, 
Fox's rating was up to a 13.9, with 24% of the audience, but the damage to the 
show's image had been done. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emmy Awards actually begin tonight in Pasadena when technical and creative 
arts honors are bestowed at a preliminary, non-televised ceremony. One of the 
Emmys' special honors, the Syd Cassyd Founders Award -- named after the founder 
of the academy -- will be presented to Hank Rieger, longtime editor and 
publisher of Emmy magazine. He was also my boss at the UPI Los Angeles bureau 
earlier in the century and, as I recall, always paid off my expense account on 
time. There is no higher praise. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday's televised Emmy broadcast, the heavy favorite, of course, is ABC's 
"NYPD Blue," which earned 26 nominations, more than any weekly series in TV 
history. Other leading contenders with double-digit nominations include HBO's 
"And the Band Played On," NBC's "Seinfeld" and "Frasier" and CBS' "Gypsy" and 
"Picket Fences," which won last year's top honors. 
</P>
<P>
 A large number of nominations is by no means a guarantee of awards. Series 
such as "Northern Exposure," "Miami Vice" and "Moonlighting" racked up numerous 
nominations, only to be blitzed when the actual prize-giving took place. 
However, shows produced by Steven Bochco -- and "NYPD Blue" is one of them -- 
tend to deliver. Bochco's "Hill Street Blues" and "L.A. Law" are the all-time 
leaders in the best drama series category, with four Emmys apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest we forget -- and it's very easy to forget Emmy winners -- last year's 
series victors included "Seinfeld" for comedy and "Picket Fences" for drama. 
Winners for best leading comedy actor and actress were Ted Danson for "Cheers" 
and Roseanne for "Rose- anne." In drama, it was Tom Skerritt and Kathy Baker, 
both of "Picket Fences."

FUN COUPLES, RAUNCH 'N' ROLL; POP MUSIC: THE MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS HAS MORE 
CHEEK AND STAR POWER IN ITS RETURN TO NEW YORK. BUT IT IS STILL PLENTY TACKY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oh, so now they get it right. 
</P>
<P>
 It figures that, after several years' worth of increasingly dull MTV Video 
Music Awards ceremonies in Los Angeles -- shows that lived up to their hype 
primarily in the vulgarity department -- the move back to New York's Radio City 
Music Hall would produce a telecast Thursday night that was cheeky, cocky, 
catty and heavyweight-studded enough that you might have actually wished to 
have been there. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as one of the Beastie Boys said, heavily disguised and unexpectedly 
charging the podium at a moment when R.E.M. was supposed to be accepting an 
award, "I just want to tell everyone that this is a farce . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly. And, this time, an almost thoroughly absorbing one. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it was the slightest bit less tacky than the less watchable telecasts 
of recent years. Setting the tone and grossly funny almost in spite of her 
arbitrarily timed gag readings was Roseanne -- finally, a host as legitimately 
irreverent as they wanna be. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, who wouldn't be a gas compared to party-pooping MTV Awards hosts of 
the past like retired perennial Arsenio Hall or especially last year's 
Christian Slater, who gave new meaning to the phrase "money for nothing"? 
</P>
<P>
 Squawked Roseanne, talking up the merits of Manhattan in her opening 
monologue: "It's safe to walk the streets -- especially tonight, because a lot 
of the really dangerous criminals are backstage." 
</P>
<P>
 Things kicked off with this year's designated Pee-wee Moment (and least 
well-kept secret in show business): a brief, royalty-like appearance by Mr. and 
Mrs. Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just think, nobody thought this would last," said Jackson. The former Lisa 
Marie Presley alternately squirmed like a trapped animal and smiled nervously 
before Michael engaged her in the most torrid clinch to burn up the television 
screen since, well, his incendiary video smooch with Iman. 
</P>
<P>
 After all the buildup, the Jacksons' awkward kickoff wasn't much to write 
Neverland about. But it was at least a setup for the show's best punch line, 
nearly 3 1/2 hours later, when final presenter Madonna was escorted out on 
stage by sometimes-sparring-partner David Letterman and announced, "And just 
think, nobody thought this would last." 
</P>
<P>
 There was more gutter-sniping to go around here than in a good episode of 
"Melrose Place." In a battle of the singularly named Titans, Roseanne used her 
monologue to make a nasty crack about famously Republican VJ Kennedy providing 
special sexual services for Rush Limbaugh; Kennedy generously returned the 
favor later on, and Roseanne served the vulgar volley back once more. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-lowest shot: Comic Denis Leary asking his co-presenter, Naomi Campbell, 
"So Naomi, are U2 up for an award this year?" -- referring to her ex-fiancee's 
(bassist Adam Clayton) band. Her blank expression hardly shifted, but the 
super-model was clearly super-peeved. 
</P>
<P>
 It's long been commonly held that the performances are infinitely more 
significant than the trophies at MTV's annual blowout. Said truism still 
applies, but '94 may be the year in which it can finally be said that the 
cutting ad-libs have become more talked about than the performances. 
</P>
<P>
 This, despite the fact that the web has never before assembled such a pantheon 
of rock bigwigs to perform and that, although none of the resulting showcases 
was stunning, almost all the live appearances were strong and flavorful. 
</P>
<P>
 Best was a literally back-to-back presentation of Top 10 punk revivalists 
Green Day and the Beastie Boys. A short, furiously tight number by the Green 
party -- replete with head-twitching, eye-bulging, gasket-like strumming and 
Billy Zoom stances -- ended with the revolving stage set turning to reveal the 
Beasties. The latter hip-hopsters were in their rock 'n' roll band incarnation, 
and in suits, skinny ties and sunglasses, with Adam Horovitz goonily howling 
"Sabotage" like Jerry Lewis fronting the Reservoir Dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen ranked highest on MTV's coup list, 
but didn't provide especially chat-worthy moments. Mick did a mighty job of 
pretending to still mean it, so perhaps it was having the Stones' randy 
two-song set so soon after Aerosmith's opening number that made it seem like 
deja vu all over again. And Bruce's "Streets of Philadelphia" isn't exactly a 
showcase for his live wares, nor its AIDS theme and somber tone exactly fitting 
for a telecast this determinedly classless. 
</P>
<P>
 The weakest performance spot was Boyz II Men's reading of their No. 1 "I'll 
Make Love to You," which served to prove once more that unworthy couplets like 
"Throw your clothes on the floor / I'm gonna take my clothes off too, yeah" 
become triply comic belted out with gospel-style intensity and earnestness. But 
the little girls understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Continents away in every sense was a standout appearance by the ridiculous, 
bouffant-adorned Russian cover band the Leningrad Cowboys, with the 70-member 
Red Army Ensemble, doing an incongruous cast-of-thousands version of "Sweet 
Home Alabama" that was like a bad dream. 
</P>
<P>
 This had to be nearly as confusing to the audience as Beastie Boy Adam Yauch 
rushing the stage -- disguised as an errant Swede -- during Michael Stipe's 
acceptance speech and uttering crazed ramblings. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Stipe -- whose "Everybody Hurts" video really did deserve the four 
professional-ballot awards it picked up, and the three general-ballot ones that 
Aerosmith's "Cryin' " won too -- didn't know what hit him. Neither did we, but 
in its own absurd and tasteless white-trash-takes-over-Art-Deco way, this 
year's show at least felt like rock 'n' roll.

GIVE THEM LIBERTY OR DEBT; POP MUSIC: PROMOTERS LOYAL TO INDEPENDENT'S DAY, A 
SHOWCASE OF LOCAL ALTERNATIVE BANDS, ARE NOW FREE TO HOLD THE EVENT AFTER A 
DISAGREEMENT WITH THE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The plug that got pulled on "Independent's Day '94" over the Fourth of July 
weekend is being reconnected, and the daylong showcase for the local 
grass-roots, independent-alternative rock scene is now scheduled to go forward 
on Oct. 22 at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Fountain Valley promoters, Tony Cardullo and Jaime Munoz, tried to stage 
the ambitious event July 3 at Oak Canyon Ranch in Silverado Canyon, but they 
had to postpone it at the last minute after a permit disagreement with county 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are planning a much bigger show -- 60 bands, up from the original 30 
-- in hopes of washing away any bad taste from the earlier postponement and 
establishing Independent's Day as a regular event on the local-rock calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 "People felt burned" by the earlier postponement, Munoz said. "This is to 
prove ourselves, to show it was on the up-and-up, and it wasn't our fault." 
</P>
<P>
 The show will take place not in the amphitheater itself, but on four smaller 
stages set up on Irvine Meadows' town-green style concourse. The stages, each 
facing in a different direction, will be placed at the center of the 
oval-shaped green, which is ringed by a walkway and concession stands. Plans 
call for nine hours of nonstop music from 3 p.m. to midnight, with all four 
stages going simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardullo said about 40 bands have been confirmed so far, with at least 20 more 
expected by the day of the show. All the acts either release their own records 
or are signed to small, independent labels. Typically, they play in clubs that 
hold no more than 300 or 400 fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill is a wide-ranging sampler of the Orange County-Long Beach rock scene 
(promoters may add additional bands from Los Angeles and Riverside counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the bands confirmed so far are Sublime, One Hit Wonder, Standing 
Hawthorn, Uniform Choice, Primitive Painters, the Crowd, Humble Gods, Just 
Plain Big, Bitch Funky Sex Machine, Psychic Rain, Supernovice, Vitamin L, 
Gameface and the Grabbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardullo said that he and Munoz, who operate as Taurus Enterprises, need to 
draw at least 2,500 people -- half capacity for the concourse -- to break even. 
Tickets from the July 3 event will be honored; Cardullo said about 900 people 
kept their tickets rather then take refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While the Taurus partners, both 25, have mainly promoted in local clubs, they 
previously have produced two bigger shows: a reggae festival in Long Beach and 
a ska-rock show in Colton. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual twist, all bands will donate their performances, even though 
Independent's Day is primarily a for-profit event (the promoters say they will 
give 15% of any profits to charity). 
</P>
<P>
 Cardullo said the bands are willing to play for free to help make possible a 
large-scale event that will draw more fans and call more attention to the local 
scene than their normal run of club gigs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chance to be seen by more than 300 people at Club Mesa," Cardullo 
said, adding that Taurus will invite "every A & R rep (record company talent 
scout) in L.A. Because we are taking the risk, we haven't had any complaints 
from the bands that are playing for free." 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters say the original festival was canceled after they learned that the 
permit covering the Silverado Canyon site did not allow for tickets to be sold 
at the gate, and that county officials were not going to issue a special permit 
to save the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The promoters led a protest at the Sheriff's Department on the day of the 
aborted show. Cardullo contends that county officials wanted the plug pulled 
because they were put off by the idea of an alternative-rock show, and by such 
provocative band names as Bitch Funky Sex Machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taurus partners had hoped to donate some of the profits to the Orangewood 
Children's Home for abused children, but controversy over some of the band 
names and the musical style apparently has prompted the county-operated 
facility to distance itself from the rescheduled Independent's Day show. 
</P>
<P>
 One Orangewood official, who asked not to be named, said that the facility's 
board was leery of being associated with a concert involving punk rock or 
heavy-metal bands, and because "in terms of the band names it wasn't real 
appropriate for a children's organization." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Orangewood has been on the receiving end for many benefits by 
local grass-roots bands from the same rock scene that Independent's Day will 
showcase -- including annual Christmas benefits at Linda's Doll Hut in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taurus partners say they still plan to give 15% of any profits to a 
charity that helps abused and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets cost $20 at the gate, or $15 in advance. Outlets include Ticketmaster 
locations and phone charge (714) 740-2000, Bionic Records locations, and the 
Lab in Costa Mesa. Concert information: (714) 991-2055. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 BRANCHING OUT: On a smaller scale, the two Taurus partners next week will 
launch a Monday night series of grass-roots alternative rock shows at Music 
City in Fountain Valley. They have dubbed the series Funkpunkandjunk, and will 
inaugurate it Monday with a bill featuring Her Own Hands, Homegrown, Sketch, 
Birdbrain, Zoombuladelic and Humble Gods. 
</P>
<P>
 The series, open to fans 18 and older, continues with the Decline, Regression, 
Circushead, Fungus Mungus, Crimson Sky and One Eye Open on Sept. 19, Thirteen, 
Iron-ons, Windowpane, Perfect Sunday, Supernovice and Tremolo on Sept. 26 and 
Her Own Hands, Peace Corp., I Found God, the Scenes, Twister and Just Plain Big 
on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Music City is at 18774 Brookhurst St. Shows start at 9 p.m., with tickets $7. 
(714) 991-2055. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardullo also has begun co-hosting, with deejay Danny, a weekly Friday night 
radio program devoted to the Southern California independent-music scene. 
Dubbed "OCX Indi Radio," it made its debut Sept. 2 on KWIZ, 96.7-FM. The 
hourlong show runs from midnight Friday to 1 a.m. Saturday. The producers 
record it in advance and air it in time bought from the radio station.

LIGHTENING UP THE DARK SIDE; BLUE OYSTER CULT COULD TAKE A JOKE -- BUT THE BAND 
SURVIVED ANYWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

 Ear-torturing decibel levels, flash pots and smoke machines. Blackleather 
jackets, satanic imagery and allusions to death. Beavis and Butt-head would 
almost certainly walk around sporting Blue Oyster Cult T-shirts were they old 
enough to remember the group's heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first of the hard-rock groups to revel in the Gothic side of metal, 
Blue Oyster Cult, which appears tonight at the Coach House, is forefather of 
such groups as Judas Priest, Iron Maiden and Danzig. But what set the Cult 
apart from latter-day Lucifer lovers was its essential, satirical nature. While 
the group's fascist/hellfire vibe was an integral element of its image, Blue 
Oyster Cult paid homage to the dark side with tongue firmly in cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt that the depth of our humor was unappreciated," guitarist 
Donald (Buck Dharma) Roeser said recently from a Houston motel room.  
</P>
<P>
 Roeser, 46, expressed regret at taking on the Dharma pseudonym early in his 
career, and that most people didn't get what the band was really all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that music fans don't want too much humor in their music, otherwise 
bands like the Tubes would have been huge because they were really great," he 
said. "People don't seem to dig it; they don't want the bands to make fun of 
what they're doing. They take it very seriously, which surprises me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like stuff that's hilarious, myself. People are always asking me, 'Are you 
guys really a cult? Are you devil worshipers?' Of course, we're not, but people 
don't want to hear that." 
</P>
<P>
 In its way, Blue Oyster Cult was equally influential on such groups as the 
Dictators, the Ramones and Twisted Sister, who added a healthy, campy dose of 
n'yuk n'yuk to their outrageous, eardrum-busting musings. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Cult was a pioneering group in heavy metal and humor, it's not 
often mentioned by contemporary groups as an inspiration. Older groups with 
currently hipper reputations -- Black Sabbath and Alice Cooper, for example -- 
seem to get most of the lip service from today's metal merchants. Roeser feels 
the Cult deserves more credit for the areas it pioneered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I guess I look at BOC as an influence on other bands," he said. "But 
we're the kind of band that, when other bands get asked about influences, the 
name doesn't seem to be on the tip of their tongue." 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in Long Island in 1969, Blue Oyster Cult endured a number of 
record-company rejections under different names before eventually being signed 
by Columbia in 1971. Its commercial breakthrough came in 1976 with the 
gold-selling album "Agents of Fortune," which included the uncharacteristically 
mellow hit single, "Don't Fear the Reaper." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, its sound was out of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took a hiatus in the mid-'80s, then we re-formed because we had an offer 
to go to Greece," Roeser said of the brief break. "Then we ended up playing 
some shows in Germany and just sort of fell back into it to make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 The group -- now featuring original members Roeser, vocalist Eric Bloom and 
keyboardist Allen Lanier, along with drummer Chuck Burgi and bassist Jon Rogers 
-- recently released "Cult Classic" on Herald Records, a re-recorded collection 
of their best-known songs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed new versions of a couple of our old things," Roeser explained. 
"They used the new version of 'Reaper' in Stephen King's miniseries 'The 
Stand.' There's, like, a statute of limitations when you record for a major 
label that prevents you from re-recording your songs, but that's expired. We 
wanted to own our own versions of the songs. 'The Reaper,' 'Burning for You' 
and 'Godzilla' sound almost exactly like the originals, the other ones are 
pretty much the way we do them now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But isn't Roeser tired of playing the same material after all these years? 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be worse," he said. " 'The Reaper' is actually a good song, even 
today. For example, how would you like to have to go out and play 'Achy Breaky 
Heart' every night for the rest of your life? That would be torture." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cult is currently finishing up an album of all new material -- its first 
since 1989 -- for release next summer. Though Roeser remains enthusiastic about 
the project, he doesn't rule out a solo career in the future, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the first recording of the band with Chuck and Jon, and it 
sounds quite a bit different from classic BOC," he said. "We'll see if there's 
a market for it. I could be in BOC in one form or another for the rest of my 
life, that would be no problem. We kick more butt now than we did in the arena 
in the '80s. So many bands of our era are sorry shadows of what they once were, 
whereas our band is more muscular and energetic than it's ever been. People are 
surprised at how good we are. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, there's all sorts of stuff I'd like to do besides this, so 
we'll just wait and see what happens." 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; STRONG CAST A BONUS FOR THE UNPREDICTABLE 'TRIAL BY JURY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Trial by Jury," an absorbing and ingenious courtroom drama/lady-in-distress 
thriller, is all the more entertaining for having successfully made 
consistently plausible the increasingly improbable. It's the kind of film that 
requires star authority to bring it off, and it receives it in abundance from 
Joanne Whalley-Kilmer, in perhaps her best big-screen role since playing 
Christine Keeler in "Scandal," the 1989 retelling of Britain's Profumo affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Whalley-Kilmer is Valerie Alston, a beautiful Manhattan divorcee with a 
7-year-old son (Bryan Shilowich) and a SoHo antique clothing boutique. When 
she's selected to serve as a juror on the trial of a notorious gangster, Rusty 
Pirone (Armand Assante), charged with a raft of crimes, including 11 murders, 
she sees it as simply doing her duty as a good citizen. Yet almost immediately 
she is plunged into a nightmare, blackmailed by Pirone's henchman, led by 
cynical ex-cop Tommy Vesey (William Hurt), who threaten to harm her son if she 
not only doesn't find Pirone innocent but also if she fails to persuade enough 
of her colleagues to go along with her in order to create a hung jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Valerie should turn instantly to U.S. Atty. Daniel Graham (Gabriel 
Byrne) for protection, but Pirone's strategies are so diabolically terrifying, 
her decision not to is wholly and unsettlingly credible. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Jordan Katz and Heywood Gould and directed by Gould, whose first 
film was "One Good Cop" with Michael Keaton, "Trial by Jury" starts out as a 
solid, conventional genre piece only to turn unpredictable. Whereas Valerie's 
complex and seemingly endless ordeal could bring about a nervous breakdown or 
worse, it instead toughens her, her loss of innocence confronting her not only 
with some especially sordid and scary realities of life but also allowing her 
to discover capabilities within herself she initially would rather have never 
uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 It is entirely appropriate that Valerie deals in the glamorous gowns of the 
'40s and '50s, because when Whalley-Kilmer wears them she recalls the movie 
heroines of that era. You can easily imagine Barbara Stanwyck tearing into the 
role of Valerie under the direction of Douglas Sirk. What cinches the film's 
success is the exceptional support Whalley-Kilmer receives from her three 
leading men: Assante as the once icily repellent yet undeniably sexy Pirone 
(who must surely use John Gotti's tailor), Byrne as the fiery, determinedly 
idealistic Graham and Hurt as the coolly ambiguous Vesey, whose fall into 
Pirone's clutches is never properly explained but which is effectively papered 
over by Hurt's sheer presence. Also contributing strongly in smaller roles, 
among many others, are Kathleen Quinlan as a lethally tough villain and Stuart 
Whitman as Whalley-Kilmer's warm, loving father.

mid-level staff changes announced Friday.Two top staff members left after only 
one year at Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Chafin succeeds Ed Prohaska. Hired in July, 1993, Prohaska accepted a job

MUSIC REVIEW; NAGANO LEADS WORKMANLIKE BOWL CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In its third concert in as many nights, England's oldest orchestra, the 
visiting Halle Orchestra from Manchester, went about its duties in a thoroughly 
workmanlike fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Its conductor, too, the Morro Bay-born Kent Nagano, never much of one for 
rapturous flights of fancy or emotional excess anyway, clocked in with a 
resolutely professional job. 
</P>
<P>
 The program Thursday at Hollywood Bowl (before a crowd of 7,961) had not been 
put together with any particular care for themes and resonances. It listed 
Richard Strauss' "Don Juan," Stravinsky's Violin Concerto and Elgar's "Enigma" 
Variations. It was a difficult night for an experienced listener to be 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 In Strauss' swashbuckling tone poem, one missed the clash of foils and gush of 
romance that the composer so effectively captured. This was a generally tidy 
reading, muscular, hefty at climaxes, but also sluggish and by-the-numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Stravinsky's prickly Concerto, violinist Cho-Liang Lin was his usual cool, 
incisive, bracing self. He played with consistent point, powerful direction and 
steely virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Nagano ignored Stravinsky's explicit demands to pare down the 
orchestra -- around 60 strings were onstage to the composer's dictated 30, and 
in drastically different proportions -- so that the accompaniment just chugged 
along lackadaisically, and none too neatly. 
</P>
<P>
 With the "Enigma" Variations we seemed on terra firma; at least there was 
something approaching a true interpretation going on here. Nagano explored 
detail and nuance in his reading, flirting with inaudibility on occasion and, 
in his ethereal, unhurried lyricism, sometimes letting the pace sag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Halle, solid in all of its choirs though distinguished in none, responded 
alertly and amply. During the encore, Vaughan Williams' Fantasia on 
"Greensleeves," a car alarm went off and ruined it. How does one steal a car 
from stack parking, anyway? TIMOTHY MANGAN

THEATER REVIEW; EAST WEST'S 'SWEENEY TODD' REALIZES THE POSSIBILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attend the tale of East West Players -- the 99-seat theater that took on 
"Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Stephen Sondheim's 
masterwork. It's the musical with a plot like a steel trap and a thrilling, 
operatic score that embraces broad comedy, penny-dreadful gore and the height 
of human rage. Plus, it has a killer act-one finale, one of the best in the 
entire canon of American musicals.  
</P>
<P>
 Set in the grime and misery of late-19th-Century lower-class London, "Sweeney" 
tells the story of a much-wronged barber and Mrs. Lovett, the friendly neighbor 
who helpfully gives him the idea to butcher his customers and at the same time 
turn her sorry meat-pie shop into a thriving enterprise. The majority of the 
East West Players are Asian American, which necessitates a few cuts in the text 
and a change in a line about yellow hair to the oxymoronic "raven hair, like 
wheat." Other than that, it will never enter anyone's mind that East West isn't 
the little company that could. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Dang's direction is both deeply conversant with Hal Prince's seminal 1979 
staging for the huge Uris Theatre and also attuned to the possibilities of 
telling an intimate story, as Sondheim initially imagined it (the 
composer-lyricist adapted the story with Hugh Wheeler from British playwright 
Christopher Bond, who took his cue from an 1847 tale). The minimal 
choreography, though, is too corny for the piece. On Chris Tashima's 
three-tiered wood set, which is both simple and wonderfully complex, the actors 
move chunks of scaffolding, transforming the scene from a dock to a storefront 
to a parlor to a madhouse and more. They then sit down amid the scene they've 
created, representing the ever-present unemployed in a place where, as Mrs. 
Lovett says, "times is hard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barely obscured by a curtain, four musicians (three on keyboard, one 
percussion) handle the magnificent music with love and energy. As an ensemble, 
the cast sings well, although individual performances cobble the score 
somewhat. Orville Mendoza sings Sweeney better than he acts it, but his 
powerful build and silent seething are effective, particularly when he strikes 
a tableau, holding his razor out, like a Greek statue representing the 
archetypal attitude of revenge. As Mrs. Lovett, Freda Foh Shen acts better than 
she sings, and her unceasing cheerfulness in the face of (or possibly because 
of) all the gore is just right. In the secondary parts, there are two 
outstanding performances: Radmar Agana Jao's touching, funny Tobias, the young 
urchin whom Mrs. Lovett takes under her wing (so to speak), and Linda 
Igarashi's Johanna, a boilerplate ingenue that she makes fresh and vital. This 
is especially impressive because Paul Wong, as her lover Anthony, is hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, East West makes "Sweeney" come to life. Although it is a world 
so cruel that even songbirds are blinded because "not knowing day from night, 
they sing without stopping," it is a world infinitely worth knowing. This 
"Sweeney" sings with all its heart.

TV REVIEW; 'BOYS' AN AMIABLE OUTING FOR 2 SITCOM VETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS opens its fall season Sunday with the premiere of an amiable comedy series 
starring Hal Linden and Suzanne Pleshette as a couple in advanced middle-age 
whose lives are turned topsy-turvy when their adult sons move back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Although its premise is formulaic -- unexpected move-ins that produce 
lifestyle clashes are a sitcom cliche -- "The Boys Are Back" is executed with 
some skill, benefiting from patches of amusing writing that exploit the 
considerable craft of its two name stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Having finally emptied their house of offspring by sending their youngest son 
off to college, Fred and Jackie Hansen envision a self-indulgent life free of 
parental worries and responsibilities. Fred even dreams of hitting the high 
seas with his boat. 
</P>
<P>
 But the solitude is short-lived when their two other sons barge in. First 
comes out-of-work Mike (George Newbern), moving back with his wife and three 
young kids until he can find another job. Then comes Rick (Kevin Crowley), a 
policeman who needs a place to stay after his wife has kicked him out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Boys Are Back" is at its worst when Mike's noisy kids are around, at its 
best when the two older brothers interact with each other and their parents. 
Rick: "Mom, have you seen my handcuffs?" Jackie: "They're in your sock drawer." 
</P>
<P>
 Although nothing to build an evening around, it's a pleasing start for a 
comedy that, unlike the preponderance of its rookie counterparts, at least has 
the potential to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Boys Are Back" premieres at 8 p.m. Sunday, then will be seen Wednesdays 
at 8 p.m. on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

JAZZ REVIEW; COMPLEX IMPROVISATIONS FROM LOVANO'S QUARTET AT THE BAKERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Lovano must have a lot of confidence in the receptivity of his audiences. 
His one-nighter at the Jazz Bakery Thursday night made very few concessions to 
easy listening. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based tenor saxophonist, one of the premier jazz men of the '90s, 
has worked in a variety of styles, with players as diverse as John Scofield, 
Bill Frisell and Charlie Haden. But the music of his own quartets leans heavily 
in the direction of dense, unrelentingly complex improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 An opening original, "Song and Dance," for example, began with an appealingly 
boppish, start-and-stop melody. But the line was almost immediately set aside 
for extended soloing by Lovano, trumpeter Tim Hagans and bassist Darek 
Oleszkiewicz . Other tunes, despite such deceptively lyrical titles as "Birds 
of Spring in Time Gone By" and "Miss Etna," similarly served as springboards 
for individual improvisations. Much of it was impressive, with Lovano 
occasionally coloring his solos with bristling, avant-garde noise components 
and stratospheric upper harmonics. On a rare ballad, "This Is Always," he 
allowed a few touches of lyricism to sneak into his chorus. 
</P>
<P>
 What was missing throughout, however, was a sense of group interactivity. 
Hagans and Lovano work together regularly, but Oleszkiewicz and drummer Carmen 
Castaldi are West Coast players added for this engagement. Although both are 
skilled musicians, the quality of their participation was understandably 
defined, and limited, by a minimal amount of rehearsal time. 
</P>
<P>
 But the music Lovano plays -- with its intricate improvising and multilayered 
rhythms -- is at its best when there is a familiar, intuitive interplay among 
the musicians. Unlimited by compositional restrictions, the music gains its 
structure from a kind of spontaneous group creativity. And too often, on 
Thursday night, that group creativity was simply not present. DON HECKMAN

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ENJOYABLE LIVE SHOW BY NEW RUTLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Nasty was the "smart" Rutle -- the one who scandalized the rock world when 
he claimed the band was bigger than God (he actually said bigger than Rod , as 
in Stewart). 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds familiar, you get the idea of the Monty Python/"Saturday Night 
Live" hybrid the Rutles, the 1978 mockumentary on the four lads from Rutland 
that's become a cult favorite. The man who portrayed Ron Nasty in the film and 
created the Rutles' music carries some strong cult credentials himself: Neil 
Innes of the '60s madcap group the Bonzo Dog Band. 
</P>
<P>
 All these cults collided when Innes/Nasty brought his New Rutles to the 
Troubadour on Thursday -- the first-ever live performance by any Rutles and an 
exceedingly rare appearance by the impish musician. 
</P>
<P>
 The genius of Innes' Rutles songs is the way they flirt with their sources 
while maintaining their own identity. They sound like Beatles songs from a 
parallel universe. The music (the soundtrack has been reissued in CD by Rhino 
Records) is as playful as it is rigorous, and, while it spoofs the Beatles 
oeuvre, it tweaks rather than skewers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Troubadour, the New Rutles (L.A. Beatles tribute group the MopTops) and 
Innes, singing in his eerily Lennon-like voice, essayed their whole history. 
The early singles were lively and buoyant, and the nine-piece Rutland Symphony 
Orchestra lent texture to such psychedelic experiments as "Cheese and Onions." 
Keyboardist Gregg Phillinganes sat in as the Billy Prestonesque Desmond Little. 
</P>
<P>
 The real revelation was how much pleasure the music provided on its own terms. 
There were no Python/Bonzo antics, just a real band playing real, enjoyable pop 
music and getting a perceptible charge out of the packed crowd's response. More 
than reconfiguring the technical components of Beatles songs, Innes summoned 
their heart and spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ron Nasty & the New Rutles play tonight at the Troubadour, 9081 Santa Monica 
Blvd., West Hollywood, 9 p.m. $12.50. (310) 276-6168. RICHARD CROMELIN

WITNESSES RECANT TESTIMONY, FREE DEATH ROW INMATE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Death Row inmate awaiting retrial was freed Thursday, two months after the 
main witnesses against him recanted their testimony and one confessed to the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Burrows, who was sentenced to death five years ago, was released on a 
recognizance bond and given a send-off by his fellow inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Burrows, 41, was one of three people convicted of killing William Dulin in 
1988. The other two -- Gayle Potter and Ralph Frye -- received lighter 
sentences in exchange for their testimony. But Potter and Frye recanted their 
testimony during a July hearing. Potter said she alone killed Dulin. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a Circuit Court judge overturned Burrows' conviction and ordered a 
new trial.

CASE AGAINST ABORTION DOCTOR IS REOPENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT and VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Medical Board of California on Friday reopened the case of a Los Angeles 
abortion doctor whose license was suspended for one year for negligence in the 
deaths of two patients, at the request of officials who now want to revoke the 
license altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual order came at the request of the state Attorney General's office 
and medical board Executive Director Dixon Arnett, who urged panel members to 
consider harsher action against Dr. Leo F. Kenneally. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneally reputedly has performed more abortions than any other doctor in the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one month ago, the board agreed with a decision by an administrative law 
judge to suspend Kenneally's license for one year and place him on probation 
for another 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In recommending the disciplinary action, Administrative Law Judge Milford A. 
Maron found that Kenneally at times was guilty of gross negligence and 
incompetence. But he also called Kenneally "an unselfish and committed 
provider, serving the poor in a community that is grossly underserved 
medically." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneally, who has performed an estimated 100,000 abortions over a decade for 
low fees, operates clinics under the name Her Medical Clinics in Central Los 
Angeles and in Pacoima.  
</P>
<P>
 Two young women died after undergoing abortions at the Los Angeles clinic, 
allegedly because of gross negligence and incompetence in conditions that 
Arnett described as, "in my view, the most egregious violations of the Medical 
Practice Act that I have seen." 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Jay Hartz, who represents Kenneally, said a medical expert 
contends that the patients died of natural causes. "To hold Dr. Kenneally 
responsible for these deaths is just ridiculous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartz demanded the removal of Arnett and accused him of politicizing the 
medical board's review of physicians, charging that the board is giving in to 
anti-abortion activists who are trying to strip abortion doctors such as 
Kenneally of their right to practice. According to Maron, Kenneally probably 
has performed more abortions than any other solo provider in California. 
</P>
<P>
 But Arnett, who described himself as a supporter of abortion rights, 
discounted that argument, saying, "The issue is not abortion, but public 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartz said the medical board's retreat from its earlier decision makes him 
"distrustful -- and undermines the board's credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board is afraid of its own shadow," Hartz said. "It's a weak 
board, and anytime anybody blinks at it, it's going to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint filed by the Attorney General's office against Kenneally accuses 
him of failing to properly care for a 22-year-old asthmatic woman who suffered 
a seizure during an abortion in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of halting the procedure to respond to the medical emergency, the 
complaint said, Kenneally continued to perform the abortion. The woman was 
later taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second case, the complaint said, Kenneally neglected to summon 
paramedics promptly when an 18-year-old patient stopped breathing and went into 
cardiac arrest in 1987. Again, he continued with the abortion instead of 
stopping to treat her life-threatening symptoms, the complaint said. The woman 
died in a hospital 58 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint also cited five other cases in which the doctor was accused of 
mishandling abortions that resulted in severe loss of blood, permanent 
sterilization or other injuries. He also was accused of administering drugs up 
to three times the recommended dosages. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the board's order to reconsider the case, Kenneally -- who was 
to have ceased practicing at 5 p.m Friday when his license suspension began -- 
can continue to perform abortions until a new decision is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 A closed hearing probably will be held in February after board members have 
had time to review up to 38 boxes of documents recording the case, Arnett said.

COST GAP BETWEEN RAIL PLANS NARROWED; TRANSPORTATION: ELEVATED LINE WOULD STILL 
BE $19 MILLION CHEAPER THAN SUBWAY, ACCORDING TO COST ANALYSIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Building a subway across the San Fernando Valley would be far less expensive 
than originally estimated, but an elevated railway above the Ventura Freeway 
would still be at least $19 million cheaper, according to a cost-comparison 
analysis released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited report narrowed -- but did not eliminate -- the price 
advantage that a freeway elevated line would have over a subway running 15 
miles east and west through the center of the Valley, two different approaches 
that have been angrily debated for more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the document, analysts conclude that new technology, lower construction 
costs and alternate station designs would reduce the cost of a subway system by 
more than $750 million from the original price tage of $3.03 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, alternative construction techniques would also cut the cost 
of the elevated freeway line, saving about $340 million. The freeway route 
would therefore cost $2.25 billion, compared to about $2.27 billion for the 
underground system. 
</P>
<P>
 The minimum difference -- $19 million -- was alternately trumpeted as 
significant and dismissed as trivial Friday as both sides in the debate geared 
up for an intense lobbying campaign that is expected to culminate in a showdown 
next month before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not a big difference. It's not the $400-million (difference) or the 
other numbers that were thrown around," county Supervisor Ed Edelman said, 
referring to projections made by transit planners three years ago. "This makes 
the two lines virtually . . . identical in terms of cost," said Edelman, a 
supporter of the subway system, which would parallel Chandler and Burbank 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disagreement came from fellow Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who wants to build 
an elevated system above the Ventura Freeway median -- often called a monorail 
by supporters, although the design has not been agreed on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very glad to see that the monorail's cost savings have been verified by 
this independent report," said Antonovich, who in the past has asserted that 
cost alone would decide the issue for the MTA, which had a $300-million budget 
deficit this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, transit officials tapped the subway as the preferred mode, 
envisioning a seamless ride from downtown Los Angeles to Warner Center along 
the Metro Rail Red Line. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision was reversed two years later after analysts estimated that 
the cost of an underground route would exceed the elevated freeway alternative 
by $442 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, officials have put off a final decision pending further studies, 
the most important of which was the independent cost comparison released 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The report said that recessionary drops in real estate prices and in 
construction costs have pushed down the price of both options. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Red Line extension, substantial savings could also be achieved by 
building open-trench rather than traditional enclosed stations, which would 
boost the subway cost to $175 million more than an elevated freeway line. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich said such open-air stations would break the MTA's promise to local 
residents to build enclosed stations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Mahfet, one of the chairmen of a coalition of homeowner and business 
groups that favor the subway, said he would accept the open-trench idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue isn't technology. The issue is the route," Mahfet said. He contends 
that more traffic would be diverted from the Ventura Freeway and its 
surrounding area by running a rail line along Burbank and Chandler boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 He criticized the freeway-median route, saying residents would be reluctant to 
use it if they have to get off the train at the eastern terminus and somehow 
get to the already planned North Hollywood Red Line station to board a 
different train to Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 However, supporters of the elevated line note that it would boast 15 stations, 
compared to the subway's 10, and would be closer to heavily traveled Ventura 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to cater to more people," said Bill Korek of the Citizens 
Committee for Monorail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cost-comparison report said a new Caltrans mandate that the MTA pay to 
widen the freeway by 34 feet to make room for the elevated railway would cost 
$240 million. But the added cost would be more than compensated by adopting 
different building techniques, such as performing some construction and 
assembly off-site, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 All figures are in 1998 dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA Board of Directors was originally due to decide the Valley rail issue 
this month. But the potential absence of key figures in the debate, including 
Antonovich, means that the question will probably be taken up at next month's 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy has already given rise to political power plays between 
Edelman and Antonovich, the officials most outspoken on the issue. In June, 
Antonovich tried to muscle Edelman out of his turn to assume the chairmanship 
of the MTA board, trying to take the job himself. Antonovich argued that 
continuity would be better served by electing him over Edelman, who is 
scheduled to retire in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA chairman has the power to control the amount of time accorded each 
side in the debate before the board and can determine whether a vote is taken 
quickly or delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the MTA board elected Edelman as its chairman, but in a compromise 
picked Antonovich to serve out the remainder of the yearlong term after 
Edelman's retirement.

LEGACY OF A RHINESTONE COWBOY; FASHION: A DECADE AFTER THE DEATH OF NUDIE, 
TAILOR TO THE WESTERN STARS, HIS WIDOW IS CLOSING UP HIS CELEBRATED SHOP.

<P>
 At the dawn of his career, Roy Rogers realized he'd need to outfit himself in 
some truly fancy duds if he was going to impress the folks who caught his act 
in a traveling rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 The arenas were so large that Rogers, galloping around the ring on his horse, 
Trigger, just didn't stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 So he went to see Nudie, a Los Angeles tailor who was hoping to make it big 
designing outfits for movie stars. Nudie was experimenting with a revolutionary 
Western look, and he made Rogers a flashy Western suit with long fringes and 
hundreds of tiny, glittering rhinestones. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, when the spotlight found him, Rogers was transformed into a 
dazzling spectacle that made him impossible to miss. 
</P>
<P>
 The client was happy, and Nudie was well on his way to becoming the tailor to 
the Western movie stars.  
</P>
<P>
 Nudie made John Wayne's boots. Elvis Presley wore a $10,000 gold lame suit 
designed by Nudie on the cover of his album, "50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be 
Wrong." The gaudy costume worn by Robert Redford in "The Electric Horseman" was 
a Nudie creation. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nudie died in 1984 at age 81, his widow, Bobbie, took over his legacy, 
Nudie's Rodeo Tailors Inc., a Western-wear shop that has been at the same 
location on Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood since 1963.  
</P>
<P>
 Bobbie, now 81, says she's ready to retire. She will close the 
6,600-square-foot store that has become a museum of sorts on Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to dissolve it while I'm still living and not leave it to someone 
else," she said. "I don't know what they would do with it after I'm gone." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, longtime customers recalled Nudie's as a genuinely glamorous part 
of the motion-picture industry and bemoaned its passing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry to see it go, really," said Bob Musselwhite of Irvine, who has been 
a customer for 20 years. "They've had some beautiful stuff in here, and these 
are some very, very nice people." 
</P>
<P>
 Nudie's will not pass unnoticed. Calls for media interviews have come from 
around the nation this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was CNN, they want to come in on the 14th," announced Nudie's 
granddaughter, Jamie Nudie, who works at the store, after a call this week.  
</P>
<P>
 Friends, family and customers alike recall Nudie as a charismatic figure, 
outgoing and fun-loving, who made friends easily. Jamie recalled how Nudie 
would sometimes stroll the store serenading customers on his mandolin. 
</P>
<P>
 He presented a grand spectacle tooling around Los Angeles in his white, custom 
1975 El Dorado convertible, replete with steer horns mounted on the hood, a 
dashboard inlaid with 300 silver dollars and a cowboy-style rifle mounted on 
the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very proud when he got in that car," said Musselwhite with a chuckle. 
"He thought he was the king of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Nudie, born in Russia, emigrated to Brooklyn, N.Y., when he was 11, his wife 
said. His full name was Nudie Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned to box and became a prizefighter, which offered him the opportunity 
to travel. He met Bobbie in her hometown of Mankato, Minn., and the two 
married, then moved to California in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the store was beginning to take on a vacant look, as shelves 
began to empty. Bobbie was hoping to sell the photographs -- about 1,900 in all 
-- to a single collector who would put them in a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like he was here," she said. "He is everywhere, he is in pictures. 
This is what he created."

PROBATION URGED FOR DOCTOR; COURTS: JUDGE SAYS PHYSICIAN WHOSE GIRLFRIEND DIED 
FROM COCAINE HE SUPPLIED SHOULD NOT LOSE LICENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has recommended six years of probation for a Sherman Oaks 
emergency-room doctor who admitted abusing drugs for 20 years and supplying 
cocaine to a girlfriend who died of a massive overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Board of California had sought to revoke or suspend Dr. Stanley 
Azen's physician's license, charging him with gross negligence in the death of 
Donna Lynn Miller, 28. She suffered seizures and died at Azen's $400,000 former 
Westside home after they took cocaine together in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written opinion made public Friday, state Administrative Law Judge 
Richard E. Ranger said although Azen failed to get treatment after he became 
addicted to drugs and improperly tried to revive Miller by himself, he should 
not lose his license. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger said there was no evidence Azen, 43, was impaired by drugs when he 
performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Miller or that he "intentionally 
permitted Donna to die." The judge said Azen passed numerous random drug tests 
while on probation for a 1991 cocaine-possession conviction and no longer uses 
illicit drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger's recommendation still must be reviewed by the state medical board, 
which usually ratifies a judge's opinion in such cases, a board spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger's recommended discipline contrasted with the punishment meted out to 
Azen last year by the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which revoked his 
permit to prescribe pain-killing narcotics, triggering his dismissal from 
Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley. DEA permits are considered 
crucial for emergency-room physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen's attorney, Robert Beswick, was delighted with Ranger's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 "No downtime is amazing," he said. "I thought they'd get him for at least six 
months" of suspension. The deputy state attorney general who prosecuted Azen, 
Robert McKim Bell, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Azen worked for 10 years in the emergency room at the Medical Center of North 
Hollywood and later was employed for three years as an ER physician at 
Pacifica. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his legal problems, Azen won high praise from several physicians he 
has worked with. They described him as an excellent doctor who was deeply 
committed to caring for low-income patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger's 15-page opinion, however, made no mention of those accolades. The 
judge concluded simply that "the public interest would not be disserved" by 
placing Azen on probation and allowing him to prescribe narcotics only in a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In legal hearings, Azen admitted he began experimenting with cocaine and 
marijuana in the 1970s and became "a regular cocaine user" in the 1980s, 
spending up to $2,000 per month on the drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said he never used cocaine while on duty. But a longtime friend told 
state investigators the physician had "a high tolerance" for cocaine and used 
it to stay awake at work. In 1987, Azen was working up to 90 hours a week at 
the North Hollywood hospital, earning $240,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 After Miller moved in with him, Azen's former Westside house became a 
gathering spot for their friends, who often barbecued, played volleyball and 
used drugs together for days on end, Azen testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen described Miller as a drug addict and alcoholic. Although she was working 
as a medical auditor when they met, the physician said she was unemployed and 
"dysfunctional" just prior to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 After having drinks, taking cocaine and having sex with Azen on the night of 
Sept. 20, 1990, Miller suffered two seizures in bed. Azen said he performed CPR 
but could not revive her. Cocaine can induce seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller died of a cocaine overdose, and experts testified that her body 
contained four times a fatal dose of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said she had only "one or two lines" of cocaine with him that night, and 
Ranger said it was unclear how such a large amount of cocaine entered her 
system. But the judge noted that Miller, without Azen's knowledge, had acquired 
a key to the home safe where the doctor stored his cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 After Miller's second seizure, Azen said he performed CPR for 30 minutes 
before calling paramedics. Ranger said Azen was guilty of gross negligence for 
not summoning emergency help earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months after Miller's death, Azen was arrested by Los Angeles police 
for allegedly selling cocaine to Miller's sister Debbie. He later was convicted 
of possessing cocaine and sentenced to three years of probation, including 180 
days in jail and a $50 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said that following his arrest, he decided to kick his drug habit and 
entered a Los Angeles outpatient clinic of the Betty Ford Center. He underwent 
counseling and passed 38 random drug tests. He said he has not used illicit 
drugs in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was convicted of cocaine possession, Azen's Westside home and Jeep 
Cherokee were seized under federal anti-drug asset-forfeiture laws. The Jeep 
was later returned. 
</P>
<P>
 In revoking Azen's license to prescribe narcotics, the Drug Enforcement 
Administration said in a written decision that it was "inconsistent with the 
public interest" for him to keep his certificate, given his long history of 
drug abuse. Azen has appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the permit was revoked March 3, Azen continued to work at Pacifica 
without it until May 15, when questions about the permit led to his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Azen said patients were never affected because he was able to get controlled 
drugs from the hospital pharmacy, which has its own DEA certificate.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; SENIOR WOMEN WORK OUT FOR HEALTH STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it sweatin' with the oldies. 
</P>
<P>
 Three times a week, 50 golden girls meet in a gym at Northridge Medical 
Center. They are old enough to be grandmothers, or even great-grandmothers. But 
over the next 12 months, they will work out more than many women half their 
age: three times a week for an hour each day. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cal State Northridge professor will monitor their progress, hoping to learn 
more about the cardiovascular capacity of older women in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 50 women volunteered to participate in the study that began last week 
under the direction of Steven Loy, who teaches exercise physiology at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
 Loy also hopes to determine whether some exercises are better than others at 
improving the women's cardiovascular fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 He has divided them into three groups, one that will use stair-climbing 
machines exclusively, another that will only do walking drills and another that 
will lift weights. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is patterned after one Loy did several years ago with college women. 
In that study, Loy compared the effects of running on a treadmill to stair 
climbing, which involves walking up rotating steps similar to an escalator. 
</P>
<P>
 After 12 weeks, Loy found that the college women who exercised on StairClimber 
machines three times a week showed significant cardiovascular improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 He later conducted a similar study targeting middle-age women and got with 
similar results. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Loy wants to prove that the same exercises can "improve the quality of 
everyday life" for elderly women, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 June Davis, 70, of Northridge said she wants to be in the study to build 
muscle strength. Since being diagnosed with muscular dystrophy 20 years ago, 
Davis has only been able to engage in minimal physical activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many (senior) women have health problems these days," she said. "This 
study is giving me the chance to improve my condition now and hopefully lessen 
my chances of getting another physical disease." 
</P>
<P>
 At 83, Granada Hills resident Bo-Ching Tong is the oldest participant in the 
study. Tong said she signed up to build up her leg muscles.  
</P>
<P>
 "I used to teach tap dancing when I was younger," she said. "Who knows? Maybe 
when the study is over I can start teaching again." ALICIA DOYLE

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; POLICE SEEK HELP FINDING STALKER SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale police asked for the public's help Friday in finding a man who 
stalked an 8-year-old girl for 30 minutes at the Glendale Galleria last 
weekend, then tried unsuccessfully to kidnap her. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, described as a Latino or Asian man in his late 20s to early 30s, 
is wanted on attempted kidnaping and attempted molestation charges. 
</P>
<P>
 He probably failed to lure the girl out of the mall only because the child 
knew to tell him "that her mother warned her not to go with strangers," police 
Sgt. Jon Perkins said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "With every convincing statement that he made, she responded in the same way," 
Perkins said. "She was very adamant about that." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police reports, the girl and her mother, who live in Los Angeles, 
were on a shopping trip to the mall last Saturday. The man first approached the 
girl while she was walking through the mall, brushing his hand against her 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 11:45 a.m., the girl left her mother's side in the Nordstrom 
department store's cosmetics section to go get a lid for a drink her mother had 
just bought her at a nearby espresso counter, authorities said. The man 
allegedly approached her again and asked her, "Do you want to take a walk with 
me?" and asked the girl where her mother was. He grabbed the girl's hand and 
tried to take her with him, but she broke away, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Police released a composite sketch of the man that was based on the 
recollections of the girl's mother, who said she remembered the man walking 
past her and smiling at her earlier that day, and a Nordstrom employee who 
witnessed the incident.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is considered dangerous, police said, especially because he tried 
to kidnap the girl in front of passing shoppers in the midst of a busy shopping 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "That shows you the boldness of this individual," Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins said police are appealing to the community to help find the man 
because they have not been able to come up with any leads and they believe he 
may try kidnaping another child. The incident was not witnessed by the mall's 
security staff, and so far, the man has not shown up on videotape taken by 
security cameras throughout the mall that day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are also checking their files on registered sex offenders but 
have not drawn any connection between the suspect and previous similar crimes 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 All 280 stores in the mall have been alerted to look out for the suspect, as 
have officials at nearby malls such as the Media City Center in Burbank and the 
Plaza Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Police Sgt. Rod Brooks said the incident is an aberration and parents 
should not consider the Galleria unsafe for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police department operates a substation at the mall, but really never 
deal with any actual kidnapings, no problems with child bothering," Brooks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crimes that are common at the mall are auto burglary, petty theft and 
disturbing the peace, he said. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; QUAKE FINALLY CLAIMS BAKERS SQUARE EATERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More evidence that the aftershocks from the January quake continue: Bakers 
Square coffee shop in Northridge served up its last slice of pie Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant, which reopened within days of the quake, was the only business 
in a Tampa Avenue strip mall that was able to keep going.But after surviving 
the temblor, the eatery couldn't survive in a ghost town.  
</P>
<P>
 Not that it didn't try, despite losing all of its kitchen equipment in the 
quake. Until the equipment could be replaced, the restaurant served bottled 
beverages and offered to-go meals, said manager Terry McMullen.  
</P>
<P>
 But many of its former customers never came back. Garry Reichlmayr, a Bakers 
Square area director, blamed the devastation surrounding the restaurant and the 
depressed economic state of Northridge. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; MAN SENTENCED FOR GIVING GIRL TATTOO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tarzana man was sentenced to six months in jail Friday at Van Nuys Municipal 
Court for giving a 16-year-old girl a permanent tattoo he told her would wash 
off, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Flores, 27, received the maximum sentence that could be imposed under a 
law prohibiting the tattooing of anyone under the age of 18, said Los Angeles 
City Atty.Jim Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores tattooed a rose measuring 2 1/4 by 5 inches on the girl's upper right 
arm. He pleaded guilty to the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred at a New Year's Eve party last year, when Flores was 
giving several other people washable tattoos, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother discovered the tattoo a few days later and took her to the 
Los Angeles Police Department's West Valley station to complain. FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HIV OUTREACH PROGRAM FOR LATINOS GROWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley arm of Bienestar, an HIV education, outreach and case 
management organization for Latinos, is looking to expand its services. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization distributes brochures on safer sex and provides a weekly 
support group conducted in Spanish.  
</P>
<P>
 It also dispatches outreach workers -- who are themselves HIV-positive and 
Latino -- to places in the Valley where Latino men tend to congregate. 
</P>
<P>
 With 82 HIV-positive clients, the Valley Bienestar also hopes to begin 
offering a drop-in center. Currently, the organization's two local outreach 
workers operate out of the Valley HIV/AIDS Center in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La O, executive director of Bienestar, said the primary way the virus 
has been spreading in the Latino population is through gay or bisexual men. De 
La O said many of these men do not consider themselves gay or bisexual, and are 
often uncomfortable about being approached about HIV, which they consider is a 
"gay" disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them also don't have a social support group," De La O said. "In 
terms of the Latino population who are gay or bisexual in the San Fernando 
Valley, it is more underground and not as open and free as on the other side of 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 De La O attributed the difference in part to the fact that there are no 
exclusively gay Latino bars in the Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Sanchez, an outreach worker and support group facilitator, frequently 
sets up tables at local bars where he leaves safe-sex booklets and HIV testing 
information, along with packets of condoms and directions in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we go to a bar, we don't want to be competing with the music and they 
are drinking," Sanchez said. "So talking to them is not very effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he leaves on the table small brochures that an interested passerby 
can casually pick up and stick in his pocket to be read later and in private.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; FASHION SQUARE PLANS $20-MILLION ADDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to draw an upscale department store such as Nordstrom, Sherman Oaks 
Fashion Square is planning a $20-million expansion that would increase the size 
of the mall by 20%, to nearly 1 million square feet.  
</P>
<P>
 David Burger, an Australian businessman who owns Fashion Square, has already 
discussed the project with officials at Nordstrom and other stores, including 
Bloomingdale's. Burger also owns the Buena Park Mall in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaining another deluxe department store in the San Fernando Valley would 
brighten the local economic outlook, said economist Jack Kyser. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be "good for the mall and good for the community," said Kyser, who is 
also on the board of the Valley Economic Development Center. Such a store would 
also "generate a lot of sales revenue for the city of Los Angeles," he added.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it's Nordstrom, and I can't imagine that it would be anybody other than 
Nordstrom, it would be an instant hit," predicted Dick Carter, a retail 
specialist at Blatteis Realty and a Sherman Oaks resident. "The customer 
profile of the Sherman Oaks-Studio City-Encino marketplace fits the Nordstrom 
profile." 
</P>
<P>
 Burger hopes to start on the expansion early next year and expects it to take 
about nine months. The city, which must approve the plan, will hold a public 
hearing on it Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing in a high-profile department store would also be a boost to Fashion 
Square. One of the malls in the Valley hardest hit by the Northridge 
earthquake, the mall sustained $5 million in damage that forced it to close for 
two months. Since the temblor, however, business has picked up 10%, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, the mall also lost one of its biggest draws, an I. Magnin 
store, because the store's parent company was having financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding the mall would more than triple the amount of space formerly 
occupied by I. Magnin to 180,000 square feet, enough to attract a desirable 
department store, said Brian Pickering, vice president of City Freeholds (USA), 
the American subsidiary of Burger's company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like Nordstrom would be ideal," Pickering said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickering said he would like to see construction begin in February. It would 
include widenings and re-striping of nearby streets to add lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people who live near the mall, at the southeast corner of Hazeltine 
Avenue and Riverside Drive, said they fear expansion would create traffic and 
parking headaches.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to work with the City Council to make sure substantial 
restrictions are put on the project to make sure it doesn't cause problems in 
the neighborhoods," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to increasing the space for a department store, the proposed 
expansion would add about 20,000 square feet to the mall's common area, 
bringing the total size of the mall to 975,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also includes a new four-level parking structure with 2,655 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky will wait until after the public hearing to form an 
opinion about the project, said planning deputy Ginny Kruger. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense it's a good sign that someone wants to put some money into Sherman 
Oaks right now," Kruger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing will be at the Sherman Oaks Woman's Club, 4808 Kester Ave., 
at 9:30 a.m. A hearing examiner from the Los Angeles Planning Department will 
make a recommendation based on the hearing to the planning commission, which 
will consider the application in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision on the project will be made by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Land that is zoned for surface parking alone would need to be rezoned to allow 
multilevel parking, and property that is zoned for parking would need to be 
rezoned for commercial purposes, to enable the project to go forward. KAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: DENTAL IMPLANT FIRM IS FINALIZING MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A company that claims to be the world's second-largest maker of dental 
implants is completing final preparations for its move to Calabasas from 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Core-Vent Bio-Engineering hopes to have its operations up and running by 
mid-October at the company's new 37,000-square-foot facility, said Dr. Gerald 
Niznick, a prosthodontist who owns the firm. "We're really excited about it, to 
be able to design a building from the ground up to meet our needs," he said. 
"It is a first-class building." 
</P>
<P>
 Core-Vent is moving because it needs more space, Niznick said. Five employees 
at an office in Encino will also be moved to the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Niznick said that Core-Vent, which has about 110 employees, does not expect to 
add to its work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is hoping that most of its workers in Camarillo will transfer to 
the new facility, said Patricia Jacobs, the firm's vice president of 
operations. Most of the workers live in Oxnard, Ventura and Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Core-Vent makes implants for Dentsply International, a large dental products 
distributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas officials said they are happy the firm decided to relocate there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Core-Vent is exactly the kind of small, high-tech business that every 
community likes to have," said Calabasas City Manager Charles Cate. "It's 
non-polluting. It's an ideal commercial, light industrial user." 
</P>
<P>
 Cate said city officials hope that utility taxes from that operation, combined 
with utility taxes from the Cheesecake Factory, an expanding national 
restaurant and bakery chain, will help offset the $20,000 the city will lose 
annually in utility taxes when Lockheed Corp. moves its headquarters to 
Maryland after its merger with Martin Marietta Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cheesecake Factory, which has been in Calabasas for several years, is 
building a new bakery near Core-Vent's new facility, Cate said. As part of its 
expansion plan, the firm plans to replace an aging facility down the street on 
Agoura Road. FRANK MANNING

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: POSTAL SERVICE OFFERS NEW MOVER'S GUIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new Mover's Guide is being distributed at all Valley-based post offices, 
replacing the traditional change-of-address form. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-page booklet, which is available now nationwide, contains before and 
after moving tips and advertisements offering up to $60 of savings on 
moving-related products and services. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet also contains answers to the most commonly asked questions about 
permanent and temporary mail forwarding. The Postal Service will continue to 
offer mail forwarding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was produced at no cost to the Postal Service," said Terri Bouffiou, 
spokeswoman with the Postal Service. "The ads inside pay for the cost of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service also expects to save millions of dollars when customers opt 
to notify friends and other correspondents in advance of their move, 
dramatically reducing internal forwarding costs, according to Van Nuys 
Postmaster Kerry Wolny. 
</P>
<P>
 The booklet was tested in 10 cities last year. According to an independent 
survey conducted by the Postal Service, 84% of the movers found the Guide 
helpful. More than three out of four movers preferred it to the old 
change-of-address card. JEFF SCHNAUFER

LAPD 'GHOST TOWN' PATROL TO SADDLE UP AGAIN; POLICE: HORSEBACK OFFICERS 
APPLAUDED FOR TRIAL ACTION IN QUAKE-DAMAGED NORTH HILLS AREA. THEY'LL BE OUT 
AGAIN FOR AT LEAST THREE DAYS NEXT WEEK. 
</P>

<P>
 Calling a two-day trial this week a success, police said Friday that mounted 
officers will return for at least three days next week to fight drug dealing 
and other crimes in a quake-damaged "ghost town" in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 During a trial stint on Wednesday and Thursday, the 15 police on horseback 
garnered high praise from police and neighbors after making 11 arrests for 
various crimes in the cluster of empty apartment buildings, including 
trespassing, narcotics sales and felony warrants violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been pretty effective these last couple of days," said Los Angeles 
Police Cmdr. Scott LaChasse. "We've also had a great public reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 To further evaluate the unit's impact on crime, LaChasse said the mounted 
officers will return Monday through Wednesday, after which police officials 
will decide whether they should be deployed there on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The reviews from residents near the area -- Orion Avenue between Parthenia and 
Nordhoff streets just east of the San Diego Freeway -- are already positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response is 100% favorable, and the residents are just tickled to death," 
said Harry Coleman, chairman of a citizens anti-crime group called the North 
Hills Task Force. "They've never seen Orion this clean in 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon, who represents the area, was out 
of town Friday, but his spokesman, Arturo Gonzalez, said North Hills residents 
appreciate the new police effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is very happy," he said. "They are encouraged by the swift 
action taken to curb the criminal activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The mounted officers are the latest effort by city officials to crack down on 
crime in one of the 15 so-called ghost towns in the San Fernando Valley, 
Hollywood and Mid-City areas. City crews have already boarded up about 100 
buildings in those areas, and the city has hired private guards to patrol the 
vacant properties. 
</P>
<P>
 But in North Hills, gang violence, drug dealing and prostitution have 
flourished in the vacant units, prompting housing officials last week to 
increase from eight to 10 the number of private security guards and add armed 
guards to the unarmed force. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said the combination of extra guards and mounted police has also given 
residents a renewed confidence they can report crimes without fear of 
retaliation. "The whole program is working," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents had said they were disappointed that the mounted unit did not 
patrol after dark, but LaChasse said the unit is less effective at night 
because the horses are less visible and, thus, represent less of a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 He said keeping the mounted unit out after dark on unfamiliar streets is also 
dangerous for the officers, who do not have the benefit of headlights like 
traditional police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, LaChasse said police can use other crime-fighting tactics such as 
establishing observation posts to document criminal activity or launching 
undercover sting operations to nab drug dealers.

STATE CLOSES PARK AFTER MOUNTAIN LION ENCOUNTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a mountain lion stalking incident, state officials closed a 
Moorpark-area park as a precaution Friday -- but decided not to hunt down and 
kill a pair of lions that threatened two horseback riders this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incident does not indicate that these cats are a danger to public 
safety," said Capt. Roger Reese, who heads the state Department of Fish and 
Game's Ventura office.  
</P>
<P>
 "Neither the horses or riders were hurt in the incident," he said. "Of course, 
there was a potential that something much graver could have happened, so we'll 
have our field investigators out to access the situation before we recommend 
reopening." 
</P>
<P>
 Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park will be closed at least a week, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two horseback riders -- Sharon Virzi, 41, of Simi Valley and Robin Phipps, 
27, of Moorpark -- ran across the pair of mountain lions Wednesday afternoon at 
Cathedral Grove, an area of old oaks near Happy Camp Creek about one mile north 
of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the lions came under Virzi's horse bearing its teeth. When the riders 
tried to turn back, another cat, standing on the trail behind them, blocked 
their way. The women then doubled back and rode up the trail. At least one of 
the cats followed them, Virzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swear they were stalking us," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 But park officials speculate that the two cats were probably startled by the 
horses while waiting for deer that come out of the hills to water at the creek. 
Because the two predators were spotted on such a popular trail, officials want 
to keep the public out for at least a week while they look for any more signs 
of activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rangers will be out there as well as mounted volunteers, checking 
fortracks or any unusual occurrences," said Rorie Skei, assistant executive 
director of the East County Conservation Authority, which oversees the park. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday park rangers posted signs of the closure and warning people about 
the threat of mountain lions.  
</P>
<P>
 In mountain lion country, hikers are advised to walk in pairs. If a chance 
encounter occurs, experts suggest that people raise their hands above their 
heads to appear larger, make loud noises and walk away slowly. Do not run, they 
said, because that could trigger the cats predatory instinct. Parents are 
advised to pick up and hold their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really know how long we'll be closed for," said Drew Mashburn, a 
supervising park ranger for Ventura County. "When we reopen people should just 
be aware that this is mountain lion territory, and that they should act 
accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain lion sightings are common in Ventura County this time of year because 
they are coming after prey that has left the parched hills and mountiains 
seeking food and water, experts said. On two or three other occasions in the 
last month, mountain lions have been seen in Happy Camp park, Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they are not aware of any mountain lion attacks on people in 
this county in recent years.

WOMAN SHOOTS BURGLARY SUSPECT CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman shot an alleged burglar in the chest with a revolver as he advanced on 
her in her home while she was reporting the break-in to police telephone 
operators, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Susan Kaleta, 47, was not injured, and has not been charged with a 
crime, Los Angeles Police Detective Rick Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged burglar, identified by police as Pablo Martinez, 28, also known as 
"Javier," was taken to Northridge Hospital Medical Center where he was in 
critical condition with a gunshot wound to the upper torso, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's injury is not life-threatening, but there is a danger of paralysis, 
authorities said. "When we were at the hospital this (Friday) morning, the 
doctors felt that he was paralyzed, but they need to do more tests to be sure," 
said police Lt. George Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital would not discuss his condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta told investigators that she believed Martinez, who lived in a converted 
garage near her house, is the same man who had attempted to break into her 
house on two other occasions since December, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident Thursday began about 10:30 p.m. when Kaleta heard a noise in the 
front yard of her house in the 6800 block of Penfield Avenue, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she looked out and saw a man trying to remove a screen on the bedroom 
window, police said, Kaleta screamed at him to leave, then hit the panic button 
of the burglar alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was not frightened away however, and continued pulling the screen, 
setting off another alarm, Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the man climbed through the window and came down a hallway after her, 
police said, Kaleta got the .38-caliber revolver she keeps in the house for 
protection, and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, as Kaleta pointed the gun at Martinez, "She told him, 'I've got 
a gun, go away,' " Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said when the unarmed Martinez continued advancing, Kaleta shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they heard at least three shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, a day laborer who rented a garage on Lubao Avenue one block east of 
Kaleta's house, was booked on suspicion of burglary, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, news of the shooting spread through the quiet neighborhood, where 
residents said crime was rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard about it, I couldn't believe it," said Veronica Castillo, 21, 
who lives across the street from Kaleta.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; JEWISH LETTER REACHES ACCORD ON SEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unmarried Jewish men and women with loving, committed relationships "embody a 
measure of morality" in their sexual lives if they follow ethical norms 
expected of married couples, says a nearly completed pastoral letter for the 
Conservative branch of Judaism -- a document that reaches a consensus on sex 
that has eluded many Christian denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex that is not coerced, fidelity to one's partner, attention to birth control 
and healthy practices are among the considerations incumbent upon heterosexual 
couples who, for a variety of reasons, have decided they won't or can't live up 
to the Jewish ideal of married love, according to the pastoral letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Jews assume that since Judaism wants people to restrict sex to marriage 
that you might as well forget about Jewish tradition saying anything else about 
sexual relations," said Rabbi Elliot Dorff, the author, who has nursed the 
document through seven drafts in an effort to reach consensus among rabbis in 
the 1.5-million-member Conservative wing of Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people assume that it's all or nothing," said Dorff, recently named the 
equivalent of dean of the faculty at the University of Judaism in the Sepulveda 
Pass in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "My point is that nothing in Judaism is all or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a rare document for a mainstream U. S. religious body, saying 
something officially -- other than condemnation -- about the widespread 
phenomenon of unmarried couples who live together but have not necessarily 
dropped their religious ties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, 
United Methodist Church and Episcopal Church have been trying in recent years 
to fashion broad "human sexuality" statements at the national level, but 
without much success. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest impasses have arisen over whether church bodies can give qualified 
blessing to committed relationships of gay and lesbian members or admit them to 
the ranks of clergy. 
</P>
<P>
 But even where solely heterosexual issues are concerned, any expression in 
early drafts of limited sympathy for divorced, widowed or other single adults 
in mature sexual relationships quickly runs into opponents who cite church 
tradition that requires "fidelity within the covenant of marriage," to cite a 
phrase used at Presbyterian national meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the bishops of the Episcopal Church adopted a "study document," 
downgraded from a more authoritative "pastoral letter," on human sexuality 
issues that attempted to address the concerns of single adults while 
reiterating the church position that human sexuality reaches its "fullest 
potential" in the union between husband and wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the most difficult disputes were over homosexual relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conservative rabbis were able to avoid that impasse by referring 
unresolved issues -- such as blessing same-sex unions and ordaining gays and 
lesbians -- to the Jewish Law Committee of the Rabbinical Assembly, the 
international organization of Conservative rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 The document deals with gay and lesbian issues only in cases where 
Conservative Judaism has reached a consensus -- for instance, that they should 
be welcome in synagogues and that homosexuality should be better understood. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorff said he has sent the latest version of "A Jewish Pastoral Letter on 
Intimate Relations" to officers of the Rabbinical Assembly and to the 
sponsoring Commission on Human Sexuality for any last-minute, minor changes. 
The final version will probably go to the printer in late October, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an accompanying letter, Dorff told his colleagues that he changed what was 
probably the most controversial sentence in the sixth draft "in which I said 
that non-marital sex can partake in varying degrees of holiness," depending on 
the degree that it incorporates high standards articulated elsewhere in the 
document. Dorff changed "holiness" to "morality." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter does not break new ground in Jewish law, nor does it set policy, 
cautioned Rabbi Joel Rembaum of Los Angeles' Temple Beth Am in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rembaum said it takes what many rabbis already tell individuals in private 
counseling sessions and places that stance in a public document that might be 
used for broader educational purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that vast numbers of (unmarried) people are living together," 
said Rembaum, who is current president of the Southern California Board of 
Rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel there is an obligation to say that any kind of relationship between 
men and women be conducted along the highest standards of ethical conduct," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since many couples live together before getting married, they may have already 
established how they relate to one another and to their Jewish heritage, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't expect them to say, 'Now we change because we're married,' " 
Rembaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pastoral letter repeatedly asserts that couples should restrain from 
sexual intercourse until marriage for the benefits of lasting companionship, 
for the obligation and blessings of raising children, and for the education of 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Sexual relations that are incestuous, adulterous, casual or promiscuous were 
condemned by the rabbis, but they acknowledged there are others with an 
ongoing, loving relationship who engage in non-marital sex for a variety of 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those reasons, the document said, may be "because a suitable mate has 
not yet been, or may never be, found; . . . marital commitment (is) premature, 
often for emotional, educational, economic or professional reasons; or because 
experience with divorce or the death of a partner has necessitated a gradual 
healing process, including experience of several transitional relationships 
prior to remarriage." 
</P>
<P>
 The pastoral letter also advised that in light of the AIDS crisis, any new 
sexual contact should call for full disclosure of the partner's sexual history, 
HIV testing, and careful and consistent use of condoms until the risk of 
infection has been ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 If the pastoral letter is somewhat liberal on non-marital sex, the document 
nevertheless took some relatively conservative stances stemming from worries 
about the numerical decline of Jews through intermarriage and smaller families. 
</P>
<P>
 Critical of the trend by couples to postpone marriage and childbearing until 
they are in their 30s, the rabbis' document said, "Jews should consider it 
reasonable to marry and to begin to have children in their 20s." 
</P>
<P>
 The document also urges that Jewish teen-agers date fellow Jews exclusively. 
"As much as marriage may seem eons away, dating is the usual way in which young 
people meet and ultimately marry," the letter said.

 JEWISH CEMETERIES: Memorial services for families to pay tribute to deceased 
relatives will be held Sunday at Jewish cemeteries, a tradition associated with 
the High Holy Days that end Thursday with Yom Kippur. 
</P>
<P>
 Those planning to attend the 40th Kever Avot services at 10 a.m. at Mount 
Sinai Memorial Park have been invited to bring packages of non-perishable food. 
The food gifts will be given to five agencies, Jewish and non-Jewish, that 
serve the hungry and the homeless. The cemetery is at 5950 Forest Lawn Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 At the noontime Kever Avot service at Sholom Memorial Park in Sylmar, Rabbi 
Joshua Berkowitz of Beth Jacob Congregation in Beverly Hills will deliver the 
address. The service will be in the Chapel of Eternal Light at the cemetery, 
which is located at 13017 N. Lopez Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 CONTEMPORARY WORSHIP: The announcement from United Methodist Church of Tujunga 
introducing a new "contemporary worship service" at 9 a.m. Sunday promises that 
it will last no more than 45 minutes, that guitars, keyboards and drums will 
replace the organ and choir, that skits and videos will replace the sermon and 
the dress code is "come as you are." 
</P>
<P>
 As if that weren't enough, a pamphlet also advises that you can call the 
church ((818) 352-1481) or Pastor Glen Haworth any time, and "his name is Glen, 
not Reverend, Father or Pastor -- just Glen." 
</P>
<P>
 But for those who are uncomfortable with all that informality, the church at 
9901 Tujunga Canyon Boulevard still holds a traditional worship service at 
10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 CATHOLIC SPEAKER: Brother Peter Donohue, director of detention ministries for 
the Los Angeles Roman Catholic Archdiocese, will speak at 10 a.m. Monday in 
Montrose at a meeting of the East San Fernando Valley District of the 
Archdiocesan Council of Catholic Women. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass will be celebrated at 11:30 a.m. by Father John K. Foley, pastor of the 
host church, Holy Redeemer Church, 2411 Montrose Ave. For reservations at the 
event and a luncheon, call Jo Ann Olivier at (818) 790-7392. JOHN DART

INVESTIGATORS ARREST MAN IN TUJUNGA BRUSH FIRE; CRIME: HE IS BOOKED ON 
SUSPICION OF RECKLESSLY CAUSING 50-ACRE BLAZE THAT CAME NEAR SEVERAL HOMES. NO 
ONE WAS INJURED. 
</P>

<P>
 Arson investigators arrested a 42-year-old Tujunga man in connection with a 
brush fire that swept through 50 acres in the Sunland-Tujunga area Friday 
afternoon, coming within feet of several homes but causing no injuries and no 
major damage, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy James Johnston was booked on suspicion of recklessly causing a fire, a 
misdemeanor, said Investigator Paul Blum of the Los Angeles Fire Department's 
arson section. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials would not discuss why they think Johnston was connected to the 
blaze, nor how the fire started at Mt. Gleason Avenue and Big Tujunga Canyon 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Fire Chief Roger Gillis would not confirm reports that fireworks 
were to blame.  
</P>
<P>
 "That is something they're looking at but I don't think they've proven that to 
be the cause of the fire," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out at 12:59 p.m., burning through medium to heavy brush.  
</P>
<P>
 It was fought by almost 200 city and county firefighters, six 
retardant-dropping helicopters, nine hand crews and two bulldozers, said a 
spokesman for the city Fire Department.  
</P>
<P>
 The fire was put out at 2:51 p.m.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ALL-NUDE CLUB LEASE TERMINATED; BUSINESS: THE 
LANDLORD OF THE SANTA CLARITA RESTAURANT AND BAR HAD OBTAINED A COURT ORDER TO 
PROHIBIT SUCH ENTERTAINMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Businessmen seeking to open the only all-nude strip club in the Santa Clarita 
Valley signed an agreement Thursday with their landlord that officially 
terminates their lease and ends a long-simmering controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant and bar -- called Castaic Junction: A Gentlemen's Club -- 
located just north of Magic Mountain, opened June 30 for one day of all-nude 
entertainment before it was quickly smothered in a cloak of legal restraints. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Newhall Land & Farming Co., the club's landlord, immediately 
obtained a court order prohibiting nude dancing on the grounds that its lease 
did not allow "lewd or offensive" entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials for Newhall Land, the Santa Clarita Valley's primary developer, said 
they wanted a first-class restaurant suitable for family dining, rather than an 
all-nude dance hall, said spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer. 
</P>
<P>
 So club operators clad their dancers in bikinis and lingerie and continued to 
perform until July 21, when sheriff's deputies shut down the place for 
operating without the necessary county permits. The club reportedly did not 
have a food or entertainment license. 
</P>

 Santa Clarita residents complained loudly about the club, but operators there 
said they had a steady stream of patrons until it closed. Despite plans to 
reopen Aug. 15, the doors remained shut and club officials withdrew from the 
site one week later.

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; SEASON TAKING A LAST GASP AS MISSING LINK IS SOUGHT 
</P>

<P>
 It is almost impossible to predict the course of baseball's stalemated 
collective bargaining negotiations and the possibility of saving any of the 
diminishing season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry McMorris, owner of the Colorado Rockies, said Friday it would take a 
miracle to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he also referred to the similar but dissimilar tax plans that the 
players and owners have put on the table at various times and said: 
</P>
<P>
 "There ought to be a way of working with the concepts and formulas to find a 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
 There was none Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The modest optimism that accompanied presentation of the players' proposal 
Thursday faded on Day 29 of the strike when it was rejected by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The door closed, but not completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting commissioner Bud Selig, who had set Friday as a tentative deadline, 
said he would delay a decision on canceling the remainder of the season until 
early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the owners' negotiating committee, Boston Red Sox CEO John 
Harrington and Atlanta Braves President Stan Kasten, remained in New York to 
continue examining numbers and concepts, and lawyers for the two sides planned 
to meet twice today, possibly re-examining the rejected players' proposal in 
relationship to a tax plan discussed previously by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a last gasp, or as Selig said of the nearly comatose negotiations and 
possible cancellation of the World Series, horrifying and heartbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
 The acting commissioner, the man of many hats, dressed it in the solemnity 
that has characterized his public posture, having flown in to preside over the 
rejection of the players' proposal and the postponement of his deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 He left only a few hours after he had arrived, returning to Milwaukee to guard 
the self-interest of his Brewers and the small-market coalition that is 
zealously pursuing a salary cap and is now closing in on what the union has 
long suspected is the owners' goal: unilateral implementation of a salary-cap 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig again denied reports that 19 of the 28 clubs favor compromise and 
resumption of the season, with only the Angels, Brewers, Pittsburgh Pirates, 
Minnesota Twins, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, Chicago White Sox, San 
Diego Padres and Kansas City Royals left among the hardliners. 
</P>
<P>
 He insisted again that not one club has suggested changing the owners' 
proposal and that it is long past the point at which the union should be 
questioning the owners' unanimity and relying on the defections of previous 
years' negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig delivered that message, along with a sense of hope and urgency, to Don 
Fehr, the union's executive director, in a meeting early Friday evening, but 
Fehr's top aide, Gene Orza, shook his head and said, "There's no doubt that the 
majority of clubs would like to settle" but are frustrated by the voting rule 
that requires 21 of the 28 to approve an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 As convinced as Orza is about that, the union is mystified by the refusal of 
any big-market owners to speak up, state their real hopes and shatter the 
perception of unanimity. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Friday, when some clubs did not receive a copy or full explanation of the 
players' proposal until the negotiating committee had already rejected it -- 
the union had delivered the proposal Thursday afternoon -- the grumbling was 
minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Selig was saying that all of the clubs had been told about the 
proposal, Peter Angelos said his Baltimore Orioles had yet to be told. He 
didn't think the Orioles were alone in that regard, but didn't have anything 
critical or biting to say about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter O'Malley of the Dodgers was characteristically mild in his appraisal of 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the negotiating committee has the authority to reject or approve a 
proposal within certain guidelines. He said there is need for flexibility on 
both sides, but if chief negotiator Richard Ravitch opposed the players' 
proposal, so did the Dodgers. Is there a schism among the owners? No, insisted 
O'Malley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of anxiety and frustration, but the owners are united more than 
ever. The need for cost certainty is shared by all 28 clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger owner's strained relationship with Selig has been chronicled. He 
recently seemed to point a damning finger at the acting commissioner when he 
told The Times that he would not blame Ravitch or Fehr if the season went down. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, he said that "in every negotiations, there must be responsibility and 
accountability," and "the focus keeps coming back to (Selig)." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig was ducking blows on several fronts Friday. There was the issue of when 
clubs were told about the players' proposal and what they were told. There was 
the issue of unanimity again. And there was the issue of why Ravitch had not 
given the union full details of the owners' revenue-sharing plan and why it 
finally took McMorris to do it last Saturday, a situation that has reportedly 
prompted several clubs to demand Ravitch's benching -- not an unprecedented 
situation for an owners' negotiator near the end of another negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 The season is on the brink of vanishing, and the only thing that matters is 
this last-gasp attempt to find a solution -- a link, perhaps, between tax 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible? Not if the owners continue to insist on a salary cap or 
ceiling. Not if they keep their proposal intact so that it can be implemented 
as their last, best offer. That is the one predictable factor in an otherwise 
unpredictable situation.

IT'S NO. 1 VS. NO. 2 FOR WOMEN'S TITLE; TENNIS: GRAF DEFEATS NOVOTNA AND 
SANCHEZ VICARIO DOWNS SABATINI IN U.S. OPEN SEMIFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In two tense women's semifinals at the U.S. Open on Friday, when the going got 
tough and the collars got tight, Steffi Graf and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario were 
able to draw unimpeded breaths and play unimpeded tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 And so today's final will match the top players in this tournament's seedings, 
and in the world. No. 1 Graf of Germany, already the winner of 15 Grand Slam 
event titles, will be going after another against No. 2 Sanchez Vicario of 
Spain, already the winner of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf played with her usual iron will in a 6-3, 7-5 victory over Jana Novotna 
of the Czech Republic, the seventh-seeded player here. Graf trailed in the 
second set, 2-5 and 15-40, and fought back into the set and, eventually, the 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez Vicario, beaten by Graf in this year's Australian final but the winner 
of the French after Mary Pierce had upset Graf, also steeled herself to the 
tension and the windy conditions on Stadium Court in a 6-1, 7-6 (8-6) victory 
over Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina, the No. 8-seeded player here. Sanchez 
Vicario lost two match points at 5-4 of the second set, then fought off a set 
point for Sabatini in the tiebreaker before closing out the match with a reflex 
lob volley that Sabatini, strangely, chased down and tried to return by hitting 
the ball between her legs, her back to the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have just hit it normal but I just went for it," Sabatini said. 
</P>
<P>
 If this was an unusual way to end a Grand Slam semifinal match, or any match 
for that matter, then these semifinals had lots of unusual elements. 
</P>
<P>
 Novotna seemed to be in fine shape to win the second set, when Graf stepped to 
the service line at 2-5 and 15-40 and spun in a 79-m.p.h. second serve. Novotna 
netted it. At 30-40, Novotna hit a forehand long. After two deuces, Novotna got 
set point No. 3, and hit a lob long. 
</P>
<P>
 When questioned about her nerves in that situation she said: "I missed the 
forehand return, then I make the easy error, but after that, she passed me, she 
did great. There was nothing I could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Novotna, serving at 5-3, was broken quickly at 15-40, putting Graf back 
on serve. Graf accomplished the break by starting the game with a net-cord 
passing-shot winner and got the 15-all point with an incredible running 
forehand cross-court passing shot that left Novotna so devastated that she 
netted two forehands for the break. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, similarities of the 1993 Novotna-Graf Wimbledon final began coming to 
mind. In that memorable match, Novotna, serving in the third set at 4-1 and 
40-30, double-faulted that point and appeared to fall apart the rest of the 
way, eventually crying on the shoulder of the Duchess of Kent during the awards 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, serving at 5-5, Novotna hit a second serve into the net at 74 m.p.h, got 
passed by Graf for love-30, and followed with two more double faults, the 
second a feeble shank off the frame of her racket that had so little velocity 
it didn't even register on the speed gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not getting tense at all," Novotna said. "I think it was very windy 
conditions today." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, apparently able to get more of that wind down her throat in key 
situations, then served out the match -- after Novotna, fighting hard to the 
end, saved one match point before succumbing to yet another big inside-out 
forehand by Graf. 
</P>
<P>
 Graf, asked if thoughts of that '93 Wimbledon final had come to mind while she 
watched Novotna hit three double faults in one game, said, "Like when guys are 
always saying choking, you know, I don't think it happened. Definitely not 
until 5-all, but OK, she makes three double faults, that is really difficult." 
A similar tension problem appeared to affect Sabatini. She hit nine double 
faults, made 48 unforced errors and won only 34% of the points on her second 
serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Nerves seemed to bother her most seriously in the tiebreaker, when she hit a 
62-m.p.h. first serve on set point at 6-5, then followed that with a 67-m.p.h. 
first serve when she lost the 6-5 point. Both times, Sanchez Vicario used the 
soft serves to take control of the point and hit backhand winners. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, there was the ill-fated match point, the between-the-legs shot by 
Sabatini that looked like something the Jensen brothers would try out on Court 
22 purely for crowd reaction. Sanchez Vicario's reaction was quite simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not do that at match point," she said. "Or any other time." Tennis 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the strangest endings to an important moment in Grand Slam doubles, 
the top-seeded women's team of Gigi Fernandez and Natalie Zvereva, seeking a 
sweep of the Grand Slam titles this year, lost in the semifinals to the 
unseeded team of Katerina Maleeva and Robin White, 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 6-3. Maleeva 
was serving at 5-3 and 30-love of the final game when the rains came. After 
about a 1 1/2-hour delay, they returned, and Maleeva got the game to 40-love 
before Zvereva and Fernandez fought back to 40-30. Then, Maleeva hit a first 
serve near the line, Fernandez shanked a return that went barely two feet in 
front of her -- and stood stunned as the line judge called the serve good. Last 
year, Zvereva and Fernandez also won the first three Grand Slam doubles titles 
of the year and then lost in the semifinals of the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Meilen Tu, the junior player from Northridge who won a spot in the main draw 
and lost in a tough first-round match, got through to the semifinals of the 
junior girls' draw. Tu, who won the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s girls' 18 title earlier 
in the year to gain the wild-card spot in the main draw, beat Tara Snyder, 0-6, 
6-4, 6-4. Tu, of Granada Hills High, who won't turn 17 until January, is seeded 
fourth among the junior girls here.

USC-PENN STATE: ROSE BOWL PREVIEW?; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NOW THAT NITTANY LIONS 
ARE IN THE BIG TEN, IT'S AN INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tailback U. and Linebacker U. meet for the last time in a regular-season game, 
at least in this century, before an expected 95,000 at Beaver Stadium today.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, USC and Penn State could be playing again in Pasadena in a January 
rematch, lending intrigue to an intersectional rivalry that began as an 
eight-game series, then was cut to four.  
</P>
<P>
 Each team is 1-0. The Trojans displayed an impressive running game last 
Saturday in a 24-17 victory over Washington, and Penn State routed overmatched 
Minnesota, 56-3. 
</P>
<P>
 When the USC-Penn State series began in 1990, some hoped it would evolve into 
a longtime proposition, such as the decades-old USC-Notre Dame rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State agreed to play at the Coliseum in 1990 and 1991, and lost both 
times. There was no 1992 game, but USC came here to Happy Valley last season 
and lost in the final minute, 21-20.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was originally an eight-game series, going to the late '90s," said Budd 
Thalman, Penn State associate athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when we were accepted by the Big Ten in 1990, we needed to free up some 
dates and USC excused us from the final four games of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time the series started, we wanted to start an intersectional rivalry. 
We'd had one with Alabama we enjoyed for 10 years, but when we lost that one, 
we started one with USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another reason why it was decided to end the USC series was a feeling on the 
part of both conferences that it wasn't desirable for the Rose Bowl game to be 
a rematch of a regular-season game." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, that could happen this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 USC seems significantly improved over the 8-5 team that was a Pac-10 
tri-champion last year. And the Nittany Lions have seven offensive starters 
back from a 10-2 team that won its last five games a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, hopeful of reawakening a decades-old tradition of Heisman-grade 
tailbacks, showed off two youngsters last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Starter Shawn Walters, a sophomore, had a solid performance, gaining 91 yards 
in 26 carries. He lugged three Huskies into the end zone on a tying touchdown, 
then carried three consecutive times before scoring the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 And freshman backup Delon Washington had 109 yards in 10 carries, one a 
34-yard run that set up Walters' tying score. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson has promised that another freshman tailback, Rodney 
Sermons, will play today. Another standout newcomer who didn't play against 
Washington is junior college transfer Leonard Green, hobbled by a hamstring 
pull for more than two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago here, USC's running game was DOA. The Trojans netted 34 yards 
rushing to Penn State's 282.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's principal concern today is manpower at wide receiver.  
</P>
<P>
 Starter Ed Hervey was already nursing a sore shoulder, then twisted a knee 
when Walters fell on him in the Washington game. And transfer Keyshawn Johnson 
has a thigh bruise that bleeds into his knee area, causing some swelling.  
</P>
<P>
 That leaves senior Ken Grace, who had five catches last week, and a freshman, 
Larry Parker, who has been preparing to play all week in practice. Three tight 
ends -- Johnny McWilliams, Tyler Cashman and John Allred -- caught 10 passes 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Rob Johnson's production was well off his 1993 pace last week, but 
he made the key play in the winning touchdown drive, a nine-yard scramble on 
third and seven to Washington's 18. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago here, Johnson went 25 for 43 for 291 yards and two touchdowns, but 
was 12 for 13 in the homestretch, when he brought the Trojans back from a 21-7 
deficit. A two-point conversion pass to McWilliams fell incomplete with 37 
seconds to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State senior quarterback Kerry Collins completed 19 of 23 passes for 263 
yards and three touchdowns against Minnesota. In one stretch, he broke a 
54-year-old school record with 14 consecutive completions.  
</P>
<P>
 The standout, however, was tailback Ki-Jana Carter, who had a 210-yard day 
that included runs of 80 and 62 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 All-American linebacker Brian Gelzheiser, the leader of Joe Paterno's defense, 
sat out the Minnesota game last weekend with a sore knee. He is expected to 
play today.  
</P>
<P>
 Paterno, 67, in his 45th season at Penn State, says he doesn't know what to 
expect today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the squad after the Minnesota game that USC had a big edge over us in 
that they had a tough game behind them while we have no idea how good we are," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He hopes this won't be a repeat of 1991, when Penn State beat Cincinnati, 
81-0, then lost to USC the following Saturday, 21-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it's a similar situation," Paterno said. "But this squad has a lot more 
mature and strong leaders than that team had. At least, I hope it does." USC

'THE NEXT HOWIE LONG'; THAT'S WHAT MCGLOCKTON COULD BECOME, SAYS . . . HOWIE 
LONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Getting Raider defensive tackle Chester McGlockton to do an interview during 
the first two years of his NFL career was practically impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever a reporter approached, he found a way to avoid answering questions. 
But unlike some players, McGlockton always declined politely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't have anything to talk about," the 6-foot-4, 315-pound 
McGlockton said. "More or less, I didn't talk because I hadn't done anything 
and there's nothing to really say when you're not talking about football." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his career, McGlockton's silence was of little consequence, because 
he spent more time in the trainer's room dealing with injuries than on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 A foot injury on the first play of his first exhibition game forced McGlockton 
to miss much of his rookie season and a "turf toe" injury limited him to a slow 
start last season. 
</P>
<P>
 So, whenever McGlockton drew the media's attention, it usually wasn't in a 
positive manner. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get injured and people get down on you, like you're not (any good)," he 
said. "The media really did that to me my first year and it wasn't really fair 
because I wasn't healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 So why is McGlockton talking now? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because last year I had at least a decent season," he said. "And I feel that 
I did help the team a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 What changed was that as McGlockton recovered, he emerged as a dominant 
defensive force. With seven sacks and 78 tackles, the former Clemson star began 
to show why the Raiders had made him their No. 1 draft choice in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Cincinnati, McGlockton had a season-high 13 tackles and two sacks. 
Against Cleveland, he showed his agility with a 13-yard interception return. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon it became clear the Raider defense was better with McGlockton on the 
field. He broke his right leg in the Raiders' wild-card playoff victory over 
Denver and many said later that his absence was a major reason Buffalo defeated 
the Raiders the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 McGlockton's two biggest supporters, Coach Art Shell and former All-Pro 
defensive lineman Howie Long, said that he was only approaching his potential. 
His critics remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they were really saying was, 'You're not (anything) now, but you could 
be good,' " McGlockton said. "I've been hearing that my whole life, so it's 
nothing new. It just would be nice to see how I was with one healthy season 
before writing things like that." 
</P>
<P>
 When he made himself eligible for the NFL as a redshirt junior, one draft 
publication had this to say about McGlockton: 
</P>
<P>
 "Positives: Huge and massive with tremendous weight and bulk. Super athlete 
for his size. Very strong and explosive. Great balance. Light on feet. Great 
speed for his size. Dominates in spurts. Unlimited potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "Negatives: Overweight underachiever. Lacks stamina and endurance. Only 
hustles and chases when he wants. Not a team player. . . . Shaky character. Has 
a variety of injury problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Summary: Is one of the biggest, strongest, most gifted human beings you will 
ever see . . . but unless he improves his work ethic, he could be a coach 
killer." 
</P>
<P>
 So far in the NFL, McGlockton has more than lived up to the positives. In the 
27 games he has played, the Raiders are 17-10. Without him, they were 1-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious problem for McGlockton has been avoiding injuries, which he blames 
on chop blocks by Green Bay's Guy McIntire, when he was playing with San 
Francisco, and Denver's Brian Habib. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two cheap shots put me out, two illegal cut blocks," said McGlockton, who 
re-injured his broken leg in an exhibition game this year. "The league allows 
offensive linemen to get away with stuff like that, and I don't think that's 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never noticed until it started happening to me. I mean if you break my 
leg, you are messing with my livelihood. Football's my life right now. It's how 
I pay my bills." 
</P>
<P>
 Long, who retired at the end of last season, helped McGlockton deal with his 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really supported me and helped me when I was down," McGlockton said. "A 
lot of people didn't understand it and a lot of guys on the team didn't 
understand our relationship, but he was really helpful to me when I first got 
here, on and off the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The friendship between McGlockton and Long may seem odd, considering their 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, 34, a white eight-time Pro Bowl player, was born and raised in 
Massachusetts. McGlockton, 25, is a black third-year pro from North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Long played at Villanova, a school not known for its football program. 
McGlockton played at Clemson, where football is big-time. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, who was a media favorite, now works as a television commentator for Fox. 
McGlockton couldn't care less about exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we've known each other our whole lives," said Long, who moved 
McGlockton into his home for two months in 1992. "We socially just grew closer 
together off the field. He doesn't see color, I don't see color. I don't see 
geography, he doesn't see geography. We just call it the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 And although Long is no longer a Raider, the friendship thrives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk a couple times a week," McGlockton said. "He even called me when I 
got hurt this year and said, 'What the . . . ? I leave you alone and you get 
hurt.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Long says McGlockton could be a perennial Pro Bowl performer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited about the guy," he said. "He has a lot going for him and I would 
like to see him become a great, great player. I would like to see him become 
the next Howie Long here. He can take that and take it even further. He has 
that kind of ability."

BRUINS TURN TO STRENGTH; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: DONAHUE AGAIN WILL SOMETIMES USE ONE 
BACK, FOUR WIDE RECEIVERS IN GAME AGAINST SMU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after the rainy spring Saturday when Skip Hicks took off on a slick 
long-jumping board and shredded his knee, clouds gathered over the offices of 
the UCLA football coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Donahue took inventory of his running backs and shuddered. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Hicks, last season's top ground gainer, out with a ligament injury 
that medical texts said would take nine months to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Sharmon Shah, coming back off his own knee problems, so severe that 
he had been given a medical redshirt season. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Derek Ayers, who had shown flashes of brilliance, but was unproven. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was Daron Washington, a senior who had yet to blossom. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, an insurance policy was needed, and Bob Toledo, the new offensive 
coordinator, was dispatched to Tallahassee, Fla., to get one. The idea was to 
find a way to use four receivers in a formation and take the pressure off the 
running backs. Florida State had done that in winning a national championship. 
If you're going to learn, learn from the best. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching three days of practice and several hundred hours of film, the 
Bruins had their insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had talked to the offensive coaches and said, 'Let's talk about a 
worst-case scenario,' " said Donahue. "If all these backs go down and we only 
have two backs to play . . . If (wide receiver) was where our players were and 
we were short of backs, then we would play like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all that short of running backs, the 13th-ranked Bruins played like that 
anyway last week in much of a 25-23 season-opening victory over Tennessee. They 
will play like that again today against Southern Methodist in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 How much is open to question. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had not intended to play the whole season (with one back and four wide 
receivers)," Donahue said. "We still want to be in a two-back offense. I don't 
want us to be in an exclusively one-back offense. But I also want to make sure 
I can put the best athletes on the field, ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Either way is fine, said quarterback Wayne Cook, upon whom UCLA depends to run 
its wide-open offense that has an added fillip: no huddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one word to describe the offense, and that is fun, " Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to SMU Coach Tom Rossley, there is another way to describe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at the film of UCLA on offense and said it looked like they've been 
watching us play," he said. "They're doing a lot of the things we're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the Bruins are doing them better. SMU struggled in its season 
opener, staying with Arkansas for three quarters before being blown out, 34-14. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's offense revolves around Cook, who completed 25 of 38 passes for a 
career-high 295 yards and a touchdown against Tennessee. He found nine 
receivers, led by Kevin Jordan, who caught six passes for 152 yards, one a 
52-yard touchdown strike. J.J. Stokes caught six passes, for 84 yards, but he 
also caught a helmet in his right thigh, and the bruise makes him questionable 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look like they've got plenty of weapons," said Rossley. "It looked like 
it was a good offense for them. I was kind of surprised they were running it." 
</P>
<P>
 So was Tennessee, but now everyone knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, one of the ideas was to give other teams something they had to practice 
for," Donahue said. "It's just something else they have to spend time on." 
</P>
<P>
 SMU is not without weapons, but the Mustangs are limited largely to 
quarterback Ramon Flanigan and wide receiver Mick Rossley, son of the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossley caught 11 passes for 106 yards and a touchdown against Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanigan, the Mustangs' best athlete, completed 19 of 36 passes for 180 yards 
and a touchdown. He also rushed for 82 yards, then lost 46 of them on five 
sacks. He has run a 4.37-second 40-yard dash, which gives opposing coaches 
fits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is fast," said Donahue. "That guy will be running all over the field, and 
we've got to contain him. We have to make sure we can wrap him up and box him 
in. He'll raise some havoc. They liken him to the kid at Florida State last 
year, Charlie Ward." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward won the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the problems the Bruins will face is focus. Ahead is a game against No. 
1 Nebraska in Lincoln. SMU was 2-7-2 last season and is 11-43-2 since coming 
off a two-year "death penalty." The potential for embarrassment is there for a 
team looking ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how much your players will respond," Donahue said. "No matter 
how much you prepare them, you don't know how much creeps in and affects them."

SENIOR GOLF TOURNAMENT BEGINS SEVEN MILES FROM PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As federal investigators combed a charred ravine for clues to the crash of 
USAir Flight 427, the nation's worst air disaster since 1987, the Quicksilver 
senior golf tournament got under way Friday seven miles away in the rolling 
western Pennsylvania hills of suburban Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes playing golf so trivial," said Ed Sneed."It's hard to put it in 
perspective, when we're playing a game and people have lost their lives and are 
suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was virtually the only topic of conversation for fans and golfers 
alike, and the galleries were uncharacteristically quiet as Ben Smith, a 
nonwinner in 11 years on the Senior tour, took the lead with a 69. One back are 
Jim Colbert, Ray Floyd and Bob Dickson. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir is a major employer in the small towns and boroughs that pocket the 
hills of suburban Pittsburgh, and it seemed almost every fan and volunteer knew 
somebody touched by the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Begley, a Quicksilver Golf Club assistant pro, got the scare of his 
life when he was told his father, Jim, was on Flight 427. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Begley, an engineer for Hewlett-Packard, was booked on the flight, 
but was detained by a meeting in Chicago with his boss and took a later flight. 
His family's fears worsened when they didn't hear from him. Jonathan Begley 
said his father didn't call right away because he didn't know about the crash.

MORNING BRIEFING: PERHAPS JORDAN WOULD BE UP TO NFL TASK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Rosenbloom of the Chicago Sun-Times writes that Philadelphia quarterback 
Randall Cunningham would sign Michael Jordan now to play for the Eagles as a 
two-point conversion specialist.  
</P>
<P>
 "Put a guy like Michael Jordan in the backfield, hand him the ball and let him 
dive over," Cunningham said. "Anybody can dive over from two yards. That will 
make a difference in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If teams are smart, they'll use it." 
</P>
<P>
 A new challenge for Air Jordan? 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the NFL record for most touchdowns rushing?  
</P>
<P>
 Overpaid?Kevin Paul Dupont in the Boston Globe on the Kings' signing of Jari 
Kurri for $2 million a year for two years:  
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry, the guy's got Jack Clark written all over him. Good guy, but he 
already was clicking at less than a point per game last year, and the big 
ticket now looks like money paid for past performance -- and most of that 
happened in Edmonton." 
</P>
<P>
 Name crisis: John Steigerwald of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on what he calls 
the singular-name plague: 
</P>
<P>
 "You can trace the origin back to the World Football League in the mid-1970s, 
but the tradition has been carried on and totally abused by several indoor 
soccer leagues.  
</P>
<P>
 "Chicago Wind and Philadelphia Bell were bad enough. But soccer brought us the 
Pittsburgh Spirit, the Cleveland Force and Cleveland Crunch, and now we have 
the Anaheim Splash. It's time for the federal government to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Too good, too far: West Virginia's Todd Sauerbrun averaged 60.1 yards on nine 
punts, one a 90-yard effort, in his team's 31-0 loss to Nebraska in the Kickoff 
Classic on Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressive? Not particularly to West Virginia Coach Don Nehlen, who said: 
"Todd punted the ball real well, but the problem is, he kicked it too far and 
we couldn't cover it. Then, they'd still bring it back 20 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Dream course: Lee Trevino told Golf World why he loves the Pinehurst No. 2 
course in North Carolina:  
</P>
<P>
 "No condominiums, no houses around it. You see other players when you look 
across the fairways. You don't see a big dog going, 'Woof, woof.' 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see fences, and you don't see those rubber pink flamingos in back 
yards or any other goofy things like you see on other courses." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Walter Payton of the Chicago Bears, with 110 from 1975-1987.

end: "He looks like some guy we picked up from Wal-Mart." MAL FLORENCE

 I am tired of all the hypocritical and self-pitying baseball fans faulting the

 I heartily support the owners' right to make a profit on their investment. 
After all, that is the American way. The owners take all the risks and deserve 
the rewards. The players take no risks with guaranteed contracts and are paid 
even if they do not play (because of injuries) or perform poorly. I have never 
heard of a player giving back a portion of his salary after a bad season or 
being on the DL for periods of time.

 On the other hand, there have been instances of players demanding contract

121-103 won-lost record, the AFC compiling a 119-105 record. How can this be? 
Are there two fictional teams that you expect to compile 0-16 records?

GHOSTS OF A FOOTBALL PAST PROWL NOTRE DAME SIDELINE

<TEXT>

 Gene Wojciechowski criticized everything about Notre Dame ("Whoa, Let's Give 
Powlus More Time," Sept. 8). Its opening game, its coach, its quarterback, even 
the network broadcaster -- all in the name of Julius Caesar's Ghost. He doesn't 
even know that Caesar's Ghost is just a stage role, played by a leprechaun, and 
created by Bill Shakespeare, the chap who threw the game-winning pass in the 
Irish's 1935 comeback upset of Ohio State.

 It was amusing to read Steve Harvey's Bottom Ten column, in which he declared 
that the Rams were pro football's worst team and that Indianapolis Colts'

YANCEY SERVED AS EDUCATOR FOR MANIC DEPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golfer Bert Yancey, who died last week, had the courage to help educate the 
public about manic depression, which provided a much-needed service and 
awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Yancey's heart attack and the symptoms that preceded it were not taken 
seriously, it is obvious there needs to be more public awareness about heart 
disease and the specific warning signs of a heart attack.

Nastase. The same media in the past have criticized the childish outbursts and

CONTENDERS STRUGGLE BUT STAY PERFECT; BOXING: ROMERO, MOSLEY STAY ON COURSE FOR 
WORLD TITLE SHOTS BY WINNING THE HARD WAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Danny Romero and Shane Mosley, two fighters accustomed to quick and 
brilliant victories, Friday night was all about patience, poise and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 Both fighters are aiming for world title shots by the end of 1995, but in 
separate bouts they had to endure unexpected tests of endurance before a crowd 
of about 350 at the Grand Olympic Auditorium to keep their records perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero (19-0, 17 knockouts) defended his North American Boxing Federation 
flyweight title against Manuel Jesus Herrera when the bout was stopped with 
four seconds to go in the 12th round. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier lightweight bout, Mosley (15-0, 15 KOs) stopped Luis Ramirez 45 
seconds into the 10th and final round after controlling the fight from the 
opening bell but getting frustrated by Ramirez's ability to withstand 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprisingly competitive Herrera (12-3-1) kept Romero at bay often in the 
bout with his reach advantage, body movement and a snapping overhand right that 
had Romero's left eye badly swollen by the 12th. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, 20, who knocked Herrera down in the second and 12th rounds, had never 
gone past nine rounds in his professional career before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 12th-round knockdown, which came moments into the round, Romero 
peppered Herrera with his trademark overhand right, then lifted Herrera from 
the canvas with a quick right uppercut to the jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, who was penalized a point in the ninth for holding, was chasing an 
obviously dazed Herrera across the ring, firing his right, when the bout was 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a lot more awkward, a lot tougher than we thought," Romero said about 
Herrera. "He recovered really quickly each time I hit him." 
</P>
<P>
 All three judges had Romero comfortably ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, who fought at 119 as an amateur, also said he felt weak from the 
second round on, and said this is probably a sign that he might not be able to 
make the 112-pound flyweight limit much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero is in the top five in both the International Boxing Federation and the 
World Boxing Council flyweight rankings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get a title shot instantly," Romero said. "I don't know how long 
I can stay at this weight." 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier fight, Mosley, 23, went into the 10th for only the second time 
in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy, he was moving back on me all the time, taking a lot of the power off 
of my punches," Mosley said. "He was afraid of me, and it's hard to fight a guy 
who won't fight with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley, who looked frustrated at times while piling up the points with his 
stiff left jab and straight right, won every round on the cards. But he came 
out determined to score the knockout in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosley's next fight might be on the undercard of the Michael Moorer-George 
Foreman heavyweight title bout Nov. 5 in Las Vegas.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; JONES, TONEY TO TAKE A JAB AT A CAREER SPRINGBOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roy Jones and James Toney, contenders to fill a vacancy in the hearts and 
minds of boxing fans once occupied by such greats as Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin 
Hagler and Thomas Hearns, posed for pictures, promised victory and peered 
malevolently at one another Friday at the House of Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard watched it all, as he has watched hundreds of other boxing news 
conferences since his retirement, and for once, his presence didn't overwhelm 
the moment. In fact, it seemed to add to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Toney, undefeated champions considered two of the top three fighters 
in the world, will fight for Toney's International Boxing Federation 
super-middleweight title on Nov. 18 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is the fighter with the blistering hand speed and ability to move around 
the ring like a halfback. Toney is the fighter with the underrated defensive 
skills and devastating inside power. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an era when cautious promoters and chaotic decisions have cut away at 
boxing's stature, Jones vs. Toney is a fight that suggests comparisons to the 
days when Leonard, Roberto Duran, Hearns and Hagler lifted the sport higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Does anybody in boxing stoke those kinds of passions any more? Julio Cesar 
Chavez did, for a while, in Mexico. Mike Tyson might again, once he is released 
from prison, but he carries enormous baggage. Pernell Whitaker is the sport's 
best, but with Chavez on a swift decline, he has nobody in his weight class to 
give him the competition he needs to achieve real superstardom. 
</P>
<P>
 If a new Leonard or Hagler or Hearns is going to emerge in the next few years, 
it probably will be as a result of this November bout and whatever bouts spin 
off it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fight that takes you to the next level, you understand that?" said 
Leonard, who acknowledged that he'd feared this fight would never take place. 
"It's a fight that propels you to the point where people say, 'He's a great 
fighter.' You can't do that when you fight the other guys." 
</P>
<P>
 When it appeared that the fight might never happen, Leonard, who works with 
the MGM, moved to remind both men of what they might be throwing away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was talking to both guys," Leonard said, "saying, 'Hey, this is the fight 
that's going to make you who you want to be, and who you think you are.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, both guys have complaints that they are not making marquee money. 
But it takes this kind of fight to make you a marquee name." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones has recognized that reality by agreeing to relinquish his IBF 
middleweight belt in order to move up to fight Toney, and by signing a deal 
that pays the fighters strict percentages of the pay-per-view profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, in such a high-profile bout, the fighters are guaranteed a set amount 
that can be inflated if the PPV buy turns out to be more than expected. Toney 
and Jones are getting no such guarantee. Their only guarantee is that the 
winner will have a very, very bright future. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I win the fight, I'm sure I'd be considered the top guy," Jones said. 
"Nobody would have any other choice." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I become a bigger star after I win this fight," Toney said. "I will 
be the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Toney's veteran trainer, Bill Miller, says that until you measure yourself 
against the best, you can't claim to be No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "This fight will put him where he wants to be," Miller said. "They always tell 
us this before every fight, 'Beat this guy, and that will do it.' When we 
fought Tim Littles, they said it. When we fought Prince Charles (Williams), 
they said, 'Oh, he's a bad guy, this will do it.' Then afterward, it's always 
somebody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is the guy. It takes this type of fight for both of them. They need 
each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond this fight, for both fighters, lies the possibility of a series of big 
bouts. Gerald McClellan, one of the sport's hardest hitters, is the World 
Boxing Council super-middleweight champion and would love a shot at Toney or 
Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Norris, who abandoned plans to move up from junior-middleweight after 
losing to Simon Brown early this year, might be tempted to try it now that he 
has regained his WBC junior-middleweight title. 
</P>
<P>
 After about a decade of less-than-scintillating fighters, could this be the 
start of a new era? 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely could be something like that," Jones said. "I could have a 
series with James. I could have a series with McClellan. I still could have a 
series with Terry Norris. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could knock boxing out of its slump." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more interesting undercurrents is the noticeable tension between 
Jones and Bob Arum, who promotes both men and is promoting the fight but has 
been having public disagreements with Jones over money the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a comfortable thing," Jones said. "See, if you go ahead and do stuff 
the way you're supposed to do stuff, we wouldn't have any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go back and play those games with me and do like he does all the rest 
of the fighters, you're wrong. I'm not James Toney. I'm not one of those old 
fighters who kisses his behind and will just do it his way." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent point of contention was a $150,000 payment Jones said Arum was 
withholding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's due Sept. 15, and I will, of course, pay him," Arum said. "He made it 
seem like it was past-due money, which it wasn't. Why he said that, I have no 
idea. He's a very moody kid." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Carbajal's attorney says that the former light-flyweight champion is 
bewildered about the statements being made about Carbajal's possible 
involvement in Phoenix gangs after Carbajal was arrested on felony charges 
involving gunshots at a party last weekend. Carbajal allegedly fired shots into 
the air and flashed gang signs when he was denied entrance to the party last 
Saturday morning. He was booked and released, pending an investigation. He 
faces a maximum 1 1/2-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael has adamantly and vehemently denied he has any connection with any 
gang," said the lawyer, Ben Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
 Miranda, who says Carbajal has been advised not to make any statements about 
the incident or the allegations, blasted suggestions that Don King, who 
recently signed the fighter away from long-time promoter Bob Arum, had had an 
immediate, bad influence on Carbajal. "Don King has nothing to do with any 
unfortunate circumstances that Michael may find himself in," Miranda said. 
"Michael's still the same he's always been, and he's always going to be the 
same -- doesn't drink, smoke, do drugs, doesn't belong in a gang and he lives 
in a neighborhood that generally can be characterized as containing a lot of 
those elements. Don King didn't tell Michael to stay in his community. But 
Michael's committed to living in the neighborhood. Michael feels comfortable in 
his neighborhood and he doesn't consider moving anywhere an option at this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, negotiations continue for a third Carbajal-Humberto (Chiquita) 
Gonzalez bout, but there has been little progress and Miranda said Friday that 
as far as the Carbajal camp is concerned, there will be no second rematch. King 
has promised Carbajal a $1-million purse to fight Gonzalez, who is promoted by 
the Forum and believes he deserves more than Carbajal for the bout. "Chiquita 
is going to blow it," Miranda said. "Chiquita is going to be nowhere in a year, 
and we're moving in other directions." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, Gonzalez makes the first defense of his World Boxing Council and 
International Boxing Federation titles since winning them from Carbajal last 
February. Gonzalez fights Juan Domingo Cordoba at Lake Tahoe. The fight is 
being televised by Channel 9. One of the good young fighters in the area, 
junior-lightweight Carlos Hernandez, has been added to the Gonzalez undercard. 
Hernandez (17-0-1 with 9 KOs) is scheduled to meet Juan Carlos Barreto (16-5, 5 
KOs). 
</P>
<P>
 Police have told friends of former lightweight champion Ike Williams that they 
have dropped the investigation into his death after a coroner ruled that he 
died of arterial sclerosis, commonly known as hardening of the arteries. 
Williams, 71, was found dead last Sunday in his Wilshire district apartment, 
and witnesses told police that his television was missing and a window had been 
left open. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Parker, the former promoter of Oliver McCall, who is scheduled to 
fight in two weeks for Lennox Lewis' WBC heavyweight title in London, filed a 
lawsuit in U.S. District Court, trying to stop the bout, claiming McCall was 
stolen by Don King Productions. A lawyer for Don King Productions said the 
lawsuit was without merit and that most of the claims had been previously 
dismissed by U.S. District Judge Nicholas Politan in Newark, with the judge 
ruling they could not be brought again. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya has two defenses of his World Boxing Organization lightweight 
championship firmly scheduled: Oct. 8, at the Grand Olympic Auditorium, against 
John Avila, and on the Roy Jones-James Toney undercard Nov. 18 against an 
undetermined opponent, possibly Carl Griffith. Calendar

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fiesta Bowl will be the new bowl alliance's first potential national 
championship college football game after the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 As the highest bidder among the three alliance members at $118 million, the 
Fiesta Bowl had the option of staging the alliance's first potential title 
matchup.The game will be Jan. 2, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The new bowl alliance was created this summer to replace the existing 
agreement that expires after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 On a rotating basis, the Fiesta, Orange and Sugar bowls will have the 
opportunity to match up the two top-ranked teams from the Atlantic Coast, Big 
East, Big 12 and Southeastern conferences as well as Notre Dame. The Rose Bowl 
will continue to invite the Big Ten and Pac-10 champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fiesta Bowl's choice to be the first potential title site was disclosed 
during a news conference to announce that the Dial Corp has signed on as a 
"backup sponsor" from 1996 through Jan. 1, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 Dial will replace IBM OS/2, which notified the Fiesta Bowl on Wednesday that 
it would pull out as title sponsor after next January.

MICHIGAN NEXT FOR POWLUS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SOPHOMORE QUARTERBACK LEADS NOTRE 
DAME AGAINST WOLVERINES, WHO ARE WITHOUT FOUR INJURED STARTERS, INCLUDING 
WHEATLEY. 
</P>

<P>
 You know it's Michigan-Notre Dame week when . . .  
</P>
<P>
 -- Irish Coach Lou Holtz spends the first few days fretting about his 
offensive line, his running backs, his defensive line, his kicking game, his 
game plan, New York cable television ratings and his pronunciation of the 
Michigan second-string tailback's name. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michigan Coach Gary Moeller tweaks Holtz on the annual list of grave 
concerns. "After listening to Coach Holtz, I wasn't sure they had any players 
at all," he said. "But after watching the film, they have some players out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Key Michigan players, among them star running back Tyrone Wheatley, are out 
with injuries . . . but none of the Irish seem to care. 
</P>
<P>
 -- NBC needs smelling salts. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The outcome could influence an entire season in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan-Notre Dame week is many things, but it is never boring. Since 1978, 
the teams have met 14 times and nine of the games have been decided by seven 
points or fewer. And if you add the scores of the 14 games, the teams are 
separated by a half-point average: 20.1 for Michigan, 19.6 for Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Today shouldn't be much different as the fifth-ranked Wolverines travel to 
third-ranked Notre Dame. The Irish have won five of the last seven games and 
tied another, but rarely are the victories easy or without their share of 
occasional controversy. Remember 1992, the year Holtz got roasted for playing 
for a 17-17 tie at home? 
</P>
<P>
 This time, everyone is talking about sophomore quarterback Ron Powlus, who 
started for the first time last week and threw for four touchdowns in a 42-15 
victory over Northwestern. Holtz later called it, "a nice job," and added that 
he wasn't crazy about Powlus' mechanics and consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Holtz was thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus, who missed last season because of two broken collarbones, is trying to 
do the impossible -- keep a low profile in a high-profile position. That's hard 
to do when some people are already linking his name with the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus has lower expectations, such as playing two consecutive games without 
hurting himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I can take away from (the Northwestern game) is that it's still the same 
game I played a couple of years ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus is sound but Michigan isn't. If you're keeping count -- and they are at 
Ann Arbor -- the Wolverines have lost four starters to injury, guard Joe 
Marinaro, wide receiver Walter Smith, the heralded Wheatley and most recently, 
outside linebacker Matt Dyson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben Huff is expected to replace Dyson and Eddie Davis will fill in again for 
Wheatley, whose separated right shoulder will keep him out of practice until 
next week. If Davis struggles, look for sophomore Tim Biakabutuka (or 
"Biakapa-tutu . . . Mr. B . . . Captain B," as Holtz called him). 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever it is, Notre Dame isn't going to change its basic defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it will make much of a difference," said Irish linebacker 
Jeremy Nau. "Michigan is Michigan. It's the guys he runs behind. I could run 
behind that (offensive line) and get three, four yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just reload. They're just like us, they don't retool."

MOTORCYCLES; SCHWANTZ HOPES TO KEEP U.S. STREAK ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Schwantz's fortunes at the U.S. Motorcycle Grand Prix have not been all 
bad, but they haven't been very good, either. 
</P>
<P>
 In five races at Laguna Seca Raceway, the lanky world champion from Paige, 
Tex., has finished fifth, second, third and fourth, and he crashed while 
battling for the lead in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, more than ever, Schwantz wants his first victory here to stem the 
dominance of Mick Doohan, the Honda rider from Australia who took the world 
500cc road racing championship away from him earlier. Doohan has won eight of 
the 11 races and a victory Sunday would end American rule of its home race. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first modern-age USGP was held on the scenic 2.196-mile circuit 
through the hills of Monterey, no foreign rider has won. Eddie Lawson of Upland 
won the inaugural on a Yamaha, Wayne Rainey of Downey won the next three, all 
on Yamahas, and John Kocinski of Little Rock, Ark., won last year on a Cagiva. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much competition out there it's inevitable the Americans will lose 
one day, but I'd sure like to keep the streak going one more year," Schwantz 
said after riding a lap Friday on his Suzuki at 91.241 m.p.h., fourth fastest 
among first day qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Luca Cadalora of Italy, the No. 1 rider for Kenny Roberts' team, surprised the 
international set by posting top speed of the day, 92.152. Defending champion 
Kocinski was next at 91.965, with Doohan third at 91.245. Another qualifying 
session today will set the field for Sunday's 33-lap race. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as keeping the streak going, I want to win because it's a race I've 
never won," Schwantz said. "I finished second and third behind Wayne (Rainey), 
but I came closest in 1990 when I fell trying to find a way to beat him." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwantz was tucked in on Rainey's tailpipe going into the last corner, four 
laps from the end, when he made a mistake and slid out. The fall broke his 
wrist, a chronic problem for Schwantz. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before this year's opening race in Australia, where he was to open 
defense of his world championship, Schwantz fell while riding a mountain 
bicycle and broke his forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 "That set me back just when things were looking good for a big season," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwantz won the third race, in Japan, and after three consecutive seconds 
behind Doohan, appeared to be back in top condition. Then he fell in Holland 
and broke the wrist again. 
</P>
<P>
 Three races later, still riding with a cast, he won the British GP. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can get a high enough finish Sunday to clinch second place in the 
standings, I may have surgery on the wrist so it will be ready when winter 
testing starts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwantz was wearing a cast Friday and said, "The wrist doesn't hurt nearly as 
much when I wear it." 
</P>
<P>
 With three races remaining, he has 169 points to 123 for Alberto Puig of 
Spain, 122 for Alex Criville of Spain and 120 for Kocinski. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian Doriano Romboni, riding a Honda, set a track record of 90.451 m.p.h. 
in the 250cc class.

WITNESS FOR THE DEFENSE FINDS NEW RULES OFFENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Dent knew something was terribly wrong the first time he tried to rush 
Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like there were four blocking running backs in the backfield," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim McDonald knew something was terribly wrong when he watched Raider 
receivers streaking past him and all he could do was stand, remembering his 
coach's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "All summer long they've been saying, 'Don't touch the guy! Don't touch the 
guy!' " McDonald said. "What could I do? You have to let him go." 
</P>
<P>
 We knew there was something terribly wrong Monday morning when we picked up 
the newspaper and found this in a game summary: 
</P>
<P>
 RECEIVING: New England -- Coates 8-161. Could this be the same Ben Coates who 
had caught passes for fewer yards last year than 44 other NFL receivers? 
</P>
<P>
 The Ben Coates who'd averaged 4.1 yards a game? 
</P>
<P>
 This, this, tight end? "This league is a whole different thing now," said 
Rickey Jackson, who, like Dent and McDonald, is an embittered All-Pro defender 
for the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The owners wanted to make the game better for the fans, make it more 
entertaining," Jackson said. "And that's what has happened. We players are just 
here to put on a show." 
</P>
<P>
 Those owners, hoping to sprinkle a tad more offense into the game, unwittingly 
saturated it this spring with too many offense-friendly rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The results make it spicy for quarterbacks and receivers, but represent 
heartburn for defenders and purists. 
</P>
<P>
 A glance at Week 1 in the new National Get-Out-of-That-Guy's- 
</P>
<P>
 Way-and-Let-Him-Score League: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eight teams scored 30 or more points. Seven quarterbacks threw for 300 or 
more yards. In six games, each team scored 20 or more points. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the above happened even once last year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In the 14 openers, teams combined for an average of 46.6 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1993 season, teams averaged nearly a touchdown and a field goal 
less, 37.4 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With three of the best defensive backs in the game, guys averaging 
$1.7-million salaries a year, the New England Patriot defense gave up the most 
passing yardage in the club's 35-yard history. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Hurst, Myron Guyton and Ricky Reynolds were no match for Dan Marino's 
473 yards for the Miami Dolphins -- even though this was Marino's first game 
since Achilles' tendon surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of 138 kickoffs, 121 were returned, or 87.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in week one, of 140 kickoffs, 81 were returned, or 57.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the first time in five years, the average return yardage increased 
more than two yards from the previous year, from 18.2 to 20.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Why all the freaky numbers? Know your new rule book: 
</P>
<P>
 -- With referees under a mandate to enforce a no-chucking rule beyond five 
yards from the line of scrimmage, receivers are able to run uninhibited to 
their proper spots. 
</P>
<P>
 If they tell a quarterback they are going to be somewhere, they are almost 
assured of getting there. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the timing patterns that guys use today, it's a perfect rule for the 
offense," McDonald said. "You can't even slow a guy down." 
</P>
<P>
 -- With offensive linemen allowed to line up eight more inches off the line of 
scrimmage -- at the center's waistline -- the quarterback's pocket begins 
forming even before the snap. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might as well put a running back's jersey on some of these linemen," 
said Neil Smith, defensive end for the Kansas City Chiefs. "The pocket is now 
huge." 
</P>
<P>
 -- With kickoffs pushed back five yards to the 30, only a return man with 
cramps will not give his team good field position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you see where some of those teams are starting from?" Dent said. "With 
that kind of field position, it's a lot easier to score." 
</P>
<P>
 Will the outburst continue? Our guess is, sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 Referees will probably back off on the no-chucking rule as their attention 
span wanes, but quarterbacks will still have more time and teams will still 
seemingly start each drive somewhere around the 35-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 And somewhere, even offensive guru Sid Gillman will wince. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of this stuff is crazy," Gillman said. "You talk about all these records 
that will be set. Well, they are going to have to put parentheses after those 
records and mention the rules that helped caused them." 
</P>
<P>
 We agree. And we wonder, when will this league learn to leave well enough 
alone? 
</P>
<P>
 A tad more scoring can make the average game great. A lot more scoring only 
makes it cheap. ROOKIE WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 Those who saw the Indianapolis Colts' Marshall Faulk run for about 500 yards 
and 10 touchdowns last Sunday -- that's how many we counted after three 
highlight shows -- are convinced he will be this year's best first-round draft 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who watched Dan (Big Daddy) Wilkinson of the Cincinnati Bengals 
chasing terrified Cleveland Browns out of the backfield are convinced he will 
be the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were those who saw New York Jet cornerback Aaron Glenn help hold 
the Buffalo Bills to 173 yards passing. And those who saw Cleveland cornerback 
Antonio Langham make a game-saving interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask player personnel directors after just one game, and they all still love 
their first picks. 
</P>
<P>
 We aren't among them. 
</P>
<P>
 An early rating of the first-rounders, seven gems and four bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 1-Faulk: Experts say truly great NFL running backs are great from the first 
moment they step onto the field. Makes sense here. 
</P>
<P>
 2-Wilkinson: He made one tackle where it appeared he began the play in the 
backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 3-Glenn: In the kid's physical duel with Andre Reed, Reed blinked first. 
</P>
<P>
 4-Langham: Redeemed himself after allowing touchdown pass to Darnay Scott. By 
adding him to Don Griffin, Eric Turner and Stevon Moore, the Browns might have 
created one of best secondaries in football. 
</P>
<P>
 5-Bernard Williams, tackle, Philadelphia Eagles: Of the five sacks his line 
allowed to the New York Giants, none were his fault. 
</P>
<P>
 6-Dwayne Washington, cornerback, Minnesota Vikings: Almost decapitated the 
Green Bay Packers' Sterling Sharpe on one play. Our opinion of him soared. 
</P>
<P>
 7-Todd Steussie, tackle, Vikings: Suffered only one breakdown during the loss 
to the Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 1-Henry Ford, defensive end, Houston Oilers: The only sound first-round pick 
who didn't even suit up Sunday. A real Edsel. 
</P>
<P>
 2-Wayne Gandy, tackle, Rams: The only sound first-round pick beaten out by 
somebody named Clarence Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 3-Trent Dilfer, quarterback, Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Misses summer workouts, 
holds out during most of training camp, forces team to lose with Craig 
Erickson. 
</P>
<P>
 4-Derrick Alexander, receiver, Browns: One of only two first-round picks who 
suited up but did not play Sunday. The other was Dallas defensive end Shante 
Carver, who watched Charles Haley rack up four sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander had no such excuse. A NEW SINGLE-GAME RECORD FOR SELFISHNESS 
</P>
<P>
 Fuzzy Thurston, a guard for the Packers during their glory years and now a 
popular bar owner in Green Bay, was in his car last Saturday morning when the 
news came over the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver Sterling Sharpe had left the Packer camp and was not going to play in 
Sunday's season opener against the Vikings unless the team renegotiated a 
contract he had already signed through the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have wrung his neck," Thurston said. "I was amazed that he could have 
let his team down like that." 
</P>
<P>
 He was speaking for all of Green Bay, a hard-working, conservative town that 
would have forced the Packers to trade Sharpe if he had not changed his mind 
and actually played. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, they would have had to trade him if he didn't show up," Thurston said. 
"Nobody in this town would have ever forgiven him." 
</P>
<P>
 Thurston said folks in his bar were hoping Saturday that Sharpe would actually 
stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all said, 'The hell with him. Who is he? We don't need him!' " Thurston 
said. "But then he comes back and, well, you know. On the field, the guy is a 
heck of a player." 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers insist that Sharpe, whose $1.9-million salary this season is less 
than four of his teammates including tackle Ken Ruettgers, received no extra 
money to return. Apparently he was just given some future salary in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe rewarded the Packers with a touchdown catch. But three days later in 
practice, he was back to his old tricks, failing to pick up an errant pass even 
though he was the only player within 25 yards of the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sharpe returned to the line of scrimmage, a water boy ran 55 yards and 
retrieved the ball before the next play. QUICK HITTERS * TRUTH BE TOLD: If 
Steve Young had known Joe Montana would play so long after having back surgery 
in 1986, he never would have agreed to be traded from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
to the San Francisco 49ers in 1987, according to agent Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of facing Montana in football's ranking blood feud this weekend in 
Kansas City, Young would have been playing for the Green Bay Packers or Arizona 
Cardinals, according to Steinberg.  
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Walsh told us he thought Joe would not properly recover from the back 
surgery," Steinberg said. "We believed him. The last thing we wanted to do was 
to walk into a quarterback controversy. Joe just surprised people." 
</P>
<P>
 What a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT TIMING! On Monday night, Young passed Montana to become the all-time 
passing ratings leader with a 93.433 rating. Montana has a 93.328 rating. 
</P>
<P>
 * EVERETT VS. MILLER, CHAPTER ONE: After one week, former Ram quarterback Jim 
Everett has more than twice the passer rating, 92.8, of his replacement, Chris 
Miller, 41.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett threw for 326 yards, more than all but four other passers in the 
league. Miller completed six passes, fewer than every other starting 
quarterback in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned, Ram fans. It will get worse before it gets better. 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU SEE, THIS LABOR AGREEMENT IS GOOD FOR SOMETHING: In the five days after 
the NFL's opening weekend, only five players were waived or released. Last year 
during that same period, with no salary cap, 12 players were waived or 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 The more-than-50% drop can be attributed mostly to teams not wanting to mess 
up their arrangement under the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that has something to do with it," said Bob Ackles, Arizona assistant 
general manager. "If you put a guy on waivers and he is claimed, his bonus 
accelerates into this year's cap. And if you release a guy, you've got to 
replace him with something better." 
</P>
<P>
 Meaning something costlier, which few teams can afford, once their salaries 
are arranged like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
 * SIGN OF THE TIMES: Receiver Rob Moore of the New York Jets set off the 
airport metal detectors in Buffalo last week. What was it, his keys? His coins? 
</P>
<P>
 Try a screw that had been inserted into his broken left wrist, and an 
electronic stimulator that had been attached to the joint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I had to get frisked," Moore told reporters. "For some reason, I tried 
to walk through. I told them, 'It's a long story, and I don't have enough time 
to explain.' "

JORDAN TAKES OFF THE GLOVE, SCORES 52 IN A CHARITY GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jordan, in his first public basketball appearance in 15 months, showed 
on Friday that he has lost none of his incomparable moves since he retired and 
took up baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored 52 points on an assortment of dunks, drives and jumpers, delighting 
a sellout crowd of 18,671 in the final basketball game at Chicago Stadium, 
where he'd led the Bulls to three consecutive NBA titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can still do this," Jordan said of his performance in a charity game 
sponsored by former Chicago Bulls teammate Scottie Pippen. "I just don't have 
to do it in front of 18,676." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan made 24-of-46 shots as his team won, 187-150. 
</P>
<P>
 As the final minutes ticked off, the crowd stood and screamed, "Michael! 
Michael!" 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, guarded by Pippen, didn't disappoint. He hit a fall-away jumper and 
seconds later weaved his way from halfcourt for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
 The final seconds became a game of one-on-one between Jordan and Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen and Jordan missed their final shots, then hugged as the game ended. 
Jordan knelt and kissed the red Bulls insignia on the floor.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; DAVIS MISSES PRACTICE, UNLIKELY TO PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defensive end Scott Davis missed practice for the third consecutive day Friday 
because of what were termed "personal problems" by Coach Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not listed among those deactivated for Sunday's home opener 
against the Seattle Seahawks at the Coliseum, Davis is not expected to 
play.That will put further pressure on a defensive line already thin because of 
Howie Long's retirement and the release of Greg Townsend. Without Davis, the 
Raiders would move Nolan Harrison from tackle to end and insert Jerry Ball into 
the lineup at tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting every game of the 1990 and '91 seasons for the Raiders, Davis 
sat out the following two years, opting to go into business. But, at age 29, he 
returned as unexpectedly as he had left, saying he still felt he could 
contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders are looking for another running back to replace Napoleon McCallum, 
who suffered a season-ending knee injury in Monday night's opener. Rather than 
bring back Randy Jordan or Derrick Gainer, two backs cut before the start of 
the season, the Raiders are first looking at other possible replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 Until they find a suitable substitute, they will not place McCallum on the 
injured reserve list. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deactivated for Sunday's opener are McCallum, defensive lineman Willie 
Broughton, linebacker James Folston and offensive lineman Rich Stephens. The 
Raiders must deactivate three more players before kickoff. STEVE SPRINGER

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; HENLEY EXPECTED TO RAISE BOND MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE and MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The agent for Ram cornerback Darryl Henley said Friday he has a "high degree 
of confidence" that his client can raise an extra $400,000 bond ordered by a 
federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Demoff said Henley will likely raise the money through friends, 
although the additional amount "obviously creates a problem." John Shaw, Ram 
president, also said it was his understanding Henley would have no trouble 
coming up with the extra money. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Gary L. Taylor ordered that Henley's local 
bail -- the amount he is required to post while he is in the Central District 
of California -- be raised from $200,000 to $600,000. Henley had already posted 
the original $200,000, secured by his parents' property in Upland. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional amount, which includes a 10% cash deposit, must be raised by 
next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have posted a separate $2-million bond for Henley that applies to the 
time that he travels with the team. Part of that bond is secured by a 
$1-million insurance policy with Lloyd's of London. 
</P>

<P>
 Tight end Troy Drayton caught only six passes in four exhibition games and 
didn't catch a ball in the season-opening victory over Arizona. But Coach Chuck 
Knox insists Drayton isn't lost in the team's game plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some balls called for Troy last week," Knox said. "We have every week. 
One time, he wasn't exactly where he should have been, or he probably would 
have had a big play. The other time, the quarterback fell down, and Troy was 
wide open. It would have been a 40-yard completion." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Backup left tackle Wayne Gandy, the Rams' first round-draft pick who barely 
played in the season opener last week, split time with starter Clarence Jones 
in practice Friday. "He's got a chance to play some," Knox said of Gandy. "He's 
coming along pretty good." . . . . Defensive end Gerald Robinson, running back 
James Bostic, offensive lineman Chuck Belin and linebacker Brett Collins are 
inactive for Sunday's game. MARK PLATTE and MIKE REILLEY

MCCUTCHEON LEADS BISHOP AMAT; PREP FOOTBALL: HE SCORES FIVE TOUCHDOWNS IN HIS 
TAILBACK DEBUT TO HELP BEAT CARSON, 34-7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was quite a debut at tailback for Daylon McCutcheon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bishop Amat High senior tailback rushed for 253 yards and scored five 
touchdowns while leading the top-ranked Lancers to a 34-7 victory over visiting 
Carson in a nonleague football game Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still learning the position," said the modest McCutcheon, who previously 
had been a standout receiver and defensive back for Amat. "I told my line, 'You 
take care of me, and I'll take care of you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, it would be hard to find more caring teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easy to see what kind of night McCutcheon, son of former Ram running 
back Lawrence McCutcheon, would have from the first time he touched the ball, 
when he took a handoff to his left and ran 76 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 He carried the ball five times in the first half and scored three touchdowns 
to give Bishop Amat (1-0) a 21-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why didn't I give him the ball more?" said Tom Salter, Bishop Amat's 
first-year coach. "Heck, we only had it for 13 plays in the first half -- 
Carson is a good team. We always want to get him the ball as much as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-ranked Carson (0-1) scared Amat early when Eric Davis ran the opening 
kickoff back 94 yards, apparently for a touchdown. However, the play was called 
back because of a clipping penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson managed to control the ball for nearly 14 minutes of the first half, 
but mistakes proved costly.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was enough to cause Salter some anxiety. "Really, I'm just glad the 
first one is over," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Salter took over the program this season from the highly successful Mark 
Peredes, who left to coach at Riverside North.

FOR AGASSI, THE U.S. OPEN IS NOT A SHUT CASE -- YET; TENNIS: LONGSHOT FROM LAS 
VEGAS PLAYS MARTIN AND STICH FACES NOVACEK IN TODAY'S SEMIFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The men's semifinals of the Andre Agassi-U.S. Open tennis tournament will be 
played today. Actually, Agassi is not a sponsor of the event. He merely owns it 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The unseeded Agassi began the tournament as both a Las Vegas longshot and a 
longshot from Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 And in his non-matching blue and black tennis outfit, long straggly hair 
flowing from under his black cap toward his black socks and black and white 
shoes, he is a sight to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is the apple of tennis fans' eye in the Big Apple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is talking about Andre, everybody thinking he is going to win, and 
that's just the way I like it," said Michael Stich of Germany, another 
semifinalist, who will play Karel Novacek of the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Many believe Stich, seeded fourth, will get through to Sunday's final and give 
the tennis world a matchup of former Wimbledon champions, Stich having won in 
1991 and Agassi in 1992. It would be strawberries and cream in Flushing Meadow, 
which, hopefully, would be better than it sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But before either gets to Sunday, when a victory by Agassi would make him only 
the second man in the history of the tournament -- since Vic Seixas in 1954 -- 
to take out five seeded players, each must pass a formidable test. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi will play Todd Martin, the other seeded player who got through to the 
semifinals in a men's draw as full of casualties as your basic Clipper 
transaction. Martin, seeded ninth, is the only male to have made it to the 
semifinals of three Grand Slam events this year. He lost in the final of the 
Australian to Pete Sampras and in the semifinals at Wimbledon to Sampras. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin has played Agassi five times and won three matches, among them a 
five-setter this year at Wimbledon. At 24, Martin is the same age as Agassi, 
but he started his climb on the tour much later than Agassi, who, in his early 
teens, left the bright lights of Las Vegas for the bright lights of the 
Bollettieri Tennis Academy in Florida. When Agassi was playing Ivan Lendl in 
the semifinals of this tournament in 1988, at 18, Martin was out on one of the 
back courts, playing in the junior boys' event. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, 6-feet-6 and kind of a gentle giant, did the unthinkable and 
unforgivable for those who are to make it big on the pro tennis tour: He went 
to college, Northwestern University, and stayed for two years. Nevertheless, it 
is fair to say that both are educated in the Greek tradition. Martin read 
Socrates, Agassi read Nick. 
</P>
<P>
 On the court, Agassi is an all-court player, capable of rallying with anybody 
from the backcourt, capable of returning anybody's serve and capable of serving 
and volleying, if necessary. He is fast, flamboyant, flashy. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin is an all-court player too, capable of playing well from the backcourt 
and capable of serving and volleying with the best of them. He is not fast, not 
flamboyant and not flashy. The likely key to this match is that Martin will 
serve 110-m.p.h. shots at Agassi, who might very well return them at about 115. 
</P>
<P>
 The big serve will also be a big issue in the Stich-Novacek semifinal. Stich 
has a first serve that frequently exceeds 120. Novacek's is slightly slower but 
so effective that he hit 28 aces in his five-set semifinal victory over Jaime 
Yzaga of Peru. The difference will be that Stich follows his big serve to the 
net, whereas Novacek stands at the baseline and admires his. 
</P>
<P>
 They have played six times and Stich has won four matches, on various 
surfaces. For Stich, who has gone out early in most Grand Slam events since his 
1991 victory over Boris Becker in the Wimbledon final, this U.S. Open is 
nevertheless somewhat familiar territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so for Novacek, a 29-year-old veteran, who is known for playing lots of 
tournaments and having lots of single-day successes, but never really breaking 
through in a big tournament. For him, this is Christmas in September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been playing masters, I have been playing everything basically that 
exists in tennis," he said after beating Yzaga. "But I never went to a 
semifinal of a Grand Slam, so today I am very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Novacek, ranked No. 56 in the world, will also be the longest longshot to get 
through to Sunday. Stich, who has his remarkably fluid game flowing quite 
nicely now, might be the pick of the savvy tennis insiders. Martin will be the 
choice and heartthrob of middle America, whose values and style he so clearly 
represents. 
</P>
<P>
 And Agassi? What should he care? He owns this place.

U.S. SWIM CHIEF CONFRONTS CHINESE WITH DRUG CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dennis Pursley, U.S Swimming's national team director, confronted China's 
national coach Friday with allegations that the use of banned substances is 
responsible for the startling success of the Chinese women. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole issue kind of makes me sick to my stomach," Pursley said after 
meeting with China's Chen Yunpen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese women have won seven of the first 10 events during this week's 
World Championships, including Friday's 100-meter butterfly, and officials from 
Australia, Canada, France and Sweden have called upon the international 
swimming federation, FINA, to establish stricter anti-drug measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Liu Limin finished first in the 100 butterfly in 58.98 seconds, breaking 
American Mary T. Meagher's 12-year-old meet record of 59.41. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian Samantha Riley won the other women's final Friday night, the 100 
breaststroke, swimming a world-record time of 1:07.69. 
</P>
<P>
 In a men's final, Australian Kieren Perkins, set a world record in the 400 
freestyle with a time of 3:43.80. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley and Germany's Franziska van Almsick are the only non-Chinese women with 
gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a great deal of respect for the Chinese athletes and their coaches but 
there is no question the circumstantial evidence is overwhelming that they have 
an added advantage through drugs," Pursley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his meeting with Chen, Pursley said, "It was a very painful conversation. I 
wanted to face-to-face share my thoughts and concerns. I've had a lot of 
respect for him as a coach and a person and still do." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Chen's reaction, Pursley said, "He had pretty much the same 
response that you've read and heard many times before. If he was angry, he 
didn't show it."

SWIMMING / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; JAGER PROVIDES PUSH FOR U.S. RELAY TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the men's 400-meter freestyle relay at the 1992 Summer Olympics, the 
U.S. team's most experienced swimmer, Tom Jager, gave a speech that the team's 
least experienced member recalls so vividly that he was able to repeat it 
almost word for word Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told us that no U.S. team had ever lost that relay in the Summer Olympics, 
and that he didn't want us to be the first," said Jon Olsen, who swam the 
anchor leg in that gold-medal effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Substitute World Championships for Summer Olympics, and those are the words 
that Olsen, now a veteran of 25, passed on to his three teammates before the 
400 freestyle relay at the Foro Italico pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the guys responded very well," said Olsen after the United States 
had upheld its winning tradition with a meet-record time of 3 minutes 16.90 
seconds, the third-fastest of all-time, to upset the Russians, including anchor 
Alexander Popov, who finished in 3:18.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Popov, the world 100 freestyle champion and world-record holder, was so far 
behind when he dived into the water that all he could do was improve his team's 
standing from fourth to second. It would have been interesting to see the 
finish if he had been closer at the start because, although he had the fastest 
split at 48.22, Gary Hall swam the last 100 for the United States in an 
excellent 48.48 and might have gone faster if challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as the fourth night of the World Championships ended, U.S. swimmers were 
having a good time to celebrate a good time. Unfortunately for them, there have 
been too few of either this week for a U.S. team that is likely to be 
remembered as the least decorated ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The relay team's gold medal Friday night was only the Americans' second, and 
even the optimists among them foresee only three more winners in the final two 
days: Janet Evans in the 800 freestyle, Jeff Rouse in the 100 backstroke and 
the men's 400 individual medley relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has never won fewer than its seven golds from the 1986 World 
Championships in Madrid. But even that team never suffered the indignity that 
this one did Friday, when no woman finished among the top 16 in the 100 
breaststroke preliminaries. It was the first time in the World Championships 
that an American did not qualify for either the A or the B finals in an event. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. women were shut out of medals Friday, leaving them with six in 10 
events and no golds. Of course, no country's women are winning many medals 
except for the Chinese. But the U.S. men are faring only slightly better with 
two golds among their six medals after 10 events. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. men's coach, Jon Urbanchek of the University of Michigan, said that 
most of the swimmers were in no condition to peak again only three weeks after 
competing in the national championships, which served as the trials for this 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who did come back strong were those who weren't challenged at the U.S. 
nationals," he said. "But that meet took a toll on the youngsters who gave 
everything they had just to get here. It's unfair to ask them to come into this 
lion's den only 20 days later." 
</P>
<P>
 Two U.S. medal probables remained at home, Melvin Stewart because of a 
tonsillectomy and Jager because of a dispute with national team director Dennis 
Pursley about the schedule for reporting to a pre-meet training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. breaststroker Seth Van Neerden said that Pursley's inflexibility has 
caused low morale. Three swimmers were disciplined Friday, two for arriving 
late for the morning preliminaries, even though they were not competing, and 
one for missing curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have some 16-year-olds on the team, but not everyone should be treated 
as if we're that age," said Van Neerden, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 But 24-year-old Eric Wunderlich, who finished second in Friday night's 
200-meter breaststroke behind Hungary's Norbert Rozsa, said that he had never 
been with a U.S. team that has gotten along better. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best group I've been associated with," said Pursley, who has been 
in his position since 1989. "If anything has dampened their spirits, it's that 
they haven't swum as fast as we're capable of."

COMMENTARY; IT'S TIME FOR AGASSI TO SEIZE HIS OPEN MOMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There has never been a great American tennis player who did not win the U.S. 
Open. If Andre Agassi wants to be remembered, it is time for him to win it. 
</P>
<P>
 He won Wimbledon once. A lot of people have won one major. It is when you do 
it again that people begin to believe you really are a champion. There comes a 
time in sports when you declare yourself. Andre Agassi is supposed to declare 
himself this weekend at the Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Riddick Bowe won a big title fight once. He was colorful and made a lot of 
money in a hurry. Now no one remembers the last time Bowe did anything. It will 
be that way for Agassi one of these days. It is why this chance to win the Open 
might be the best he will ever have. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi always has had the game. He hits shots off the ground, catches the ball 
on the rise and attacks from the back of the court, the way Jimmy Connors 
could. Agassi has done that now for five straight matches at the Open. In the 
past, on big points, Agassi played as if you could park cars inside his head. 
He also played scared, going for more shot than he had to, unwilling to play 
the point out. 
</P>
<P>
 In tennis, that is a form of choking. It has not happened to Agassi at the '94 
Open, at least not yet. At this Open, Agassi has looked like a finisher. He has 
been a star, not some loopy tennis starlet, going from one pose to another, one 
hairstyle to another. 
</P>
<P>
 He had one dream run like this before, at Wimbledon in 1992. Agassi played 
beautifully on the grass, then ended up with a dream draw when he got to the 
last weekend. His semifinal opponent was John McEnroe. Agassi made McEnroe, who 
had once owned Wimbledon, look like some sad, used-up batting practice pitcher. 
The score for Agassi was 6-4, 6-2, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in the final, Agassi got Goran Ivanisevic, who had a huge serve and no 
idea when the service return came back. The two of them went all the way to 
4-all in the fifth set. Then Ivanisevic's left elbow turned to concrete and 
Agassi surprised everybody, himself most of all, by winning Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, he had always come apart in the late innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he reaches a crossroads in his career, even though he is only 24. If he 
wins the Open Sunday -- if he can beat Todd Martin today and then win the final 
-- everything changes for him, and tennis is luckier for that. If he cannot 
grab this moment, with Pete Sampras out of the way, then maybe one major is all 
he has in him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe the optimum years for a tennis player are between the ages 
of 24 and 27," Brad Gilbert, Agassi's new coach, was saying the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told Andre that out of the next eight (majors), he can win three. You 
can't win one and be satisfied. I really expect that over the next nine months, 
he's going to be in the top two in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Martin will not be an easy opponent for Agassi today. Martin played 
Sampras in the final of the Australian Open in January, then made it to the 
semifinals of Wimbledon. He is having a much better year than Agassi. But 
Martin also nurses a groin injury and may be too slow, the way Agassi is 
running opponents all over the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are the same for Martin as for Agassi but there will not be the 
same urgency for Martin somehow. This Open seems more important to Andre 
Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
 If Agassi can win it, maybe he can make it all the way to No. 2 in the world 
behind Sampras. Maybe the two of them can build a rivalry that is more than 
just one Open final. Maybe what we really find out this weekend is if Agassi 
has it in him to be the whole show in tennis, not just a sideshow.

DEL MAR; NOW, NAKATANI GIVES LESSONS TO HIS TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in 1990, when Corey Nakatani was losing his five-pound apprentice weight 
allowance, he kept hearing an unsettling question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where," he was repeatedly asked, "are you going to ride now?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken aback at first because such a question was a not-too-veiled 
suggestion that he had to leave Southern California and go elsewhere, such as 
South Dakota or Sri Lanka, to prove that he could win without "the bug." 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept saying I was staying right here," Nakatani said Friday. "I won over 
200 races with the bug. I thought I deserved to stay here. I think I showed I 
had the ability to deserve a shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani, 23, was sitting in the jockeys' lunch room shortly after he had 
brought Baja Bill home a winner in the second race. He had also won the first 
on He's Domineering, an appropriate name for the horse considering the man on 
his back has moved into a comfortable lead in the rider standings at the Del 
Mar meeting. Those winners were his 42nd and 43rd and he later added a 44th to 
give him a seven-victory advantage over runner-up Gary Stevens. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was the nation's leading apprentice rider in 1989, Nakatani has 
never won the riding title at a racetrack meeting. Kent Desormeaux has won the 
last three years here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in the hunt last year," Nakatani said, "but I got (a 10-day suspension) 
and it cost me being right there." 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani's chances this year might also have been hurt by a suspension he 
incurred this week for a ride on Eagle Eyed in Monday's Del Mar Derby. He got 
five days for bumping Desormeaux's Marvin's Faith coming down the stretch, and 
his horse was disqualified from third to seventh place. Nakatani went to court 
and got an injunction allowing him to continue to ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident caused a brief rift between the jockeys, Nakatani supposedly 
believing Desormeaux refused to give him room in retaliation for something he 
had done to Desormeaux earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was kidding between me and Kent that got overheard and exaggerated," 
Nakatani said. "We both ride to win and we both ride with our horses as the top 
priority. I think I was on the best horse in that race, definitely the best 
3-year-old grass horse in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, things did not go well for Nakatani in the Del Mar Derby. However, 
among his accomplishments at this meeting are stakes victories on King's Blade 
in the Bing Crosby Handicap, Approach The Bench in the Eddie Read Handicap, 
D'hallevant in the Pat O'Brien Breeders' Cup Handicap and Gold Splash in the 
Osunitas Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani will be on D'hallevant in the six-horse Del Mar Budweiser Breeders' 
Cup Sunday and he figures as a factor against Brocco, a horse making his first 
start since the Kentucky Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he has an exceptional chance," Nakatani said. "He has early speed and 
that helps in any kind of a race. It helps keep him out of trouble and lets you 
do what you want to do with a race." 
</P>
<P>
 Although D'hallevant might represent Nakatani's strongest entrant in this 
weekend's stakes races, he also has Shir Dar in today's Palomar Handicap for 
older fillies and mares. The Grade II event is an upward step for the Bobby 
Frankel-trained filly, who has spent most of the year on the allowance level. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like an evenly matched race to me," Nakatani said, "and it's on the 
turf. I really believe the horse who gets the best trip wins on the turf." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his success, Nakatani does not have to climb aboard very many 
longshots. The ultimate compliment is paid to a jockey by racegoers when they 
begin to bet horses because he is riding them. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani might not be an apprentice any more, but he is still going to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laffit Pincay is my idol," he said. "To this day he's the best from the 
eighth-pole to the wire. I watch him . . . and he's a big part of my success. 
You look around here and you've got Gary Stevens, Chris McCarron, Eddie 
Delahoussaye, the greatest riders in the world. You've got to learn around 
these guys." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Juddmonte Farms entry of Skimble, ridden by Pat Day, and Nidd, ridden by 
Eddie Delahoussaye, is the 9-5 favorite in today's Palomar Handicap. 
Delahoussaye is back for the first time since he was injured in a mishap last 
Saturday. Second choice is another entry, Mr. and Mrs. Martin Wygod's Glass 
Ceiling, with Chris McCarron aboard, and Private Persuasion, with Alex Solis 
up, at 5-2. . . . The Rocking Chair Derby, a showcase for retired riders, will 
be held between the fifth and sixth races without parimutuel betting. . . . 
Stellar Affair, ridden by Gary Stevens, was the winner of the $60,000 Matching 
Handicap Friday. . . . A federal judge in Syracuse, N.Y., refused to vacate an 
Internal Revenue Service lien imposed on Devil His Due's owner as a way of 
collecting back taxes from her father. However, U.S. District Judge Thomas 
McAvoy granted a preliminary injunction that will allow Devil His Due to race 
Sept. 17 in the Woodward at Belmont Park. McAvoy issued his decision following 
a two-day hearing. He gave attorneys 60 days for discovery of evidence, after 
which time the judge will set a trial date. Devil His Due's owner, Edith 
LiButti, contends the IRS wrongfully placed the lien and notice of seizure on 
the horse and Lioncrest Stables in Mahwah, N.J. Although LiButti claims she is 
the sole owner of Devil His Due, the IRS contends her father is profiting from 
his association with his daughter and has an undisclosed financial interest in 
the horse.

 BANKING ON SAFETY: You can get a free photo of your youngsters in Laguna Hills 
today and help ensure their safety too. Independence One Bank of California 
will host at its branch there "Back to School Safely. . . . Bank officials will 
provide KidCare Photo kits for your school-age children to help ensure that 
police have an up-to-date photo and vital information should a child ever be 
lost of abducted. Says bank spokesman Ed Sondker: "It will at least give 
parents some peace of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 BARE & UNCOOL: The Laguna Hills safety event includes a bicycle safety 
session. Police countywide say the biggest bicycle problem remains youngsters 
not wearing their helmets as required by law. Beginning Jan. 1, police will 
issue fines -- not just warnings -- for violators. . . . In Garden Grove, 
police offer incentives, such as discounts for helmets or food coupons for 
helmet users. One motorcycle officer there, Karl Mansfield, says the problem is 
peer pressure: "It's something they don't think is cool and neat-looking." 
</P>
<P>
 WIDE KIK: You're driving to Los Angeles, your radio turned to Orange County's 
KIKF-FM country music station (94.3). And just past the Long Beach Freeway, it 
always starts to fade on you, right? No more. . . . For the first time, 
starting today, KIKF-FM's expanded signal will be clear all the way to Santa 
Clarita in northern L.A. County. Country music is no longer just for "rednecks 
and truck drivers," says KIKF President Art Astor. "Now it's more of a 
mainstream kind of entertainment for people of all walks of life." 
</P>
<P>
 HEAVY ROCK: Some 60 Orange County rock bands are expected to take part in a 
one-day local-music festival set for Oct. 22 on the grounds of Irvine Meadows 
Amphitheatre. And all will be donating their services, even though only 15% of 
the proceeds are going to charity. . . . Why play for free? "It's a chance to 
be seen by more than 300 people" in a local club, says festival co-promoter 
Tony Cardullo (F2).

PEACE FINALLY FINISHES OFF THE 'ONE NINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an emotional ceremony that opened a rush of both painful and proud 
memories, the Marine Corps on Friday deactivated the 1st Battalion, 9th 
Regiment as aging survivors of the famed unit that was known as the "Walking 
Dead" in Vietnam stood at attention, many with tear-filled eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-luck battalion, which many considered a jinxed unit during the 
Vietnam War, earned an unenviable reputation for sustaining high casualties and 
for constantly being engaged in heavy combat. 
</P>
<P>
 The "One Nine," as the unit is commonly called in the Corps, fought in the 
bloody hill battles in 1967 along the demilitarized zone between North and 
South Vietnam. It often skirmished along the coastal highway near Hue that 
soldiers in both the French and U.S. Indochina wars came to know as the Street 
Without Joy. 
</P>
<P>
 And the battalion was also at Khe Sanh in 1968 during an unprecedented, 77-day 
siege by the North Vietnamese army that many feared would become America's Dien 
Bien Phu, the offensive that led to French forces' withdrawal in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Vietnam, the battalion also fought in the island campaigns of 
World War II, including the assault on Iwo Jima, still the Marine Corps' most 
costly battle in terms of dead. 
</P>
<P>
 During the One Nine's four-year stint in Vietnam, from June, 1965, to July, 
1969, casualties of 50% or more during engagements were not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit's reputation was such that Marine and Navy corpsmen resisted being 
transferred to what was dubbed the "Purple Heart" battalion, and some wondered 
whether North Vietnamese soldiers had a special vendetta against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't jinxed, and there was no vendetta against us. It was just that we 
were in constant combat," said Dave (Beetle) Bailey, an Anaheim engineer who 
served in the One Nine from 1966 to 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, 50, was wounded for the second time on April 5, 1967, on the Street 
Without Joy, when a reinforced NVA company overran his understrength company of 
60 men, of whom 52 were either killed or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ceremony attracted dozens of former Marines and Navy corpsmen who had 
served in the battalion and who came from all over Southern California to watch 
the final folding of the battalion's colors, emblazoned with Presidential Unit 
Citations earned in World War II and Vietnam, and carrying the battalion's 
distinctive emblem -- a large black 9 pierced by a golden bolt of lightning. 
</P>
<P>
 Present-day Marines who were assigned to the One Nine were then absorbed into 
the 2nd Battalion 1st Marine Regiment, which paraded before the Vietnam 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 A Marine spokesman said the battalion's deactivation was made necessary by 
Pentagon cutbacks dictated by the Cold War's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of veterans, once inured to the pains of war, had a difficult time 
holding back tears during the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were really teen-age soldiers. The mystique of One Nine will grow to 
life-size proportions over the years," said Orange County Superior Court Judge 
David O. Carter, who was wounded three times at Khe Sanh on April 16, 1968. 
"You had a brief moment in your lifetime to walk beside true heroes. And they 
are the kids whose names are on the Vietnam (Memorial) wall." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 620 Marines and Navy corpsmen from the One Nine died in Vietnam. 
Carter, who was a platoon commander in Company C, said that 38 of "my kids went 
up the hill" on the day he was wounded, "and only eight came down." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the battalion shed most of its blood in 1967 and 1968, when the North 
Vietnamese launched aggressive and well-planned campaigns along the so-called 
demilitarized zone in Quang Tri and Thua Thien provinces, it began to earn its 
reputation almost as soon as it arrived in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Franco, 49, of Chino was the sole survivor of a five-man fire team that 
was wiped out on June 10, 1966. Franco's C Company was sweeping west of Da 
Nang, near Hill 37, when it was attacked. An enemy mortar round exploded in the 
midst of his fire team, wounding Franco in the head and killing the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was unconscious for many days, and then spent a year in the hospital in San 
Diego. The doctors put a steel plate in my head and I was returned to duty, but 
not to Vietnam," said Franco. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Vietnam War, the unit's casualties could occasionally be blamed on 
the Marines' tactics as often as they could be attributed to their enemy's 
cunning or their own heroism. Critics used to say that the Marine infantry 
manual consisted of a single page, on which there was but a single printed 
line: "Hey diddle, diddle, straight up the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, this was the only tactic used against an enemy that was skillful in 
outflanking its attackers, in defensive fighting and in picking the most 
opportune time to engage the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the courage of individual Marines, who often fought under the most 
trying conditions, was never questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years of the war, most fights were small unit engagements. But 
all that changed in 1967 in the hill battles along the DMZ, said Al Slater, 
former commander of A Company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world changed overnight. The NVA came down with bigger guns and more 
people. We were outnumbered and outgunned. Many Marines died at Con Thien, Dong 
Ha, Cam Lo, Camp Carroll and the Rock Pile," said Slater, 53, a juvenile 
probation officer in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The hill battles where One Nine distinguished itself were fierce, often fought 
in fog and monsoon rain. The fighting was close, hand-to-hand and personal. 
There was no quarter given by either side, and it was understood that anyone 
wounded and left behind on the battlefield was not likely to be taken prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came across many Marines who were wounded and then shot in the head by the 
NVA. There was a lot of bitterness and anger. We hated the NVA, but we also 
respected them," said Slater. "There were times when my Marines killed enemy 
prisoners before I could stop them. You don't condone things like that, but you 
understand why it happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said he has an indelible image of the Walking Dead, symbolized by his 
own company, which was wiped out the night he was wounded. As the Marines were 
walking in a line across a field, an illumination round burst overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Instinctively, the men froze in place as the eerie shadows cast by the 
artificial light rippled across the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just for a second I looked to each side of me and saw a line of gray figures, 
but I couldn't see their faces. 'These are the Walking Dead,' I said to 
myself," Bailey recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the NVA began firing, catching the Marines in a deadly 
cross-fire before flanking and overrunning the company.

TRANSCRIPT PAINTS GRISLY PORTRAIT OF JET IN DISTRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC and JUDY PASTERNAK, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As lightning flashed across a stormy sky and a priest walked among the dead 
intoning last rites, federal officials said Friday the reason a USAir jetliner 
crashed on a nearby hilltop remained a mystery and revealed that a member of 
the cockpit crew shouted seconds before the plane hit: "Oh, God! . . . Traffic 
emergency! Oh, s---! Ahhh! Ahhhh! Ahhh! Ahhhh!" 
</P>
<P>
 There was no hint in the crew member's words about what caused the crash 
Thursday evening which killed all 132 people aboard the plane. The words were 
in a transcript of radio transmissions between the cockpit and a Pittsburgh 
area air traffic controller, made public by the Federal Aviation 
Administration. The transcript drew a horrifying portrait of an airliner in 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
 7:02:22 (p.m. EDT), air traffic controller: "USAir (Flight) 427, turn left, 
heading one-zero-zero. Traffic will be 1 to 2 o'clock, six miles, northbound 
Jetstream climbing out of (runway) 33 for 5,000 (feet)." 
</P>
<P>
 7:02:32, USAir 427: "We're looking for the traffic, turning to one-zero-zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said this was acknowledgment of a routine warning to expect 
another plane in the area -- but so far away it could not have caused the 
crash. Then, suddenly: 
</P>
<P>
 7:03:10, USAir 427: "Oh (unintelligible). Oh, God!" 
</P>
<P>
 7:03:14, controller: "USAir 427, maintain 6,000. Over?" 
</P>
<P>
 7:03:16, USAir 427: "Traffic emergency! Oh, s---! Ahhh! Ahhhh! Ahhh! Ahhhh" 
</P>
<P>
 7:03:24, controller: "USAir 427, Pittsburgh (calling)." 
</P>
<P>
 The controller repeated the plea three more times. And then, finally, came the 
last transmission: 
</P>
<P>
 7:04:38, controller: "USAir 427, radar contact lost!" 
</P>
<P>
 A wind-whipped rain turned the hilltop crash site into a bog Friday as the 
priest struggled through the mud tending to the dead and workers tried to 
identify and sort charred and dismembered human remains. U.S. Transportation 
Secretary Federico Pena visited the scene and told reporters afterward: "We're 
all very much at a loss to explain this accident." 
</P>
<P>
 The plane, a Boeing 737 flying from Chicago to Pittsburgh, plunged out of a 
clear sky. It was not known whether the crew member who was recorded by 
Pittsburgh controllers was the pilot or co-pilot, but his words gave no 
indication of weather problems. Indeed, Carl Vogt, a member of the National 
Transportation Safety Board, said a cockpit voice recorder, which captured what 
crew members said to one another, also "does not add much to why this 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogt told a news conference that pieces of light insulating material from the 
aircraft were found two miles from the crash site. But he indicated they were 
light enough to have been blown away from the scene. "We don't have any 
indication," he said, "that it (the plane) was not intact upon impact. . . . 
There is no indication of (midair) explosions." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators found both of the plane's jet engines, Vogt said, and their 
turbine blades were bent, indicating that they were under power when the 
aircraft hit the ground. Information on a digital flight data recorder, he 
said, showed that the engines were operating at identical power settings. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 6,000 feet, Vogt said, "the aircraft rolled (abnormally) left, and it 
was 23 seconds until it hit the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine eyewitnesses, interviewed Friday, said nothing fell from the plane and 
there were no explosions, Vogt reported. Some recounted hearing a loud 
thrusting noise, followed by a whine, typical of a jet engine accelerating. 
Vogt said all nine recalled that the plane plunged straight down, nose first. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the witnesses were two youngsters, who were taken aside by investigators 
after their mother brought them to a press briefing tent. The two had been at 
soccer practice at opposite ends of a playing field, about a half mile from 
where the plane fell. They said they had seen its fatal plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard the engine stuttering," said Jason Moka, 10. "We saw fire from the 
engines. It was going pretty fast, and it made a big loud shaking. Everybody 
was running. It was big, low, and then it climbed and then went down. The wing 
went up. It went belly-up in the air and then nose down." 
</P>
<P>
 His brother, Justin, 6, added: "It made a spiral, a very steady spiral." 
</P>
<P>
 Their accounts matched those of the other witnesses in every respect except on 
the question of whether there was an engine fire and whether the plane climbed 
briefly before it fell. NTSB investigators, Vogt said, have found no evidence 
of either. 
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the NTSB said there were reports of an aircraft that was 
trailing the fatal plane by three miles. Its pilot and co-pilot might have seen 
the crash unfold, the source said, and also might be able to help 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the investigators slogged through the mud marking the spot where 
each piece of human remains was found. Vogt said the investigators, along with 
other workers and personnel from police and fire agencies wore special suits to 
protect them from biological hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 This, Vogt said, was "because of the possibility of blood-borne pathogens -- 
AIDS or some other disease like that which could be transmitted by blood. 
Anytime you have bodies and dismemberment like this, you have that hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the bio-hazard suits, some of the workers wore yellow boots, 
face masks and rubber gloves sealed to their suit sleeves with duct tape. The 
workers lined up for tetanus and hepatitis shots. The crash site smelled like 
burned flesh, rubber and clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 rescue workers stayed at the scene throughout Thursday night 
listening for any sounds -- moans or screams -- that might indicate someone had 
lived through the tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 They listened in vain. 
</P>
<P>
 As the rain began falling Friday morning, President Clinton telephoned 
Pennsylvania Gov. Robert P. Casey and Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy to offer 
condolences. Casey toured the site and said afterward: "The debris is 
everywhere. . . . Words cannot explain it. It is just a horrifying sight." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gov. Mark Singel declared: "The scene is one of absolute carnage. . . . 
There's a great deal of material, human and otherwise, strewn about the area. 
Out of respect for the families, I won't begin to describe what I saw there. 
But I've seen crash sites before, and this one is jarring." 
</P>
<P>
 Casey and Singel met with reporters at a command center in the asphalt parking 
lot of Garden Green Plaza, a shopping mall on one side of the oak-studded 
hilltop where the wreckage was scattered. Twenty coroners rode by in the back 
of a yellow dump truck on their way to the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
 In time, the rain turned the site into glue. One dump truck sank into the muck 
and had to be hauled out with a winch. Workers reported wading through mud up 
to their knees. Some of them broke down in tears as they described what they 
had seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had four years in the Marine Corps, but this was like nothing I've seen in 
my entire life," said Sgt. Rudy Prigorac, a policeman from Aliquippa. "There 
was no one I could identify as being a person. I was . . . searching the ground 
with a flashlight. I held it down, and I saw a small book. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a child's book, and it was open to a poem entitled 'Weeping Willow.' I 
knelt down, and I read the poem, and that's when I broke down and started to 
cry." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Ciccone, 16, a high school junior from nearby Hopewell Township, Pa., 
was among several others who followed a firetruck to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only person I saw whole was a small kid. . . . It was just lying there on 
the ground, face down. It was about 5 or 6, but I couldn't tell if it was a boy 
or a girl because the clothes were too badly burned." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the rescue workers received counseling from medical experts to help 
them handle the trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the shock was the visual impact of the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's stuff hanging from trees -- luggage, shoes and everything," said 
James Albert, chairman of the Beaver County board of commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 An in-flight magazine was intact. 
</P>
<P>
 So was a Reebok sneaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest piece of wreckage, part of the tail of the jet, was only 3 feet 
wide and 4 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the shock was realizing that the tragedy -- as bad as it was 
-- could have been worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers pointed to a house standing not far from where the plane hit. 
Some of the wreckage was scattered in front of the house and across its 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should go to church every day from now on," Albert said about the people 
who live there. "That plane missed them by only 200 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerated trucks lined up at the crash site to carry away the pieces of 
human remains. At about 4 p.m., the first of the trucks drove to a temporary 
morgue at the Pittsburgh airport. 
</P>
<P>
 From the truck, the remains moved through at least five operations: 
fingerprinting, photography, materials, X-ray and a chalkboard for information 
about each individual. The identification process was expected to take as long 
as a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press named only two Californians among the victims. It listed 
David Garber of Westminster and Walter Heiligenberg of Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash brought renewed attention to USAir's safety record. It was the fifth 
fatal USAir crash in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Fraser Jones, an FAA official familiar with aircraft 
maintenance, said USAir was put under increased surveillance in recent years 
because of its financial difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is standard procedure for us when an airline is having financial 
troubles, and the surveillance was further intensified after the Charlotte 
(N.C.) crash in July," Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But no safety issues have arisen as a result of the increased surveillance. 
There also appears to be no commonality between the latest crash and USAir's 
past accidents over the last five years." 
</P>
<P>
 A pilots' union representative said there have been no complaints against 
USAir from any of its pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Feb. 1, 1991, runway collision involving a USAir plane at Los Angeles 
International Airport, the NTSB cited "improper air traffic control procedures 
employed by the Los Angeles airport tower and the FAA's failure to provide 
adequate policy direction and oversight of its air traffic control facility 
managers." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't see a thread through them (the different accidents)," said the 
pilot's union representative, who requested anonymity. "There just doesn't seem 
to be anything you can hang on USAir." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether corners were being cut by USAir, he replied: "We don't have any 
indication of that. The pilots would let us know if that was true." 
</P>
<P>
 USAir spokeswoman Susan Young said the fatal jet underwent a routine 
maintenance check, performed every 35 flight hours, the day before it crashed. 
She said no problems were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Michael Ross in Pittsburgh, Alan C. Miller and Robert L. 
Jackson in Washington and Richard E. Meyer in Los Angeles contributed to this 
story.

CORPS' 'WALKING DEAD' MARCH INTO HISTORY; MARINES: VIETNAM VETERANS ARE HONORED 
AS BATTERED UNIT IS DEACTIVATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As aging survivors of the unit known as the "Walking Dead" stood at attention, 
the Marine Corps deactivated 1st Battalion 9th Regiment in an emotional 
ceremony Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-luck battalion, which many considered a jinxed unit during the 
Vietnam War, earned an unenviable reputation for sustaining high casualties and 
for near-constant engagement in heavy combat. 
</P>
<P>
 The "One Nine," as the unit is known in the corps, fought in the bloody hill 
battles in 1967 along the demilitarized zone between North and South Vietnam. 
It often skirmished along the coastal highway near Hue that soldiers called the 
"Street Without Joy." 
</P>
<P>
 And the battalion was at Khe Sanh in 1968 during a 77-day siege by the North 
Vietnamese army that many feared would become America's Dien Bien Phu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't jinxed, and there was no vendetta against us. It was just that we 
were in constant combat," said Dave (Beetle) Bailey, an Anaheim engineer who 
served in the One Nine in 1966 and 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, 50, was wounded for the second time April 5, 1967, on the Street 
Without Joy when a reinforced North Vietnamese army company overran his 
understrength company of 60 men. Of those, 52 were either killed or wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ceremony attracted dozens of former Marines and Navy personnel who 
had served in the battalion and who came from all over Southern California to 
watch the final folding of the battalion's colors, emblazoned with Presidential 
Unit Citations earned in World War II and Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Present-day Marines who were assigned to the One Nine were absorbed into the 
2nd Battalion 1st Marine Regiment, which paraded before the Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 A Marine spokesman said the battalion's deactivation was made necessary by 
Pentagon cutbacks dictated by the Cold War's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of veterans, once inured to the pains of war, had a difficult time 
holding back the tears during the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were really teen-age soldiers. The mystique of One Nine will grow . . . 
over the years," said Orange County Superior Court Judge David Carter, who was 
wounded three times at Khe Sanh on April 16, 1968. "You had a brief moment in 
your lifetime to walk beside true heroes. And they are the kids whose names are 
on the Vietnam (Memorial) wall." 
</P>
<P>
 The battalion fought in the island campaigns of World War II, including the 
assault on Iwo Jima, still the Marine Corps' most costly battle in terms of 
fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 During the One Nine's four-year stint in Vietnam, from June, 1965, to July, 
1969, casualties of 50% or more during engagements were not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
 The unit's reputation was such that Marines and Navy personnel resisted being 
transferred to the battalion, and some wondered whether North Vietnamese 
soldiers had a special vendetta against it, veterans recall. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, 620 Marines and Navy personnel from the One Nine died in Vietnam. 
Carter, who was a platoon commander in Company C, said that 38 of his "kids 
went up the hill" on the day he was wounded, "and only eight came down." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the battalion shed most of its blood in 1967 and 1968 when the North 
Vietnamese launched aggressive and well-planned campaigns along the 
demilitarized zone in Quang Tri and Thua Thien provinces, it began to earn its 
reputation almost as soon as it arrived in Vietnam 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Franco, 49, of Chino was the sole survivor of a five-man fire team that 
was hit June 10, 1966. Franco's C Company was sweeping west of Danang, near 
Hill 37, when they were attacked. An enemy mortar round exploded in the midst 
of his fire team, wounding Franco in the head and killing the others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was unconscious for many days, and then spent a year in the hospital in San 
Diego. The doctors put a steel plate in my head and I was returned to duty, but 
not to Vietnam," Franco said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Vietnam War, the unit's casualties could occasionally be blamed on 
the Marines' tactics rather than heroism or the enemy's cunning. Critics used 
to say that the Marine infantry manual consisted of a single page, on which 
there was but a single printed line: "Hey diddle diddle, straight up the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the courage of individual Marines, who often fought under the most 
trying conditions, was never questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years of the war, most fights were small-unit engagements. But 
all that changed in 1967 in the hill battles along the demilitarized zone, said 
Al Slater, former commander of A Company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world changed overnight. The (North Vietnamese army) came down with 
bigger guns and more people. We were outnumbered and outgunned. Many Marines 
died at Con Thien, Dong Ha, Cam Lo, Camp Carroll and the Rockpile," said 
Slater, 53, a juvenile probation officer in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The hill battles where One Nine distinguished itself were fierce. There was no 
quarter given by either side, and it was understood that if you were wounded 
and left behind on the battlefield, you were not likely to be taken prisoner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came across many Marines who were wounded and then shot in the head. There 
was a lot of bitterness and anger. We hated the (North Vietnamese army) but we 
also respected them," Slater said. "There were times when my Marines killed 
enemy prisoners before I could stop them. You don't condone things like that, 
but you understand why it happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey said he has his own indelible image of the "Walking Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 As his company walked across a field the night he was wounded, an illumination 
round burst overhead. Instinctively, the men froze as the eerie shadows cast by 
the artificial light rippled across the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just for a second I looked to each side of me and saw a line of gray figures, 
but I couldn't see their faces. 'These are the 'Walking Dead,' I said to 
myself," Bailey recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, the enemy began firing, catching the Marines in a deadly 
cross-fire before flanking and overrunning the company.

COLUMN ONE; WHY THE WORLD LET RWANDA BLEED; CHASTENED BY SOMALIA, A GUN-SHY 
U.S. URGED CAUTION ON AN ALREADY WEARY UNITED NATIONS, BRAKING EFFORTS TO STEM 
THE BRUTALITY. 
</P>

<P>
 Like the numb and hollow-eyed gaze of the emaciated survivors of Treblinka or 
the mountains of skulls stacked up by Cambodia's Khmer Rouge, the shriek of 
pain of the people of Rwanda has seared itself onto the world's conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 These are harrowing images of spring and summer: blood-smeared churches 
stacked with machete-slashed bodies as though they were so much deadwood; 
weakened children stumbling and dying in the mud as they were trampled 
underfoot by the swiftest tide of refugees in modern times; stinking, teeming 
refugee camps at Goma and Bukavu in Zaire, still sumps of disease and want and 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with these appalling images come the questions, nagging and disturbing 
because they mock our belief and hope that on the threshold of the 21st 
Century, human beings have learned to live in a kinder and more civilized 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the genocide of Rwanda, the organized, wholesale slaughter of something 
like half a million people, and maybe twice that many, have to happen? 
</P>
<P>
 Could the outside world and the United Nations have done more to stop it? If 
so, why didn't they? And what was the role of the United States? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, what were the lessons learned? Could Rwanda's nightmare recur, if not 
here, then elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been so late it's not funny," Canadian Maj. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, the 
top U.N. military officer in Rwanda during the blood bath and a career soldier 
praised by many for his professionalism and panache, said as he turned over 
command here Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The departing Canadian didn't say it, but many others have: One potent, 
decisive force urging delay in international intervention was the United 
States, with its newfound caution about U.N. involvement in countries' internal 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 But in truth, there were few voices heard in opposition to the U.S. counsel 
against precipitate action -- few, at least, with the will and means to back up 
their arguments with solid and substantial commitments of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda who warned early of impending catastrophe would 
find themselves restricted from acting by the language of U.N. Security Council 
resolutions produced in this context of caution and compromise. Even after the 
storm broke, the U.N. reaction was to retreat, to reduce rather than increase 
its forces in the riven country. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Rwandans fear that nothing has been learned -- that, as in their own 
national tragedy, the outside world will intervene too late, with too little, 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the aftermath of the violence, the world's reaction has remained 
piecemeal, although the top U.N. official in Rwanda, Shahryar Khan of Pakistan, 
warned his superiors this week that "guerrilla warfare" might be set to break 
out, reviving the deadly cycle of civil war and massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 17, the U.N. Security Council authorized a peacekeeping force of 5,500 
soldiers, but as of Friday, exactly 4,150 were on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have countries offering to send an infantry battalion. Then we say, 
'Anybody want to equip them?' We are waiting for the phone to ring," said 
Canadian Maj. Jean-Guy Plante, spokesman for the U.N. Assistance Mission in 
Rwanda (UNAMIR). "Of course, it is now too late to stop the massacres anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.N. commission created in July to determine formally whether acts of 
genocide and large-scale violations of human rights occurred in Rwanda, as a 
first step toward identifying and punishing the mass murderers, has called on 
the world community to supply 200 forensic medical experts and investigators. 
At last count, four were in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of the commission itself, distinguished jurists from Togo, Guinea 
and Mali, spent only a week here and then left, saying they might be back later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "You listened to the questions that they asked, and it was clear they weren't 
really briefed at all," one high-ranking U.N. official involved in relief 
efforts here said. 
</P>
<P>
 What is particularly tragic -- some would say criminal, in light of the 
high-sounding ideals proclaimed in the U.N. Charter -- is that as long ago as 
last Oct. 5, the United States and other members of the U.N. Security Council, 
in its Resolution 872, ordered the creation of a "peacekeeping mission" in 
Rwanda "in the shortest possible time." 
</P>
<P>
 The mission's goal was to aid in the establishment of the coalition government 
and pluralistic, non-ethnic constitution mandated by the Arusha Accord of Aug. 
4, 1993, that had, it seemed, put an end to a withering 3-year-old civil war 
between the Rwandan government and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front led by 
returnees from exile. 
</P>
<P>
 But as early as last December and January of this year, U.N. military 
observers who arrived here got wind of activities that presaged a possible 
blood bath in this verdant, beautiful country in the highlands of central 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda's strife-plagued history made the most nightmarish scenarios possible, 
even highly likely: In five years of slaughter beginning in 1959, an estimated 
100,000 members of the Tutsi minority were slain by the majority Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one senior U.N. official in Kigali, Dallaire and his 
subordinates, then in command of a 2,500-member force from Belgium, Ghana and 
Bangladesh, asked superiors at U.N. headquarters for permission to act to 
prevent what appeared to be preparations for a new round of bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 The request was turned down, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had reports that certain elements were distributing arms to civilians and 
training civilians to carry out atrocities," the senior official said, speaking 
on condition of anonymity. "We informed New York and wanted to mount 
operations, and were told it was not in our mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had information on the location of weapons, training camps, information on 
the distribution of arms," the official recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallaire, a 47-year-old cigar-smoking artilleryman from Quebec City, wanted to 
take preventive action -- to seize the weapons -- as early as December, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was dissuaded, he was instructed, he was cautioned: It was not in his 
mandate," the official added. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months after Dallaire failed to get the go-ahead, Rwanda would reap the 
whirlwind of ethnic violence from scrupulous adherence to the language of 
Resolution 72. From the arms caches that the 2aU.N. peacekeepers had detected 
came some of the weapons used to perpetrate the most rapid genocidal slaughter 
in modern times. 
</P>
<P>
 The spark for the explosion came when a plane carrying Rwanda's president, 
Juvenal Habyarimana, and his counterpart from neighboring Burundi, Cyprian 
Ntayamira, crashed April 6 on approach to Kigali's airport after apparently 
being hit by a missile. Both leaders were killed. The Rwandan government 
accused rebel Tutsis of shooting down the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Commanded by the hard-line Hutu leaders who succeeded Habyarimana, Rwandan 
soldiers, members of the ruling party's youth wing, the Interahamwe, and 
ordinary Hutus embarked on a massacre of their opponents and members of the 
Tutsi minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Day after day, bands armed with machetes roamed the hills of Kigali, 
butchering people and tossing hand grenades into houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are massacres all over the place," one person trapped here told the 
Associated Press on April 17. "The army's delight is to murder civilians, while 
civilians turn on each other in ethnic revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with such barbarism on a massive scale and renewed hostilities between 
Rwanda's civil war foes, the Security Council decided April 21 to slash the 
number of its peacekeepers here rather than reinforce them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget, at the time, many of our people were unarmed; they were 
military observers," UNAMIR spokesman Plante said. UNAMIR's repeated pleas for 
reinforcements and essential supplies such as armored vehicles were falling 
mostly on deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, "Gen. Dallaire said, 'For security reasons, I can't operate with 
2,500 people,' " Plante recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Uppermost in his mind was the massacre of 10 Belgian soldiers on the first day 
of terror after they tried in vain to protect the prime minister, Agathe 
Uwilingiyimana, a moderate Hutu, from a murderous band of soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, Lebanon and elsewhere, U.N. peacekeepers, 
too few to deter attack, had become targets. When the Belgian government, 
rocked by public opinion, quickly pulled out its key contingent of 440 troops 
for their safety, no other Western country volunteered to replace them. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali then warned that carrying out 
even the Security Council's limited mandate in Rwanda would become "untenable." 
Before April 21, some of Dallaire's men had already been pulled back to Kenya. 
With the massacres in full swing, and Kigali's streets echoing with screams and 
explosions, the U.N. force was then cut to 450, although Dallaire was 
authorized to pare it to as few as 250. 
</P>
<P>
 The butchery had been so carefully prepared and spread so widely -- this 
country is as big as Maryland -- that only a huge and rapid invasion of 
well-equipped troops could have halted it with certainty. But there is little 
doubt in the minds of many U.N. peacekeepers that even with several thousand 
more soldiers, they could have saved countless more lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallaire at one point asked for 8,500 and was told by U.N. officials in New 
York to be more modest in his requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were confined here. We knew places badly needed our protection, but there 
was nothing we could do," said Plante, who arrived in Kigali, the Rwandan 
capital, six days after the massacres began. "With 450 men, we had our hands 
full. If we had had the 5,500 (the number of troops finally authorized by the 
United Nations), instead of protecting 18,000 to 20,000 refugees in the city, 
we could have protected maybe 100,000 to 200,000 . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have gone out to the churches where we knew people were trapped," 
Plante said. "We would have been able to protect them and deliver them food. 
There was hundreds of thousands of tons of food in the city, but we didn't have 
access. Because when we went to the warehouses, people would fire on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Its ranks slashed, UNAMIR's remnants hunkered down at the airport, a 
hotel-turned-command-post and Kigali stadium, which was filled with thousands 
of refugees. U.N. troops rode in trucks and other vulnerable "soft-skin" 
vehicles because Dallaire hadn't received enough of the armored vehicles that 
he had pleaded for. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-helmeted soldiers were further handcuffed by their mandate, which the 
Security Council whittled down even more in its April 21 resolution. U.N. 
troops in Rwanda were ordered to do no more than try to mediate a cease-fire 
between the government and the rebels, to act as observers and to supervise 
humanitarian relief, if possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people say, 'Why didn't you go into the massacres and separate the 
Tutsis and the Hutus?' . . . that wasn't our mandate," Plante said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when a Kigali radio station, Mille Collines, was on the air urging Hutus 
to exterminate the "cockroaches," UNAMIR took no action to knock it off the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't in our mandate," Plante said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the jargon of U.N. peacekeeping, Dallaire, unlike his peers in Somalia, had 
not been given "Chapter 7" authority by the Security Council to intervene 
militarily to try and force an end to the fighting and killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "UNAMIR could have stopped this if we had granted them Chapter 7 authority," 
one State Department official maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. official acknowledged that only "overwhelming authority, tens of 
thousands of troops," could have stanched the Rwandan blood bath or forced an 
end to the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a commitment never came. In the words of a blistering report in May from 
the London-based watchdog group Africa Rights, in Rwanda "the coup was mounted 
and the genocide perpetrated without international denunciation of those 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 That same month, more than four weeks after the slaughter began, diplomats at 
U.N. headquarters in New York were still heatedly debating what to do. The most 
insistent voice urging caution came from the United States, which was worried 
that intervention might degenerate into the sort of debacle that the earlier 
U.N. relief operation in Somalia had become. 
</P>
<P>
 There, after unselfishly sending 20,000 Marines and soldiers to help a famine- 
and strife-stricken country on the Horn of Africa, Americans had grown uneasy 
as their young men and women became the targets of the people they had come to 
help -- showered with rocks by children and shot at by snipers from warring 
clans. 
</P>
<P>
 Their disillusionment climaxed last October with the horrifying televised 
spectacle of an American corpse dragged through the streets of the Somali 
capital, Mogadishu, by jeering, exultant Africans. In the end, 42 Americans 
were killed and 175 wounded in a faraway country they had been sent to help. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sobering and formative experience for U.S. policy, one that sent 
shock waves through the Pentagon and White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened in Somalia has frankly made the American military gun-shy," the 
State Department official said. "I don't know how many times I've heard 
American officers say, 'These people are not worth one American life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The direct outgrowth of the costly misadventure was Presidential Policy 
Directive 25, whose avowed touchstone is "realism." Under PPD25, which 
President Clinton signed May 5, the Administration said it will refuse to 
approve peacekeeping operations until they are subjected to close scrutiny, 
including an assessment of their chances for success. 
</P>
<P>
 PPD25's first application came in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-May, after the massacres had flickered out in Kigali but were 
continuing in other parts of the country, Madeleine Albright, the U.S. 
ambassador to the United Nations, invoked the new policy before the Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sending a U.N. force into the maelstrom of Rwanda without a sound plan of 
operations would be folly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other Security Council members echoed the Americans' caution and approved 
it as a fresh breeze of pragmatism. But Boutros-Ghali, though he refrained from 
mentioning the United States by name, flatly rejected the Clinton 
Administration's preoccupation with preventing another Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must accept that in certain operations we will not be successful," he 
argued. "And the fact that you are not successful in a certain operation must 
not be an obstacle to additional operations all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 As the dead piled up in Rwanda, Boutros-Ghali called on the 15-member Security 
Council to change course and send an enlarged force of at least 5,500 
peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 After numerous delays and considerable pressure from the United States, the 
council authorized the force but delayed sending more than a few hundred 
soldiers. Member nations wanted from Boutros-Ghali a military strategy, a 
commitment from countries to provide the troops and a timetable for their use. 
They also wanted assurances that both sides in the civil war would cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 In Albright's words, anything else would have been "pie in the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials believe the Clinton Administration's lack of enthusiasm for 
intervention crippled Boutros-Ghali's attempts to recruit soldiers for the 
mission. But there hardly was an international outpouring of commitment, even 
from other African countries. Ethiopia, Ghana, Senegal, Zambia, Zimbabwe, 
Congo, Malawi, Mali and Nigeria were willing to send troops, but only if 
somebody else paid to equip them. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, U.N. forces were already involved in 17 other peacekeeping 
operations, from Bosnia to Cambodia. Rwanda -- this small, landlocked country 
plagued by its own murderous politics and ethnic hatreds, lacking strategic 
importance and anything to offer the world but coffee -- fell victim to "donor 
fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
 It was late June before the outside world intervened in force. Help came in 
the form of French marines and Foreign Legionnaires, who set up a "safe zone" 
for fleeing Hutu refugees in the country's heavily forested southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the now-almost-victorious Rwandan Patriotic Front, France was the most 
suspect actor of all. A former colonial master of much of Africa, it had 
supplied arms to the former government. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Hutu-dominated Rwandan government forces almost defeated, an 
estimated 2 million refugees had surged toward Rwanda's frontiers with Zaire, 
Tanzania and Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only then, one senior U.N. official says, that the outside world became 
shocked by televised images of this wretched exodus. It was only then that it 
was moved to commit enormous resources to soothe Rwanda's suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people coming into Goma made it a pure refugee operation," the U.N. 
official said. " . . . For U.N. agencies, you were responding to a classic 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton promised "immediate and massive" aid as part of an operation dubbed 
Support Hope, and the U.S. military began a round-the-clock airlift of food, 
water and medicine to the refugee camps. By July 2, the Administration had 
committed itself to delivering $250 million in aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
stressed last month while inspecting the U.S. military assistance effort, the 
United States remains committed to avoiding any peacekeeping role here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. is not going to get involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some U.N. officials involved in coordinating the mammoth response to the 
refugee crisis fear that it will obscure the failure of the international 
community to deal with the somber events behind it: the butchery that erupted 
in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've used the word genocide to describe what went on here, and the 
international community hasn't done anything about it," the U.N. official said. 
"If you have 500,000, 1 million people exterminated in this country, and don't 
do anything about it, are we even going to blink an eye if 200,000, say, are 
exterminated somewhere else?" 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kagame, the 36-year-old Tutsi who led the Rwandan Patriotic Front to 
victory and is now Rwanda's vice president and defense minister, questions the 
United Nations' ability to learn from its failure to prevent mass slaughter in 
his country. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens in New York is beyond my control, and my experience is that it's 
either negative or comes too late," Kagame said. "Maybe someday, somebody will 
do the right thing. But I am not optimistic about the way they handle things."

AS SHORT CALLS PROLIFERATE, PHONE FIRMS SEEK NEW FEES; TECHNOLOGY: INNOVATIONS 
LIKE E-MAIL MEAN LESS TIME ON THE LINES. WHETHER THAT RAISES COSTS IS DISPUTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprising side effect of new technologies, Americans' telephone calls 
are suddenly getting much shorter -- and if the phone companies have their way, 
those short calls will soon get much more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the nation's long love affair with leisurely phone chats, innovations 
such as pagers, voice mail, E-mail, electronic credit card readers and fax 
machines are now dramatically abbreviating telephone calls and luring longer 
connections off the public phone network. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as people leave voice mail rather than calling back -- or send E-mail 
rather than calling at all -- about 52% of residential phone conversations last 
one minute or less, compared with 22% in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone companies are not at all happy about this. They say it is costing 
them money -- not because overall phone traffic is down (it isn't), but because 
the first few seconds of a call, when the initial connection is made, are the 
most expensive to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, they have a solution: a new "setup" charge that could make 
some short calls as much as five times more expensive. Next week, the 
California Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve a request by 
Pacific Bell to levy such a charge for long-distance calls made within 
California. Pac Bell has proposed a similar fee for interstate calls in a 
petition recently filed with the Federal Communications Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the new fee could be extended to local calls as well, satisfying a 
longstanding phone company desire to move away from flat-rate monthly charges 
and require customers to pay for each call. But such changes are likely to 
anger consumers, and could thwart the development of computer on-line services 
and other emerging communications technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Phone company finances aside, it is clear that new technologies are 
drastically altering the way the public telephone network is used. In 
Massachusetts, physicians whose staffs once spent hours placing long-distance 
and local calls to determine patients' insurance eligibility now accomplish the 
same task in seconds by swiping a wallet-size ID card though an electronic 
scanner connected by phone lines to Blue Cross/Blue Shield. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, Howard Sogren, senior vice president of global systems and 
technology at Merrill Lynch, says he hardly ever picks up his phone now that he 
can send electronic messages over his company's private computer network. "In 
the last year I have reduced my need to have a phone conversation with anyone 
overseas by 90% and domestically, by about 60%," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country, retailers are verifying credit cards electronically in 
seconds, rather than spending minutes on the phone. Companies of all stripes 
are finding they can make do with fewer personnel to field live phone calls: 
Operators and secretaries are being eliminated as electronic voice mail boxes 
are installed. And marketing is being transformed by computers that tirelessly 
dial homes to pitch products with a synthesized human voice that does not dally 
with customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "E-mail and voice mail reduce significantly the time" spent on the phone, said 
Dan Elron, a telecommunications expert at the New York offices of Coopers & 
Lybrand. The technology, Elron added, forces people to dispense with 
"extraneous issues like the weather and deal with things much faster." 
</P>
<P>
 The social implications of these changes are ambiguous. And it is impossible 
to determine whether live conversations are actually any shorter than they used 
to be. Data about phone usage shows only whether a call has been completed, not 
what kind of traffic the call is carrying. 
</P>
<P>
 For the phone companies, none of this matters. What they see is a 
proliferation of costly, short calls. And they say current pricing encourages 
many of the users who make longer calls -- big companies and government 
agencies that maintain lengthy connections with clients or satellite offices -- 
to abandon the public phone network in favor of cheaper private lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with the current rate structure is you lose the winners and keep 
the losers," said Ed Lowry, executive director of external affairs for Bell 
Atlantic Corp. "We have to be able to give our customers pricing options to 
keep them and get our rates more in line with costs." 
</P>
<P>
 "The phone companies face a material loss of revenue unless they address the 
situation of the continuing proliferation of short-duration calls," said 
Richard P. Nespola, president of Management Network Group Inc., a Leawood, 
Kans., consulting firm. "The market has changed. Communications are coming in 
short bursts." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Bell contends that the new charge it is seeking would not affect 
consumers because it would be collected from long-distance carriers. But the 
long-distance companies, which already pay an "access charge" to local phone 
firms to cover the local portion of all calls, are likely to pass any higher 
costs along to consumers, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 And some dispute the phone company argument that short calls are more 
expensive to carry. "This is telecom tomfoolery," said Bruce Kushnick, 
president of New Networks Institute, a New York research firm. "Moving 
electrons over a wire does not cost more money. The telephone companies are 
simply restating their math" in order to win rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer on-line services and other heavy users of the public network are 
fiercely opposed to the new pricing proposals. "This obviously would have a 
deleterious impact on the nation's economy and essentially would penalize 
CompuServe and similarly situated companies for making extremely efficient use 
of the public switched network," said CompuServe, one of the nation's leading 
computer on-line services, in a petition filed with the FCC last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of pressing for such rate increases, CompuServe said, phone companies 
"should concentrate on finding less costly ways of setting up calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some find it peculiar that phone companies would be complaining about 
changing usage patterns, since new technologies in general are contributing to 
an unprecedented boom in communications, which in turn is creating major new 
opportunities for phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we've seen the development of value-added private networks that 
take telephone users off the public switched network, we tend to see growth in 
other areas that didn't exist before," said Bob Baulch, a manager of AT&T's 
communications service group in Morristown, N.J. "There is all kinds of private 
networking going on and to us that's an accepted practice that does not (alarm 
us)." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall demand for phones is exploding so much, in fact, that some area codes 
could be filled to capacity in the next few years. What's more, some phone 
innovations, such as voice mail and call waiting, allow millions of calls to be 
completed today that in the past might have gone unanswered or uncompleted. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the additional lines being hooked up are devoted to fax machines, 
on-line computer services or other devices that communicate in relatively brief 
periods. Other added capacity does not directly financially benefit the local 
phone companies. For an industry seeking new revenue streams to modernize its 
networks, experts say the trend is ominous.

SMOG AGENCY BOWS TO L.A., DEFERS SOME STRICTER LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Setting a new course for clearing the nation's dirtiest skies, Southland air 
quality officials on Friday unanimously adopted a plan that aims to clean up 
ozone, the main ingredient of smog, by 2010 but does not commit them to 
controversial measures regulating heavily polluting trucks, trains and other 
diesel equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 As a concession to the city of Los Angeles, the South Coast Air Quality 
Management District board decided to defer many proposals that target nitrogen 
oxides, including a series of pollution limits that would force many diesel 
engines to use futuristic technologies such as fuel cells, natural gas or other 
clean-burning alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had said not only that such stringent measures were unrealistic but 
also that they would be economically devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they remain in the district's own plan, the measures will be removed 
from the version submitted to the federal government. In doing that, the AQMD 
and the state will not be committed to implementing them if they find a better 
answer. They can take until 1997 to find alternative ways to achieve health 
standards for particulates, the soot-like air pollutants that can cause lung 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the nitrogen oxides regulations, the AQMD says its plan contains 
enough aggressive anti-smog steps -- an array of almost 100 proposed measures 
-- to meet the federal health standard for ozone, the lung-scarring gas that is 
the Southland's worst pollutant. 
</P>
<P>
 One important new approach, officials say, is a pollution trading program 
requiring about 1,100 aerospace plants, metal-plating shops and other 
industrial facilities to cut their hydrocarbon emissions 70% by 2010. As a 
financial incentive, the companies would be allowed to buy and sell pollution 
credits under a system similar to a smaller program the AQMD launched this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with such new smog-fighting programs, curbing ozone will be a huge 
challenge because pollution from vehicles, industry and other sources must be 
cut by two-thirds in 16 years even as the region's population is expected to 
grow by 4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise over particulates is a major victory for Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan, who days before a scheduled AQMD vote last month raised strong 
objections and sparked controversy when he came up with his own eleventh-hour 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD executive officer James Lents called the uproar over accommodating the 
mayor "a tempest in a teapot" that eclipsed what air quality officials believe 
are more critical portions of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Los Angeles Vice Mayor Michael Keeley called the AQMD's compromise 
a "constructive alternative" that "addresses all pollutants while maintaining 
flexibility and local control, which the mayor considers crucial." 
</P>
<P>
 After five months of acrimonious debate and attempts at building consensus, 
Southland business leaders say the plan approved Friday -- which will cost at 
least $5 billion a year -- still contains many economic pitfalls and could 
prevent recovery from the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that Mayor Riordan's plan will ease the pain," said Ron Lamb, a vice 
president with the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. "It goes a long way to 
resolve some of the things we're concerned about. But still, considering how 
our businesses are suffering, we have to be careful in how we implement it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some environmentalists, however, view it as a weak plan that accommodates 
polluters and may never bring about clean air. They say the board sent a strong 
message to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates trains, 
interstate trucks and ships, that aggressive diesel measures are not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, about 50 members of a community and labor rights group based in 
Wilmington lambasted the board Friday in a vehement and emotional protest, 
chanting, "You're killing our children!" 
</P>
<P>
 "You have turned this into a farce," said group leader Chris Mathis. "No 
agency at all is better than what we have now. . . . To industry, 
congratulations, you all win." 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD plan, covering Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino 
counties, is the third update of the region's clean-air strategy in five years. 
By law, the agency is required to come up with an update every three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the plan goes to the state Air Resources Board for approval, which could 
come next month. At that time, the ARB will add statewide measures, including 
future goals for electric and other low-emission passenger cars and other motor 
vehicles. Under the federal Clean Air Act, the ARB has until Nov. 15 to submit 
a final plan to the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the AQMD staff had originally proposed reducing nitrogen oxides 79% 
by 2010, the plan to be submitted to the EPA would reduce it by 50% -- a 
difference of about 270 tons of pollutants per day. Nitrogen oxides contribute 
to the Los Angeles Basin's ozone pollution as well as to its famous brown haze 
and its particulates. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals not included in the version now going to the EPA would have set 
stringent pollution standards that would have required most locomotives to stop 
using diesel fuel by 2000 and many heavy-duty trucks and construction equipment 
to switch after 2010. Retrofitting aircraft engines to cleaner-burning 
technologies would have been required after 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucking and airline industries were harshly critical of those rules, 
saying that no workable technology exists. They contended that they would be 
forced to reduce hauling of goods and eliminate flights in and out of the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 But the AQMD staff said setting stringent anti-smog targets would help trigger 
development of technology, just as earlier regulations produced catalytic 
converters on cars and cleaner power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Broadbent, AQMD planning director, said, "We are still very much 
committed to implementing these rules" because they remain in the district's 
version of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Also eliminated in the update were proposed fees on diesel-powered ships 
entering Los Angeles and Long Beach harbor, which had been vigorously opposed 
by Riordan and the business community. Instead, the AQMD will urge the federal 
government to allow ships to switch to lanes farther out to sea so that less 
pollution from their engines reaches the shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it does not reduce nitrogen oxides enough, the compromise plan would 
fail to achieve federal health standards for particulates. To meet federal 
deadlines, the AQMD must come up with additional options by February, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 One suggestion from Riordan's office is to find ways of controlling natural 
dust particles, which blow from farms, unpaved roads and lots, particularly in 
San Bernardino County. That suggestion, however, has prompted complaints from 
many Inland Empire officials that Los Angeles is trying to shift the burden of 
controlling particulates to them. They point out that motor vehicles in urban 
areas are by far the largest source of particulates. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD will convene two conferences of experts to try to devise other ways 
to reduce particulates, although no dates have been set. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe our measures are cutting-edge. The question is, have we missed 
something?" said Barry Wallerstein, AQMD deputy executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they got a reprieve, diesel engines still will be part of the plan 
submitted to EPA. It calls for standards, dubbed "clean diesel," that require 
that engines emit less pollution by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles and the state also are urging the federal government to set 
national standards for trucks, trains and other heavy-duty vehicles, which 
would mean Los Angeles and other major urban hubs would remain competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA says it is seriously considering the idea. Facing a court order after 
losing a suit by environmentalists, the EPA is preparing a backup clean-air 
plan for the Southland and Sacramento by February, and its proposals may be 
even more stringent than the AQMD's. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Titus, a spokesman for the California Trucking Assn., said Friday that 
the changes in the AQMD plan are a positive sign, but that truckers still face 
the prospect of economically devastating measures proposed by the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 In debating the updated plan Friday, the AQMD board virtually ignored a new 
tax proposal from a panel of 70 city and county elected officials at the 
Southern California Assn. of Governments. The group recommended that the AQMD 
incorporate in its plan a tax on motorists of 3 to 5 cents per mile -- 
equivalent to about $1 per gallon of gasoline -- to replace current gasoline 
taxes of about 2.5 cents per mile. The money would fund mass transit and other 
advanced transportation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD board created a task force to study the idea, but Chairman Henry 
Wedaa said such a tax is unrealistic and would require approval of the state 
Legislature. Clearing the Air 
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District 20-year clean air plan 
contains about 100 measures targeting vehicles, industries, consumer products 
and other sources of pollution. Here is a look at the plan: 
</P>
<P>
 * History: This is the third plan created by the AQMD in the past five years. 
The four-county Southland region, which has the nation's most polluted air, is 
required under federal law to achieve all health standards by 2010. Every three 
years, the AQMD must update its plan for meeting those mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Programs: The plan includes a pollution-trading provision for 1,100 
companies, such as aerospace firms, that emit hydrocarbons; controls on 
petroleum facilities such as tanks and fuel supplies for pleasure boats; 
controls on dust from farms, paved and unpaved roads and construction activity; 
smog checks for light-duty diesel vehicles and cleaner-running diesel trucks 
and buses; advanced shuttle transit and electronically controlled freeways; 
building infrastructure for electric cars and alternative fuel cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * Schedule: Some of the measures could be adopted and implemented as soon as 
next year, while others requiring advanced technology would not go into effect 
until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 * Costs: Business leaders say the revisions will cost at least $5 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enforcement: The measures would be implemented by the AQMD, the state Air 
Resources Board, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Next step: The plan goes to the state Air Resources Board for approval. 
Deadline for submitting it to the EPA is Nov. 15.

DRAFTERS SETTLE ON LANGUAGE FOR ABORTION POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drafters of a new global plan on population set aside continuing objections 
from the Vatican on Friday and endorsed a new abortion policy that calls for 
protecting women from unsafe abortions but leaves legalization up to individual 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
 A small working group of the 160 countries at the International Conference on 
Population and Development moved on to the difficult issues of defining 
reproductive health and reproductive rights, and also faced some Islamic 
opposition to making inheritance laws equal for men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise wording on abortion was substantially the same as a policy 
statement that won overwhelming international endorsement earlier in the week, 
but three days of exhausting negotiations aimed at bringing the Vatican on 
board produced a refined version that all but a handful of Latin American 
countries accept. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holy See announced that it favored many parts of the abortion policy, 
including its goal of protecting women from botched abortions, its call for 
counseling services aimed at preventing abortion and its not promoting abortion 
as a family-planning tool. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican said it "endorses the need to provide quality medical care for the 
complications arising from abortion," adding, however, that its positive 
reaction "constitutes a substantial but not complete identification" with the 
new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican delegation said it would reserve a final decision until other 
controversial sections of the population plan have been debated, clearing the 
way for the abortion policy to proceed for final adoption by the conference 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference's 20-year action plan sets out a comprehensive set of policies 
-- ranging from empowering women to reducing consumption by rich nations -- 
aimed at curbing global population, currently at 5.7 billion and growing by a 
record 90 million people a year. 
</P>
<P>
 While the overwhelming majority of the plan's proposals have a solid 
international consensus, the conference from its beginning Monday has been 
sidetracked by the Vatican's attempt to excise language in any policy that 
might be seen as favoring abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 In his careful address withholding endorsement of the abortion policy, Msgr. 
Diarmuid Martin also said the Vatican was dropping its objections to the phrase 
"family planning" in the document because of new assurances that such programs 
will not include abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet U.S. officials said they were pleased with the conciliatory tone of 
Martin's address, even though he withheld specific approval of the abortion 
policy. Afterward, U.S. delegation chief Timothy E. Wirth went to congratulate 
the Vatican delegate personally on his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holy See appears to be setting itself up for a dramatic showdown at the 
close of the conference, scheduled for Tuesday, when it will finally announce 
whether it can back the population action plan or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina, Peru, Malta, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic were the only 
nations to join the Vatican in opposing the compromise abortion policy, but 
U.S. officials emphasized that the Holy See is far from sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the proceedings of the last four days should show you that they have 
not been marginalized. There are difficult issues ahead, and if they're not 
handled in a positive and respectful way, it's going to be impossible to reach 
a consensus," said a Clinton Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most controversial issues now under discussion involve the 
definitions of reproductive health and reproductive rights, areas in which the 
Vatican fears a new international right to abortion could be implicitly 
established. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic countries, which pulled out of an earlier alliance with the Vatican 
when they endorsed the compromise policy on abortion, also still have an agenda 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt, for example, is questioning an otherwise non-controversial section on 
gender equality that calls for men and women to have equal inheritance rights. 
Under Islamic law, a woman inherits only half as much as a man. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt has also raised questions -- mostly relating to translation -- on 
sections involving the equitable treatment of girls and boys, on marriage, and 
on exploitation of and violence against women. Egypt was responsible for 
changes clarifying that individual nations will decide what kind of counseling 
to give women with unwanted pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic countries also joined the debate on reproductive rights. In the 
section dealing with the "right of couples and individuals to make decisions 
concerning reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence," Libya, 
Iran, Algeria, Indonesia and the Central African Republic called for deletion 
of the word "individuals." They said it would violate religious values by 
implying that single people have this right. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic countries have joined the Vatican in voicing reservations about a 
phrase, "marriage and other unions," that they say could be interpreted to 
include homosexual relationships. The language was originally inserted at the 
request of Caribbean and African nations to cover common-law marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lionel Hurst, vice chairman of the drafting committee, said it is "very 
unlikely" the phrase will be changed. "Maybe we can include a footnote to say 
it doesn't necessarily include homosexuality," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Debate on these issues is expected to last well through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still some difficult issues to do -- very difficult," said a member 
of the U.S. delegation. "It's not over."

PROSECUTION WON'T SEEK DEATH PENALTY AGAINST SIMPSON; COURTS: DISTRICT ATTORNEY 
WILL ASK FOR LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE. DEFENSE SAYS IT CAN NOW CONCENTRATE 
ITS EFFORTS ON WINNING ACQUITTAL FOR THE EX-FOOTBALL STAR.

<P>
 Ending weeks of anticipation, prosecutors announced Friday that they will not 
seek the death penalty against O.J. Simpson and instead will ask that he be 
sentenced to life in prison without parole if convicted of murdering his 
ex-wife and her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to Simpson's lawyers, Assistant Dist. Atty. Frank Sundstedt 
said the decision was made after "consideration of all available aggravating 
and mitigating penalty phase evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office also released a statement saying that 
Sundstedt's decision was reviewed by Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, who concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys, said the decision meant 
the defense could concentrate its efforts on winning an acquittal for the 
former football great at his trial, scheduled to begin Sept. 26. Until the 
death penalty issue was decided, Simpson's lawyers had not known whether they 
needed to prepare for that aspect of the case as well as the primary trial 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are continuing to prepare for trial, and this decision does not affect 
that," Shapiro said. "The work goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., Simpson's other lead counsel, declined to comment in 
detail, saying only: "I think they made the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The death penalty decision came nine days after the initial deadline 
prosecutors had set for deciding the issue. Simpson's attorneys protested last 
week that they were being forced to prepare for trial without knowing whether 
their client was fighting for his freedom or his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts, who had criticized the delays, generally agreed that the 
district attorney's decision was not only legally correct but strategically 
sound. Among other things, they theorized that it would have been difficult for 
prosecutors to win a conviction if jurors had been confronted with the 
possibility of putting the football legend to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Before making the decision, Sundstedt consulted with a seven-member committee 
of top officials from the district attorney's office. Simpson's attorneys 
declined an invitation to appear before the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not participate in the death penalty determination because O.J. 
Simpson is innocent of these charges," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the district attorney's letter nor the statement detailed the office's 
reasons for not seeking the death penalty. A member of the committee said the 
decision was not difficult and was reached without significant disagreement 
among the panel members. "It was easy," the committee member said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another committee member, who also requested anonymity, said one major factor 
in the decision to seek life in prison was Simpson's lack of a felony history. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee last formally met Thursday, but reporters were told then that 
the Simpson case was not on the agenda. Garcetti approved the decision Friday 
morning, but delayed announcing it until after he notified members of the two 
victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the district attorney's office comes more than a month after 
Simpson was arraigned in Superior Court on charges that he killed his ex-wife 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. Simpson has pleaded not guilty to 
those murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's father, Fred, said outside his Ventura County home that he had heard 
about the prosecution's decision but did not want to discuss it. "That's not an 
issue I want to comment on publicly," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson's parents in Dana Point could not be reached for comment. A 
message on their answering machine said they would make no statements to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Aug. 31, Simpson's lawyers complained about the delay in 
announcing a death penalty decision, saying that it made it difficult for them 
to prepare for a trial scheduled to begin in less than three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is fundamentally unfair for us to be left in a situation where we 
don't know what to prepare for," Shapiro said during that hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito shared that concern, and urged prosecutors 
to move as quickly as possible to make a decision. The delay, he said 
"complicates all of our lives immensely." 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the looming question of the death sentence had a direct impact 
on how the two sides would proceed with jury selection, which is scheduled to 
begin Sept. 26. In death penalty cases, jurors who feel they could not order 
any person to be executed are automatically excused. 
</P>
<P>
 As the district attorney's office weighed the decision, it was confronted by 
an unusual level of public interest and disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Some activists, including a group of leading African Americans, have 
criticized certain aspects of Garcetti's handling of the Simpson prosecution 
and raised concerns that the death penalty decision would be in the hands of 
the all-white, all-male Special Circumstances Committee. Gloria Allred, a 
prominent attorney known for backing women's issues, urged Garcetti to seek the 
death sentence, arguing that to do otherwise was unfair to battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's statement alluded to those pressures but said they did 
not influence the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the office is aware that there is deep public concern about whether the 
death penalty will be sought in a case, the decision must be independent of 
this concern," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mack, head of the Los Angeles Urban League office, said he expected anger 
from women's rights activists who had urged Garcetti to seek the death penalty 
because it had been sought against women accused of killing their husbands and 
because Simpson had a history of physically abusing his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 But that reasoning, Mack said, is misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spousal abuse is a horrible, obscene thing, and it is clear O.J. Simpson was 
given a smack on the wrist for it because of his celebrity status," Mack said. 
"I don't want to get into any arguments from activists in the women's rights 
movement about who has been jacked around more by the system, but they are 
really missing the point that this case ought to be judged independently and 
separately." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the competing views, most legal experts had predicted that the death 
penalty was unlikely to be sought in the Simpson case. As a result, few were 
surprised Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Levenson, a Loyola law school professor and former federal prosecutor, 
said a variety of factors had made it unlikely that the district attorney's 
office would seek to execute Simpson. Sympathy for the famous football star, 
his lack of a lengthy criminal record and the rarity of imposing the death 
penalty in domestic homicides all weighed against seeking it in this case, 
Levenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, legal experts noted that almost all prisoners on Death Row have few 
financial resources. Simpson is a multimillionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Garcetti's administration, the Special Circumstances Committee has 
reviewed about 300 cases as of July. Capital punishment was deemed warranted in 
about 16% of those cases, according to statistics provided by the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Death was most often sought when someone was killed in the course of a 
robbery. It was next most often sought in cases involving multiple murders, the 
special circumstance with which Simpson is charged. Only one domestic violence 
case resulted in a decision to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, according to its own guidelines, does not seek the death 
penalty unless it believes that the evidence bearing on the issue is of "such 
convincing force" that a judge or jury would have no choice but to conclude 
that the aggravating circumstances, those that work against the accused, 
outweigh the mitigating circumstances, those that work in his or her favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Gessler, the capital cases coordinator in the public defender's 
office, said Friday that Garcetti's decision was a "perfectly proper one." 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem in that case has been O.J.'s celebrity status and the fact that 
everybody has been waiting for the D.A.'s decision," he said. "If this were a 
case of a non-celebrity, I think the decision to go for life would have been 
made long ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Gessler said Garcetti's decision "takes into account the realities of any 
domestic situation, a long-term marriage situation or romantic situation where 
emotions come into play." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor, cited some of the same issues and said 
the district attorney acted correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 "No jury would have given Mr. Simpson the death penalty for two important 
reasons," he said. "First, they couldn't have dehumanized him, which is what 
jurors need to do when they impose the death penalty. Second, Mr. Simpson 
doesn't have the past criminal history that would suggest his execution is 
necessary to eliminate any ongoing lethal threat to society." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most observers praised the decision, they also were critical of the 
district attorney for taking so long to reach it. Barry Levin, a defense 
attorney and former Los Angeles police officer, said the decision should not 
have been a difficult one and added that the delays undoubtedly complicated the 
task for Simpson's lawyers as they rush to prepare for the upcoming trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Harland W. Braun, a well-known Los Angeles defense lawyer, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's astounding that it took them this long to make such an obvious 
decision," said Braun, who once worked in the district attorney's office. "Even 
if it was premeditated, it was still based on simmering passion. It was never a 
death penalty case. It seemed as though the D.A.'s office enjoyed being the 
center of attention for so long and dickering over somebody's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, like cowards, they sort of make the announcement on a Friday afternoon 
and run for home," Braun added. "They should explain what factors went into 
this decision so we can judge the application of the death penalty from the 
public's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 The most vehement protest came from attorney Leslie Abramson. Abramson is 
defending Erik Menendez, who faces a possible death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 She praised Garcetti for deciding not to seek the death penalty against 
Simpson, but called him a hypocritical politician for continuing to seek it 
against her client, who along with his brother, Lyle, shotgunned their parents 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the absolute sense, it is right: O.J. does not deserve the death penalty 
-- even if he did what they say he did, which there is no proof of yet," 
Abramson said. But she said Garcetti "can draw no viable distinction (between) 
seeking death for the Menendez brothers and not for O.J. There is only a 
political difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Abramson said both the Simpson case and the Menendez case involve domestic 
violence. She also stressed that her client and his brother had no prior 
criminal record and that two juries had failed to convict them of first-degree 
murder, a prerequisite for seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, she said the district attorney's decision to continue to seek the 
death penalty against the brothers is "neither pragmatic, legal or moral," but 
rather political. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, Mr. Garcetti is not worried about the Cuban American vote," 
Abramson said. "Obviously, he is worried about the African American vote at the 
jury and in the next election." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Andrea Ford, Henry Weinstein, Alan Abrahamson, Matthew 
Mosk and Rebecca Trounson contributed to this story. Weighing the Death Penalty 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's Special Circumstances Committee does not seek the 
death penalty unless it believes that evidence bearing on the issue is of "such 
convincing force" that a judge or jury would have to conclude that aggravating 
circumstances -- those that work against the accused -- outweigh mitigating 
circumstances, those that work in his or her favor. The following factors could 
be aggravating or mitigating: 
</P>
<P>
 * Defendant's age: Simpson is 47. In general, the younger the age, the more 
mitigating the circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Criminal record: A prior felony conviction is an aggravating circumstance. 
Simpson has no felony record. He pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of 
spousal abuse in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * Special circumstance: The absence or presence of a special circumstance such 
as multiple murder, which is what Simpson is charged with. 
</P>
<P>
 * Force: The presence or absence of attempted use of force or violence or the 
threat of force of violence. The deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman were very violent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Emotional state: Whether the accused was at the time of the crime extremely 
mentally or emotionally disturbed. No evidence of this has been publicly 
offered one way or another in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 * Victim's role: Whether the victim participated in the homicide or consented 
to it. No public indication of this in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 * Extreme duress: Whether the accused acted under extreme duress or 
substantial domination by another person. No evidence publicly offered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Defendant's role: Whether the accused was an accomplice rather than a main 
actor and the degree to which he or she was involved in the crime. No hard 
evidence publicly offered, but Simpson's lawyers have contended in court that 
one person could not have committed the murders.

DECISION TO END BASEBALL SEASON IS POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball acting commissioner Bud Selig on Friday delayed a decision on 
canceling the remainder of the 1994 strike-bound season even though a proposal 
from the players union -- made amid increased optimism a day earlier -- was 
rejected by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 On Day 29 of the players' strike, the owners' negotiating committee said the 
proposal failed to achieve the cost certainty that the owners believe is 
possible through the salary cap proposal they delivered to the players on June 
14 and which remains on the bargaining table. The salary cap is steadfastly 
opposed by the players union. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, arrived in New York on Friday and said 
he would not enforce his tentative Friday deadline for reaching a settlement or 
canceling the season, choosing instead to make that decision early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very patient and very cautious, and I've said all along that common sense 
will prevail," Selig said of the deadline. "I'm willing to bend over backward 
(in pursuit of an agreement), but at some point we have to establish common 
ground, and tragically we've been unable to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no negotiating sessions scheduled over the weekend, but lawyers for 
both sides are expected to meet this morning to review the situation and 
possibly re-examine the players' proposal in relationship to a similar proposal 
the owners have discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Fehr, the union's executive director, said it becomes "progressively 
harder with each passing day" to think in terms of saving the season, along 
with the playoffs and World Series, "but we won't shut the door until they shut 
it. The only thing positive about today was that they didn't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Eugene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said that unless 
there was positive movement in the negotiations in the next 72 to 96 hours, it 
would be impossible to resume play. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Series has been conducted annually since 1904, surviving a 
Depression, two World Wars and the 1989 Bay Area earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody dreads these circumstances or is more dismayed by them than I am," 
Selig said. "But as horrifying and heartbreaking as the short-term pain is, the 
long-term pain of not dealing with our economic problems would be far worse. 
Those problems have been repressed for too long." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners' response to the escalation of salaries and a revenue disparity 
among the clubs that they claim has left several smaller market franchises in 
economic peril has been the salary cap proposal they are expected to implement 
unilaterally if negotiations fail to produce a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The union contends that the owners' proposal would place an artificial ceiling 
on salaries, destroy free agency and transfer millions of dollars from the 
players to owners. 
</P>
<P>
 It was after a week of behind-the-scenes conversations between union officials 
and some club executives -- primarily Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris, 
Boston Red Sox chief executive officer John Harrington and Atlanta Braves 
President Stan Kasten -- that the union developed the proposal they made on 
Thursday, raising a degree of hope that seemed to be dashed just a day later. 
</P>
<P>
 The key provision in the union proposal called for a 1 1/2% tax on the 
payrolls and revenues of the 16 highest revenue clubs. The collected tax would 
be redistributed to the other 12 clubs, helping to balance the alleged 
disparity. Owners claimed Friday that $50 million -- based on 1994 projections 
before the strike -- would be redistributed by the players plan compared to $70 
million through the owners' salary cap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Selig and the owners' chief negotiator, Richard Ravitch, who has 
reportedly fallen into disfavor among some owners and seemed to have been moved 
out of the daily process by the recent involvement of McMorris, Harrington and 
Kasten, said in a news conference that the proposal failed to restrict salary 
growth, provide the owners with cost certainty or draw a link between revenue 
and salaries, as the cap does. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same stuff we've been hearing for generations," said Fehr, convinced 
that the owners' ongoing goal is to destroy free agency through the unilateral 
implementation of their salary cap. "Nothing we have said or done in these 
negotiations has mattered. All they preach is the salary cap." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he was hopeful the owners would re-examine the proposal and see the 
merit in it, insisting the tax provides cost containment by penalizing the 
higher payrolls. He acknowledged, however, that to raise it in an attempt to 
increase the amount of revenue being shared by the big and small markets would 
be an impediment to clubs signing high salaried free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have discussed a similar tax plan, but the tax would be levied 
after a payroll reached a designated ceiling, which the union contends is the 
equivalent of a cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We both have tax concepts on the table, and there ought to be a way to work 
with the concepts and formulas to find a solution," said McMorris. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington and Kasten are remaining in New York to work on that. McMorris was 
scheduled to leave today, and Selig, who met with Fehr later Friday to reaffirm 
a sense of hope and urgency regarding their quest for a solution, was scheduled 
to leave this morning.

 PROFESSOR ROBERTI: Departing state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) is 
headed to the classroom. He's been hired by USC for the fall term as a 
part-time teacher in American political parties, campaign trends and political 
reform, "things I'm fairly conversant with, for better or for worse." . . . 
Roberti, leader of the state Senate for 13 years, leaves office in December 
(A21).

 DREAM ON: Many people thought Toluca Lake's Paul Dooley could have received an 
Oscar for his portrayal of the jaded used-car salesman in 1979's "Breaking 
Away," but he wasn't even nominated. . . . At Sunday's Emmy Awards, however, 
Dooley has another chance to be recognized by his peers. He was nominated for 
his guest role in HBO's "Dream On." 
</P>
<P>
 CLOSING SHOP: He made John Wayne's boots and Elvis Presley's gold suit. Nudie 
was a tailor to the stars. But the North Hollywood Western-wear shop that made 
him a name in this town will shut down in a few weeks. Nudie died in 1984, and 
now his wife, Bobbie, is retiring (B1). . . . Manuel Ortiz (above), who plans 
to open his own tailor shop, checks out the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 THE TV VALLEY: Fox has more than football this fall -- it has a piece of the 
Valley, too. The network's new drama, "Party of Five," premiering Monday night, 
will feature some action filmed at two local schools -- John Burroughs High in 
Burbank and Walter Reed Middle School in North Hollywood. . . . The series, set 
in San Francisco, revolves around a family of five orphans. 
</P>
<P>
 NEVER TOO LATE: They're old enough to be grandmothers, even 
great-grandmothers. Big deal. Does that mean fitness is out of fashion? 
Definitely not. The 50 women who meet three times a week in a Northridge gym 
are taking part in an exercise study (B2). . . . Said Bo-Ching Tong, 83, of 
Granada Hills, who used to teach tap dancing: "Who knows? Maybe when the study 
is over, I can start teaching again." Michael Arkush

BRIEFING BOOK; THE PATH TO PEACE; A YEAR AFTER ISRAEL AND THE PLO SIGNED THEIR 
LANDMARK PACT, BOTH SIDES REPORT PROGRESS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS. DESPITE 
SETBACKS, MOST SAY PROCESS IS IRREVERSIBLE. 
</P>

<P>
 That handshake -- Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser 
Arafat uneasily reaching out to one another last September -- summed up not 
only the hopes and achievements but also the tragedies and fears of their 
peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 Encapsulated in that dramatic moment were the past and the future of the 
Middle East, and standing on the South Lawn of the White House, Rabin quoted 
the admonition of the biblical Book of Ecclesiastes, "To everything there is a 
season and a time to every purpose under heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 After more than 100 years of conflict between Arabs and Jews, Rabin said, "the 
time for peace has come." 
</P>
<P>
 PROMISES: In months of secret negotiations, Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization had reached a historic accord recognizing the 
legitimacy of both Jewish and Palestinian aspirations for national homelands 
and, consequently, the need to divide the land between the Mediterranean Sea 
and the Jordan River over which they had fought for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the Palestinians would begin a five-year period of 
self-rule, establishing their own government in the Gaza Strip and West Bank 
town of Jericho and extending it later through the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel would begin withdrawing its forces from Palestinian territories, ending 
27 years of military occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 This was only the first step -- the hardest questions, including establishment 
of a Palestinian state, its borders, rival claims over Jerusalem, the future of 
Jewish settlements and the return of Palestinian refugees, were deferred for 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 However tentative, the agreement signed last Sept. 13 freed strong forces for 
peace. The fate of the Palestinians had been at the core of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, and the accord with the PLO opened opportunities for Israel to sign 
peace treaties with neighboring Arab states and break out of its regional 
isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet both Rabin and Arafat have faced bitter opposition because of the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat was accused of selling out the Palestinians, of accepting "the criminal 
Zionist entity," of failing the hundreds of thousands of refugees scattered 
through the Arab world, of "abandoning the revolution . . . for personal power 
in a postage stamp of a place." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin was denounced as "a dangerous megalomaniac," "the traitor who signed the 
death warrant for the State of Israel"; in cruel caricatures posted throughout 
Israel, he is often portrayed as an Arab terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
 ACCOMPLISHMENTS: Implementation of the basic agreement on self-government 
required months of arduous, often bitter negotiations; resurgent violence 
repeatedly threatened to upset the process. But after a year, there are major 
gains: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Gaza Strip, for so long a hellhole for both the Palestinians and their 
Israeli occupiers, is tranquil despite dire predictions of murderous conflict. 
The PLO quickly established its authority as its security forces deployed to an 
enthusiastic welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Palestinians established their first government. It is taking shape in a 
day-by-day struggle that, nonetheless, gives people in the Gaza Strip a sense 
of control over their lives. Under an expansion of the Palestinian Authority's 
powers, Palestinians are taking over management of education, health care, 
welfare services, tourism and taxation in the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most Israelis are happy to be out of the Gaza Strip, recent opinion surveys 
say, and are looking forward to ending Israel's occupation of the West Bank. 
They are angered by continuing attacks on their soldiers and settlers by 
Palestinian radicals opposed to the peace process but largely agree with the 
government that the deal was a good one. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once Arafat had returned to the Gaza Strip and West Bank and the Palestinian 
Authority had had been established, King Hussein of Jordan felt free to press 
his own negotiations with Israel, signing a declaration with Rabin ending the 
state of war between their countries. King Hassan II of Morocco followed by 
agreeing to open low-level diplomatic relations with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 PROSPECTS: For many Palestinians, progress comes too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gaza Strip, unemployment remains acute -- at least 50%, probably much 
more. More than 80% of families live hand-to-mouth, largely subsisting on 
meager welfare rations. Development aid promised by the West has only trickled 
in as donors have delayed help until the Palestinian Authority established 
priorities and accounting procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivals of Arafat's Fatah group are restless, demanding elections that will let 
them compete for a larger role in the new authority but making Fatah nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems remain from the year of negotiations. Israel continues to hold about 
5,000 Palestinian prisoners, many on politically related charges. The passage 
between Gaza and Jericho has not been opened. Palestinians want to enlarge the 
Jericho enclave and to have a presence at the border crossings from Jordan and 
Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian elections, part of the original accord, will be a watershed. 
They will constitute a referendum on the deal Arafat struck with Rabin. They 
will install the Palestinians' first popularly chosen national government. 
</P>
<P>
 And, under the accord, Israeli troops will pull back from Palestinian towns 
and villages in the West Bank. Israel so far has not agreed to the scope and 
timing of the Palestinian vote, planned for Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Also ahead are tough talks on what both sides call the "final settlement" 
issues. But some, notably the status of Jerusalem and the future of the Jewish 
enclaves in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, crop up almost daily. Arafat is now 
seeking to expedite those negotiations, but Rabin has refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tied to the Palestinians and dependent on their success in 
self-government, Israel is looking to other tasks -- breaking the stalemate 
with Syria, the key to a regional peace; ending the Arab economic boycott; 
establishing relations with Tunisia and perhaps some Arab countries of the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems, the peace momentum continues. Israeli and Palestinian 
leaders alike assert that it has become irreversible, that the question now is 
how well -- or badly -- the accord will be carried out.

GAY AUSTRALIAN TAKES COMPLAINT TO U.N. PANEL -- AND WINS; TASMANIA: 
CONDEMNATION OF STATE'S SODOMY LAWS STIRS FIERCE DEBATE. ISLAND REBUFFS 
COMMITTEE'S CALL FOR CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On Christmas Day, 1991, Nick Toonen, a 29-year-old homosexual who lives on 
Australia's remote island of Tasmania, filed an unusual complaint with the 
United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Toonen wrote to the U.N. Human Rights Commission in Geneva that Tasmania's 
80-year-old laws banning "intercourse against nature" constituted a threat to 
his life and liberty, violated his privacy and led to constant vilification and 
threats of physical violence. 
</P>
<P>
 To the surprise of many Australians and the consternation of others, the U.N. 
commission announced in March that it agreed with Toonen. It called on 
Tasmania, one of Australia's six states, to repeal its sodomy laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Tasmanian government has defiantly refused to change the laws. The 
dispute has led the Australian federal government to draw up legislation 
overriding the state's laws, prompted an economic boycott of the island by 
outraged groups and embarrassed many Australians, whose country has a 
reputation for tolerance toward gay men and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Australia was one of the first countries in the world to allow 
homosexuals to join the military. It allows its ambassadors abroad to live in 
openly homosexual relationships and even has, in Sydney's state of New South 
Wales, an "anti-vilification" law that makes it a criminal offense to make a 
derogatory remark about gay people. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia's five other states repealed their sodomy laws more than a decade 
ago. The country now has gay hotels, gay resorts, even gay grocery stores. When 
Australia's state television company broadcast Sydney's gay and lesbian Mardi 
Gras parade in prime time on a Sunday night earlier this year, it recorded the 
highest ratings ever received by the network. 
</P>
<P>
 But Australians are just as suspicious of their federal commonwealth 
government in Canberra as Americans are of Washington. Criminal laws in 
Australia are the exclusive domain of state parliaments, and there is no 
constitutional provision for federal review except in rare cases involving 
conflicts with foreign powers. 
</P>
<P>
 The government of Tasmania, which initially defended the laws as a public 
health measure, is increasingly portraying the dispute as a states' rights 
issue, which has far more popular appeal. "I want to see the states unite to 
stop the commonwealth government from abusing its external affairs powers," 
Tasmanian Premier Ray Groom announced during a recent visit to Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over Tasmania's sodomy laws has also stirred up painful memories of 
Australia's turbulent past. Tasmania, then known as Van Diemen's Land and its 
inhabitants as "demons," was established as Britain's overseas prison colony, 
an antipodean Devil's Island. As long ago as 1843, according to the historian 
Robert Hughes, author of "The Fatal Shore," an account of early Australia, 
settlers on the island tried to halt the transportation of convicts from 
England, citing fears of rampant homosexuality among the prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a feeling among middle-class settlers that Tasmania was permanently 
stained by this unnatural vice. It's the descendants of those settlers who 
dominate the state parliament today," said Rodney Croome, one of the founders 
of Tasmania's Gay Law Reform Group, who until recently was Toonen's lover. It 
was Croome's idea to bring the case before the United Nations after efforts to 
repeal the laws twice failed to pass the state parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Tasmania's history and remoteness, many urban Australians are 
tempted to dismiss it as a land of rednecks. But it is in fact quite diverse, 
divided by an invisible line that seems to separate the more conservative farm 
belt of the north from the more cosmopolitan south, which includes Hobart. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a strikingly beautiful land of 480,000 where the hottest political 
issue, after the question of gay law reform, is whether shops should be allowed 
to remain open on Saturday afternoons, which is now prohibited by law. There is 
a law still on the books making it a criminal offense for a man to dress up in 
women's clothes after nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the police in Tasmania have appeared reluctant to prosecute 
homosexuals; indeed, Croome and three others have turned themselves in to the 
police in hopes of provoking a court case. Official statistics show 46 criminal 
convictions for sodomy involving both men and women since 1976, with punishment 
ranging from a fine to 2 1/2 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Toonen, who has never been charged under the disputed laws, said in an 
interview that the question of prosecution is irrelevant to the harm the laws 
do. "Whenever the issue comes up in areas such as service, the response is 
always, 'It's against the law.' This places a stigma on all gay and lesbian 
people," he said. "The law has an effect on the way you feel about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Toonen, who runs a voluntary agency in Hobart, said he agreed to file the 
complaint because he had grown up in Tasmania and was committed to remaining on 
the island. In the past, most gay men and lesbians left for Sydney, a gay mecca 
much like San Francisco, as soon as they could, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big issue is transformation of attitudes in Tasmania," Croome added. 
"There wouldn't be such an obsessive debate unless the issue touched something 
very deep in what it means to be Tasmanian. Society is very deeply polarized." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the campaign to preserve the laws is the island's attorney general, 
Ron Cornish, a former police officer. Cornish said the laws have not been 
changed because they reflect the will of the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that sodomy should remain a criminal offense and remain on the 
statute books," Cornish said. "The No. 1 reason is that we believe that through 
the practice of sodomy there is a high transmission of sexual diseases, the 
most serious of which is AIDS." The infection rate for HIV, the AIDS virus, is 
much lower in Tasmania than in the rest of Australia, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. decision has caused an angry backlash among conservative voters who 
support the sodomy laws, forming groups with names like Homophobic Activists 
Liberation Organization. "Can the U.N. prevent God's wrath falling on those who 
reintroduce the practice of Babylon?" a reader wrote to the Mercury, Tasmania's 
leading newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Gibbs, leader of an anti-homosexual group called TAS-Alert, said his 
1,500 members fear that homosexuals would use legalization to proselytize in 
public schools. "We're alarmed at the deviation from justice and democracy and 
total disregard of the will of the Tasmanian and the Australian people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The caldron of controversy was stirred in late July when a Sydney chef named 
Peter Urmson organized a boycott of food produced in Tasmania, the island's 
main export, in an effort to force the government's hand. The Buy Right 
campaign signed up 300 businesses and received support from as far away as 
Europe to boycott Tasmanian apples, cheese and its distinctive Cascade beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This boycott will stay in place until that legislation is completely 
overturned," Urmson said, adding that about 40% of those participating are 
heterosexual. "We want to show Ron Cornish he doesn't have the people of 
Australia behind him." 
</P>
<P>
 The boycott has propelled the issue into a fierce debate in Australia, with 
some opponents of the state's laws saying they are nonetheless going out of 
their way to buy Tasmanian. "As grotesque as the criminal sections are, however 
-- and this is a king-sized however -- one must deplore the arrogance and 
meretriciousness of the effort by homosexuals to have them rescinded," 
columnist Frank Devine wrote in the newspaper the Australian. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Paterson, a cheese producer in northern Tasmania and head of the 
island's Food and Beverage Assn., reported in early August that the boycott had 
no measurable effect. "Inevitably you have innocent people hurt. It's dividing 
the community -- for every person who says he is not going to buy Tasmanian, 
there is someone else who says he is." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over gay law reform has even divided the Tasmanian government. Sue 
Napier, an assistant minister of youth and women's affairs, asked for a 
conscience vote -- in which members can vote outside party discipline -- in the 
state parliament because she opposed the ruling Liberal Party's opposition to 
reform. But she lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see the law changed. By decriminalizing, it doesn't mean you 
encourage or condone homosexuality," Napier said in a telephone interview. "But 
I knew that the party's policy was not to reform when I stood for election." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lester, a respected political columnist for the Mercury, argued that 
the Liberal Party, which despite the name is Australia's conservative political 
movement, took a tough line on the laws because it depends heavily for support 
on the so-called Bible Belt in the north of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Liberals were concerned with intrusions made by the National 
Party, which represents the far right wing and until recently never had much 
support in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is blatant political hypocrisy," said John White, a member of the state 
parliament and the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on legal matters. "For 
the government to say we're a Christian-based society which believes in the 
Bible and refuse to accept what Christ said about tolerance and forgiveness is 
just unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lavarch, the Australian federal attorney general, said he would 
present legislation to Parliament in Canberra this month to override the 
Tasmanian laws. He said the federal government can act in this case because of 
its treaty obligations with the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy could easily end with a political standoff, with the police 
unable to prosecute anyone because the law has been overridden by the federal 
government but with the sodomy laws still on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Toonen and Croome said they want to retreat a little from the 
huge public attention that has been brought to bear since the U.N. decision. 
While they won a public victory, their relationship came to an end, Toonen 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happens, we've broken the back of the whole issue," Toonen said. "It 
has become an embarrassment to a country which prides itself on its human 
rights position."

IRISH NATIONALIST EXPECTED TO GET U.S. VISA; NORTHERN IRELAND: SINN FEIN LEADER 
LIKELY TO SPEAK TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND BE ALLOWED TO VISIT SEVERAL CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nationalist leader Gerry Adams said Friday that he will apply for a visa to 
revisit the United States and hopes to arrive before the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 He is expected to be invited to address members of Congress to explain 
developments in the Northern Ireland peace process following the historic 
cease-fire declared last week by the outlawed Irish Republican Army. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton is expected to approve the visa for Adams on the grounds 
that the cease-fire was declared and is holding, despite the refusal by 
loyalist paramilitary groups to announce a similar truce in the 25-year-long 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The visa application will be opposed by the British government, which also 
objected to Adams being granted entry last February. But the Clinton 
Administration overruled the objections; Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the 
political wing of the IRA, spent 48 hours in New York City in a media blitz, 
presenting his version of the cause of Irish unity. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Adams is expected to seek, and get, a less restrictive visa that 
will allow him to travel to New York, Washington, Chicago, Boston -- and 
perhaps San Francisco and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But militant Protestant leader the Rev. Ian Paisley, a member of the British 
Parliament, warned that U.S. "interference" in the affairs of Northern Ireland 
could bring closer "the time for civil war" in the troubled province. 
</P>
<P>
 Paisley made his comments after meeting the U.S. consul general here. He 
argued against issuing a visa and said any visit by Clinton to the province -- 
although none has been suggested -- would provoke widespread protest by 
Protestant unionists, who want continued British rule in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 But another leading unionist member of Parliament, John Taylor, said Friday 
that he thinks the IRA campaign of violence is effectively over. 
</P>
<P>
 "My gut reaction is that this cease-fire is for real," said Taylor, a member 
of the moderate Ulster Unionist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The upbeat remarks by Taylor, who was shot several times by an IRA gunman in 
1972, were thought to lift some of the unionist pressure on the Clinton 
Administration to deny Adams a visa. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, the primate of the Protestant Church of Ireland, Dr. Robin 
Eames, pleaded with the loyalists to call a halt to violence -- and heed 
British Prime Minister John Major's personal assurance to him that there had 
been no secret deal negotiated between London and the IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior cleric warned the Protestant paramilitaries, "If the perception on 
the part of many Protestants that the current peace process is somehow confined 
to the nationalist or Republican community is allowed to grow, it will place a 
dangerous imbalance on the possibilities of long-term peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rarely has sensitivity to each other's feelings been more important than at 
this time," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, who signed a declaration with Major last 
December opening the way for all-party peace talks on Northern Ireland, also 
urged the loyalists to end their violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take your time in making up your minds," he said. "You are entitled to time, 
the same as others were entitled to time, but at the end of the day we want to 
see you participate in and contribute to the creation of a permanent and 
enduring peace on the island of Ireland."

ARMENIA, AZERBAIJAN AGREE TO EXTEND THEIR CEASE-FIRE; STRIFE: BOTH SIDES VOW TO 
INTENSIFY SEARCH FOR PEACE IN DISPUTED NAGORNO-KARABAKH AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, brought together by Russian 
mediators, agreed here Friday night to extend a 4-month-old cease-fire in the 
disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and to intensify their search for a 
peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a step forward," Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev remarked 
after two days of talks at a Russian government compound. He said there will be 
"a series of such meetings" leading to a three-way summit involving Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 "There we will dot the i's and cross the t's and strike a final agreement," 
Kozyrev predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The two former Soviet republics have been fighting more than six years for 
control of the ethnic Armenian enclave within Azerbaijan. Last year 
Nagorno-Karabakh's militia, backed by Armenia, drove the Azerbaijani army out 
of the enclave and seized adjacent Azerbaijani lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Worn down by the conflict, which has taken more than 20,000 lives, the two 
sides agreed to a cease-fire May 12 and have largely observed it. But peace 
talks have stalled over two procedural disputes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Azerbaijan insists that Armenian forces withdraw to Nagorno-Karabakh's 
borders before negotiations can proceed; Armenia wants the troops to stay where 
they are until a settlement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 * Armenia wants Russian peacekeepers to separate the warring parties; 
Azerbaijan rejects the Russian army as an unfriendly force. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev said the talks between Presidents Levon Ter-Petrosyan of Armenia and 
Heydar Aliyev of Azerbaijan gave "impetus to the negotiating process" but 
announced no resolution of any dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The two presidents imposed a vow of silence on their negotiators and left 
Moscow without commenting on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Azerbaijani Foreign Minister Gasan Gasanov told his country's Habar news 
agency that at least one major issue remains unresolved -- Armenia's insistence 
on controlling a narrow supply corridor to the enclave through Azerbaijani 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenian Embassy spokesman Georgy L. Ovanesyan said the two delegations will 
resume their talks here today at a lower level and work toward more top-level 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This process is irreversible," he said. "But it is a long-term process." 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians and diplomats in Azerbaijan said in interviews last month that 
several forces were pushing the two sides toward an agreement. The onset of 
winter is a threat to fuel-starved Armenia, cut off by a trade blockade 
organized by Azerbaijan and its allies. And hundreds of thousands of 
Azerbaijanis made homeless by the war are becoming a burden on their 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a draft settlement now on the table, Armenia would give back most 
conquered Azerbaijani territory, refugees from both sides would go home, the 
trade blockade would end and a mixture of Russian and European troops would 
keep peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft does not cover the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh itself, a 
mountainous territory the size of West Virginia inhabited mostly but not 
exclusively by ethnic Armenians. That issue will go on the agenda for the next 
summit, the Armenian spokesman said.

RETIRED ADMIRAL RETURNS TO VIETNAM; ASIA: AMERICAN BELIEVES AGENT ORANGE HE 
ORDERED SPRAYED LED TO SON'S DEATH FROM CANCER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bittersweet journey after 25 years, retired Adm. Elmo Zumwalt Jr. 
returned to Vietnam on Friday for the first time since he ordered the spraying 
of the defoliant Agent Orange that he believes led to the cancer death of his 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels nostalgic," he said. "It's good to be back. I have for many years 
wanted to come to discuss important policy issues with the government of 
Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 His mission during his weeklong visit, he said, is to complete an agreement 
with the Vietnamese to support joint research on Agent Orange and to "bind up 
the wounds of war." 
</P>
<P>
 "The work I'm doing in the case of Agent Orange and as chairman of the 
National Marrow Donor Program are both my way of memorializing my son rather 
than trying to do it with bricks and mortar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Zumwalt, it was a strange feeling to be in the territory of his former 
battlefield foes. 
</P>
<P>
 As commander of U.S. naval forces in Vietnam from 1968 until 1970 and then as 
chief of naval operations until his retirement in 1974, he had seen the 
Communist North Vietnamese terrain through satellite photographs many times. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to be able to come in and meet with people who were adversaries for so 
long on policy issues of mutual interest is really an exciting experience," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese gave him a red-carpet reception that included scheduled 
meetings with President Le Duc Anh and with a legendary old battlefield foe, 
Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, now 83. Giap held off half a million American troops and 
led North Vietnam to a victory over the U.S.-backed South. 
</P>
<P>
 Zumwalt, 73, of Arlington, Va., was accompanied by another son, James, also a 
Vietnam veteran, and by a leading U.S. expert on Agent Orange, Dr. Arnold 
Schecter. 
</P>
<P>
 Zumwalt's eldest son, Elmo Zumwalt III, served in Vietnam from June, 1969, 
until August, 1970, as a lieutenant junior grade commanding a patrol boat in 
the Mekong Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 He died of cancer in August, 1988, at age 42. Agent Orange also was believed 
to have caused severe learning disabilities in his own son, Russell, now 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Zumwalt was stationed in the region most saturated with Agent 
Orange to reduce vegetation and deprive the enemy of natural cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I operated in areas that were so heavily hit with Agent Orange that they 
looked like burned-out World War II forests," he said in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1983, lymphoma was diagnosed and Zumwalt says he has no doubt that 
Agent Orange was to blame for his son's illness. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither ever had any guilt feelings, Zumwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son and I both believed to the day of his death that he was almost 
certainly alive as the result of the use of Agent Orange and the great 
reduction in casualties that stemmed from defoliation," Zumwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would use Agent Orange again today in identical circumstances if we didn't 
have non-carcinogenic defoliants, because we greatly reduced the deaths and 
woundings by using it," he said. "Instead of losing or maiming 6,000 out of 
every 10,000, we're now seeing six or eight out of every 10,000 come down with 
cancer."

JAPAN WILL MAINTAIN U.S. SECURITY TIES, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan will "faithfully stand by" security arrangements with the United States, 
including continued support of troops in Okinawa and commitments to pay for 
U.S. bases and personnel, Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The presence of U.S. troops in Japan is still of great importance, and the 
U.S. presence is meaningful for this reason," Kono said in a wide-ranging 
interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has drawn attention in Japan, where the Defense Agency is 
threatening to renege on promises to pay 100% of the costs of U.S. facilities 
and Japanese employee salaries in fiscal year 1995, which begins next April. 
</P>
<P>
 Total defense spending also threatens to drop below the symbolic 1% level of 
gross national product maintained for the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Okinawan politicians in Kono's Liberal Democratic Party came out 
this year in favor of removing all U.S. bases from Japan. About 75% of U.S. 
troops in Japan are stationed in Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 25, former Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama, chairman of the Liberal 
Democrats' foreign policy research board, said that the Okinawa politicians' 
activities against the bases "is a problem with our party president serving as 
foreign minister." The politicians started openly advocating removal of bases 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's current coalition government, led by Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi 
Murayama, has sought to portray itself as a "peace government." And Kono 
himself is regarded as a dove. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foreign minister, who is in Los Angeles to attend four-nation trade 
talks, said Japanese support remains unwavering and that the current government 
intends to place a greater value on relations with the United States than did 
the previous administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am affirmative of the (troops') presence on Okinawa," Kono said. "Prime 
Minister Murayama clearly stated to President Clinton that he would uphold 
U.S.-Japan security arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Japan would move to develop nuclear weapons if North Korea does 
so, Kono said: "One hundred percent, No." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the critical issue is not whether North Korea possesses nuclear 
weapons -- many nations do, he said -- but whether or not relations with that 
communist country are hostile. He declined to specify what actions Japan would 
take to force North Korea to abide by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, 
saying he supports the current talks between Pyongyang and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what Japan will do if the U.S. government imposes trade sanctions, as it 
has been threatening, Kono said he "couldn't imagine" such measures being 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign minister, in the interview at the Century Plaza Hotel, also said 
no decision has been made on what kind of resolution to pass in Parliament 
expressing remorse for Japan's deeds in World War II, as Murayama has said will 
be done to mark the 50th anniversary of the war's end next August.

 Shooting by presumed drug traffickers forced the Brazilian army to divert a 
convoy of cars carrying Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari to an 
international summit, a Brazilian news agency reported.Salinas and his staff 
arrived in Rio de Janeiro's international airport Thursday and were due to 
drive down the Linha Vermelha, or Red Line, when army units on the highway 
reported shooting in one of the numerous shantytowns nearby, the Estado agency 
said. An army colonel quoted by Estado said he believed drug traffickers were 
behind the shooting. No shots were fired by the army, he said.

 The United States and European nations are drafting a U.N. resolution to ease 
sanctions against Yugoslavia in return for its cutoff of non-humanitarian aid 
to Bosnian Serbs. Speaking on condition of anonymity, diplomats said Friday 
that the sanctions could be relaxed because the Yugoslav government agreed to 
the stationing of foreign civilian monitors along its border with 
Serb-controlled parts of Bosnia. Likely first steps would include reopening the 
airport in Belgrade to international flights and international sports and 
cultural contacts.

 About 40 people were wounded, some gravely, when an attacker hurled a grenade 
into the main market in the capital, Bujumbura, on Friday, security sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grenade exploded in a part of the market reserved for selling hardware and 
used-car parts, they said.The wounded were taken to the nearby Prince Louis 
Rwagasore clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 At least nine people were killed and 17 wounded last Sunday in an attack on a 
Roman Catholic church in Burundi's northeast Muyinga province by a gunman and 
others wielding machetes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic violence and strikes in August swept much of the central African 
nation, which has the same ethnic mix of Hutus and Tutsis as neighboring Rwanda 
and has been teetering on the brink of anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven people were wounded Aug. 11 when an unidentified attacker threw a 
grenade into the central market.

 Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, Burundi's interim leader, said last month the 
country would be plunged back into turmoil unless rival political groups 
resolved the question of who will be the next president.

<P>
 Ntibantunganya, a Hutu and former National Assembly chief, has been interim 
president since President Cyprian Ntaryamira was killed in the same plane crash

Rwanda.

FDA BEGINS DRIVE TO REDESIGN DRUG LABELS; REGULATION: OFFICIALS SAY THE GOAL IS 
TO MAKE OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCT INFORMATION CLEARER. NEW NUTRITIONAL MARKERS 
WILL BE THE MODEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration has begun overhauling the labels on 
over-the-counter drugs to make information more readable and understandable for 
consumers, agency officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The redesigned labels, which would appear on medicines purchased without a 
physician's prescription -- such as aspirin and antacids -- likely will be 
modeled after the new nutritional labels that are now on food packages across 
the nation. The new food labels feature a standard, easy-to-read format that is 
consistent among all products. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to have better-informed consumers," said Dr. Michael Weintraub, 
director of the FDA's office of over-the-counter drug evaluation, who presented 
the plan at a meeting of a joint subcommittee of the agency's non-prescription 
drugs and arthritis advisory committees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to be able to pick up a box of medication and know (from the 
label information) whether it's for them," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, agency officials emphasized that the work toward revamping the 
labels had only just begun and that there are numerous obstacles to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest problems -- and the most frequent complaint of consumers -- 
is tiny print size, which is very difficult to read for many consumers, 
particularly the elderly, they said. It results from manufacturers having to 
include all required information on a small package, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Print size is a problem, and getting this information to consumers is a 
problem," said William E. Gilbertson, director of the FDA's monograph review 
staff. "We have to consider ways to improve upon this. Right now there is no 
(FDA) regulation regarding print size." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials pledged to cooperate and work with the FDA to develop the 
new labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal for better readability is one we all have," said R. William Soller, 
senior vice president and director of science and technology for the 
Non-Prescription Drug Manufacturers Assn. "The general feeling within the 
industry is that there are ways to make the label better. . . . We are 
committed to good label readability." 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA said it is considering changes in text and format, including increased 
print size, and the possible use of boxed areas, symbols and contrasts in 
colors to emphasize warnings and other information. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, California approved legislation asking manufacturers of 
over-the-counter drugs to voluntarily make their labels more readable but some 
have complained that the law has no teeth because the changes are not 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is expected to study and test numerous draft labels among focus 
groups and others before releasing its proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, such proposed regulations are then subject to a period of public 
comment before final rules are released. Also, the industry likely would be 
given a time frame to use up old labels and phase in new ones. Thus, it could 
be several years before new labels actually begin appearing on products. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA first proposed revamping food labels in 1989. A year later, as the 
agency prepared to issue its final regulations, Congress approved legislation 
that, among other things, established an explicit timetable to implement the 
new labels, thus speeding up the process. The first new food labels began 
appearing in the summer of 1993. Last May was the final deadline for most 
foods. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA does not need congressional legislation to effect such changes on 
those products under its jurisdiction, although Congress has the power to 
overrule or alter the FDA's authority.

TEXT OF CLAUSE ON ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is the text of the abortion paragraph in the Plan of Action to be adopted 
at the U.N. International Conference on Population and Development. The 
language was approved Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 In no case should abortion be promoted as a method of family planning.All 
governments and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations 
are urged to strengthen their commitment to women's health, to deal with the 
health impact of unsafe abortion* as a major public health concern and to 
reduce the recourse to abortion through expanded and improved family-planning 
services. Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given the highest 
priority, and all attempts should be made to eliminate the need for abortion. 
Women who have unwanted pregnancies should have ready access to reliable 
information and compassionate counseling. Any measures or changes related to 
abortion within the health system can only be determined at the national or 
local level according to the national legislative process. In circumstances in 
which abortion is not against the law, such abortion should be safe. In all 
cases women should have access to quality services for the management of 
complications arising from abortion. Post-abortion counseling, education and 
family-planning services should be offered promptly, which will also help to 
avoid repeat abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Unsafe abortion is defined as a procedure for terminating an unwanted 
pregnancy either by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment 
lacking the minimal medical standards or both." (World Health Organization)

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; AT POPULATION CONFERENCE, FRUSTRATION SETS IN, T-SHIRTS GO 
ON 
</P>

 At about $10 apiece, they have become one of the hottest-selling souvenirs of 
a happening that is otherwise short on keepsakes: T-shirts showing the Pope's 
white hat with the universal red slash through it. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Vatican-inspired abortion debate at the U.N.-sponsored International 
Conference for Population and Development drew into its fifth day, both 
die-hard abortion-rights activists and even many anti-abortion activists were 
wearying of the argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Rieneke Ausherman of the International Federation of Family Health printed up 
the T-shirts in Louisiana long before the conference started, but it wasn't 
until the international game of politicking -- Would the Vatican sign or 
wouldn't it? -- went into tiresome extra innings that the T-shirts took off. 
</P>
<P>
 Informal working committees met late into the night with the Vatican's 
proposed changes on the abortion text, agonizing over whether "legal abortion" 
should be changed to "permitted abortion" or "where abortion is not against the 
law." Hours passed, then days. People flocked to the T-shirt stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have bought these. . . . And a number of priests too," 
Ausherman said. "They tell me they're fed up with the bishops, and it looks 
like everybody else is too. People are frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not that people are finally ready to stop arguing about abortion. They're just 
catching their breath. A press conference of the Women's Caucus on Thursday 
nearly broke into a melee when anti-abortion activists started shouting down 
mainstream feminists, who stood up and started singing "We Shall Overcome" in 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen D. Mumford, president of a group called the Center for Research on 
Population and Security, is working the crowd at the conference with a study 
that purports to show that real population control can't come about without 
"the widespread use of abortion." 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to get into this issue," he said, furtively pulling out a 
copy of his study, which even adamant abortion-rights activists have asked him 
to keep quiet about. "But we're literally misleading the whole of humanity on 
this if we don't make people realize that you cannot achieve even a 1% growth 
rate without abortion rates of at least 500 per 1,000 live births." 
</P>
<P>
 The International Right to Life Committee is also working overtime. Posters of 
mangled fetuses have disappeared as fast as they could be passed out, so the 
committee has ordered a new shipment from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really can't keep up with the demand," said Olivia Gans of Washington, 
D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally we have anywhere from four to 10 people at a time over here, 
particularly the Egyptians. With all the controversy, this has remained a very 
constructive place, a very positive place: a happy place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The code phrase: "The eagle has landed." 
</P>
<P>
 You hear it a lot these days around the corridors of the U.S. delegation's 
headquarters at the conference center. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it mean? The eagle, in this case, is Pharaoh's Revenge, a good 
old-fashioned intestinal devastation, served up Egyptian style. U.S. officials 
estimate that 60% of the delegation has come down with it (along with assorted 
flus and colds), and conferees of all nationalities are increasingly finding 
themselves confined to their hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 A young Senegalese delegate had to be taken to the hospital for treatment 
Thursday, and on Friday, Timothy E. Wirth, undersecretary of state for global 
affairs and the U.S. delegation's chief, said something cryptic as he slipped 
out of the conference hall early: "The eagle has laid lots of eggs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from the conference center, more than 1,800 non-governmental 
organizations have gathered for a population forum of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside the expected -- the International Planned Parenthood Federation, the 
International Women's Health Coalition, Population Action International, UNICEF 
-- are the less than expected. A group of turbaned Sikhs dishes out advice on 
how yoga and good food can improve women's reproductive health the natural way. 
Heifer Project International presents a panel discussion on "Women in Livestock 
Development." And then there is the Assn. of Garbage Collectors for Community 
Development of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One World Now, in connection with the International Population and Family 
Assn., reserved a meeting room at the Cairo Meridien for the entire week for a 
series of lectures and discussions called the Conference on Population, 
Development, Family Life and Ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first morning's session, they canceled the rest and decided to move 
out to the main conference center with everyone else. There was no one in the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 John Parker, an associate of One World Now founder Benton Musslewhite, 
explains that the idea is to erase national frontiers and place the entire 
world under the jurisdiction of the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wars were fought that developed lines all over the world, and Mr. Musslewhite 
kinda feels we should maybe take a step backwards and erase some of these 
lines," Parker said in a slow Louisiana drawl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Places like India, it's overcrowded. People are desperate, and they can't get 
out," he goes on. "There's some scholar says Texas can hold everybody in India 
-- give 'em all an acre of land and a house." 
</P>
<P>
 What would Texans think of this idea? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't suppose they'd like it much," Parker reflects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest delegate is Ione Grannis of Los Angeles, described in the 
conference's daily journal, Earth Times, as "92 and passionate." 
</P>
<P>
 Grannis has worked as a Los Angeles County social worker and a counselor for 
troubled women and unwed mothers for the Salvation Army. In Cairo, she's 
representing the United Nations Assn. of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very frightening to think of all the beautiful people, flora and fauna 
of this world devastated by the very people who benefit from it," she said.

ISRAEL TO RELEASE 127 PALESTINIANS CONFINED TO JERICHO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel will allow 127 Palestinians it has confined to the Palestinian 
self-rule enclave in the West Bank town of Jericho to return to their homes 
within a week, Israeli security sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forty-one have already been allowed home, and 127 more will go within a 
week," one security source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The freed men, barred from home and stuck in Jericho with nothing to do, have 
become a source of friction between Israel and the Palestinian Authority 
running self-rule. Jericho residents have demonstrated alongside the men 
demanding that they be allowed home. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the May 4 accord setting up self-rule in Jericho and the Gaza Strip, 
Israel pledged to free 5,000 Palestinian prisoners. Most have been released. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel forced about 550 freed Palestinians it had convicted of certain 
offenses who had homes elsewhere in the West Bank to stay in Jericho until 
their sentences ran out.

PALESTINIAN AID TALKS DERAILED OVER JERUSALEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Talks on crucial foreign aid to support Palestinian autonomy broke down Friday 
in a dispute between Israel and the Palestinians over whether some of the funds 
could be used in East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The conflict drew an angry rebuke from the talks' sponsor, the World Bank, 
which said the aid issue is too important to be "derailed by the two main 
parties." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank said it would try to resume the negotiations but set no date for 
reconvening the delegations from donor nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, which insists that Jerusalem must remain its undivided capital, 
vehemently objects to efforts by the new Palestinian administration to 
undertake projects in East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, interviewed on Israel's 
Arabic-language television, said that under the self-rule agreement with 
Israel, the Palestinians were not supposed to raise the issue of Jerusalem 
until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians would like to see East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from 
Jordan in the 1967 Middle East War, as capital of their would-be state. 
</P>
<P>
 Uri Savir, director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry and head of the 
Israeli delegation to the talks, told Israel Radio that the postponement would 
mean a delay in the expansion of autonomy to other areas.

U.S. TO SEND 2,000 TROOPS OFF HAITI; CARIBBEAN: THE PENTAGON'S DECISION DOUBLES 
THE NUMBER OF FORCES IN THE REGION. SOLDIERS WOULD ACT ONLY AS OCCUPYING FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a further sign of U.S. intentions in Haiti, the Pentagon on Friday decided 
to dispatch 2,000 Army infantry soldiers to within eyesight of the island's 
coastline in a move that doubles the number of U.S. combat forces in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers, part of the 10th Mountain Division from Ft. Drum, N.Y., are to 
leave Norfolk, Va., on Wednesday aboard the aircraft carrier Dwight D. 
Eisenhower and reach waters near Haiti within five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources stressed here Friday night that the troops would not be part of the 
landing force, should an invasion take place. Rather, they would act as part of 
the multinational occupying force that would help restore order once the 
Haitian military chief, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, is ousted and deposed Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is returned to power. 
</P>
<P>
 "These troops are going in no matter what," said one senior Pentagon official. 
"The only uncertainty now is how Cedras leaves, whether he steps down or gets 
stepped on." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th Mountain soldiers will boost to nearly 4,000 the number of U.S. 
troops stationed near Haiti. On Aug. 17, 1,800 U.S. Marines landed in Puerto 
Rico, where they have been conducting exercises to prepare for either an 
invasion of Haiti or for assignments as part of the occupying force there. 
</P>
<P>
 "These Marines can evacuate Americans or invade or help in mop-up activities," 
one U.S. military official said Friday. "They can do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th Mountain soldiers are specifically designed as a unit trained to 
fight in difficult terrain. They have a long history dating back to campaigns 
during World War II that helped break the German resistance in northern Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the 10th Mountain was used to help bring in first-aid supplies 
to war-torn Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pentagon officials, two Navy ships -- the Eisenhower and the 
Mount Whitney -- were ordered Friday to return to the Norfolk naval base after 
leaving Wednesday for long-planned joint exercises in the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 They are to arrive in Norfolk today and Monday, sources said, and will be 
prepared for the Caribbean mission. The Eisenhower will be reconfigured to 
carry the soldiers, while the Mount Whitney will be used as a command and 
control ship. 
</P>
<P>
 The ships will depart Wednesday for Haiti, where sources said they are to be 
in place by Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be right offshore within eyesight of the beach," said one senior U.S. 
military leader. "It will be like if you looked out your living room window and 
saw company pulling up the driveway." 
</P>
<P>
 The source, who earlier this week said that he thought an invasion was a sure 
thing, said Friday that he now believes Cedras will capitulate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sending a loud and clear message that says we're coming in either way. 
And my bet is that Cedras is going to get the hint and be gone." 
</P>
<P>
 In a second move Friday bolstering the U.S. military intentions in Haiti, the 
Pentagon ordered the preparation of five more large military cargo ships to be 
used by a U.S. fleet in the threatened invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The move brings to 12 the number of such ships now being activated to carry 
heavy weapons, supplies and troops to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 cargo ships, which are stationed at various ports along the Eastern and 
Southern seaboards, have been ordered to be ready next week to load military 
weapons. The ships are manned by civilian crews and are under contract to the 
Navy. They can be activated on short notice; all are nearly 700 feet long and 
can travel at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Navy already has nine warships near Haiti, along with the 
1,800 Marines. On Friday, the Marine detachment practiced storming beaches amid 
grenade and mortar shell fire at Vieques, Puerto Rico, as part of a practice 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Most speculation has been that any invasion by 10,000 troops, most of them 
from the United States, would occur between late September and mid-October.

SHUTTLE IS OFF ON SPACEWALK, SCIENCE FLIGHT; DISCOVERY: LAUNCH IS BRIEFLY 
DELAYED BY STORMS. LASER PULSES WILL BE BEAMED TO EARTH TO LEARN MORE ABOUT 
GLOBAL CLIMATE AND HOW IT IS CHANGING. 
</P>

<P>
 The space shuttle Discovery and its six astronauts rocketed into orbit Friday 
on a mission that includes a laser show, the release and capture of a satellite 
and the first free-flying spacewalk in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The space shuttle lifted off nearly two hours late because of thunderstorms, 
rising from the launch pad at 3:23 p.m. PDT and piercing high wispy clouds as 
it arced out over the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to fly," said launch controller Jeff Lauffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery's commander, Navy Capt. Richard (Dick) Richards responded: "We'll 
see y'all in about a week or so." 
</P>
<P>
 Applause and cheers erupted from the launch control center a few miles away 
from the launch pad when Discovery took off. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you saw there was some relief from the frustrations we experienced over 
the past few weeks," launch director Robert Sieck said in a news conference 
after Discovery was safely in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sieck attributed workers' relief to the long wait this afternoon, uncertain 
weather and frustration over the previous launch attempt, which ended in the 
engine shutdown of another shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took some patience and it took some time," Sieck said. "But like most 
launches, the harder they are to achieve, the better they feel when they 
finally go." 
</P>
<P>
 Richards admitted he'd had his doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't think for a while we were going to do it, but you all came through 
for us," he told Mission Control. 
</P>
<P>
 During the nine-day mission, a $25-million laser aboard Discovery will beam 
pulses down to Earth and measure the light bounced back from clouds, 
atmospheric particles and the planet's surface. Scientists hope to learn more 
about global climate and how it's changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term warming and cooling trends are linked to the amount of radiation 
trapped beneath or reflected off airborne particles called aerosols, and the 
pulses will help scientists measure the radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the laser pulses emitted from the shuttle will be the width of a 
finger when it leaves Discovery but will spread to the size of three football 
fields by the time it hits Earth. The round trip -- 320 miles from Discovery to 
Earth and back -- will take just one-thousandth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA said the fluorescent green lasers may be visible from the ground and will 
pose no danger if viewed by the naked eye or with binoculars or small 
telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
 But amateur astronomers have been warned not to aim telescopes larger than six 
inches in diameter at the lasers because of the possibility of eye damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle's crew of five men and one woman is also scheduled to drop off a 
$14-million satellite Tuesday and retrieve it two days later. The satellite has 
two telescopes that will focus on the sun's corona, the outer part of the solar 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Friday, astronauts Mark Lee and Carl Meade, both Air Force colonels, are 
scheduled to test a new jet pack by venturing out into space without a lifeline 
to the shuttle.

U.S. FINDS '47 UFO INCIDENT TO BE FULL OF HOT AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There'll be no convincing some people, but the Air Force says -- again -- the 
thing that hit the ground near Roswell, N.M., in 1947 was not the proof that 
UFOs exist. But it did prove that a crashing balloon could make a 47-year mess. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no secret autopsies on space aliens who couldn't fly too well. No 
flying saucer pieces under guard on an air base. No big conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just a balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 One of ours. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 It took eight months to reach that conclusion, and the Air Force hopes now to 
put to rest talk in UFO circles that military authorities covered up a grand 
extraterrestrial event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force began the investigation in January after Rep. Steven H. Schiff 
(R-N.M.) asked the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of 
Congress, to press the Pentagon to declassify documents relating to Roswell. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force officials tracked down principals, combed archives, and even sent 
some old news photos to the CIA for analysis -- all to try to deflate the 
persistent rumors of a massive government conspiracy to hide the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort produced a 25-page report, released Thursday, in which Col. Richard 
Weaver concludes that the debris a rancher found probably came from a 
top-secret balloon designed to monitor the atmosphere for evidence of Soviet 
nuclear tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the UFO theories, Weaver had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
 "What is uniquely lacking in the entire exploration and exploitation of the 
Roswell Incident is official positive documentary or physical evidence of any 
kind that supports the claims of those who allege that something unusual 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Weaver predicted "pro-UFO" elements simply would dismiss his report 
as part of the cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Walter Haut, a volunteer at the UFO Museum at Roswell, a center 
devoted to gathering information on this and other suspected UFO incidents, 
wasted no time in rejecting the Air Force conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very strongly about it," Haut said. Referring to those who made the 
original UFO claim, he said: "We're not talking about flaky people." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1947, the owner of a ranch near Roswell picked up debris that 
included scattered foil-coated fabric, sticks, rubber and some small I-beams 
with strange markings. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Jesse Marcel, the Army Air Force intelligence officer who brought in the 
wreckage, was reported to have recovered a "flying disc." A local headline 
screamed that the Air Force "Captures Flying Saucer." 
</P>
<P>
 Days later a higher-ranking officer identified the material as the remains of 
a weather balloon. But the seed of what became known as the Roswell Incident 
had been planted.

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL APPOINTED TO INVESTIGATE ESPY; PROBE: COURT NAMES L.A. 
LAWYER TO DETERMINE IF THE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY ACCEPTED GIFTS FROM FIRMS 
REGULATED BY HIS DEPARTMENT. HE DENIES IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles attorney Donald C. Smaltz was named as an independent counsel 
Friday to investigate whether Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy violated "any 
federal criminal law" by accepting gifts from a major poultry producer or other 
organizations and individuals regulated by his department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pledge a fair, comprehensive and prompt investigation and if warranted 
vigorous and effective prosecutions," Smaltz said in an interview. "The 
investigation will be as comprehensive as required to get to the bottom of the 
allegations." Smaltz was sworn in Friday here. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy, who has denied wrongdoing, was in Bonn, Germany, on Friday for 
agricultural talks after concluding four days of meetings in Russia. Ali Webb, 
his spokeswoman, declined comment. But Reid Weingarten, the secretary's defense 
lawyer, said that Smaltz "has the reputation for being a competent, 
experienced, honorable attorney. We're looking forward to cooperating fully 
with the counsel and receiving Secretary Espy's exoneration in very short 
order." 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz, a white-collar defense attorney and former prosecutor, is the second 
independent counsel to be named by a three-judge panel of the federal appeals 
court here to investigate Administration figures since President Clinton signed 
a new independent counsel law in June. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a Republican like the first, Kenneth W. Starr, solicitor general in the 
George Bush Administration, who was named to take over the Whitewater 
investigation from Robert B. Fiske Jr. Starr will be trying to determine 
whether Clinton was improperly influenced by his relationship with the owner of 
a failed Arkansas savings and loan who was his partner in a real estate 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 The mandate detailed by the special court as it named Smaltz, 57, is as broad 
as that sought by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno when she asked for appointment of an 
independent counsel a month ago to investigate her Cabinet colleague. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno noted at the time that the investigation of Espy began after a press 
report last March that Tyson Foods Inc., an Arkansas-based poultry producer, 
had been receiving lenient treatment from the Agriculture Department on 
regulatory matters and that Espy had accepted gratuities from the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department investigation found evidence that Espy accepted gifts 
from Tyson Foods during trips to Arkansas in May, 1993, and to Texas last 
January. Reno said that entertainment, transportation, lodging and meals 
provided by Tyson amounted to "at least several hundred dollars in value." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is sensitive for the President and his wife because Tyson 
Foods President Don Tyson is a longtime Clinton backer. The firm's outside 
counsel, James B. Blair, helped First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton make nearly 
$100,000 in commodity trading profits in 1978, 1979 and 1980 on an initial 
investment of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In her application to the court, Reno said that the Justice Department 
investigation also made "preliminary reviews of other instances in which 
Secretary Espy allegedly received gifts from organizations and individuals with 
business pending before the Department of Agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz said he has found temporary quarters in Washington. He said he plans to 
hire an administrative assistant and three to five lawyers. Smaltz also will be 
able to call on the FBI for assistance. He declined to estimate how long it 
would take to complete the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pennsylvania native, Smaltz graduated from Penn State University in 1958 and 
Dickinson School of Law in 1961. He spent three years in the U.S. Army's Judge 
Advocate General Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, he was hired as an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles. Smaltz 
spent three years as a federal prosecutor, specializing in white collar crime 
cases -- including bank, securities and tax fraud cases. 
</P>
<P>
 As a private attorney, Smaltz won a high-profile victory in 1975 when he and 
another lawyer persuaded U.S. District Judge Warren Ferguson in Los Angeles to 
dismiss charges against Frank DeMarco, former President Richard Nixon's tax 
lawyer, on grounds that the Watergate special prosecutor's office had failed to 
divulge information pointing toward DeMarco's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he was one of four finalists for the U.S. attorney's job in Los 
Angeles. Then-President George Bush ultimately named Superior Court Judge 
Lourdes G. Baird at Gov. Pete Wilson's suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Smaltz has handled numerous complex cases, including 
representation of California Overseas Bank, the financial institution that was 
used by the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos and his wife, Imelda, 
in their "looting of the Philippines," according to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 While pleading the bank guilty to federal charges, Smaltz said on numerous 
occasions that he believed the U.S. government had no business getting involved 
in legal matters that he said should have been handled entirely in the 
Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Smaltz has been an aggressive critic of what he has decried as 
overly zealous actions by federal prosecutors. In November, 1990, he chaired a 
Federal Bar Assn. conference in Los Angeles where Mrs. Marcos, who was 
acquitted on racketeering charges; former White House aide Lynn Nofziger, whose 
conviction of violating government ethics law was overturned on appeal, and 
others vented their anger at government lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz said Friday that he felt "very comfortable" taking on the Espy 
assignment: "The government must always turn square corners. That will be done 
in this case. You don't indict unless you believe the jury is going to 
convict." 
</P>
<P>
 Smaltz's mandate covers allegations that Ronald Blackley, Espy's chief of 
staff in March, 1993, ordered Agriculture Department officials to halt work on 
developing tougher poultry inspection standards and to erase a draft of the 
proposal from their computers' memories. Blackley has denied ordering a halt on 
the inspection standards, which were strongly opposed by poultry producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the court gave Smaltz jurisdiction to look into other allegations or 
evidence of federal law violations arising from the original inquiry. It also 
empowered him to investigate any obstruction of justice, false testimony or 
recalcitrant witness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department's preliminary inquiry found no evidence that Espy 
accepted gifts as a reward for past or future acts, Reno noted in her 
application for an independent counsel. But the law says that the department 
cannot decline to ask for an independent counsel because of lack of evidence of 
the required intent "unless there is clear and convincing evidence that the 
person lacked such state of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 trip cited in Reno's application involved a speech by Espy to the 
Arkansas Poultry Federation in Russellville, Ark., and a stay with a companion, 
Patricia Dempsey, at a group of Tyson cottages on a lake there. Espy and 
Dempsey returned to Washington on a Tyson plane, which Espy has explained by 
saying that he had to return quickly for an unexpected White House meeting. 
Tyson said that Espy reimbursed the company for the cost of a first-class 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Last January's trip involved Espy and Dempsey sitting in Tyson's sky box 
during the National Football League's National Conference championship game 
between the New York Giants and the Dallas Cowboys. At the time, Espy has said, 
he was in Texas for a meeting with an Agriculture Department official. 
</P>
<P>
 The other instances in which Espy is alleged to have received gifts from 
organizations with business before his department are understood to include a 
ticket to a Chicago Bulls playoff game provided by Quaker Oats chief executive 
William Smithburg. 
</P>
<P>
 Government investigators also have been looking into allegations raised by 
some Agriculture Department officials, as well as others that Sun Diamond 
Growers of Pleasanton, Calif., a large prune and walnut producer, may have 
benefited from the relationship of its vice president, Richard Douglas, to 
Espy. Douglas and Espy are longtime friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy has been accused of trying to protect a controversial federal program 
that funds overseas promotion of U.S. agricultural products -- including those 
of Sun Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Rancho Palos Verdes, Smaltz is married to Lois Smaltz, a Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge.

FAA RECORDS OF ILL-FATED USAIR JET SHOW HISTORY OF MINOR MECHANICAL PROBLEMS; 
MAINTENANCE: AIRCRAFT MADE SIX UNSCHEDULED LANDINGS AND ONE IN-FLIGHT ENGINE 
SHUTDOWN. BUT INCIDENTS WERE CONSIDERED 'VERY NORMAL.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Minor mechanical problems caused six precautionary unscheduled landings and 
one in-flight engine shutdown during the seven years that USAir owned the 
Boeing 737-300 involved in Thursday's fatal crash near Pittsburgh, according to 
Federal Aviation Administration records. 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft, registered in October, 1987, by the FAA with tail number N513AU, 
amassed 28 "service difficulty reports" during its life span. None of the 
problems appeared to pose a serious threat to flight safety, nor do any of them 
shed light on why the plane plummeted to earth Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve of the reports were filed by mechanics during the aircraft's "heavy 
maintenance check," a lengthy process that was completed on Feb. 3, 1993. They 
charted a couple of small cracks in the floor of the fuselage and several small 
areas of corrosion of floor beams. All were repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 As of its last flight, the plane had flown 23,846 hours since new and had made 
14,489 takeoff and landing cycles, according to USAir spokesman Richard Lesman. 
He characterized the FAA reports as "very normal . . . nothing out of the 
ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 A former 737-300 pilot for a competing airline who reviewed the service 
difficulty reports with a Times reporter agreed that the plane had experienced 
comparatively few problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's first unscheduled landing documented in the reports happened Aug. 
21, 1989, after the outer right main landing gear tires blew out on takeoff 
from Pittsburgh, damaging the flaps and gear landing doors. The plane flew an 
oval holding pattern near the airport to burn fuel and lighten its load prior 
to an uneventful landing. 
</P>
<P>
 The next incident was Nov. 17, 1989, when a warning light indicated that the 
anti-skid braking system was inoperative. That flight from Baltimore to 
Cleveland returned to Baltimore, which had the longer runway. Mechanics there 
replaced two electrical relays and a switch. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 9, 1991, en route from Baltimore to Las Vegas, the pilots felt a "low 
frequency vibration similar to high-speed buffet" and diverted for a 
precautionary landing at Pittsburgh, where USAir has its main hub. Mechanics 
couldn't find a cause, according to the FAA report. 
</P>
<P>
 A light warning that the aft cargo door was opened illuminated on ascent from 
Orlando, Fla., on Oct. 30, 1992, and the plane returned and landed without 
incident. A rear cargo door snubber spring was replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 While on a flight from New York's LaGuardia Airport to Tampa, Fla., on Feb. 7, 
1993, instruments indicated that the right engine of the aircraft was producing 
too much power for its throttle setting. The plane landed in Baltimore where 
mechanics replaced an engine control motor that had seized. 
</P>
<P>
 The last unscheduled landing documented in the reports occurred on Feb. 6, 
1994, when the flight crew was unable to pressurize the plane after takeoff 
from Philadelphia and a flight attendant reported the sound of rushing air at 
the forward entry door. After returning for landing, the door was found 
improperly closed. The closing mechanism was tested successfully several times 
and the plane took off again. 
</P>
<P>
 The in-flight engine shutdown happened on July 5, 1989, when the flight crew 
saw that oil pressure in the left engine had gone to zero. The engine was 
immediately shut down and the flight from Pittsburgh continued for an 
uneventful landing at its Philadelphia destination. The plane flew 15 minutes 
on a single engine. Mechanics replaced an engine starter shaft seal, filled the 
engine with oil and put the plane back in service. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has rules governing aircraft maintenance, including one specifying 
that a new jetliner must undergo its first heavy maintenance at 20,000 hours of 
flight time, and thereafter every 11,000 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir gave N513AU its first heavy maintenance check at 18,622 hours. The 
process, in which the aircraft is opened and thoroughly inspected, appears to 
have taken about a month to accomplish, according to the reports.

PULITZER-WINNER ANNA QUINDLEN TO LEAVE N.Y. TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD KURTZ, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Columnist Anna Quindlen, who was seen by colleagues as a top contender to run 
the New York Times one day, is leaving the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Quindlen, 42, who attracted a national following with her column "Life in the 
30s," said Friday that she was giving up her coveted perch on the Times Op-Ed 
page to pursue her career as a novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. had offered Quindlen top editing 
jobs with the understanding that she would be in a strong position to become 
managing editor when Gene Roberts steps down in three years, and perhaps 
executive editor after that. But Quindlen, who works out of her Hoboken, N.J., 
home and prizes her time with her three children, ages 11, 9 and 5, decided the 
price was too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a difficult and painful decision," Quindlen said. "I love the place 
and just had the best life there." She said she was not tired of the Op-Ed 
grind but that "the biggest danger in writing a column is overstaying your 
welcome. I'm not sure how much longer I could have sustained it." 
</P>
<P>
 A former reporter and deputy metropolitan editor who joined the Times in 1977, 
Quindlen moved to the Op-Ed page in 1990 and is the only regular female 
columnist. She won a Pulitzer Prize for her 1991 columns on her support for 
abortion rights and Anita Faye Hill and for her opposition to the Persian Gulf 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to imagine the Times without Anna," said reporter Maureen Dowd, who 
was hired by Quindlen. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, after finishing her second novel, "One True Thing," Quindlen, who 
is married to prominent attorney Gerald Krovatin, told Sulzberger that she 
planned to abandon punditry. She said "it was hard for both of us" but that 
there was nothing to negotiate. "I've got the best job there right now. I just 
really wanted to write novels full time."

CUBA DECLARES DEADLINE TO HALT RAFTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fulfilling a deal with the United States to end the flow of boat people, Cuba 
said Friday it would stop further departures from midday Tuesday, even if force 
had to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued on state media gave rafters 72 hours from midday today to 
clear up rafts or raft material gathered on beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement, published in the ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma, said 
that during the 72-hour period, persuasion would be used to try to stop people 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 During this period no arrests would be made of rafters, nor would their 
vessels or boat material be confiscated, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 But from midday Tuesday, departures would be stopped, even if force had to be 
used, and raft materials found on or near the seaside would be confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Cuba's lengthy coastline it would be impossible to stop every single 
person from leaving, but people should realize that if they did leave in rafts, 
they would not reach the United States, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement was issued hours after Cuba and the United States reached an 
accord in New York.

TEXT OF JOINT STATEMENT ON REFUGEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The following is the text of a communique issued by the United States and Cuba 
on the exodus of Cuban refugees: 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba 
(Friday) concluded talks concerning their mutual interest in normalizing 
migration procedures and agreed to take measures to ensure that migration 
between the two countries is safe, legal, and orderly. Safety of Life at Sea 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and the Republic of Cuba recognize their common interest in 
preventing unsafe departures from Cuba which risk loss of human life. The 
United States underscored its recent decisions to discourage unsafe voyages. 
Pursuant to those decisions, migrants rescued at sea attempting to enter the 
United States will not be permitted to enter the United States, but instead 
will be taken to safe-haven facilities outside the United States. Further, the 
United States has discontinued its practice of granting parole to all Cuban 
migrants who reach U.S. territory in irregular ways. The Republic of Cuba will 
take effective measures in every way it possibly can to prevent unsafe 
departures using mainly persuasive methods. Alien Smuggling 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and the Republic of Cuba reaffirm their support for the 
recently adopted United Nations General Assembly resolution on alien smuggling. 
They pledged their cooperation to take prompt and effective action to prevent 
the transport of persons to the United States illegally. The two governments 
will take effective measures in every way they possibly can to oppose and 
prevent the use of violence by any persons seeking to reach, or who arrive in, 
the United States from Cuba by forcible diversions of aircraft and vessels. 
Legal Migration 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and the Republic of Cuba are committed to directing Cuban 
migration into safe, legal and orderly channels consistent with strict 
implementation of the 1984 joint communique. Accordingly, the United States 
will continue to issue, in conformity with United States law, immediate 
relative and preference immigrant visas to Cuban nationals who apply at the 
U.S. Interests Section and are eligible to immigrate to the United States. The 
United States also commits, through other provisions of United States law, to 
authorize and facilitate additional lawful migration to the United States from 
Cuba. The United States ensures that total legal migration to the United States 
from Cuba will be a minimum of 20,000 Cubans each year, not including immediate 
relatives of United States citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 As an additional, extraordinary measure, the United States will facilitate in 
a one-year period the issuance of documentation to permit the migration to the 
United States of those qualified Cuban nationals in Cuba currently on the 
immigrant visa waiting list. To that end, both parties will work together to 
facilitate the procedures necessary to implement this measure. The two 
governments agree to authorize the necessary personnel to allow their 
respective interests sections to implement the provisions of this communique 
effectively. Voluntary Return 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and the Republic of Cuba agreed that the voluntary return of 
Cuban nationals who arrived in the United States or in safe havens outside the 
United States on or after August 19, 1994, will continue to be arranged through 
diplomatic channels. Excludables 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and the Republic of Cuba agreed to continue to discuss the 
return of Cuban nationals excludable from the United States. Review of 
Agreement 
</P>
<P>
 The representatives of the United States and the Republic of Cuba agree to 
meet no later than 45 days from today's announcement to review implementation 
of this Joint Communique. Future meetings will be scheduled by mutual 
agreement.

CUBAN AMERICANS SEEK END TO REFUGEES' LONG DETENTION; IMMIGRATION: DESPITE 
ACCORD, FLORIDA ACTIVISTS CALL FOR THE RELEASE OF MIGRANTS HELD AT U.S. 
FACILITIES. THEY SAY CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING MOST. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the agreement Friday between the United States and Cuba, frustration 
is mounting in south Florida's Cuban community over the indefinite internment 
of exiles here and at the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the United States has agreed to increase the number of Cubans allowed 
into the country each year, Cuban Americans here believe that the Clinton 
Administration should abandon its policy of refusing to process immigration 
requests at detention centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said Friday that Cuban rafters being held at safe 
havens must return to Cuba and make their application in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is going to return to Cuba to apply for political asylum? That's a joke," 
said Miami human rights activist Siro del Castillo. "These people have the 
right to apply. The U.S. can turn them down." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Cuban Americans here had voiced support of the Administration's hard-line 
stance in handling of the Cuban crisis, even accepting as necessary the vow of 
U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno that no migrant picked up at sea after the Aug. 20 
cutoff will be permitted to enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, stark conditions in the barbed-wire camps have led many 
Cuban Americans to call for the release, at the least, of more than 600 
children in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "This environment is just not appropriate for children," said Francisco 
Hernandez, president of the Cuban-American National Foundation and a member of 
an ad-hoc monitoring group, Cuba Crisis Steering Committee, which this week 
visited more than 600 Cubans being held in the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service's Krome Detention Center, west of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not look good seeing children who have gone through a difficult 
situation -- risking their lives -- and their parents, being subjected to this 
situation," Hernandez said. "We think those who come in with children should be 
released." 
</P>
<P>
 All others held at the centers should be given an opportunity promptly to 
apply to enter the United States, Cuban Americans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Cobo, director of the Transit House for Cuban Rafters in Key West, 
harshly criticized the Administration's detention policy as violating "the 
basic human rights of the Cuban nationals who are fleeing from Castro's 
dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
 In paid newspaper advertisements in English and Spanish, Cobo charged that 
Cubans are being held "incommunicado" in camps and being denied adequate 
medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Castillo said that under United Nations conventions, "people cannot be 
expelled or forced to go back to the country from which they fled. If the U.S. 
in some way pressures these Cubans back to Cuba to apply, then it is not 
complying with the U.N. agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a sad irony that through this agreement the U.S. government asks the 
Cuban government to do what they have criticized them for years for doing: not 
letting people leave the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the exodus of Cubans has slowed in recent days -- only 86 rafters 
were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard by midafternoon Friday -- more than 30,000 
remain in custody, most at Guantanamo. More than 500 others are being held in 
Panama and at a detention facility in Port Isabel, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Interning Cuban refugees as a way of halting the dangerous flotilla of rafts 
was never a palatable prospect, especially for Cuban Americans. But most Cubans 
in Miami supported the Clinton plan if it promised to thwart Castro's attempts 
to ease internal tensions in Cuba by letting discontented citizens flee. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent days, tensions in the Guantanamo camp and in the Krome detention 
center have spilled over into the Cuban community here, especially regarding 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these children are in critical (emotional) condition," said Robert 
Boyer, one of two Miami attorneys who has filed a class-action lawsuit 
demanding that the INS release more than 100 children held at Krome. "They are 
agitated, on edge, asking when they're leaving, going home to relatives, 
grandparents. These people are not criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Cuban-born U.S. Reps. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and Lincoln Diaz-Balart of Florida 
have also called for the children to be freed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 years that Krome, a converted missile base on the edge of the 
Everglades, has been used as a detention center to hold illegal immigrants, no 
child has ever been held for longer than a few days. Children stay in 
dormitories with their mothers, while men sleep in a large tent. Fathers are 
allowed to visit their wives and children twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dade County has dispatched Spanish-speaking teachers to the detention 
center, even the director of the school system's outreach program has called 
for the detainees' release. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have hundreds of children, and their relatives, in American detention 
centers," said Eduardo Martinez-DuBochet in a letter to the editor printed in 
Friday's Miami Herald. "Where is the spirit of Ellis Island? 
</P>
<P>
 "All these children and their anguished parents are beautiful human beings. We 
need to open the detention center's doors."

2 CRIME SPREE SUSPECTS FIGHT EXTRADITION BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two suspects in a cross-country crime spree that included three murders and a 
kidnaping contested extradition efforts by three states Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio and Oklahoma are seeking extradition of Lewis Gilbert, 22, and Oklahoma 
and Missouri are seeking extradition of Eric Elliott, 16, lawyers told a court 
hearing here.The suspects also pleaded not guilty to New Mexico charges of 
being fugitives from justice. 
</P>
<P>
 The states have 30 days to file warrants seeking the return of the suspects, 
who are both from Newcomerstown, Ohio. "I hope to reach a consensus among the 
prosecutors here and in the other states," said Santa Fe County Dist. Atty. 
Henry Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we're contesting extradition is (to determine) where is he least 
likely to receive the death penalty," said Dan Marlowe, Gilbert's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's scared like anybody else would be," Marlowe added. "He's afraid of 
getting fried." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Ellington, an attorney for Elliott, told reporters: "He's confused, he's 
a thousand miles from home, he has limited access to phones, he's let out of 
his cell two hours a day, he's been through a great deal in the last week." 
</P>
<P>
 The crime spree apparently began Aug. 29 about 30 miles south of Canton, Ohio, 
when Ruth Loader, 79, was kidnaped, her farm house robbed and her car stolen. 
Loader is still missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Loader's car was found in Fulton, Mo., about 650 miles away on Sept. 1.

U.S. WARNS AGAINST WIDENING ROADS AT MANASSAS BATTLEFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Interior Department, stepping into the debate over a proposed Disney theme 
park near Haymarket, Va., has warned Prince William County that any development 
plan that counts on widening roads through nearby Manassas National Battlefield 
Park is "unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a letter to county officials outlining its position, the federal agency 
that oversees the park also appeared to push for a compromise between 
preservationists and the Walt Disney Co. over the $650-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior officials focused their criticism on the county, not Disney, and said 
the "likely presence of Disney's America" could spur "a livable, vibrant 
community located between Disney's America on the west and Manassas National 
Battlefield on the east." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a compromise, the letter hinted, might be reached if Disney were to 
support the Interior Department's effort to close the battlefield roads, rather 
than enlarge them as county officials want to do. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Interior officials have wanted to close the two heavily traveled 
highways that bisect the battlefield and carry thousands of northern Virginia 
commuters daily. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six-page letter the county received Friday, Assistant Interior 
Secretary George T. Frampton Jr. and National Park Service Director Roger G. 
Kennedy noted that the county's plan to handle traffic generated by a Disney 
park assumes that one road, U.S. 29, would be widened from two to four lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 That could relieve choked roads around the Disney site four miles west of the 
battlefield, but would cause "severe, irrevocable and unacceptable" impacts on 
a "national treasure," the federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is sacred ground, honored by the blood of American heroes" in two Civil 
War battles, which already faces dangerous and distracting traffic problems, 
Frampton and Kennedy said in the letter to Planning Commission Chairman Gregory 
Gorgone. "We cannot believe the Disney Co. would favor such a course of 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 In two battles in 1861 and 1862, about 23,000 Union and Confederate soldiers 
were killed or wounded in some of the bloodiest fighting in the Civil War. Both 
were Confederate victories.

CLINTON ASSAILS OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS; FAMILIES: IN ADDRESS TO BLACK BAPTIST 
GROUP, HE CALLS THE INCREASE IN ILLEGITIMACY A 'DISASTER.' HE STRESSES THAT 
GOVERNMENT CANNOT ENFORCE MORALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, in a lengthy address to a Baptist group on the themes of 
values and personal responsibility, called the growing rate of out-of-wedlock 
births in the United States a "disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is wrong," the President said in his first major speech since returning 
from a 12-day beach vacation. "You shouldn't have a baby before you're ready, 
and you shouldn't have a baby when you're not married. You just have to stop 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has spoken before of the societal costs of illegitimacy, but Friday's 
remarks were his most direct and forceful. He said that aid programs can be 
changed to stop rewarding welfare recipients who bear children out of wedlock 
and that government programs can be revised to reduce welfare dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 But he stressed that government cannot enforce morality or teach 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll try to do my part, but this is not a government deal," he told an 
estimated 12,000 members of the National Baptist Convention USA, the nation's 
largest black denomination. "This is the way people are behaving, as if there 
were no respect for themselves and no future. We have to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks were warmly received. "You are among some of your best 
friends," convention President T. J. Jemison told him. 
</P>
<P>
 The President was careful not to portray births outside marriage as an African 
American problem but a nationwide crisis. The rate of white out-of-wedlock 
births has nearly matched the black percentage and nearly half of all children 
born in the United States are now born to never-married women, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we ought to give up on families," Clinton declared as members 
of the audience shouted words of encouragement. "Somebody's got to love these 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's appeal followed several weeks of personal reflection about the 
direction of his presidency, and marked an effort to rise above the slough of 
partisan politics and proclaim a moral vision for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 While he touched on the recently passed crime bill and mentioned in passing 
his efforts to reform the nation's health care system, Clinton deliberately 
avoided much specific discussion of his legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The President has concluded in recent weeks that he has devoted too much of 
his time to policies and programs and too little to articulating a message of 
renewal for the country. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned from vacation a year ago with a similar resolve to surmount the 
mundane. His first major appearance after returning to Washington then was at 
an interfaith breakfast. He used the occasion to preach on the themes of faith 
and family. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's New Orleans address was one of what will be several attempts again 
this fall to detail what Clinton and his presidency stand for, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the 42-minute speech, Clinton touched all the bases -- the sanctity of 
work, the centrality of family, individual responsibility and community 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's speech came a day after former Vice President Dan Quayle spoke on the 
country's "poverty of values," hitting particularly hard on the obligation of 
men to assume responsibility for the children they father. 
</P>
<P>
 "If children grow up never knowing their father, they're bound to assume that 
fathers are irrelevant and that males are not accountable," Quayle said 
Thursday in San Francisco, returning to the scene and subject of his notorious 
"Murphy Brown" speech in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raising a child is not just a mother's responsibility, it is a father's 
responsibility too," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House official said that the timing of Clinton's speech and its 
similarity to Quayle's message were "a coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's appearance, Clinton mused aloud about why Americans are not 
happier -- and he more popular -- given that the nation is at peace, the 
economy is generally healthy and unemployment is falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said that the nation is jittery because it is going through a period 
of profound change. He compared the insecurity of the post-Cold War era to the 
years immediately after the two world wars. He described the current era as a 
time of hope and fear intermingled. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also decried what he sees as rampant cynicism about public 
institutions and public servants, fueled by a hostile media and a culture of 
pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in a time which almost seems to glorify the negative, the cynical, 
don't we?" Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that many people preach about a decline in values, but warned: "We 
should not let the voices of despair make our insecurities deeper. That is 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 And he also said that discouragement about the current state of the nation 
should give Americans energy, not paralyze them. 
</P>
<P>
 "So to all those who preach that we need to return to the values of our faith, 
I say we do. But the real issue is, what are we going to do about it. Not what 
are we going to say about it but what are we going to do about it?" Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The saying is important, for we in words come to visualize the future, and we 
need the vision so that we do not perish," he said. "But we must act on the 
vision and that's where all the problems come." 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to the President's remarks from a front-row seat on the stage, 
the Rev. Jesse Jackson, a leading civil rights figure, scolded him for ignoring 
that "economic desperation among blacks is substantial." 
</P>
<P>
 "One would expect him to come here and speak of economic stimulus and jobs and 
economic development," Jackson said. "Instead we are getting moral lessons on 
how to live. And they are good moral lessons. But we must fight welfare and 
crime with jobs and economic development." 
</P>
<P>
 While in New Orleans, Clinton also attended a fund-raising luncheon with about 
60 guests and met with the executive board of the National Conference of Black 
Mayors.

FERNANDO CHAMORRO RAPPACCIOLI; NICARAGUAN GUERRILLA LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fernando Chamorro Rappaccioli, 62, a Nicaraguan guerrilla leader who fought 
the U.S.-backed dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza and the Sandinista government 
that replaced it. Chamorro Rappaccioli gained a measure of fame in 1978 when he 
fired a rocket from Managua's Intercontinental Hotel at Somoza's 
headquarters.No one was injured but the brazen assault helped galvanize the 
Sandinista National Liberation Front, which overthrew Somoza in July, 1979. In 
1979, when the Sandinistas began their final push to oust Somoza, Chamorro 
Rappaccioli fought in southern Nicaragua alongside Eden Pastora, known as 
"Commander Zero," and entered Managua with him on July 19. Edmundo Chamorro, 
Fernando's brother, said Fernando later became disenchanted with the sharp 
leftist turn of the Sandinistas after they took power. In Managua on Tuesday 
from complications of an embolism.

JAPANESE STUDENT DIES IN CRASH WITH SCHOOL BUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-age Japanese girl on a cultural exchange visit was killed Friday, and 
another Japanese girl was badly hurt when a car driven by their host family's 
daughter crashed into a school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The young driver also was hurt when her car slammed underneath the back of the 
stopped school bus, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 21 of the 52 junior high students on the bus received minor 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in shock," said Bob Harman, principal of San Marcos High School, where 
the exchange students were visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 The families of the two girls from the town of Nakagawa, Japan, had been 
notified of the crash and were planning to fly to the United States, Harman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead girl, Kazuko Nakano, 17, was one of a group of eight students and one 
teacher for the monthlong exchange program in the San Diego suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 The group had arrived last week, and Tuesday had been the two Japanese girls' 
first day at San Marcos High. 
</P>
<P>
 The other student, Yumi Higuchi, 17, was in critical condition at Sharp 
Memorial Hospital with massive head injuries. The car's driver, Elizabeth Ann 
Brown, 17, a senior at San Marcos High, was in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead girl was sitting in the rear right seat of the Honda Accord that 
crashed into the school bus, which was halted at a bus stop, authorities said.

HOLLIS ELLIS; ONE OF THE LAST OF ARMY'S 'BUFFALO SOLDIERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollis Ellis, one of the last of that minute band of black cavalrymen 
christened "Buffalo Soldiers" in the early part of the century, has died of 
cancer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Angelus Funeral Home said he died Monday at age 87. He had 
retired from the Army in 1948 and spent the next 25 years working as a 
facilities manager for the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollis, a native of Texas and one of seven children, enlisted in the 10th 
Cavalry at Ft. Huachuca, Ariz., in 1927. At the time he joined, it was a crack 
unit of 5,000 horsemen clad in shiny knee-high riding boots and sporting the 
Army's equivalent of Smokey the Bear campaign hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the military was segregated and predominantly white during that era 
and for many years afterward, the Army had had all-black cavalry units for 
decades, particularly in the Old West, where they patrolled the frontier from 
Montana to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 They fought Native Americans during the territorial wars of the late 19th 
Century and later pursued Pancho Villa through the desolate deserts of America 
and Mexico in 1916. They also had served with Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders 
in Cuba during the Spanish-American War. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 Ellis and a few of the surviving Buffalo Soldiers gathered in Los 
Angeles to commemorate the 50th anniversary of their assignment to Camp Lockett 
near Campo, Calif., east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 There along the Mexican border, thousands of horsemen had patrolled acres of 
leased cattle land to prevent any Japanese invasion of the United States 
through Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during that period of World War II that Ellis and the other 
accomplished horsemen began to realize that their place in the sun had been 
eclipsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Horses just didn't fit in the mechanized Army," Ellis remembered thinking at 
the time. "But we looked good. . . . We were sharp." 
</P>
<P>
 His survivors include his wife, Audrey.

HUFFINGTON TARGETS 'CAREER POLITICS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington began airing a new television 
commercial Thursday which complains that Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein is a 
"career politician." The ad is scheduled to be broadcast statewide for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: It begins with a narrator's voice saying that Feinstein and 
Huffington are both millionaires worth at least $50 million each. Snapshots of 
both candidates appear on the screen along with imitation newspaper clippings. 
The narration continues with a comparison of the two candidates: "Feinstein has 
taken more than $6 million from special interests. Huffington won't take one 
penny from special interests. Feinstein takes her $133,000 Senate salary. 
Huffington gives his to charity. Feinstein bills the government for her travel. 
Huffington pays his own way. Feinstein uses her taxpayer-paid chauffeur to get 
to work. Huffington drives himself." The ad concludes: "Can you tell which one 
is the career politician?" 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: The estimate of both candidates' wealth comes from the Roll 
Call newspaper in Washington, which reviewed public records to determine 
Feinstein's worth at about $50 million and Huffington's at about $75 million. 
The commercial's reference to Feinstein's $6 million from special interests 
refers to the total campaign contributions she reported in her last finance 
statement. According to her campaign, less than a fifth of that amount comes 
from political action committees representing special interests while the rest 
comes from individual donors. Huffington is paying campaign costs out of his 
own pocket, more than $10 million so far. On charitable contributions, 
Huffington has given his congressional salary to a children's organization in 
his district. But Feinstein's charitable contributions last year ($175,707) 
exceeded her Senate income. Huffington has declined to reveal his charitable 
donations other than the children's group. About Feinstein's driver, The Times 
has reported that a member of the senator's staff drives her on official 
business. Feinstein said she paid the staff member for personal trips -- 
including to and from her home -- about $2,000 per year out of her own money.

SACRAMENTO FILE: BILLS ALLOW 14-YEAR-OLDS TO BE TRIED AS ADULTS IN SOME CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jerry Gillam, Times Staff Writer 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has signed into law a package of three anti-crime bills that 
allow minors as young as 14 who are charged with violent serious crimes to be 
tried, convicted and imprisoned as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The three bills are SB 23X by Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear Lake), AB 560 by 
Sen. Steve Peace (D-Bonita) and SB 1539 by Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-Modesto). 
Peace introduced his bill when he was in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, juveniles were responsible for 19% of the state's murders, according 
to the governor, and arrests of minors for violent crimes increased 63.7% from 
1987 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the governor said street gangs have increasingly enlisted 
juveniles to carry out violent crimes because gangs know that existing laws 
treat minors more leniently than adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "When young violent offenders kill, rape or rob, they must be given the same 
penalty as adults, because it doesn't matter to their victims how old they 
are," the governor told a Capitol news conference. GOVERNOR 
</P>
<P>
 Bills Signed 
</P>
<P>
 * Juvenile Handgun Penalties: AB 2470 by Assemblyman Richard Rainey (R-Walnut 
Creek) makes minors convicted of illegal possession of handguns subject to up 
to three years imprisonment, and allows judges to revoke their driver's 
licenses for up to five years and order them to perform up to 500 hours of 
community service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stalking: AB 95X by Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco) requires the 
state Department of Corrections to notify victims, their families and court 
witnesses before it releases inmates who have been convicted of stalking 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aggravated Arson: SB 1309 by Sen. William Craven (R-Oceanside) imposes a 
prison term of 10 years to life for arsonists who set fires that are intended 
to cause injury or property damage and result in either $5 million or more in 
damage or the destruction of five or more homes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arson Reporting: AB 2336 by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) sets up a 
statewide computerized arson information reporting system to help local fire 
and law enforcement officials track and arrest arsonists. 
</P>
<P>
 * Registering Arsonists: AB 8X by Assemblyman Bill Hoge (R-Pasadena) requires 
any person convicted of arson to register with local law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Religious Worship: AB 3103 by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) 
increases the penalty from six months to a year in jail for disturbing 
religious church services or preventing people from attending them.

ROBERTI TAKES PART-TIME TEACHING JOB WITH USC POLITICAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic state Sen. David A. Roberti of Van Nuys, leader of the state Senate 
for 13 years, has joined the faculty at USC as a member of the political 
science department. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti said Friday that he was hired for the fall term as a part-time teacher 
of an upper division class in American political parties, campaign trends and 
political reform, "things I'm fairly conversant with, for better or for worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti, whose Senate term expires in December, became the first California 
legislator whose career was abbreviated by voter-imposed term limits. In June, 
he was defeated for the Democratic nomination for state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti said it was uncertain whether the USC position would lead to a new 
career in teaching. "A lot of the students are enthusiastic, young and 
idealistic. It's a nice environment to experience and a chance to share a 
little bit of accumulated knowledge," he said.

GLOBAL TRADE PACT FACES UNEXPECTED STRUGGLE FOR RATIFICATION; CONGRESS: THE 
WHITE HOUSE IS PRESSING FOR APPROVAL THIS YEAR. BUT HESITANT LAWMAKERS MAY 
DELAY ONCE-LAUDED REPLACEMENT OF GATT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With time running short on the congressional calendar, the White House finds 
itself suddenly struggling to win passage of a once-lauded global trade 
agreement against unexpected opposition and ever-worsening odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation that would massively overhaul the world's trading regulations and 
slash tariffs by an average of 40% is sitting in a bubbling pot of politically 
risky issues facing Congress when it returns next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition is not as vocal or emotional as the coalition that tried to 
stop the North American Free Trade Agreement a year ago. But it has the staying 
power of a low-grade fever. 
</P>
<P>
 Making things worse for the Clinton Administration, Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.), an influential figure whose aggressive support could provide 
crucial momentum, has instead called for delaying a vote on the agreement until 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's recommendation has shaken the White House, although Administration 
officials insist that passage this year remains a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President is absolutely committed to ratification this year," U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor told reporters earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact has broad bipartisan support, owing in part to its origins. It was 
largely negotiated during the Ronald Reagan and George Bush presidencies and 
was completed under the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Dole's call for a delay has left some congressional backers of the 
trade accord nearly ready to raise their hands in surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the view of some influential trade advocates, to delay is to court 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the international organization that oversees world trade is 
warning that a U.S. failure to quickly ratify the agreement could be a fatal 
blow, leading other nations already uneasy with the trade plan to toss aside 
the progress made over seven years of negotiations and throw global prosperity 
into a protectionist-fueled tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact would replace the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which since 
1947 has set the rules governing international commerce, with the World Trade 
Organization. In addition to beginning deep cuts in import taxes, it would 
reduce government subsidies, open markets for food and consumer goods and 
extend protection to the growing areas of commerce, including certain financial 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 After seven years of on-again, off-again negotiations, the agreement was 
completed in Geneva last December, given final approval at a largely ceremonial 
meeting in Marrakech, Morocco, in April, and dispatched to some 120 nations for 
ratification. Now, it is on a path that few Administration officials, if any, 
thought six months ago would be as strewn with boulders as it has become. 
</P>
<P>
 In remarks aimed at the United States, Peter Sutherland, the director general 
of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, said recently that failure of 
the major trading partners -- the United States, Japan and the 12-member 
European Union -- could have serious consequences "for the U.S. economy and for 
the world as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 26 nations have ratified the agreement, which its proponents still 
hope will take effect Jan. 1, 1995. Approval by the others is widely seen as 
depending on ratification by the United States, which has more international 
trade at stake than any other nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hanging by a thread," said a congressional aide deeply involved in trade 
matters. "I still think it will happen. But I get less sure each day. You're 
talking about doing the most major trade agreement in history in a two-week 
period." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the agreement has joined such disparate figures as Ralph Nader, 
conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan and Rush Limbaugh, the radio talk 
show host. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there has been no central figure galvanizing the opposition, as Ross Perot 
did last year during the debate over the three-way trade pact with Mexico and 
Canada. That absence, said Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist 
who has written frequently on Congress, is good news for the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politicians are always looking for an issue to highlight. They're good at 
scanning the horizon for inflammatory issues. The fact no one has done that 
with (the trade agreement) says something about its political muzzle velocity," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has the world trade pact become a strong current running through the 
congressional election campaign. But attention now being paid to the pact has 
surprised some members of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), who has conducted 31 town meetings in recent 
weeks, said that "people talked to me about the WTO (World Trade Organization) 
even in New Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 To Rep. Robert T. Matsui (D-Sacramento), who is the acting chairman of the 
House subcommittee on trade, the opposition offered by Dole is worrisome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably need to pass" the trade accord, Matsui said, referring to the 
political boost that a victory might give Democrats in a year when they fear 
there are few congressional accomplishments to tout. "But that could be 
problematic given what Dole has said. If Republicans pick that up, that's going 
to hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 What Dole suggested was not rejection of the agreement. Instead, he wrote in 
the Wichita Eagle, a newspaper in his state, "There is no reason we cannot 
address this important issue next year." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an idea that has been taken up by opponents of the agreement and one 
group carried the message to Capitol Hill on pillows, sent to each 
congressional office, bearing this thought: "GATT -- Why don't you just sleep 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole says that the agreement will "help the American farmer and the American 
manufacturer" but he wants more time to determine how much authority the new 
World Trade Organization could exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 His maneuver, although pegged to the substance of the agreement, could bring 
political ramifications: 
</P>
<P>
 By championing a delay, Dole, who is widely believed to hold presidential 
ambitions, could inoculate himself from criticism if speedy passage becomes an 
issue in the 1996 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the political calculus is divorced from this," said a source 
well acquainted with the ins and outs of Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there remain several unanswered questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Having called for a delay, will Dole actively work against a vote this year? 
Will a campaign under way in the congressional district of Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), who is likely to become the House Republican leader in the next term, 
sway him to abandon his weak support for the agreement? And will organized 
labor, which largely opposed NAFTA, throw its resources into the fight against 
the global trade plan, leading a number of House members in tight races to 
oppose the pact? 
</P>
<P>
 With Congress returning Tuesday in a mood to take quick action on the 
remaining legislation and then return home to campaign, the White House has 
little time to find the answers and turn them in its favor.

WOMAN WHO SHOT HERSELF IS CHARGED IN FETUS' DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who claimed she didn't have enough money for an abortion has been 
charged with murder for allegedly killing her 6-month-old fetus by shooting 
herself in the womb. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby girl was delivered March 27 by emergency Cesarean section after she 
was shot in the wrist. After a week, her underdeveloped kidneys began to fail 
and her body filled with fluids. She died April 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother, Kawana Michele Ashley, 19, was charged Wednesday with third-degree 
murder and manslaughter. She was being held Friday at the Pinellas County Jail 
on $50,000 bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley has a 3-year-old son, no job and was living with her grandmother. She 
feared her grandmother would not accept another child, said Ashley's friend, 
Sharrona Faye Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby's father offered help but "nothing ever happened," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was holding all of that stuff in, and it just got to her after a while," 
Wright said. "Everything was pressure on her. I think she just lost it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley was turned down for an abortion at a St. Petersburg clinic because she 
did not have enough money. Area clinics said an abortion performed 20 weeks 
into pregnancy can cost $1,300 to $1,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said she did not believe Ashley when she suggested shooting herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were talking about something else and, all of a sudden, she just said she 
would just shoot herself in the stomach," Wright recalled. "I just brushed it 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ashley was serious. She fired a .22-caliber pistol into the right side of 
her womb, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's rights groups call the story a tragic example of a failed system. 
Prosecutors call it murder. They delayed filing charges because the case was so 
complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Florida law, a fetus able to live outside the womb is considered a 
person, clearing the way for the manslaughter count. The third-degree murder 
charge is based on a death resulting from an illegal act: In this case, an 
illegal abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley is being represented by public defender Bruce Johnson, who did not 
immediately return a phone call Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women's rights groups used Ashley's story to support their call for 
government-funded abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This young woman was crying out for help and nobody heard her, as is so often 
the case with the poor," said Brenda Joyner, director of the Feminist Women's 
Health Center in Tallahassee, one of the few clinics in the state that will 
provide free or low-cost abortions to poor women. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, the women's movement has failed her, the Florida Legislature 
has failed her and the health care system has failed her," Joyner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner, who is on the board of the National Organization for Women, said she 
would ask NOW to assist in Ashley's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rai Rojas, president of Florida Right to Life, said the death could have 
been averted with adoption counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have provided a family to adopt this child," he said. "The true 
lament is that we couldn't reach out to this poor girl and offer her more than 
just death as an option."

UNSANITARY SLAUGHTER OF STEER BLAMED IN FOOD POISONING THAT KILLED CHILD, MADE 
130 ILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The unsanitary slaughter of a steer on a ranch near Corcoran led to a food 
poisoning outbreak that killed one child and made about 130 people sick, state 
and county health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The steer's intestines came in contact with the rest of the meat, probably 
causing salmonella, said Namara Garababa, a veterinarian with the state 
Department of Food and Agriculture.Health officials also have been told that 
the steer was butchered on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch's owners, Deo and Lillian Mata, have been cited because the ranch 
was not licensed to sell or slaughter livestock. The misdemeanors carry 
sentences of up to six months in jail or fines of up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 All of those who fell ill had eaten meat at a Hmong family celebration 
attended by more than 200 relatives and friends last weekend. The back-yard 
gathering was held to celebrate a Hmong teen-ager's release from Valley 
Children's Hospital in Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the celebration, the family served a raw meat dish called larb, 
which means "lucky food." The Hmong are a tribe from the mountains of Laos who 
have moved by the tens of thousands to the San Joaquin Valley since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 family members and friends attended the funeral Thursday of 
2-year-old Gregory Saelee of Oakland, who died of food poisoning Tuesday in 
Visalia.

JONES WANTS TO WEAR ANOTHER RING; RAMS: DEFENSIVE TACKLE HELPED MIAMI WIN TWO 
NATIONAL TITLES AND SHARED IN TWO SUPER BOWLS WITH COWBOYS. NOW, HE'S IN 
ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 What's wrong with the following sentence? 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams signed Dallas defensive tackle Jimmie Jones to a four-year contract 
for $7.7 million, including a $2-million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams?"  
</P>
<P>
 "$7.7 million?"  
</P>
<P>
 "$2-million signing bonus?"  
</P>
<P>
 How unlike the Rams: They spend lots of money, they place a call to Deion 
Sanders, they win their regular-season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Has Georgia Frontiere abdicated? Has John Shaw been impeached? Has Jay Zygmunt 
been kidnaped? 
</P>
<P>
 So what if Sanders won't return their calls; they've tried. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie Jones listened, and his hiring began an off-season run on Frontiere's 
bank account. The Rams, who had the well-earned reputation for being cheap, 
outraced 21 other teams to make Jones rich, handed $9 million to Chris Miller, 
awarded $3.55 million to Robert Young, and were willing to pay millions to 
Houston wide receiver Haywood Jeffires. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they were committed to winning," Jones said, "and I believed them." 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday Jones' first big defensive play as a Ram started the team running 
toward an undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter Jones shoved the Cardinals' offensive guard into the 
backfield and the path of running back Larry Centers, forcing Centers to bounce 
outside to a waiting Joe Kelly. Kelly, signed in the off-season for 
half-a-million dollars, popped the ball out of Centers' arms and into the hands 
of Ram cornerback Todd Lyght, who ran 74 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every guy that we have signed as a free agent is coming off a playoff team," 
said Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach. "Fred Stokes, Henry Rolling, Shane 
Conlan, Joe Kelly, Jimmie Jones -- these guys are all winners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game is too hard and too tough. You have to have character individuals 
who have a burning desire in the gut to succeed and want to win. At this stage 
of their careers, if they don't have that you're not going to turn them around. 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw the grit and determination and heart these guys played with against 
the Cardinals. That's something their mothers gave them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams might want to hire Mrs. Jones as a consultant, because she has 
provided her son with the uncanny knack of winning no matter where he goes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of Miami, Jones was a part of two national championships. In 
Dallas, he shared in two Super Bowl victories. One game into his career here, 
and the Rams haven't been beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we go out and take care of Atlanta and come back here, and you see us 
against the 49ers," Jones said. "Then all the skeptics are going to say, 'Wait 
a minute, this team is a contender.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmie Jones, remember, was trained by Jimmy "I guarantee we will win" 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got to Miami they had already won a national championship under Howard 
Schnellenberger and so they told me I had missed out," Jones said. "But I left 
there with two rings of my own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to Dallas, who was 1-15 the year before, and everybody is telling me, 
'You got two national championship rings but you won't be getting anymore 
here.' Well, I got two before coming to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "See this," Jones said, while holding up a finger, "I have room for one more 
ring." 
</P>
<P>
 Dismiss it as crazy talk, but Jones has added something to the Ram attack. At 
6 feet 4, 276 pounds, he has given the Rams a missing ingredient -- a quality 
pass rusher to keep teams from double-blocking Sean Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've seen me smiling, haven't you?" Jones said. "That smile has been there 
going back to Day 1 when I watched Sean Gilbert on videotape. We're talking big 
stats for the guy who plays next to Sean Gilbert." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert had 10 1/2 sacks a year ago while playing alongside Marc Boutte, who 
was released last month. Jones, while an obvious upgrade from Boutte, platooned 
in Dallas and had 9 1/2 sacks the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sean is a Pro Bowl player and with a player like that you're going to have 
the center step back and double him," Vitt said. "That gives the player next to 
Sean one-on-one situations, and with somebody like Jimmie Jones, who can win 
those one-on-one situations, we have the chance for big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, however, had the reputation for dogging it in Dallas. He says the 
Cowboys let it be known in hopes of driving down his value on the market with 
the hopes of re-signing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is I've seen none of that in him," Coach Chuck Knox said. "He's 
worked hard every day and it's obvious how much he's added to our defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice story, but what happens to Jones at season's end. He has spent the past 
three seasons in the playoffs, the last two years playing in the Super Bowl. 
Where will he be this year when the Super Bowl is played? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And who is going to provide the ticket? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be in the playoffs," Jones said, "and then if you make it to the 
playoffs, why put off what you can do today? Why can't the Rams make it to the 
Super Bowl?" 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong with the preceding sentence? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams?"  
</P>
<P>
 "The Super Bowl."

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; FLYNN AND FRIENDS LIGHT UP SCOREBOARD; HIGH 
SCHOOLS: PUMPED-UP OFFENSE COVERS UP A WEALTH OF DEFICIENCIES AS MATER DEI 
ROLLS TO 55-14 VICTORY OVER SERVITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 John Flynn, quarterback of that large safety net known as the Mater Dei 
offense, saw it coming a week ago. Servite was in a lot of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 He walked off the field at Cal State Fullerton, following the Monarchs' 55-14 
rout, knowing everything was going to be all right this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a rough training camp, but everything jelled last week," Flynn said. 
"I knew the offense was ready. We know we can score points." 
</P>
<P>
 That much was clear Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn and Co. embarrassed Servite, who the Monarchs have not lost to since 
1988. The rest of the team might have been rusty, but the offense was golden. 
</P>
<P>
 Blown coverages on defense? No problem. Flynn completed 15 of 19 passes for 
250 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitiful special team play? Forget about it. Running back Steve Bodnar gained 
70 yards and scored two touchdowns. Running back Joey Trampush gained 60 yards 
and scored one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 A few kinks in the kicking game? Hey, it happens. Sophomore Rod Perry had 135 
all-purpose yards. He caught a 40-yard touchdown pass and also ran 20 yards for 
a score. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what Servite did, no matter what the rest of the Monarchs did, the 
offense was there to make good. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so many weapons that we're going to get a lot points," Bodnar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite tried to keep in step, but was not up to speed. The Friars opened with 
a no-huddle offense and had some success, but they were not prepared for the 
offensive whipping the Monarchs had in store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the no-huddle helped us," Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "Not to be 
critical, but when we stopped them, our offense got the ball back faster." 
</P>
<P>
 And did a lot with it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs had the ball six times in the first half and scored five 
touchdowns. Only the clock stopped them, as the half ended on their sixth 
possession. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, it was 41-17 and the Monarchs had 317 total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was there," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was bad for Servite. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some dangerous receivers," Flynn said. "And we have Bodnar and 
Trampush if the passing game isn't there. But everything was there, just look 
at the scoreboard." 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn and friends know a lot about such routs. It was just last December that 
the Monarchs were chased out of Anaheim Stadium, losing, 56-3, to Rialto 
Eisenhower in the Southern Section championship game. But those scars seemed to 
be healed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars had to look for moral victories where they could find them and even 
those were few. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back David Bedard slipped out of the backfield and caught a 71-yard 
touchdown pass from David Martin early in the first quarter. It was Servite's 
first points against Mater Dei since 1991, a three-game scoreless streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei fumbled a punt, had an extra point blocked and another sail wide. It 
didn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars stayed close for a time, thanks to Bedard. He returned a kickoff 97 
yards for a touchdown and the Friars trailed, 20-14, after one quarter.

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; EMOTIONAL FOOTHILL RIPS TUSTIN, 40-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FORREST LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The death of Coach Tom Meiss' father inspired Foothill to its first victory 
over Tustin in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 With Tramel Robinson rushing for 159 yards and two touchdowns in 11 carries, 
Foothill pounded Tustin, 40-6, in a nonleague contest Friday night. It was the 
Knights' first victory over their cross-town rival since 1988. And it came 
hours after Meiss flew back from Bloomington, Ill., where his father died after 
a long illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids rallied around the adversity that we had," Meiss said. "(Defensive 
coordinator) Dan Stroup is a guru. He is the glue that held everything 
together. Under his guidance, it was like I wasn't here." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin scored on the first play of the game when split end Reggie Curry caught 
a Kevin Timone pass and raced 80 yards for a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill, however, came back strong. Nick Sveslosky's 25-yard touchdown run 
and a two-point conversion gave Foothill an 8-6 lead and it never trailed 
again. The Knights added two touchdowns on runs by Robinson and quarterback 
Mike Ford in the second quarter for a 21-6 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, a junior, scored again on the first play of the third quarter on a 
45-yard touchdown run for a 27-6 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill's offensive line dominated Tustin, clearing the way for Robinson and 
company to gain 381 yards rushing and 430 yards in total offense. Tustin 
finished with 203 yards overall, but struggled after its opening drive. The 
Tillers managed only one first down in the second half and six overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Meiss said after the game he would actively seek to end the annual game 
between the two teams, which is one of the county's most intense rivalries. The 
two teams have played each season except one since 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to end this (series) three years ago," Meiss said. "It's not healthy 
for anybody. I felt like I could not end it on a sour note. If you lose, it 
looks like you're ducking out of it. I'll do everything I can to see that it 
doesn't continue."

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; EDISON'S OFFENSE HOT, DEFENSE HANGS ON; 
FOOTBALL: CHARGERS, WITH 434 YARDS OF OFFENSE, PICK UP 35-28 VICTORY OVER 
CORONA DEL MAR.

<P>
 Edison's offense lit up the scoreboard, then the Charger defense hung on to 
post a 35-28 victory over Corona del Mar in a nonleague football game Friday at 
Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison racked up 434 yards of offense -- with quarterback Patrick Markovsky 
completing 15 of 23 passes for 210 yards and three touchdowns -- and scored 28 
first-half points. But the Charger defense had just as much trouble containing 
Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar running back Brian Hogan, who rushed for a school single-game 
record 272 yards on 20 carries, ripped through the Chargers for touchdown runs 
of 47, 62, and 67 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hogan always surprises me," said Corona del Mar Coach Mark Schuster, who made 
his debut. "Brian is an exceptional athlete, but I knew our offensive line 
would be one of our strengths." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings rushed for 380 yards, but gained only 66 yards through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar had two chances to tie it in the final six minutes, but 
quarterback Aaron Perlmutter's passes just missed their mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by seven with 5 minutes 50 seconds remaining, Corona del Mar faced a 
fourth and five at the Edison eight. The Sea Kings ran a flea-flicker, with 
Hogan taking a handoff then tossing it back to Perlmutter, who spotted Myles 
Davis wide open in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perlmutter's pass took Davis just outside of the end zone when he came 
down with the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 With less than a minute to play, Perlmutter almost hooked up on a 22-yard 
scoring pass to a diving Bill Taketa in the right corner of the end zone. But 
the ball fell harmlessly off Taketa's fingertips. Edison iced the victory by 
stopping Perlmutter for a nine-yard scramble on a fourth and 13 from the Edison 
22. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both defenses looked like they need a lot of work," Edison Coach Dave White 
said. "But I thought both offenses played great. I was happy to see our guys 
rack up a lot of points and yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Bradley Lisotto helped give the Chargers balance, rushing for 100 
yards on 16 carries. Brodie Riederich chipped in with 66 yards on 10 carries, 
and Alex Forero rushed for 56 yards on 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison scored on its first four possessions, with scoring drives of 70, 53, 
72, and 60 yards. Markovsky passed to Dave Ogas for a 28-yard touchdown pass to 
cap the first scoring drive only five minutes into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisotto and Riederich scored on one-yard runs to give Edison a 21-7 lead 
midway through the second quarter, and Markovsky found Sean Kurz -- who had 
four receptions for 57 yards -- for a five-yard touchdown pass to give the 
Chargers a 28-14 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Linnen caught six passes for 64 yards, including a 26-yard touchdown pass 
from Markovsky which broke a 28-28 tie early in the fourth quarter.

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; LOS ALAMITOS SUFFERS LOSS IN WINNING; HIGH 
SCHOOLS: GRIFFINS' WINNING STREAK CONTINUES, BUT QUARTERBACK INJURED IN VICTORY 
OVER KENNEDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 That long-running action-adventure extravaganza known as the Los Alamitos High 
football team opened its season in front of another packed, pleased crowd 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 And while this edition's debut was a smash, the group's enthusiasm was 
tempered by the loss of its leading man. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins defeated Kennedy, 24-14, in a nonleague game at Western High. The 
victory ran their unbeaten streak to 36 games, which was good news to many in 
the crowd of approximately 4,800. But Los Alamitos fans, a bunch definitely 
unaccustomed to bad news, got a big disappointment: Starting quarterback Kevin 
Feterik suffered a broken bone in his throwing hand in the first half and is 
expected to miss at least two to three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our doctor told me it's definitely broken," Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes 
said. "I'm not sure how bad it is, he left the game to go get X-rays, but it 
doesn't look too good." 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik, a left-handed junior making his first start, suffered the injury on 
the Griffins' second-to-last possession before halftime when he was knocked to 
the ground by a Fighting Irish defender following a completion. Still, Feterik 
(6 feet 1, 176 pounds) managed to complete a touchdown pass on the series, 
which typified his otherwise standout coming-out party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really weird," senior receiver Brad Melsby said of Feterik's injury. 
"I remember coming back to the huddle and him saying, 'My hand kind of hurts.' 
But he kept playing. He really hung in there and we got another score." 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 18 of 20 passes for 276 yards and three touchdowns before 
halftime. Sophomore quarterback Sean Stein (6-1, 183) took the Griffins' final 
snap of the half and started in the second half. He completed three of five 
passes for 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really nervous when I first came in," Stein said. "But my teammates 
helped me and I started to get my confidence. Hopefully, I'll be better next 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby combined with Feterik on eight completions for 125 yards and two 
touchdowns in the game's opening 24 minutes. Melsby finished with 10 catches 
for 132 yards, and junior receiver Tony Hartley caught eight passes for 131 
yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither team scored after halftime. Los Alamitos relied on a ball-control 
attack in the second half to minimize Stein's decision-making. Senior running 
back Phil Cruz carried 24 times for 124 yards, most of which came in the second 
half. Kennedy senior quarterback Jason Myles completed nine of 14 passes for 
115 yards with two touchdowns and one interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "Losing Feterik is tough, but Stein came in and did a good job," Barnes said. 
"He'll run with the first-team offense this week and he'll get more 
comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this gave everyone a little taste that Los Alamitos can still play."

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; SCORECARD: COUNTY HIGHLIGHTS FROM WEEK 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills and Laguna Hills, two former Pacific Coast League rivals, play 
next Friday at 7:30 p.m. at Mission Viejo High School. The two programs battled 
for the league title and one Southern Section Division VII title during the 
past decade. Trabuco Hills is now in the South Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei lost only twice last season. But when the Monarchs did drop a game, 
it was by a large margin. They lost to Esperanza, 33-7, and Rialto Eisenhower, 
56-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei has a chance to avenge the first debacle Friday, as it plays 
Esperanza at Valencia High School at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge and Foothill, two teams on the rise, also play Friday at 7 p.m. at 
Tustin High. IN MEMORY . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo players remembered their ex-coach Mike Rush, who died last year 
of a heart attack, before and during their 41-13 victory over Santa Ana Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the team took the field Friday, they tapped a red helmet that was 
placed below the scoreboard as a tribute to Rush. And every time the crowd 
looks at the scoreboard at Mission Viejo's stadium, they will see a large red 
and white sign that reads "In Memory of Mike Rush." THE MONSTER MASH 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills defensive lineman Zane Champion on playing against Santa 
Margarita's Josh Beckett (6-5, 305) and Kris Farris (6-8, 275) Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're some pretty big boys and they were leaning on me all night," he said. 
"But I showed them that us little guys can play too." 
</P>
<P>
 Champion, who is 6-3, 240, had two sacks and several tackles in the Mustangs' 
17-12 victory. TAKING A BREAK 
</P>
<P>
 Maina Coach Dave Thompson was in the stands at Westminster High Thursday, 
scouting the Lions as his Vikings enjoyed a night off. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they had more of a break than that. Marina opened the season with a 
34-0 victory over Damien High Sept. 1 in Honolulu, and started practicing a 
week earlier than the official Southern section starting date to prepare for 
the game. The downside: A combination of section and Sunset League rules kept 
the Vikings from practicing this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have just done a bit of running this week. We will put the pads back on 
(Friday), then start serious hitting on Monday," Thompson said. "It takes a 
couple of days to get back into the swing of things after a week off, but 
obviously the rule is intended to keep anyone from getting an unfair 
advantage." RUNNING WILD 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan McGraw scored six rushing touchdowns to tie an Orange County record as 
Laguna Hills defeated Sonora, 48-26. He carried 27 times for 277 yards, the top 
performance Friday night. TRADING UNIFORMS 
</P>
<P>
 He is recognized as the hardest hitting volleyball player in the county, but 
on Friday, Artist senior Dan Styles suited up for his first varsity football 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago he played on the sophomore team but a back injury incurred 
during preseason practice last year kept him from any action. On Friday Styles 
played wide receiver in the second half and caught his first pass, a 22-yarder 
from Nate Pivaroff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been playing tackle football ever since I was 3," Styles said. "But I 
sure wish we would've won tonight." WORTH A CHEER 
</P>
<P>
 Edison held off Corona del Mar, 35-24, despite allowing 370 yards rushing. In 
fact many Edison fans believed the only Charger defender worth cheering was 
defensive coordinator Bruce Belcher. 
</P>
<P>
 In the closing 42 seconds of the first half, Corona del Mar drove 67 yards in 
four plays. During one timeout, Belcher ran onto the field and delivered an 
impassioned plea to his defense to make a stand. The Edison fans cheered 
Belcher as he returned to the sideline. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he's a lot shorter and has no hair." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dan Dunkcanson, running back coach at Sunny Hills when asked if he was head 
Coach Tim Devaney. Friday's Best

GENERALS STUN LOCKE IN OPENER

<P>
 Having made three consecutive trips to the City Section playoffs, optimism 
abounded for Locke High even without quarterback Akili Roberson at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 But that optimism was cooled Friday as the Saints were beaten at home in their 
traditional nonconference opener with Washington, 19-11. The two schools have 
opened against each the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints, coming off a 6-4-1 season in which they were beaten in the 
Division 4-A quarterfinals, were hit with eight first-half penalties and their 
touted running game faltered in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Locke rushed for 160 yards in the first half but was held to 39 in the second. 
Locke did not score in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Flags nullified a 34-yard gain and a 40-yard reception, each would have put 
the Saints inside the Washington 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington defensive back Dante Gamble made a key interception late in the 
game to end the Saints' final drive. Gamble, a senior, said his interception 
was an atonement for a mediocre performance in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Generals were led by running back Dennis Northcutt, who had 136 yards in 
13 carries, including a 75-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Running 
back Phillip Scott scored Washington's two other touchdowns, including the 
final one on a two-yard run in third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Locke's Sirr Parker, considered one of the area's top college prospects, 
finished with 86 yards in 15 carries and one touchdown. Freddie Lee had 74 
yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Rowe, Washington's rookie coach, credited his players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not my win," Rowe said. "It's the players you should talk to, they are 
the ones who won the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, veteran Locke Coach E.C. Robinson still has confidence in 
his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a great team that can move the ball," Robinson said. "We'll come out 
in the next game and pass more." High School Football Spotlight

 Missing four defensive starters, Woodbridge shuffled its roster and came up 
with a big effort, capitalizing on three turnovers to defeat Pacifica, 37-20, 
Friday night at Bolsa Grande High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge dominated the game, giving up only seven points and 70 yards of 
offense in the first half. Sixty-seven of those yards were credited to Mariner 
running back Tommy Summers, who finished the game with 27 carries and 136 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "No way he would have gotten that many if all of us played," injured Warrior 
linebacker Ian Dominelli said. Dominelli is considered one of the top defensive 
players in the county and is out of action recovering from a wrist injury. Also 
missing were defensive end Justin Dufour, defensive tackle Tim Herr and 
defensive tackle Ryan Kellett. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Theo Wakefield picked up the slack. Wakefield ran back an interception 
53 yards to Pacifica's four-yard line to begin the second half, resulting in a 
touchdown run by Gavin Crew and a 31-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Two possessions later, Wakefield ran 61 yards from scrimmage for a touchdown 
and 37-14 advantage. Wakefield also was in on two quarterback sacks and 
harassed Mariner quarterback Ryan Johansen all night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Theo was the heart and soul of this team tonight," Coach Rick Gibson said. 
"Our whole defense came through big-time." 
</P>
<P>
 Things looked bad for Pacifica right from the start when Ricky Jenkins 
returned the opening kickoff 45 yards. The Warriors were stopped by an 
interception, but on their next possession, Jenkins got the ball again and 
scored on a 15-yard run with 4 minutes, 45 seconds remaining in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Four minutes later, Woodbridge went up, 14-0, on a 63-yard pass play from 
Casey Harris to Crew. Senior Nate Perrizo gave the Warriors a 24-0 lead when he 
returned a Pacifica punt 60 yards with 7:11 remaining in the half.

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; PRENOVOST MAKES DIFFERENCE FOR BREA-OLINDA

 Tommy Prenovost threw for 110 yards and kicked a 22-yard field goal as 
Brea-Olinda defeated Buena Park, 17-7, in a penalty-filled nonleague opener 
Friday at Spaulding Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
 Both teams combined for 17 penalties for 110 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildcats' running back Jerome Owens scored the first touchdown from 12 yards. 
Prenovost then opened the third quarter with a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide 
receiver Jacob Freeze on the Wildcats' first series of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brea-Olinda defense held the Coyotes to only five yards in the first half 
and forced five turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone Coyote touchdown came with 4 minutes 38 seconds remaining in the game 
as Buena Park's Aaron Hudson found wide receiver Robert Leventhal in the end 
zone for a five-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were lots of jitters tonight, but the first game is always like that," 
Brea-Olinda Coach Jon Looney said. "Tonight we won, but we won ugly."

 "The opening game is sloppy by nature," Buena Park Coach Bob Rau said. "I'm 
concerned with our inability to move the ball on offense, but our defense 
played pretty hard, considering they were on the field most of the game."

 Ryan Williams rushed for 252 yards and three touchdowns to lead host 
Bellflower St. John Bosco to a 48-10 romp over Huntington Beach Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams controlled the game from the outset.He rambled 80 yards over the left 
side on the Braves' first play from scrimmage to give them a quick 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach answered two series later with a 20-play, 75-yard drive that 
consumed more than 11 minutes, but came away with only a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Williams was in the end zone again after a 76-yard run. The 
Braves, who won a home opener for the first time in eight years, led at the 
half, 21-3, after a 20-yard pass from Todd Husak to Daniel Ulloa. 
</P>
<P>
 But even after a 209-yard first half, Williams was not done. After a David 
Yadrick touchdown pass to Billy Campbell brought the Oilers (0-1) to within 
28-10, Williams returned the subsequent kickoff 97 yards to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers committed three turnovers, including a fumble that set up Williams' 
final touchdown from 43 yards that pushed the lead to 42-10. AHMED V. ORTIZ

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; MCGRAW RUNS INTO RECORD BOOK

<P>
 Laguna Hills assistant Marty Spalding has seen his share of outstanding 
linemen come and go during the three decades he has coached football in south 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been 13 years since he has watched a tailback run like Brendan 
McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday night at La Habra High, McGraw ran for 277 yards in 27 carries and 
tied a county record with six rushing touchdowns as the Hawks defeated Sonora 
48-26 in a nonleague game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to say (former El Toro running back) Damon Sweazy was the best I've 
ever been around, but Brendan McGraw is the best running back talent I've 
seen," Spalding said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw was equally complimentary about the linemen in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the linemen keep blocking like this, we're going to have a great year," 
McGraw said. 
</P>
<P>
 The game got off to a bad start for the Hawks (1-0) when Sonora scored on its 
opening play of the game, as Kevin Rodriguez hit tight end Mark Gonzalez for an 
80-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 The first offensive play for Laguna Hills was not any better when starting 
left tackle Manual Rocha was lost for the game with an ankle injury. 
</P>
<P>
 However, from there the game belonged to McGraw and the offensive line, as the 
6-foot-1 senior scored on runs of 22, 51 and 61 yards in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders cut the lead to 21-14 at the half when Albert Lopez dove over from 
a yard out, but McGraw scored on a 27-yard burst to open the third quarter and 
added another short touchdown run later in the quarter for a 35-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw's record-tying touchdown came with 5:27 left in the game on a four-yard 
run up the middle. The record is held by four players, most recently Costa 
Mesa's Binh Tran, who scored six touchdowns against Calvary Chapel in 1992.

HART'S IACENDA RUNS OVER SAN FERNANDO, 41-18 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If San Fernando Coach Sean Blunt and his staff wake up today with heartburn 
and indigestion, there might be a good reason. Hart punched their Tigers in the 
gut repeatedly in a season-opening 41-18 victory Friday night at Canyon High. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gut," in football terminology, is the middle of the line and the center 
of the playing field. That's where Hart, led by junior running back Ted 
Iacenda's five touchdowns, hammered San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians scored on their first three possessions, Iacenda running up the 
middle 12 yards for the first touchdown, quarterback Steve McKeon going 12 
yards on a sneak for the second and Iacenda prancing untouched over center for 
the third. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't going to run," Iacenda said. "But what can I say? I got really 
great blocking by my line. The holes were just huge." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, with its run-and-shoot passing attack, had San Fernando playing a soft 
5-3 defense. The Tigers often rushed only three men while concerning themselves 
with deep and crossing pass patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were giving us the run," Hart offensive coordinator Dean Herrington 
said. "They were dropping deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all of Hart's 301 yards of offense (120 rushing yards for Iacenda in 
nine carries, 111 yards for McKeon, who completed seven of 16 passes) went 
straight up the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda, who had 19 touchdowns as a sophomore last season, also caught four 
passes for 74 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando quarterback Keijuan Douglas was nearly a one-man show, completing 
five of 12 passes for 86 yards and rushing 19 times for 164. But none of his 
heroics -- including a dazzling 66-yard scoring run -- mattered much after Hart 
built a 35-0 lead by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to make something happen," Douglas said. "I'm no Leon Blunt (the 
Tigers' quarterback last year who now plays for Notre Dame). But I got to do 
what I got to do. I had to step up." 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the third quarter, Douglas escaped a shirt tackle by Aaron Curd 
behind the line of scrimmage and weaved up the field for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando piled up 363 yards, all but 86 on the ground, but was penalized 
15 times for 123 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Hart only three plays on each of its first three possessions to pierce 
San Fernando for scores.

TAFT GETS PASSED BY CRESPI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One back-breaking run by tailback Jerry Brown usually is all it takes for Taft 
High to polish off an opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown's 96-yard, third-quarter touchdown dash only set the stage for a 
dramatic comeback, as Crespi scored 14 consecutive points to claim a 20-19 
victory Friday night at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior quarterback Dave Lins led the Celts on touchdown drives of 68 and 37 
yards to overcome a 19-6 deficit that Taft opened with two touchdowns early in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins scrambled eight yards for a touchdown late in the third quarter, then 
connected with Jeff DeFinney for a 20-yard touchdown with 8 minutes 5 seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins, who threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Marcos Solorzano in the second 
quarter, completed 21 of 27 for 210 yards. Under pressure throughout the game, 
Lins was sacked four times and had a pass intercepted and returned 26 yards for 
a touchdown by linebacker Antuan Simpson in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But like his teammates, Lins rebounded. "We never give up," Lins said. "We 
have a lot of heart. We showed some pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, among the best backs in Southern California, rushed for 172 yards in 14 
carries and appeared to give the Toreadors a comfortable lead with his 
coast-to-coast dash that came one play after Lins was stacked up on fourth down 
inside the five-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown accounted for 21 yards on Taft's opening drive, as the Toreadors marched 
57 yards in seven plays to take a 7-0 lead. Quarterback Dayon Shaw connected 
with Dashon Polk for completions of 17, 17 and five yards before capping the 
drive with a seven-yard bootleg for the score. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft kept Lins under pressure throughout the first half. Linebacker Emon 
Afshar snuffed one drive with a third-down sack. 
</P>
<P>
 Lins was sacked again by Dion Gaston on third down early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Solorzano caught 10 passes for 96 yards. DeFinney caught six for 69 yards.

SAUGUS DEFENSE STIFLES THOUSAND OAKS, 32-14 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's way too early to call Saugus' defense the "Desert Swarm," but the 
Centurions' "Arizona defense" was good enough to stuff Thousand Oaks en route 
to a 32-14 victory Friday night at Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their linemen aren't really known for their pass-blocking, and we probably 
have the quickest line Saugus has ever seen," Saugus linebacker Matt Gillis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks was held to 163 yards. Lancer quarterback Scott McEwan completed 
only two of 10 passes for 28 yards, and had two passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working really hard and we were ready for their passing game," 
said Saugus defensive back Jesus Alvarado, who sacked McEwan to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus' "Arizona defense" features five down lineman and one rover, who plug 
holes and running lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense lines up this way and nobody knows how to stop us," Gillis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus broke a 14-14 tie when quarterback Kevin Carrasco connected with 
receiver Richard Baker for a 25-yard touchdown pass play with 2:52 remaining in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus started a drive on the Thousand Oaks 32 and scored on a one-yard run by 
Colin Butterfield to make the score 26-14 with 1:17 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thousand Oaks' next possession, Butterfield intercepted a pass by McEwan 
and ran it back 30 yards for another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks started the game with a 10-play, 65-yard drive that ate up 6:16 
and culminated with Bill Sperry's six-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus countered on its next possession, driving 79 yards for its first score, 
a one-yard touchdown pass from Carrasco to Gillis. The two-point conversion 
attempt failed.

NO JOKE FOR BUENA; WESTLAKE WINS, 38-7 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westlake's 38-7 victory over Buena in a nonleague opener Friday night at 
Ventura High was such a laugher, even the losing coach, Rick Scott, was 
cracking jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 After Buena quarterback Chris Carr inadvertently completed a pass to 6-foot-6 
offensive lineman John Raymond in the third quarter, sending penalty flags 
flying from all over the field, Scott turned to an official and said: "What? 
That's against the rules?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of few chuckles the Bulldogs had all night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to say we're not as bad as we looked," Scott said, "but we just 
don't match up with their speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake, one of the best teams in Ventura County, dominated all aspects of 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors outgained Buena, 441-214, including 258 rushing yards for the 
normally pass-happy Warriors. Craig Walendy gained 63 yards and scored two 
touchdowns in 11 carries. Jamal Harris gained 53 in two carries and Jason 
Victor gained 51 in three carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's passing game, which revolves around blue-chip receiver Billy 
Miller, also was effective. Miller caught four passes for 89 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors, seeking to replace quarterback Kevin Crook, used three players 
at that position. Scott Spruill started and completed four of eight passes for 
84 yards. But, after Westlake took an 18-0 lead in the second quarter, Coach 
Jim Benkert started rotating Brian Shubin and Steve Aylsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Shubin completed a 58-yard touchdown pass to Mike Liebin on his first attempt. 
He completed three of six passes for 80 yards and two touchdowns. Aylsworth 
completed the only pass he attempted for 19 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always had a quarterback battle," Benkert said. "We are going to use 
the nonleague games to get experience for all three."

HERNANDEZ'S KICK HELPS SYLMAR BOOT KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Penalties came in waves, 19 in all. There were long touchdown runs for both 
sides, plus player ejections for fighting, and yet Friday night's nonleague 
game between Sylmar High and Kennedy came down to a 33-yard field-goal attempt 
in the fourth quarter by Sylmar's Daniel Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure, Hernandez delivered to help the Spartans claim a 16-14 
come-from-behind victory in a season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez needed to convert to escape from Coach Jeff Engilman's doghouse. 
After missing a point-after conversion earlier in the game, Hernandez figured 
if he missed the potential game-winner he might as well start walking home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so scared," Hernandez said. "I just wanted to kick through the ball . . 
. I didn't even want to look up." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was relieved to hear the cheers of his teammates as his kick sailed 
just inside the left upright, giving Sylmar a two-point lead with 9 minutes 5 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 The second meeting between the teams in as many seasons had the same intensity 
as last year's 7-7 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy scored on the game's opening possession on a two-yard run by Antwane 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar answered on its second possession with Greg Marquez's 11-yard touchdown 
pass to Kevin Turner tying the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy missed a chance to take a lead into the locker room at halftime when 
Robert Cervantes' 32-yard field goal missed with 49 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams traded punts to open the second half. But on the first play of 
Sylmar's second possession, Floyd Chalk bolted around a block by wingback 
Durell Price and streaked 90 yards down the Sylmar sideline for a touchdown. 
Hernandez's extra-point try missed and Sylmar clung to a 13-7 lead -- which 
lasted all of about 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who gained 83 yards in 13 carries, took a quick pitch on the Golden 
Cougars' first play and bolted up the middle for a 63-yard touchdown. 
Cervantes' extra point gave Kennedy a 14-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar shut down Kennedy in the fourth quarter. The Golden Cougars, who gained 
165 yards in the first three quarters, gained only seven in two possessions in 
the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans gained 190 of their 263 yards in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Price was keyed on all night and finished with 65 yards in 19 carries. He was 
dropped for losses six times.

 Los Angeles Loyola rallied for three touchdowns in the fourth quarter to beat 
Fountain Valley, 21-7, in a nonleague football game Friday at Huntington Beach 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs (1-0), ranked ninth in The Times' preseason poll, scored three 
touchdowns in 5 minutes 17 midway in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley's only touchdown came when Joey Rozek caught a 25-yard 
touchdown pass from quarterback Chris Ponchak with 6:20 left in the third 
quarter. Ponchak was 12 for 25 for 136 yards and two interceptions.  
</P>
<P>
 Loyola took a 14-7 lead when quarterback Kyle Spielbuhler narrowly avoided a 
sack and completed a 52-yard touchdown pass to Dan Farmer with 8:30 left in the 
game.  
</P>
<P>
 Spielbuhler was eight for 16 for 120 yards and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley (0-1) fumbled on its next possession. Ponchak was hit while 
scrambling and Loyola's Bryan Dunn recovered the ball at the Barons' 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Four plays later, Mike Vanis scored on a one-yard run off tackle to put the 
Cubs ahead, 21-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola had tied it, 7-7, on its first possession of the fourth quarter. Mike 
Ellison broke a 41-yard run down the left sideline with 11:16 left in the 
quarter. KEN HILL

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; LA MIRADA QUARTERBACK LEADS ROUT OF SUNNY 
HILLS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way La Mirada quarterback Mike Palumbo threw the football Friday night, 
the Sunny Hills defense probably thought he was unstoppable. 
</P>
<P>
 Palumbo, a 6-foot-1, 180-pound senior, completed 13 of 21 for 145 yards and 
two touchdowns as the Matadors beat Sunny Hills, 42-20, at La Mirada High in 
the season-opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 And Palumbo only played the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 He strained his shoulder in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada Coach John Mele said: "One of their big tackles landed on his (left) 
shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Not before Palumbo put some hurt on Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw touchdowns of 27 yards to Wyatt Boatwright in the first quarter and 
17 yards to Greg Rudiger late in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo Corral scored the Matadors' first touchdown on a two-yard run, after he 
returned a Sunny Hills punt 39 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers only score of the first half came on a 56-yard pass from Greg 
Garand to Jeff Renaud. 
</P>
<P>
 Garand completed 13 of 28 passes for 256 yards passing and three touchdowns. 
Two of his passes were intercepted, one of which was returned 42 yards by Ken 
Harrington for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Garand's threw a 94-yard touchdown pass to Renaud and a 16-yard touchdowns to 
tight end Sean Granillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Renaud caught five passes for 185 yards. RUSSELL BANKS

REPEAT PASS PATTERNS GIVE VERDUGO HILLS A 15-15 TIE WITH GRANT; HIGH SCHOOL 
FOOTBALL: KELLY HITS BROUCHETT ON FADE TWICE IN A ROW.

 If it worked once, why not try it again? 
</P>
<P>
 That seemed to be the thinking among Verdugo Hills High coaches Friday and it 
resulted in a 15-15 tie against Grant in a nonleague opener.  
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills pulled to within two points, 15-13, when quarterback David Kelly 
threw a seven-yard touchdown pass on a fade pattern to wide receiver Ryan 
Brouchett on a fourth down play with 3 minutes 45 seconds left in the game. The 
Dons tied the score when Kelly and Brouchett (three receptions for 44 yards) 
hooked up on an identical pattern for the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouchett's touchdown was set up when the Dons' Derek Brown recovered the ball 
at the Grant four-yard line after a bad snap on an attempted punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, who completed five of 12 passes for 77 yards and two touchdowns, was 
thrown for a five-yard loss on first down. Jason Evans gained two yards on 
second down and Kelly's third-down pass fell incomplete after being deflected 
at the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills' late score took some of the luster off a fine performance by 
Grant tailback Di-onte Smith, who scored two touchdowns and rushed for a 
game-high 143 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 His second score came on a 46-yard run early in the fourth quarter and gave 
the Lancers a 15-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant trailed, 7-0, at halftime, but Smith's eight-yard touchdown run and 
two-point conversion gave the Lancers an 8-7 lead midway through the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith also scored on a two-yard run early in the second quarter, but it was 
nullified by a holding penalty. He picked up five yards on the ensuing 
second-and-goal play from the 12, but Grant went into reverse after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Montoya, who also plays quarterback, was sacked for a five-yard loss and Grant 
lost nine more yards on fourth down when receiver Adam Crespo fell on the ball 
after a bad snap. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills marched 56 yards in 11 plays -- capped by Kelly's 17-yard 
touchdown pass to Jon Marino -- on the opening possession of the game, but the 
Dons were held to 82 yards in total offense thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant quarterback Ruben Montoya completed six of 15 for 85 yards.

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; ALISO NIGUEL WINS BATTLE OF YOUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two inexperienced teams beginning new eras under vastly different 
circumstances met for the first game ever at Aliso Niguel High on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the host team's first game in a full-blown varsity schedule and only 
its second ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills, the visitor, had a new coach, Trace Deneke, after being Orange 
County's most disappointing team a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was Aliso Niguel that showed the poise as the Wolverines delighted an 
overflow crowd of 3,500 with a 21-8 victory over the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made the big plays when they had to," Deneke said. "They've got a real 
bright future." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those plays came on defense, as John Hefty and Brad Moore ran down 
Dolphin quarterback Scott Maynard from behind at the end of a 46-yard gain to 
the 11; it prevented a touchdown. The Dolphins were unable to score and Aliso 
Niguel maintained its 14-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the defensive standpoint, we talked about pursuit," Wolverine Coach Joe 
Wood said. "It was an absolute big play." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense came up with another big play four minutes into the fourth quarter 
as Nick Gerasimou intercepted a Maynard pass; his 19-yard return put the ball 
on the 15, and the Scott Nemeth-to-Joe Valenti combination scored its second 
touchdown, from 13 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemeth completed 10 of 16 passes for 172 yards and two touchdowns, and he 
rushed for another. His first scoring pass to Valenti covered 70 yards and made 
it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Nemeth's quarterback sneak was the school's first varsity score; it came with 
10:43 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenti had six catches for 116 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel, a second-year school playing with its first group of seniors, 
had only four players starting Friday who also started in last year's 42-0 loss 
to Calvary Chapel in the school's first varsity game. And Dana Hills had only 
four returning starters from last year's team that appeared in the preseason 
top 10 and finished 1-9. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel took a 14-0 lead on the strength of superior field position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured if we got the momentum, we would be OK," Nemeth said. "We're a 
young team, and I didn't know how we would react if Dana Hills scored first." 
</P>
<P>
 Nemeth capped a 54-yard drive with a one-yard quarterback sneak at 8:01 p.m., 
the Wolverines' first-ever touchdown. The big play in the drive was a short 
pass to Brandon Littlefield that went for 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The short passing game worked well in the first half as Nemeth passed to 
Valenti on a slant pattern. Valenti then outran the secondary for a 70-yard 
touchdown reception. Craig Vandewetering added his second extra point. 
</P>
<P>
 A face-mask penalty at the end of Robert Lathan's 47-yard kickoff return 
helped Dana Hills close the gap. Lathan scored on a four-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills missed another opportunity in the fourth quarter, still trailing by 
six, when Lathan recovered a muffed punt return at the Aliso Niguel 20, but an 
illegal procedure penalty nullified the play. Earlier in the game, Dana Hills 
had a touchdown called back because of a penalty.

<P>
 Reuben Droughns picked up where he left off last year, scoring all three 
Anaheim touchdowns to lead the Colonists to a 21-14 victory over Fullerton in a 
nonleague game Friday night at Fullerton Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns, who rushed for 258 yards and three touchdowns against Fullerton in 
his varsity debut as a sophomore last season, scampered 31 yards untouched for 
a touchdown on his first play from scrimmage.Tony Vasquez connected on his 
first of three conversions to give Anaheim a quick 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, hampered by two first-quarter turnovers, got going in the second 
quarter. The Indians put together an 81-yard scoring drive, aided by runs of 32 
and 19 yards by John Wilkie and two 15-yard passes by Ryan Gregory to David 
Brookman and Wilkie. Christopher Young's four-yard scoring run and Gregory's 
extra point tied the score with 6 minutes 57 seconds left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 After Fullerton's Joseph Emigh recovered a fumble, the Indians moved 37 yards 
to take the lead late in the first half. Gregory connected on a four-yard 
scoring pass to Brookman on fourth down to give Fullerton a 14-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton defense keyed on Droughns, who had 2,039 yards last season, and 
was successful for most of the game, limiting him to mostly short gains after 
his first run. 
</P>
<P>
 In the game-tying drive, Droughns carried seven times, the longest three 
yards, but got enough for a first down on a fourth-and-short situation and a 
one-yard touchdown with 5:26 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryn Leimbach gave the Colonists the opportunity to win with a fumble 
recovery on the Fullerton 14, and Droughns responded with a 14-yard touchdown 
run to give Anaheim the lead with 3:24 left in the game. MIKE WOJCIECHOWSKI

 DeWayne Crenshaw rushed for 248 yards and five touchdowns, both career-high 
marks, as the Costa Mesa Mustangs showed why they are the top-ranked team in 
Division VIII with a 50-6 victory over host Ocean View Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks lost their 30th consecutive game, spanning the last four seasons, 
the longest current losing streak in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw scored on a 70-yard run on the Mustangs first play from scrimmage. He 
then returned a kickoff after an Ocean View touchdown 45 yards to set up his 
second touchdown, a four-yard run with 16 seconds left in the first quarter. He 
scored on a two-point conversion to give Costa Mesa a 14-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa led 22-6 at the half, and scored on all four of their second-half 
possessions. Their big plays included scoring runs of 60 and 44 yards by 
Crenshaw and a 99-yard scoring drive in the final quarter, capped with a 
30-yard Joey Archuletta scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs rolled up 465 yards rushing, averaging more than 14 yards a 
carry. Crenshaw, Charles Chatman (115 yards and a touchdown), and Archuletta 
(78 yards and a touchdown) did the bulk of the damage for the Costa Mesa ground 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View quarterback Ted Norman passed for 155 yards and ran for 79 more. 
Norman's 24-yard touchdown pass to Danny Bowen tied the score at 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View did not have any success inside Costa Mesa's 20. The Seahawks lined 
up for a 23-yard field goal in the second quarter but John Dempsey never got 
the chance to attempt it because of a bad snap. After a 66-yard, fourth-quarter 
drive, the Mustangs stopped Norman up the middle on fourth and goal from the 
one. ERIC MADDY

 There was an air show just south of the El Toro Y Friday night as San Clemente 
beat El Toro, 21-14, at Trabuco Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Triton quarterback Jeff Carlin completed 20 of 39 passing attempts for 274 
yards with no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was our game plan. We wanted to put the ball up as much as possible," 
said Carlin, a senior. He also rushed for 28 yards in five carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Trevor Insley caught two of Carlin's three touchdown passes, the first 
for 62 yards and the second for 24 yards. Insley had 148 yards on five catches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just fortunate to get out of this one," San Clemente Coach Mark 
McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not far from the truth. The stingy Chargers (0-1) started a 
fourth-quarter drive on their 4-yard line. The drive ended 12 plays later on a 
Triton junior Adam Pinion sack at the Triton 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers tied the score, 7-7, in the second quarter as junior Jamie 
Hamaway scampered four yards into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamaway finished the game with 130 yards in 30 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tritons (1-0) answered on the next drive as Insley caught his second 
touchdown of the game from 24 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro fought back and scored with just 52 seconds remaining in the first 
half as quarterback Brian Wilson connected with Joe Ader on a 7-yard touchdown 
reception. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente scored on its first possession of the second half as Carlin threw 
a 6-yard touchdown strike to Kevin Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was open on the play before and Jeff managed to find me wide open the next 
time around," said Smith, who ended the game with five catches for 32 yards.

 Drake's kickoff return reclaimed the lead for the Warriors after Canyon took 
its only lead of the game on Shaun Kelso's one-yard touchdown and Ahjeron 
Palmer's successful two-point conversion pass to Rick Engbrecht moments 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kicking game hurt us a little," Mohr said. "Not a little, a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kicks are designed to be in the corner and they were in the middle (of 
the field) where we are outmanned." 
</P>
<P>
 Righetti's first score also was set up by a long kick return -- 61 yards by 
Robert Villa. 
</P>
<P>
 With Canyon trailing, 23-8, at halftime, Kelso scored on another one-yard run 
with 11:16 left in the fourth quarter to help cut Righetti's lead to 23-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahjeron's two-point conversion pass failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelso, a 5-foot-9 junior, rushed for 94 yards in 18 carries to lead all 
rushers. 
</P>
<P>
 Righetti, which had lost 12 in a row dating back to 1992, answered with 
Drake's second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Warrior quarterback Nathan Castillo connected with Drake on a 20-yard 
touchdown pass with eight minutes remaining. Drake, who is 6-3, outleaped two 
Canyon defenders in the end zone for the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "They obviously wanted it a lot more than we did," said Mohr, who replaced the 
popular and controversial Harry Welch. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came up with the big play when they had to." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon's final score came on Palmer's 14-yard pass to Brian Connelly with 2:53 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer completed 13 of 30 passes for 177 yards with one interception.

NOTRE DAME VICTORY COMES ON SOLID FOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With its first home football game since 1992, it was supposed to be a special 
night for the Alemany High team in its opener against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the play of the Knight special teams in the first half which led 
Notre Dame to a 13-9 victory Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany's field was renovated during the 1993 season and the Indians played 
their home games at neutral sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's Steve Lee returned the opening kickoff 47 yards to the Alemany 
43-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Knight offense stalled, senior Chris Sailer nailed a 51-yard field 
goal. It matched his career longest, set in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great to get the first one out like that, to get the jitterbugs out," 
Sailer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailer added a 31-yard field goal in the third quarter and his booming 
kickoffs kept the Indians pinned in their own territory for most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the second quarter, Indian punter Steve Nunez recovered a high 
snap, then his line-drive kick hit defensive end Mike Hillman in the chest. But 
Hillman held on to the ball and returned the kick 43 yards before being driven 
out of bounds at the Alemany 12-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what else to do," Hillman said. "I got some great blocks and 
was able to make it pretty far." 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Ryan Bowne (10 of 18 passes, 83 yards) connected with 
Robbie Brewster on a seven-yard scoring pass to give Notre Dame a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian offense got untracked late in the first half. Quarterback Rudy 
Pantoja's 18-yard scramble was the big play in a nine-play, 80-yard drive. Juan 
Larios' first carry of the game went for a one-yard touchdown with one minute 
left in the half, cutting the lead to 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights had problems with penalties (11 for 105 yards) and turnovers 
(three in the second half), but kept the Alemany offense under control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense really stepped up," Notre Dame coach Kevin Rooney said. "We made 
some first-game mistakes, but hopefully, that's all they were." 
</P>
<P>
 Armone Lochard led the Indians with 38 yards in four carries, including a 
31-yard run. John Garcia led Notre Dame with 48 yards in 10 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany got a safety late in the game when Notre Dame snapped the ball out of 
the end zone on a punt.

<P>
 Junior running back Kevin Brown rushed for 166 yards and scored one touchdown 
to lead West Covina to a 26-13 victory over Katella in the season opener Friday 
night at West Covina High. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown gave West Covina the lead for good with a 51-yard run with less than a 
minute to go in the first quarter.Katella grabbed an early 7-0 lead when James 
Henderson blocked a punt by West Covina's Terrance Spencer, and Javier Espinoza 
recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Henry Frank scored the Bulldogs' first touchdown on their next 
series on a 24-yard run. Espinoza recovered a fumble by Brown at the West 
Covina 15-yard line late in the first half, but the Bulldogs stopped Katella's 
Dustin Gotz on a fourth-and-two play to preserve the the lead going into 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Burke opened the second half for West Covina with a 92-yard kickoff 
return for a touchdown. Greg Wardlaw capped the scoring for West Covina with a 
five-yard touchdown run with just over 10 minutes remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Sal Viramontes scored on a two-yard touchdown run with just under 
two minutes left in the game. He completed key first-down passes of 16 and 26 
yards to Josh Welton prior to scoring the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina outgained Katella in total offense, 341 yards to 159. The Bulldogs 
held Katella to 61 yards in the first half and did not allow the Knights a 
first down in the third quarter. DALE RUHE

 Lajuan Gibbons rushed for 97 yards in 20 carries and scored two touchdowns to 
lead Long Beach Jordan to a 47-16 victory over Santa Ana Friday at Santa Ana 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons was the key in Long Beach Jordan's rushing attack, which overpowered 
and wore down the Santa Ana defense and gained 213 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach started the scoring when Kason Smith returned the opening kickoff 
92 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana answered when Brian Schwalm threw 39 yards to Carlos Rodriguez. 
Eddie Contreras added the extra point, and a few minutes later Contreras made a 
27-yard field goal to give Santa Ana the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Jordan then scored six unanswered touchdowns. Quarterback Ortega 
Jenkins threw 34 yards to Raheen Elliot for one touchdown then added two 
four-yard runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbons then ran in from one and eight yards to put Long Beach Jordan up 
47-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Sagrero finished the scoring when he caught a 20-yard pass from Schwalm 
late in the fourth quarter for the game's final score. JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; DIEHL CARRIES LOAD; IRVINE WINS, 28-6 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Junior fullback Russ Diehl scored two touchdowns to lead Irvine to a 28-6 
nonleague victory over University in the season-opener for both teams Friday 
night at Irvine High. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine had a 28-0 lead after three quarters before University scored in the 
final minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, which won the Division IV title last year, won the game despite being 
penalized 15 times for 115 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Diehl rushed for 88 yards in 16 carries and got the bulk of the work in the 
second half when starting fullback Sean Clark suffered a deep cut in his 
forehead in the closing minutes of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 After being given stitches, Clark sat out the second half. But Coach Terry 
Henigan said the injury is not believed to be serious ad Clark is expected to 
be back in action Friday when Irvine plays host to Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark rushed for 31 yards in 11 carries. Clark's 22-yard touchdown run on the 
Vaqueros' first play from scrimmage gave Irvine a 7-0 lead with 9 minutes 40 
seconds left in the first quarter. The touchdown came after a 10-yard punt, 
which gave Irvine good field position. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the first quarter, the Vaqueros' Brian Flynn recovered a fumbled punt 
near midfield. Four plays later, quarterback Scott Larsen connected with Chris 
Austin on a 10-yard touchdown pass to give Irvine 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Diehl then scored two touchdowns in the third quarter to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored on a 15-yard run with 5:34 left in the third quarter. Then he went 
in from one yard with four seconds left in the third quarter.

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; CAPISTRANO VALLEY BOOTS LONG BEACH WILSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the nonleague opener Friday night against Long Beach Wilson, Capistrano 
Valley used a strong kicking game to beat the Bruins, 31-25, at Wilson High. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley blocked three punts, quickly converting them into scores as 
Wilson played catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 Two minutes into the game, the Cougars blitzed on fourth and 10 to block 
Wilson's first punt. Linebacker Sam Petke recovered the ball in flight on the 
45-yard line and returned it to the Long Beach 18-yard line. Three plays later, 
running back Charles Landrigan scored on a 1-yard run for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kicking game was great," Capistrano Valley Coach Eric Patton said. "We 
had good pressure on them all night. We had good pressure from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson bounced back 34 seconds later to tie the score, 7-7, thanks to a 
76-yard run by senior fullback Kevin Nash. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash gained a game-high 188 yards in 20 carries and scored two touchdowns. 
Wilson's total offense was 291 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley's pressure defense led to a second blocked punt midway 
through the second quarter, setting up a two-yard touchdown pass from Tim 
Hirchag to Petke. The Cougars led 14-13 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the fourth quarter, the Cougars bagged their third blocked punt inside 
Wilson's 10-yard line and took a 31-19 lead on a 10-yard run by Malaefou 
MacKenzie with two minutes remaining in the game. RICK CHRISTOPHER

GIRLS' CROSS-COUNTRY PREVIEW; THOUSAND OAKS EXPECTED TO BLOW PAST AGOURA LIKE A 
STIFF WIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The winds of change that began as a light breeze in last year's Southern 
Section Division I cross-country championships are expected to reach maximum 
velocity in early November if Thousand Oaks High supplants Agoura as the 
dominant girls' team in the region by winning the Marmonte League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura won its fourth consecutive Division I title in last year's Southern 
Section finals, but even then, it was obvious to many that the team of the 
future was Thousand Oaks. The Lancers finished third -- 23 points behind Agoura 
-- with a team of two juniors, three sophomores and two freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks didn't perform nearly as well in the State championships the 
following week, but still finished sixth, 15 points behind fifth-place Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers' chances for a fourth consecutive Division I title ended the 
previous night when No. 3 runner Cathy Prater came down with food poisoning. 
Without her, the Chargers' lack of depth became their Achilles' heel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of depth should not hamper Thousand Oaks this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is unlikely that the Lancers will produce a 1-2 finish -- as 
Agoura did -- in the State finals, they will have a quality 1-2 punch in 
juniors Kim Mortensen and Tara Marsden and will have 10 girls contending for 
the seven entries each team is allowed in championship meets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very exciting for the girls," Thousand Oaks Coach Jack Farrell said. 
"They seem to like the fact that they're viewed as a program on the rise. With 
the guys, they've been in this position for the last couple of years and they 
want to keep it going. But with the girls, it's new territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen finished ninth in last year's State meet, but she didn't really hit 
her stride until after that. 
</P>
<P>
 She capped her cross-country season with a 10th-place finish in the Foot 
Locker West regional and posted personal bests of 2:18.9 in the 800, 5:01.27 in 
the 1,600 and 10:53.65 in the 3,200 in track. 
</P>
<P>
 She finished fifth in the 3,200 in the State championships and her increased 
speed on the track should translate to improved performances this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsden placed 14th in last year's State cross-country championships and has 
personal bests of 2:22.91 in the 800 and 11:27.2 in the 3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Bridget Roy and juniors Alison Feinstein and Katie Scherrei are 
expected to supply quality depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy finished 59th in last year's State championships and Feinstein placed 
85th. Scherrei did not run cross-country last year, but as a soccer player who 
competes in the 400 in track, she could make a big contribution this season, 
according to Farrell. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Jamie Palmer and sophomores Megan Cordes and Tamara Savage are the 
other returnees for a team that is 22nd in The Harrier magazine's national poll 
and first in the State Division I poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Erin Sorensen and Stephanie Overton should also contend for a 
top-seven spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely different this year," he said. "I actually feel like we have 
more depth on the girls' team than on the boys." Other teams to watch: 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus -- The Centurions finished sixth in last year's Southern Section 
Division I championships. With six of their top seven runners returning, they 
have a good chance of advancing to the State meet for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Shelly Burkert, 18th in the section championships, and junior Angela 
Gundry (23rd) are the top two returning runners for the defending Foothill 
League champion and fourth-ranked team in the section's preseason poll. 
</P>
<P>
 The other returnees are sophomore Breanne Schweitzer, senior Sabrina Hambel 
and junior twins Jessica and Jamie Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Schweitzer's name might ring a bell among veteran track fans. Her father, 
Scott, ran 9:04.4 for two miles as a Burbank High senior in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura -- The Chargers will compete at the Division II level this season after 
seven consecutive appearances in the State Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Skieresz, defending State Division I champion, is a dominant front-runner, 
but her teammates' performances must improve throughout the season for the 
Chargers to remain among the top programs in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Vickie Greene (30th place) and junior Lisa Refkin (119th) are the only 
other returning runners from last year's team that finished fifth in the State 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Hwang, who missed the second half of last season with an injury, and 
cross-country newcomers Sarah Chulak, Jessica Lepisto and Meredith Helman are 
expected to fill out the squad. 
</P>
<P>
 All four are sophomores, but Coach Bill Duley expects them to make an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Chulak, Lepisto and Helman) didn't run cross-country last year, but they ran 
some decent times in track," he said. "If they improve as the season goes 
along, I think we can have a pretty good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura is ranked seventh in the section's Division II poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart -- Jessica De La Cerda, the Indians' top runner last season, is at 
Oklahoma State, but she is the only major loss from a team that finished 10th 
in the last year's Southern Section Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Monica Prelle and senior Krissy Schranz are expected to be the 
team's top two runners, followed by junior Michelle Cartier, and sophomores 
Jennifer Sullivan and Lisa Klinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Jennifer Blackburn, Corey Jones and Kelly Thorn should give the 
Indians added depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to have the front-runner this year like we had last year," 
Coach Larry David said. "But I think we're going to be grouped much, much 
closer together." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon -- The Cowboys' top runner last year -- Ann Koscki -- has moved to San 
Diego and several team members are recovering from injuries suffered in a July 
26 automobile accident, yet Coach Dave DeLong remains optimistic about the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely behind where we want to be, but I'm looking forward to it," 
he said. "I expect us to do a lot of improving as the season goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred on Highway 126 east of Fillmore when a car traveling in 
the westbound lane crossed the center line and hit a van driven by DeLong and 
occupied by nine other people. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact of the onrushing car caused the van to roll 3 1/2 times, but 
fortunately, no one suffered life-threatening injuries. DeLong said that the 
incident has affected the team's outlook, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, the team is just happy to be together and running again," he said. 
"They've kind of lost the drive to try to beat Hart and Saugus, but I think 
that will come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Teriann Boggio, juniors Kellie Stigile and Tiffany Furuya, sophomore 
Julie Harris and freshman Brandy Plasschaert are expected to be the Cowboys' 
top five runners, although their order could change from race to race. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Kathryn Sherman and juniors Michelle Estes, Betina Hsieh and Danielle 
Hadfield should supply depth to a team that appears capable of qualifying for 
the Southern Section Division I finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena -- The Bulldogs have lost five of their top seven runners from a team 
that finished ninth in last year's Southern Section Division I finals, but 
Coach Steve Blum still says they should be favored to win their 12th 
consecutive Channel League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Amy Van Atta, 19th in last year's State championships, sophomore Barb 
Almaraz, who has run 5:22 for 1,600 meters, and senior Meaghen Dunne should be 
Buena's top three. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Patty Ortega and Danita Suy, who are running cross-country for the 
first time, and sophomore Ana Levy are the leading candidates for the next 
three spots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We drop off some after the first three girls, but there aren't many schools 
out there who have a trio like ours," Blum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley -- Juniors Kristin Hawking and Natalie Shaw are expected to be the 
top performers on a team which finished 11th in last year's Southern Section 
Division I championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw (30th) finished much higher than Hawking (56th) in the section finals, 
but the latter is coming off a quality track season in which she ran 2:21.95 in 
the 800 to place third in the Marmonte League finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Judy Quick and Venessa Gonzalez and junior Lisa Honaker also return 
from last year's Pioneer squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake -- The Warriors finished 12th in last year's Southern Section 
Division II championships and five of the team's top seven runners return. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Patricia Gibby was Westlake's No. 7 runner in the section meet last 
season, but she should be its top gun this season if she stays injury-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibby ran a region-leading 2:17.27 in the 800 meters to win the Marmonte 
League title during track and she also has a personal best of 5:09.78 in the 
1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Jessica Connor, junior Kari-Ann Hong and sophomores Heather Dietzen and 
April Masiakowski return for the ninth-ranked team in the section's Division II 
poll. Individuals to watch: 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Hansen (Royal) -- The Highlander junior placed 16th in last year's 
Southern Section Division I cross-country championships and has run 5:11.85 in 
the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 Rheina Echols (Glendale) -- The Dynamiter junior finished only 49th in last 
year's Southern Section Division I cross-country finals, but ran 5:18.9 in the 
1,600 and 11:21.61 in the 3,200 during track season. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalluin Fullove (Louisville) -- The Royals' junior has not distinguished 
herself in cross-country, but won the Southern Section Division III title in 
the 1,600 in May with a time of 5:10.69, in addition to running 11:36.52 in the 
3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooke Paige (North Hollywood) -- With personal bests of 5:21.98 in the 1,600 
and 11:47.15 in the 3,200, the junior should be one of the City Section's top 
performers.

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; FIELDING SETS SCORING RECORD IN MISSION 
VIEJO'S VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
 Senior Todd Fielding ushered in the Bill Denny era at Mission Viejo in 
record-breaking fashion as he single-handedly defeated Santa Ana Valley Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielding scored 35 points in the Diablos' 41-13 rout before about 3,200 at 
Mission Viejo High. He ran for four touchdowns and kicked four extra points and 
two field goals, breaking the Diablo single-game scoring record of 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "He does it all for us," Denny said. "He runs, he kicks, we'll probably have 
him clean up the sidelines afterward." 
</P>
<P>
 Fielding came close to breaking the record, previously held by Eric Ekdahl 
(1988), Todd Yert (1985) and Roger Brown (1982), in the first half as he scored 
on touchdown runs of nine and 18 yards, kicked his own conversions and booted 
field goals of 34 and 31 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diablos led, 20-7, at the half and opened the second half by recovering an 
onside kick. Within four plays, Fielding was in the end zone again. This time, 
he went 34 yards untouched on a trap play. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielding scored his last touchdown on a six-yard run that was set up by Dwayne 
Cherrington's second of three fumbles. Fielding finished with 147 yards on 14 
carries as he consistently ran through gaping holes in the Falcon defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe it pretty much to the line," said Fielding, who had shoulder surgery in 
May and missed spring and summer practice. "I was surprised I was able to run 
this well." 
</P>
<P>
 When Fielding wasn't running wild in the Valley secondary, sophomore 
quarterback Austin Moherman was riddling it with passes. Moherman completed 14 
of 27 passes for 189 yards and did not throw an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a first night, this was as crisp a performance by an offense as I've 
seen," Denny said. "I owe that to the offensive coordinator, Kerry Crabb." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the going was mighty slow for Cherrington, who finished with a 
hard-earned 101 yards in 27 carries, a touchdown and three turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo scored its final touchdown on an 18-yard run by backup tailback 
Robert Hoover. Fielding kicked the conversion for the last of his 35 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny said it was an easier debut that he expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're never sure if you're any good until you've actually played someone 
else," he said. "It's hard to tell when you're going against yourself in 
practice every day. The kids were super high early and the thing that I liked 
is their emotions never fell off." 
</P>
<P>
 Fielding said the team wanted badly to give Denny his first victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted him to know that he's welcome and that he's doing a great job," 
Fielding said.

PREP FOOTBALL / SATURDAY PULLOUT; SAVANNA OVERCOMES A SLOW START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Savanna Coach Fred DiPalma says he never knows what to expect in season 
opening games. Friday night against Garden Grove, the Rebels sputtered in the 
opening quarter, spotting the Argonauts a lead, before rolling to a 39-7 
victory at Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first quarter had me concerned, but it's part of the learning process," 
Di Palma said."I was pleased with the way the kids responded." 
</P>
<P>
 After Garden Grove (0-1) scored its only touchdown on Ruben Retyna's one-yard 
run, the Rebels (1-0) ran away from the Argonauts. Daven King broke loose on an 
81-yard scoring run to tie the score with 1 minute 4 seconds left in the first 
quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 On Savanna's next possession, Eric Shine ran down the sideline for a 70-yard 
touchdown. Following a Garden Grove fumble, Mike Flores added a 22-yard scoring 
run late in the half, making it 21-7. A few minutes later, he returned a punt 
68 yards for another touchdown with 40 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some fast kids on this team and we took advantage of it," Di Palma 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna, last season's Division VI champion, controlled the game with its 
rushing attack. King paced the team, gaining 112 yards in just nine carries. 
Shine and Flores finished with 88 and 55 yards, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Stipes scored the other Savanna touchdown on a 24-yard touchdown pass 
from Jeremy Klemp. Flores closed the scoring with a 44-yard fourth quarter 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Millan paced Garden Grove's offense, rushing for 52 yards on 11 
carries. SCOTT JONES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dean Chambers passed for 104 yards and a touchdown, and had a rushing score, 
enabling Western to defeat Loara, 24-7, in front of 900 spectators at Glover 
Stadium Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Western utilized a conservative running game to defeat the Saxons, but 
Chambers, who completed only six of 12 with two interceptions, made the big 
plays in the clutch. 
</P>
<P>
 Western opened the game's scoring in the first quarter on an eight-yard run by 
David Bell. Then, midway through the second quarter, Chambers finished a 
seven-play, 80-yard drive with a two-yard plunge that put Western up, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Western scored its final touchdown at 9:16 in the third quarter when Chambers 
hit tight end Vince Branstetter on a nine-yard scoring pass. The touchdown 
finished a four-play, 62-yard drive highlighted by a 38-yard run by Matt 
Frembling. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara's score came at 1:57 in the third quarter on a five-yard touchdown pass 
from Jim Kirkland to Aaron Beverly. The score finished a 17-play, 80-yard 
drive, the Saxons' only legitimate drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland completed nine of 30 passes for 72 yards with one interception. COREY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Missy Clements had a match-high 23 kills and teammate Aimee Stone added 16 
kills, but the Cal State Northridge women's volleyball team lost to 17th-ranked 
Arizona in the San Diego State tournament Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's 15-12, 15-9, 14-16, 16-14 victory was Northridge's second loss in a 
row, but it was an improvement over Wednesday, when 15th-ranked USC swept the 
Matadors, 15-12, 15-10, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Clements' season-high 23 kills gave her 93 for the season and moved her into 
third on the all-time Northridge career list with 996. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone added 16 digs and four total blocks for Northridge (3-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Anderson had eight kills and 10 digs for the Matadors while Kathleen 
Shannon contributed 47 assists and 12 digs. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (2-1) was led by Melissa Harris and Barb Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris had 22 kills, 12 digs and four total blocks, while Bell added 20 kills 
-- on a .375 hitting percentage -- and 13 digs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will play San Diego State and Hofstra in its final two matches of 
the tournament today.

QUARTERBACK OPTION; AFTER YEARS OF ABUSE, GEORGE, MILLER ENJOY THEIR CHANGES IN 
SCENERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Free at last, Atlanta quarterback Jeff George wants to forget everything about 
four disastrous seasons with the Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is his Colt career in a run-on sentence: George signs six-year deal that 
pays him $12 million, whines about the play of his offensive line, holds out of 
training camp last summer and listens to boos from bitter fans in his hometown 
of Indianapolis, some of whom heckled his 80-year-old grandmothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Free at last, Ram quarterback Chris Miller wants to forget part of his seven 
seasons in Atlanta, where he feuded with former Falcon coach Jerry Glanville 
and twice tore up his left knee on the Georgia Dome artificial turf. 
</P>
<P>
 George vs. Miller -- opposing quarterbacks trying to distance themselves from 
their disappointing pasts Sunday when the Rams and Falcons meet in the Georgia 
Dome. 
</P>
<P>
 George makes his regular-season debut in Atlanta today after the Colts traded 
him in the off-season. Was it a new lease on life? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think so," George said. "What happened in Indianapolis is in the past, and 
I'm glad it's over. I'm happy now, and I was happy four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fortunate when the trade was made. My teammates know what kind of a 
player and person I am. What happens outside of football is out of my hands. I 
can't control what people say or write about me. As long as my teammates and 
peers have respect for me, that's all I care about." 
</P>
<P>
 Respect as a professional was hard to come by in Indianapolis, where George 
was a standout at Warren Central High. 
</P>
<P>
 After one season at Purdue and two at Illinois, George was the first overall 
selection by the Colts in the 1990 draft. Atlanta had traded the top pick to 
Indianapolis for wide receiver Andre Rison, guard Chris Hinton and a 1991 
first-round draft pick, which the Falcons used to select Mike Pritchard. 
</P>
<P>
 George started 49 games in four seasons with the Colts and after getting 
sacked by the fans and his own inept offensive line, lashed out in the press. 
And many fans in Indiana viewed him as a quitter, never forgiving him for 
leaving Purdue.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' Jessie Hester was George's go-to receiver for four seasons in 
Indianapolis and remembers the quarterback's problems well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff wanted to win and he ticked a lot of people off the way he went about 
criticizing players," Hester said. "Nobody there was perfect, but the fans and 
the media jumped all over him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just ate him up, and he wanted out of there because of all the bad 
vibes." 
</P>
<P>
 It all came to a boiling point last summer, when George held out for 36 days, 
costing him $144,000 in fines and the respect of the fans and some of his 
teammates. After all, the Colts weren't paying him $2 million a year to sit and 
sulk, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Here was a guy making all that money, and he didn't want to stick around with 
the franchise," Hester said. "That's all you read about, all you heard about 
back there. And Jeff felt the pressure from that. His family did too. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he came in (from the holdout), he was telling me about all his problems 
with the press and his family. That was a whole different story from what I had 
read. That was something he had to go through for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite George's attitude, Coach June Jones figured the quarterback was worth 
taking a risk on. George's strong arm and quick release were perfect for the 
Falcons' run-and-shoot offense. And Jones thought George would blend in well 
with players that included Rison, a fast-talker in tailback Erric Pegram and a 
quiet leader in offensive tackle Mike Kenn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We heard about those (negative) things when we made the trade for Jeff," 
Jones said. "But we never came across anybody first-hand who said he was a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked to ex-players, ex-coaches and nobody had those things to say about 
him. I haven't seen any of that here. He's a keen guy, gets along with 
everybody and hangs out with his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a situation where it was good for him to get out of Indianapolis, and 
it was good for us to get him." 
</P>
<P>
 George has a new look. He has changed his jersey number from 11 to 1, cut his 
long, scraggly hair and shaved off his mustache and stubble on his chin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like a rookie again," George told Atlanta writers the day he signed. 
"The style of play here is right up my alley, and it's something I haven't been 
accustomed to the last four years. They're putting the ball in my hands and 
letting me make plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Hester thinks the change of scenery has done George some good. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question about that," he said. "He's a totally different guy now. 
You can look at his face and tell he's a happy person. Hopefully, he can make 
the best of this, because he's in a great situation. You've seen the type of 
numbers Miller put up in that offense and he has the opportunity to do the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams signed Miller, a free agent, to a three-year, $9-million deal in 
early March, then traded Jim Everett, their starter for nearly eight seasons, 
to New Orleans. Miller's knee passed a tough examination by doctors, and Ram 
coaches thought his knack for throwing the deep pass in Atlanta was the perfect 
complement to tailback Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris and Steve Bartkowski were the only quarterbacks to get us in the 
playoffs," said Jones, the offensive coordinator for Miller's final three 
seasons with the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a sensational year in 1991, and had a phenomenal stretch late in the 
year. He was accurate and threw the deep pass to Michael Haynes and Andre Rison 
as well as I've ever seen it thrown." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's game is a homecoming of sorts for Miller, who doesn't expect a warm 
welcome from Atlanta fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure we'll hear a lot of boos," Miller said of returning to Atlanta. 
"We'll test the dome roof. Believe me, I've heard them boo loud before, so I'm 
not too concerned about it. They might be a little more vocal toward me than a 
lot of other guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only played 12 of the last 32 games I was there. It was pretty tough for 
the fans, myself, my wife. It put a lot of pressure on us and stress on me. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's all behind us now. It's time to move on." On the Mark 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta quarterback Jeff George's streak of 239 passes without an interception 
will be on the line Sunday against the Rams in the Georgia Dome. It is the best

SHOCKED RUSTLERS TO START LAST SEASON WITH SHACKLEFORD

 What has already been a difficult week for the Golden West football program, 
gets much harder today when the Rustlers open the season with a 7 p.m. game at 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The players were stunned Wednesday when it was announced that Coach Ray 
Shackleford, in his 29th year, is being forced out at the end of the season.

 Shackleford said that leaving isn't his idea and that the timing is horrible. 
He told his team after practice and the college released the information late 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players have a big game to get ready for this weekend," Shackleford said. 
"They should have waited until the end of the season to make this 
announcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Shackleford, 56, will remain a teacher in the college's physical education 
department. He is the only football coach the college has had and has a record 
of 155-113-9. His best two seasons were 1977 and 1978 when the Rustlers were 
9-2 and won a bowl game each year. 
</P>
<P>
 His final team opens the season against Long Beach, one of the best teams in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West is coming off a 4-6 season, in which the Rustlers lost their final 
two games.  
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach starts the season as the 16th ranked team in the J.C. Grid-Wire 
national poll. The Vikings finished 9-2, losing their final two games, in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In other 7 p.m. games: 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. San Antonio vs. Fullerton, Titan Stadium -- The season-opening task for 
Coach Gene Murphy and his Fullerton team is formidable. Mt. San Antonio is 
coming off a 9-2 season and starts this season as the top-ranked team in the 
J.C. Grid-Wire national poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. San Antonio is led by quarterback Cody Lee Smith, a Grid-Wire preseason 
All-American pick. Fullerton holds a 31-11-1 advantage over Mt. San Antonio but 
the teams haven't met since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena at Orange Coast -- OCC Coach Bill Workman starts his biggest 
rebuilding project in his nine years with the Pirates. OCC returns only four 
starters but one is running back Jeff Clayton, a preseason Grid-Wire 
All-American. Pasadena was 3-7 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago at El Camino -- Rancho Santiago finished 4-5-1 last season but 
won three of its final four games. Coach Dave Ogas hopes the winning continues 
this season. El Camino was 3-7 last season.

POWERFUL PAIR PROVIDES MUSCLE FOR SPLASH; INDOOR SOCCER: DEFENDERS HAMLETT, 
BLACK LEAD ANAHEIM IN PLAYOFFS AGAINST SACRAMENTO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One is the consummate-looking athlete, built like a bull. The other has 
Scottish blood running through his veins and a pit-bull mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 The word on Denis Hamlett is that he is strong and fast -- and you shouldn't 
get in his way. 
</P>
<P>
 The word on Ralph Black is that he is tough and coarse -- and you shouldn't 
get in his way. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the two Splash defenders could be henchmen in a Clint Eastwood 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Now playing: "The Enforcers -- No Handgun Required." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Sacramento already knows this. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlett and Black were the centers of attention when the two teams played in 
Sacramento last month; Hamlett became entangled with Knight goalie Mike Dowler, 
and when Sacramento players swarmed around Hamlett, Black charged to the 
rescue. A videotape of the incident reveals Black leaping atop the pile, 
Hamlett spitting at an opponent and Black kicking someone in the stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were hit hard by league Commissioner Ron Weinstein. Black was fined 
nearly one-tenth his monthly salary and suspended two games. Hamlett was fined 
and suspended one game. 
</P>
<P>
 Both missed the most recent meeting between the teams -- they were serving 
their suspensions -- but both will be on the floor tonight as the Splash opens 
the first round of the Continental Indoor Soccer League playoffs against 
Sacramento at The Pond. Kickoff is 7:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (20-8) won the Western Division title -- clinching against 
Sacramento -- and the Knights (15-13) finished fourth; the winner will play 
either second-place San Diego (18-10) or third-place Las Vegas (17-11) in the 
league semifinals. All series are best of three. The Splash split its two games 
with Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash has had a remarkable journey already. As the Los Angeles United 
last year, it was the CISL's most inept franchise and finished 6-22. Under new 
ownership, in a new building, with a new coach, mostly new players and a new 
name, the Splash had the second-best record in the league, trailing only 
defending-champion Dallas (24-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the credit must go to Hamlett and Black, two big bodies in the back 
line who know what it's like to do the dirty work and get overlooked -- by 
everyone but the referees. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, the team captain, is having one of his best years offensively. He has 
13 goals and 22 assists; defensively, he has 36 blocks. At 30 years old, he has 
played 13 professional indoor seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 He was one of two players management felt it had to have to be successful; the 
other was point-scorer Dale Ervine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralph has given us the experience and leadership and aggressiveness that 
we've needed -- the fight, the never-say-die attitude," said Splash Coach 
George Fernandez, who played for Sacramento last year. "He has given us 
everything we expected of him." 
</P>
<P>
 With seven games left in the regular season, Black was six penalty minutes 
away from 20, which would have cost a one-game suspension. He never got there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Ralph to play his game and not back off," Fernandez said. "If he has 
to miss a game, we'll cross that river when we get to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Black complains that he is dogged by referees, that his reputation from the 
Major Indoor Soccer League still haunts him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can mix it up, but I don't foul a lot," said Black, who committed 29 fouls 
in 25 games. "I get a lot of two-minute penalties for talking. You don't see 
Ralph Black getting two minutes for hitting people. I got eight minutes this 
year for talking. I think it's a little unjust because the guys who are getting 
me are the guys who were referees in the MISL. I think I'm getting a bum rap 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ralph, what about Sacramento and that dive into the pile?  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was silly to jump into the crowd," Black said. "The whole incident 
with Sacramento had nothing to do with me, it had something to do with a 
teammate. When my teammate gets hit, I get hit. When my teammate gets kicked, I 
get kicked. That's why I'm a team player." 
</P>
<P>
 And the videotape does show he kicked only after he was struck in the face by 
Kenny Latham. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlett did reach 20 penalty minutes. In fact, he finished the year ranked 
fifth -- with 34 penalty minutes in 25 games. He was called for 56 fouls -- 
tied for 10th in the league. His hard tackles don't win him many friends -- or 
many calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's getting a raw deal because he's too strong for these (forwards) and 
these referees don't realize how strong he is," Black said. "Denis is probably 
our toughest and is definitely our strongest player, but Denis is no different 
from me: If there's a 50-50 chance of getting the ball, he's going to go right 
through you." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fernandez: "He's the league's most unjustly penalized player." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlett, 25, is playing his third year indoors, and has some outstanding 
offensive figures despite playing in the back: He has 12 goals and nine assists 
to go along with 32 blocks. He has a disarming way with children and is 
nicknamed the Hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't try to intimidate people -- that's not my style," said Hamlett, a 
5-foot-11, 190-pounder. "(But) I had the same problem my first year in the 
(National Professional Soccer League). It was just my strength; logic is that 
someone 190 pounds versus someone 170 pounds, the heavy guy is going to win. 
With my size and strength, I overpowered guys. (Fernandez) said, 'You're going 
to get calls like that because the officials don't know any better -- they 
haven't seen anything like you.' "

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; TANNER TALKS A BIG GAME IN THE CREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Tanner, one of six goalies in camp with the Mighty Ducks, has a 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outspoken," people say, with a hint of mystery. "Very confident about 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 What exactly do they mean? Well, says Pierre Gauthier, the Ducks' assistant 
general manager, this, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Quebec Nordiques were considering drafting Tanner in 1989, the goalie 
was quite the self-assured 18-year-old. Gauthier was the Nordiques' chief 
scout. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Mr. Gauthier, you should draft me. I'm another Ken Dryden.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Then after we drafted him, he came to the table and said the other teams had 
made a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get the picture?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have said I was another Ken Dryden," he said, deadpan. "Gerry 
Cheevers was my favorite goalie." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner, who is 6 feet 3 and considers his sweater number (No. 1) an accurate 
assessment of himself, has a reputation for more than his wit and 
loquaciousness. He's also a very talented goalie, one Gauthier says was the 
best in the Nordiques camp three years in a row -- with Stephane Fiset, Ron 
Hextall and Jacques Cloutier as the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the best goalie in camp," Tanner said. "It's not bragging. Just because 
you're the best goalie in camp doesn't mean you get the Vezina Trophy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he were the best goalie in Duck camp, it might not get him anything 
but a ride to San Diego, where he spent the end of last season after the Ducks 
acquired him for a draft pick following the Ron Tugnutt trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Hebert and Mikhail Shtalenkov are the Ducks' goalies, and Coach Ron Wilson 
says Tanner would have to stand on his head while Hebert and Shtalenkov fell on 
their faces for him to end up on the opening-night roster. 
</P>
<P>
 But after escaping what had become a hopeless situation in Quebec, Tanner is 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more light at the end of the tunnel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner, 23, has a 2-11-5 record in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 "One year he started the year and played fine, but it was a lousy club that 
wasn't very good defensively," Gauthier said. "It would have been tough on any 
goaltender." 
</P>
<P>
 Plus there was that little conflict with then-Nordique General Manager Pierre 
Page. "We had a war of words," said Tanner, who thinks a Fiset in Quebec has a 
better chance of winning a job than a Tanner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes after a while a guy needs a new life," Gauthier said. "Sometimes 
after going to a new organization, people show improvement." Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Rookies Paul Kariya and Valeri Karpov each had a goal and an assist during 
their side's 5-2 victory in an intrasquad game Friday at The Pond of Anaheim. . 
. . Garry Valk (appendectomy recover) scrimmaged for the first time Friday, as 
did Shaun Van Allen (sore back). 
</P>
<P>
 Scratches were Oleg Tverdovsky (groin), Todd Ewen (knee bruise), Dean Ewen 
(ill) and Jeremy Stevenson (groin).
