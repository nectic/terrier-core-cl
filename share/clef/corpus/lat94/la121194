YOU'VE COME A LONG WAY, BARBIE; IF YOU'RE STILL BLAMING BARBIE FOR YOUR 
PROBLEMS, OR YOUR DAUGHTER'S, YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM, GIRL; FOREVER BARBIE: THE 
UNAUTHORIZED BIOGRAPHY OF A REAL DOLL, BY M.G. LORD (WILLAM MORROW & CO.: $25; 
256 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1960, my father hauled the family from St. Louis to the Democratic 
Convention in Los Angeles to campaign for Sen. Stuart Symington. John F. 
Kennedy won the nomination, of course, but the only political drama I remember 
from the trip concerned my Barbie doll. 
</P>
<P>
 My cousin Jackie and I were playing with our vintage Barbies, whose 
heavy-lidded, haughty gaze -- so different from today's saucer-eyed stare -- 
had first opened upon the world just one year before. I started to undo the 
strand of hair that held her blonde ponytail permanently in place. "Don't do 
that!" cuz warned, "We'll get in trouble!" But with the thrill of defying a 
power so big that it would know of my grooming felony, I undid it. 
Transgression turned into revelation: Miss Perfect Person's crowning glory was 
stitched around an empty circle. Barbie was as bald behind as Nikita Krushchev. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put it back, put it back," Jackie whispered, but I was so excited I was 
practically doing a St. Vitus' dance: We were the first girls ever, I was sure, 
to discover that the doll that so mesmerized us with her sexy sophistication, 
her long-limbed elegance, her astounding wardrobe -- a perfection that always 
eluded us -- was a lie. (I grew up to make a living writing advertising 
criticism.) 
</P>
<P>
 M. G. Lord, author of "Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real 
Doll" and a former New York Newsday columnist, has a different primal Barbie 
memory: cross-dressing Ken and Midge. But instead of running off with the 
Barbie Liberation Organization and switching the voice boxes of talking G.I. 
Joes and Barbies (He whines, "Will we ever have enough clothes?"; she grunts, 
"Vengeance is mine!"), she wrote this book. Itsmix of social history, 
psychoanalytical insights and the Mattel marketing schemes that invoke them, is 
told with wit, curiosity and wry photos by Sylvia Plachy. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt Ms. B. wields enough social clout to warrant yet another book: 
according to Mattel, American girls own an average of eight each and worldwide 
two Barbies are sold every second. Even if these numbers were only half true, 
the doll's impact would still be stunning. For many girls, "Barbie, with her 
shocking torpedo orbs, and Ken with his mysterious genital bulge," Lord writes, 
"were the extent of our exposure to the secrets of adulthood." 
</P>
<P>
 But the conclusion Lord draws from Ms. B. are quite different from, say, last 
year's "Mondo Barbie," an anthology of fiction and poetry inspired by more 
ambivalent, angrier memories of the doll. Coming on Barbie's 35th birthday, 
"Forever" is part of a larger appreciation, a revisionist effort to clear 
Barbie on charges of aiding and abetting "bimboism," consumerism and skeletal 
"supermodelism." Lord is saying that Barbie is more complex than that, and if 
you're still blaming Barbie for your problems -- or your daughter's -- you 
gotta problem, girl. 
</P>
<P>
 However, so does the book. But before revealing "Forever Barbie's" rather 
sizable bald spot, let's play with the lush mane of story -- the Mattel history 
that Lord doesn't even have to tease into fullness. 
</P>
<P>
 Much like the Hollywood studio system discussed in Neal Gabler's 1988 history 
"An Empire of Their Own," Mattel was founded by outsiders who forged idealized 
images of Americans more American than most people could ever hope to be. 
Barbie was created by Ruth Handler, daughter of a Polish Jewish immigrant, who 
co-founded Mattel with her husband Elliot in 1945. Her seemingly all-American 
offspring was actually a direct steal from a postwar German doll named Lilli, a 
pornographic play-toy for men which itself was based on a gold-digging cartoon 
character that ran in the "Bild Zeitung." Lilli's hard-bitten, sluttish look 
shines through in the original, cat-eyed, unsmiling Barbie. Their 11 1/2-inch 
bodies are almost identical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forever Barbie" moves from the marketing techniques that Mattel helped 
pioneer in order to sell a doll that most mothers sensed once walked the 
streets to Ruth's 1974 plea of no contest to falsifying SEC information (she 
went on to found a company that made mastectomy prostheses). Lord traces 
Barbie's many face-lifts -- from Malibu Barbie to Madison Avenue Barbie -- to 
today's smiley, vacuous girl. Multicultural Barbies did not appear until after 
the Watts riots, when Mattel funded a black-run company that produced the 
Sindana doll. Later came Barbie's black friends Christie and Julie, a black 
Barbie herself, and finally Shani, a doll with more authentic black features. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord also dives into the art world's use and abuse of B (Barbie mutilation is 
nearly as common among artists as among children): Barbie fetishes among gay 
and straight men; the obsessive collectors; and the woman who's endured more 
than 20 plastic surgery operations to model herself after the doll. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forever Barbie" is rarely uninteresting: after all, it divulges that Ken 
Handler, Ruth and Elliot's 50ish son, considers his sister Barbara (yep, 
they're the dolls' namesakes), "a conform freak . . . she was Barbie." But 
sometimes the book's passion to catalogue every possible Barbie fact and 
meaning feels like more changes into more really cute outfits with more darling 
little accessories. Under it all, however, there is one recurring, if dicey, 
theme: it might be called Complex Barbie versus Women With Barbie Complexes. 
Lord maintains that Barbie is more manifold than her detractors are willing to 
understand: "an open-ended construct, not a patented plastic one." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord's argument, suggesting that Barbie is a would-be feminist who stricter 
feminists have scared into the closet, rests largely on three points: (1) 
Barbie doesn't need a man, never did. Despite her many wedding gowns, 
officially Barbie is the consummate single girl and Ken the ultimate accessory; 
(2) Barbie throws herself not toward men, but into careers -- astronaut, 
physician, Olympic athlete, President of the United States. Her incredible 
resume encourages children to believe, as a 1984 Barbie ad slogan went, "We 
girls can do anything"; (3) Barbie's ultimate, secret career is as "space-age 
fertility icon"; she's part of a great goddess cult that puts girls in touch 
with their own power. 
</P>
<P>
 There's some truth to all of this, though it's also probable that Mattel 
maintains Barbie's single status in order not to thwart profitable audience 
fantasies. And Barbie's careerism is one with that other marketing fantasy, the 
Cosmo Girl's: We girls can do anything if -- and only if -- we acquire the 
right clothes, body, face, job and guy. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Barbie obviously doesn't share the pearish body type of antiquity's 
fertility goddesses, Lord finds at least one curious commonality: a lack of 
(usable) feet. Many "Venuses . . . taper into prongs at the ankles," Lord 
writes. The prongs "must be plunged into the earth, an act that, as she is a 
representation of the Great Mother, completes her. . . . Barbie's itty-bitty 
arched feet can be interpreted as vestigial prongs," making her, in the 
collective unconscious anyway, "an archetype of something ancient, matriarchal, 
and profound." 
</P>
<P>
 Be that as it may, each Barbie body part is tapped in this book as proof that 
the doll is not quite what we thought she was. I'm willing to entertain 
Barbie's supernaturally long legs as masculine (and thus further evidence of 
complexity), as Camille Paglia has remarked. But I'm not a bit convinced that 
Barbie's supernaturally tiny waist is merely the result of dressmaking 
constraints, as Lord insists. A Mattel designer told her, and she repeats with 
increasing ferocity, that "When you put human-scale fabric on an object that is 
one-sixth human size, a multilayered cloth waistband is going to protrude like 
a truck tire around a human tummy." But Barbie's clothes were always made with 
the thinnest of human-scale fabric, and the waistbands were no big deal, just 
cloth folded once (I'm looking at one of my early Barbie's wool skirts). 
Anyway, even when hugged by those brutish waistbands, why does her waist still 
look so minuscule? 
</P>
<P>
 Although elsewhere Lord diligently records the corporation's misdeeds, she 
never gets angry or even particularly irritated with Mattel, whose message 
regarding Barbie's feminism she admits is "let 'em take one step forward . . . 
as long as they take two steps back." Perhaps she suffers the reporter's 
version of the Stockholm Syndrome -- in order to work closely with a 
corporation crucial to your story, you bend over so far backward to be fair 
that you end up siding with the company against its enemies. Whatever the 
reason, Lord saves her wrath, and it is considerable, for women she deems too 
PC to appreciate Barbie. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch out, Naomi Wolf, who once remarked that Barbie's breast was "the 
official breast." "Speak for yourself, lady," Lord bites Wolf. Lord says Wolf's 
words got her goat because as one of "millions of breast-cancer daughters (we) 
had had a very different experience." Well, yes, but Wolf's comment is as 
obviously true as it is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch out, little Happy to Be Me, the realistically proportioned doll 
introduced in 1991 to help combat self-loathing in girls who never felt thin 
enough. The doll didn't survive, and Happy's maker blamed Mattel's 
"stranglehold on distribution channels," which Lord concedes, "given the way it 
snuffed out competitors like Hasbro's Jem," may have some truth. But Lord seems 
to scorn Happy for even trying -- like, who's the little tuber trying out for 
sorority? 
</P>
<P>
 It's here, on the question of Barbie's influence on eating disorders, that the 
complexity Lord works so hard to weave starts to unravel. As she poses it, some 
feminists blame Barbie (along with other idealized, commercial images of women) 
for anorexia, while ignoring the real culprit -- bad family dynamics, 
especially mom's. It would indeed be stupid to believe that Barbie and skeletal 
super-models like Kate Moss are primarily responsible for girls starving 
themselves to death. But it's perfectly reasonable to see the 5-foot-10-ish 
Barbie -- whose scale was once set permanently at 110, whose advice book read 
"How to Lose Weight -- Don't Eat!" and who, Lord writes elsewhere, "colonizes 
the inner lives of children" -- as at least contributing to this rising 
middle-class illness. Yet so eager is Lord to exculpate her heroine that she 
now declares, "Barbie doesn't instigate but merely reflects society's notion of 
beauty." This kind of refrain is the one advertisers always sing when their 
products come under fire, but it's just hopelessly one-way: All important 
cultural products both instigate and reflect, interacting with different 
individuals in different ways in a lifetime of endless feedback loops. This 
isn't news. But Lord, who seems to feel compelled to mount the barricades for 
Barbie, sets up overly neat either/or-isms. 
</P>
<P>
 I do understand how you can get fed up over simplistic attacks on something 
that you know is really more complicated. But Lord's ultimate solution is the 
one lesson that many of us, fat or thin, bimbo or brain surgeon, do learn from 
Barbie, the lesson that Mattel must be grinning over, unauthorized bio or no. 
At the end of "Forever," Lord tells how she attended a lecture in which the 
speaker dissed her doll. In a snit, Lord and a friend stalk out of the New York 
Hilton, clutch their credit cards, and . . . go shopping, because, she says, 
"we accepted what we could not change: Barbie was us."

THE TAPROOT OF CIVILIZATION; BY THE END OF THIS DECADE, MORE OF THE WORLD'S 
POPULATION WILL LIVE IN CITIES AND TOWNS THAN IN VILLAGES; THE VILLAGERS: 
CHANGED VALUES, ALTERED LIVES. THE CLOSING OF THE URBAN-RURAL GAP, BY RICHARD 
CRITCHFIELD (ANCHOR BOOKS: $27.50; 471 PP.)

<P>
 And what, by the way, is the meaning of life? 
</P>
<P>
 Once the question brought people up raptly. They tugged on their chins, gazed 
into the night sky and scratched with quill pens in their notebooks. Today, the 
question is apt to be voiced mischievously to scatter a crowd at a cocktail 
party and clear a path to the buffet table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh no, not that meaning-of-life thing now. Geez. Bye." 
</P>
<P>
 The question of the ages is not necessarily the question of our age. Is it? 
</P>
<P>
 We are impatient. We are overdosed. We are habituated by jingles. Our 
questions are simple: Buy now or wait for the sale? Guilty or innocent? Cinema 
or VCR? Right or left wing? Chicken or beef? 
</P>
<P>
 For these questions, we have answers. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about connecting the jumbled elements of our lives and searching for 
our place in the human tableau? 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Critchfield, part newspaperman, part vagabond and part scholar, has 
wandered the villages of the world for more than 30 years. By looking back into 
peasant cultures, Critchfield seeks meaning for own own urban society. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Villagers," which follows his 1980 book, "Villages," is a collection of 
five long reports from rural, agrarian cultures in Africa, Latin America, Asia, 
Eastern Europe and India. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not a simple book. Neither is it satisfying as a conclusionary one. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, "The Villagers" is an assemblage of riddles and contradictions, of 
arguments and asides, of faiths and fears, of patience and observation. It is a 
flabby book; it wanders in more ways than geography. But it engages us because 
the quest is worthy. 
</P>
<P>
 What can we learn from life in villages? They are the taproot of civilization. 
"So much that matters -- family, ethics, morals -- came out of villages," 
writes Critchfield. 
</P>
<P>
 We can learn of loneliness. Maybe a quarter of the people in cities live 
alone. In villages, few do. If you are alone and lonely in a teeming city, this 
loss is great. On the other hand, religion, that contradictory binding agent of 
culture, cracks at the joints in the rural Punjab the same as in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 What are we leaving behind as we are swept into this future we cannot control? 
Who can blame us for not dwelling on the big question? 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of this decade, Critchfield says, we will pass "a great milestone 
in human history": More of the world's people will live in cities and towns 
than in villages. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Villagers," we can meet a Kenyan widow whose husband is killed in a 
car accident. By custom, his life insurance is collected by his surviving 
brother. The widow breaks down, forfeits her children, but ultimately bounces 
back to help her people. Women are gaining their freedom everywhere. And old 
newspapermen still are drawn to stories of perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
 Critchfield is fascinated with the petty frictions and interactions of village 
life. In the Upper Nile, the loading of the harvest into a wagon is 
accomplished with colorful, ritualistic quarreling, pages full. 
</P>
<P>
 So what? So this: Traditional village life is woven tightly enough to restrain 
tempers. But tempers abound, and from them revolutions can be fomented. 
</P>
<P>
 Villages are no better, and never have been, than the leaders they produce and 
the history that guides them. The villages of Rwanda were more incomprehensibly 
brutal than anything the urban world has produced in a generation. 
</P>
<P>
 And hardly less than cities, villages of the 1990s are loosing their moorings 
against the tide of change. In revisiting remote places after a span of just 
five years, Critchfield said the villagers' basic view of life had been forever 
altered. "They felt the future would no longer simply repeat the past, as it 
had always done, but could be radically improved." 
</P>
<P>
 If only for the want of fertilizer. For the want of a helping hand. For the 
want of understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Critchfield make sense of our world? No, of course not. But "The 
Villagers" makes the quest itself sensible.

WAITING FOR THE MAIL; A NOVEL OF LIFE AT A YMCA ALONG THE MEXICAN BORDER; THE 
LAST KNOWN RESIDENCE OF MICKEY ACUNA, BY DAGOBERTO GILB (GROVE PRESS: $21; 218 
PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Luis J. Rodriguez, Luis J. Rodriguez is an author of poetry, fiction and 
nonfiction. Formerly of Los Angeles, he is now based in Chicago. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As most readers know, good fiction is often like good conversation. Chismes. 
Bromas. Mentiras. Scuttlebutt. Jokes. Lies. When a little bit of art is applied 
-- including full-bodied characters, intriguing and original dialogue, 
well-layered story lines, and whatever poetry one can possess -- this can be 
dangerous on the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dagoberto Gilb's novel "The Last Known Residence of Mickey Acuna" is good talk 
throughout. It feels like a beer-joint seance. Like a coffee klatch. Like two 
compadres across the picket fence tearing into mutual associates while hanging 
the wash. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel is set around a period in the life of Mickey Acuna, a mysterious 
character, whose instincts, demeanor and voice are all too typical. He could be 
the local bar junkie. The seemingly always unemployed neighbor. Your 
brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
 But something is going on with Mickey. He settles into a YMCA room in El Paso, 
along the Mexican border, where lives converge, conflict and generally cave in. 
He awaits mail, who knows what kind, but it's the thing Mickey's most deathly 
concerned about -- alongside women, Ping-Pong and getting blasted. Maybe it's a 
check. A love letter. An imaginary inheritance. Regardless, the mail becomes an 
important issue in the book, a life-and-death matter for the kind of people 
whose lives end up spinning around mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Having stayed in similar habitats, including the former YMCA hotel on Wabash 
in Chicago, and ragged motels and SRO residences in and around Los Angeles, I 
can attest to the kind of people who emerge out of the revolving doors in 
Gilb's Y: The blind man who plays accordion over the yells of a group of men 
watching a TV boxing match; the reverend with a smile, and deathly fire behind 
his eyes; and the ex-Marine porno-nut who lives to one day beat Mickey at 
Ping-Pong. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilb has entered a category of writing championed by such writers as the late 
Charles Bukowski, John Fante (whose L.A.-based stories and novels of 
life-at-the-bottom still resonate to new generations of readers) and Knut 
Hamsun, the Norwegian writer whose book "Hunger" may have been the modern daddy 
of such literature. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's Gilb's description of Mickey, Ping-Pong and the Y: "He played at night 
with the guys who groaned about the medicine smell of the TV room where the 
senior residents clustered in front of the blurred gray reception, where a 
faded tint of green light, a shade or two less than the polished floor tiles in 
every room and hall, squinted in from the opaque windows high above the 
basement-like room where metal folding chairs -- usually a full ashtray next to 
one, an aggressive curl of smoke worming its way upward -- arced around the 
corner, where the wooden console inhaled so much dust that you'd swear the 
raspy voice coming through its speaker, its mouth dry and nose clogged, would 
sneeze." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey eventually gets a job at the YMCA desk and falls for the clerical help. 
The book has a leisurely pace as the characters begin to take shape over the 
course of relating to Mickey. One of them, Butch, is a quiet, barely audible 
ex-con. His presence is mostly as scenery, background to the other more vocal, 
crazy or violent characters. But near the end, Butch ends up with one of the 
longest monologues, as he explains buying presents for his children and 
ex-wife, perhaps as a means to a reconciliation. We end up knowing more about 
him in that talk than we do about other characters in the whole book. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilb deftly moves the novel at a storyteller's pace. Not too fast, not too 
slow. However this is both a strength and weakness in the book. The possible 
rationale for Mickey's stay at the Y is brought to a head in a single scene 
near the end of the book. I say possible because it's not quite sure what 
Mickey's involvement is in the explosive incident that closes the novel. But it 
takes a long time to get there. The book often appeared to me as a drawn-out 
short story, taken to longer lengths then it needed to. But, then again, it 
also was the length that allowed the various characters to come alive; the book 
to find its structure. 
</P>
<P>
 I could also do without the obvious archetypes in the novel: the drunken 
Native American desk man, the big-breasted horny daughter of the clerical lady, 
the crazy black dude who eventually gets arrested, the fast-talking, 
high-energy white guy with a cowboy hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Gilb's gift is in telling stories of regular dudes and dudettes, common 
folk and working-class fools who are actually wise, intelligent and closest to 
the human emotions others try to escape from. He tells their lives without a 
lot of glitter or glamour, in the voice of such people, rich lived-in voices 
you have to pay a listen to. 
</P>
<P>
 A journeyman carpenter as well as writer (he has apparently worked on 
high-rises as long as he has been churning out fiction), Gilb also introduces 
into the great legacy of American writing characters from the border that often 
don't make such appearances, except in a few distorted instances. In fact, the 
El Paso/Las Cruces region is fast becoming a hot bed of Latino/a literary 
talent, with such notables as Benjamin Saenz, Denise Chavez, Pat Mora as well 
as Gilb writing from there. And many more Latino/a writers in other cities -- 
among whom I humbly include myself -- have roots there. 
</P>
<P>
 I celebrate such writers, such works; they now must be recognized as vital to 
the living lexicon of North American letters. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Gilb, the way he can divulge a story he can sit in my back yard with 
beer in hand any time. I'll wager he's a good carpenter too.

COVER STORY: FACING THE GHOST OF GUILT; LEE GRANT-DIRECTED 'REUNION' GRAPPLES 
WITH A MOTHER'S DARK JOURNEY FROM DESPAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY CONLOGUE, Ray Conlogue is the Quebec cultural correspondent for the 
Toronto Globe and Mail. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marlo Thomas, who lives with husband Phil Donahue in a sprawling Connecticut 
mansion, is the last person you'd expect to see hauling herself up a ladder in 
an old barn choking with haydust. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas is a hard-working actress who expects no privileges (well, maybe a 
few: a private cook attends her in her trailer). She has undertaken the 
difficult role of Jessie Yates, a woman who lives and works on a farm in New 
England with her three children and husband -- a perfect world, until the 
sudden death of her 5-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a story about something you can't solve," Thomas says. "I wanted to know 
how a woman like this could go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' interest in "Reunion," which airs Sunday night on CBS, is intense. She 
is also the producer, and she made sure it would be directed by her friend Lee 
Grant, who brought her acclaim (and an Emmy) with another TV movie, "Nobody's 
Child." 
</P>
<P>
 "Reunion" focuses on the one night in 1,000 when a mother ignored the crying 
on the nursery intercom, and her son strangled to death. Soon she begins to see 
and hear his ghost, and finds herself contemplating suicide in order to 
"rejoin" him. 
</P>
<P>
 For Thomas, however, the film -- based on Linda Gray Sexton's novel "Points of 
Light" -- does more than simply press the panic button of every mother in 
America. It asks serious questions about the morbidity that lurks within the 
mother-child bond. It shows how Jessie, the most sensible of women, comes to 
believe that killing herself and the twin sister of the son she lost is the 
only way to reunite the three. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who was so gripped by the book that Donahue couldn't get her to put it 
down at suppertime, says that Jessie's dilemma -- "this unaccountable blameless 
thing" that leaves her contemplating tragic options -- is what raises "Reunion" 
above the level of a happy-ending TV movie.

 "TV is way ahead of motion pictures as far as women are concerned," she says. 
"There are those who say that TV is a woman's medium. It's doing the thing 
those Olivia de Havilland B flicks did in the '40s. TV is where the stories 
are!" 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Grant agrees. The sex symbol of "Peyton Place" and winner of an Oscar (for 
"Shampoo"), abandoned film for TV when she became a director because she found 
that women still don't have the clout to make feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, there's maybe two who can. The problem is the studios want action. That's 
why you have four good actresses doing something like" -- there is just the 
hint of her nose wrinkling -- "Bad Girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the several years of headbanging it would have taken to get "Reunion" 
into feature production, Grant and Thomas chose the TV route. Which is fine, 
says Grant with a laugh, "if you don't mind doing it in half the time with a 
quarter of the money!" 
</P>
<P>
 Grant is sitting outside a rambling ocher-red barn in Hudson, a genteel rural 
suburb of Montreal whose candy-cute downtown stands in for the Midwestern small 
town where Jessie and her husband (played by Peter Strauss) live. The director 
takes in the bucolic splendor and says, in her raspy downtown voice, "Canada's 
such a peaceful place. It's nice not to feel menaced, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 To see her and Thomas on the set is to find how different a film can be when 
it's not being run by a camera-wielding patriarch with a tortured soul. "This 
is my living room," she says cheerily, waving me onto her territory. "Make 
yourself at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody but the actors are wearing face masks, due to the prodigious 
quantity of dust kicked up by the ancient bales of hay that litter the barn. 
It's about the sixth take of a tough shot where Thomas, in a cumbersome 
nightgown, has to step on a rotten ladder rung at just the right moment, while 
young Courtney Cash remembers to notice Jamie's ghost. A technician pumps away 
at a smoke-making machine jauntily labeled L'Intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally Grant cries out: "We got it." Thomas slides down the ladder and does a 
happy little dance, exultantly agreeing: "We got it ALL: Children! Smoke! 
Nightgown!" They settle down for a little gossip while the technicians set up 
the next shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look over at Lee when I'm acting," says Thomas, "and she's glowing because 
she's doing it along with me." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a happy partnership, although Grant admits to a little actorish jealousy 
because "nobody's taking pictures of me!" 
</P>
<P>
 But it's a small price to pay, knowing that the picture they make together 
will be exactly the picture they want the public to see. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reunion" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

LIFE AS A MEDIA BARON; BIOGRAPHY OF A SHY, SECRETIVE MAN JUST SCRATCHES THE 
SURFACE; NEWHOUSE: ALL THE GLITTER, POWER, AND GLORY OF AMERICA'S RICHEST MEDIA 
EMPIRE AND THE SECRETIVE MAN BEHIND IT, BY THOMAS MAIER (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: 
$24.95; 446 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Shaw, David Shaw writes about the media for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 This intriguing, damning but ultimately unsatisfying biography of the man who 
is arguably the most powerful media baron in the United States reminds me of 
all those unauthorized biographies of Howard Hughes. Because Hughes was an 
obsessive recluse, readers learned little about him in those books that wasn't 
speculation, rumor, innuendo and amateur psychoanalysis. For the most part, 
Hughes' would-be biographers filled their pages with what purported to be 
inside accounts of his various creations and acquisitions -- everything from 
RKO, TWA, Hughes Aircraft and the hotels of Las Vegas to the "revolutionary" 
brassiere he designed for actress Jane Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Maier, an investigative reporter for Newsday in New York, falls -- 
indeed jumps -- into the same, perhaps inevitable trap in "Newhouse." 
Sixty-seven-year-old Samuel I. (Si) Newhouse Jr., the multi-billionaire who now 
runs the empire created by his once-impoverished father, is not really a 
recluse. Nor is he the bizarre eccentric that Hughes was. There have been no 
stories about his having six-inch-long fingernails or a phobia about germs. But 
he is shy, secretive and (like his company) private. Because his Conde Nast 
empire includes some of the most glamorous magazines in America -- the New 
Yorker, Vanity Fair, Vogue -- but he grants few interviews himself, Newhouse 
has become a mystery figure of sorts among the New York glitterati. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier says on the first page of his book: "Si Newhouse never responded to a 
written request for an interview." Newhouse's brother and second-in-command, 
Donald, and other family members "had much the same reaction," as did many 
Newhouse executives, Maier says. Thus, despite the author's admirably 
exhaustive efforts -- "examining hundreds of pages of court testimony and 
documents, conducting more than 250 interviews and reading numerous books, 
newspapers and periodicals" -- the book lacks any true sense of who Si Newhouse 
really is and what he really wants, apart from money. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the Hughes books, one learns a great deal in "Newhouse" about the 
Newhouse creations and acquisitions -- which include the country's largest book 
publishing group (Random House, Knopf, Pantheon, Crown); two dozen newspapers 
(among them, dailies in Cleveland, Portland, Newark and New Orleans), and 
assorted television holdings. But one learns precious little of consequence 
about Si Newhouse himself, other than that he has a valuable art collection, a 
strong commitment to such verities as family and hard work, and a penchant for 
firing longtime editors. (His spectacular dismissals have entered publishing 
lore: Grace Mirabella, who had spent 36 years at Vogue, heard she was fired 
only when it was announced on television; the ousting of both William Shawn, 
the legendary New Yorker editor, and Andre Schiffrin, the publisher of Pantheon 
Books, triggered in-house uprisings.) 
</P>
<P>
 Early to bed, early to rise, Newhouse usually gets to his office before dawn, 
and there's a delightful scene in the book in which guests at a Newhouse 
cocktail party are alerted that it's time to leave by a dimming of the lights 
in his "grand duplex" -- at 8 p.m.! -- so Newhouse won't miss his 9 o'clock 
bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Such personal anecdotes are all too few, alas. In fact, the most vivid 
portrait in this book is not of Si Newhouse -- nor even of his father or 
brother -- but of Roy Cohn, who rose to infamy with Sen. Joseph McCarthy and 
became a longtime close friend and legal adviser to Si Newhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cohn sections contain the best material in the book, in particular the 
behind-the-scenes role that Cohn played in getting Newhouse's Cleveland 
Plain-Dealer to shamefully back away from its own Page 1 expose on Jackie 
Presser, the Teamsters Union boss who had ties to both the Mafia and the FBI. 
But even with the rich (and unseemly) Newhouse/Cohn relationship, Maier is 
often reduced to surmise and speculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohn's homosexuality "didn't seem" to disturb Newhouse, he writes. And: 
Newhouse "likely knew . . . Roy's secret." And -- in writing about how Cohn 
used the Newhouse-owned Parade magazine to attack the Internal Revenue Service 
when it was investigating Cohn: Whether Newhouse agreed with this diatribe "is 
not certain." 
</P>
<P>
 Maier is on sounder -- and more fertile -- ground when he can rely on 
documents, as in his painstaking reconstruction of the Newhouse family's own 
battle against the IRS. When Newhouse Sr. died, the estate was hit with a 
$1-billion tax bill. But Newhouse Jr. and his shrewd attorneys managed to 
whittle the bill to $48 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier is also effective in using the Newhouse newspapers as a prototype for 
the homogenization of the American media and a case study on the dangers of 
monopoly ownership. Competition can lead to excess and sensationalism, of 
course, but it can also force newspapers to take seriously their civic 
responsibilities, to dig deep and report broadly, if only out of fear of being 
beaten. Thus, after describing the Newhouse family's role in the demise of the 
Cleveland Press in 1982, Maier writes: "With the collapse of competition and a 
certain lock on the market, newspapers like Newhouse's Cleveland Plain Dealer 
could afford a 'take it or leave it' approach to serving the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Maier describes the Newhouse newspaper and broadcast holdings as "the biggest 
part of the Newhouse empire," but he devotes only a relatively small portion of 
his book to Si Newhouse's role in these ventures. The book has 13 chapters, and 
Maier devotes seven of them to accounts of the high-profile controversies 
surrounding Newhouse's personnel moves at the New Yorker, Vanity Fair and his 
book-publishing companies. Maier is thus guilty of the very sin for which he so 
self-righteously condemns the Newhouse-run magazines: pandering to the public 
with glitter instead of substance. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Maier seems determined to paint the most unflattering portrait 
possible of Newhouse; he's variously depicted as a "buffoon," as "the bumbling 
son of the wealthy owner" and as someone to be condemned for his "abuse of a 
public trust, his tolerance and sometimes deliberate participation in ethically 
vacuous deals." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has done little to rescue his newspapers from the resolute 
mediocrity they represented in his father's day, Newhouse has been a major and 
not altogether malignant force in the magazine world. However much one may 
lament the disappearance of the old New Yorker and the royal flash and trash of 
the new Vanity Fair, both magazines have carried some very good journalism 
under Newhouse's aegis, and it's entirely possible that neither would have 
survived in the current media climate without the infusion of Newhouse's money 
and his editors. 
</P>
<P>
 Maier gives Newhouse so little credit that after all his criticism, the reader 
is startled to find the author saying, in the final words of the book, that 
Newhouse's "most remarkable achievement" has been his "ability to surprise, to 
overcome his personal fears and limitations, to exceed the expectations of 
those who thought they knew him best. For so much of Si Newhouse's life, as he 
often professed, has been about the willingness to change." 
</P>
<P>
 It's as if, having buried Newhouse, Maier felt compelled to praise him.

PROFILE; FRESH 'EXPOSURE'; PAUL PROVENZA, ONCE A RAUCOUS STAND-UP, NOW A DOCTOR 
SAYING 'AH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE RHODES, Joe Rhodes is a freelance writer based in Portland, Ore. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hidden inside a converted sporting goods warehouse at the far end of a wooded 
industrial park in Seattle's eastern suburbs, exists the parallel universe of 
Cicely, Alaska, a pop-up town at the edge of the Zen frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 All the interior sets for "Northern Exposure" -- the cabins, the tavern, the 
doctor's office, the radio station and the general store -- are set up just 
beyond the reception area, which is, quite frankly, a fairly odd sight in 
itself. A life-size wax replica of cast member Barry Corbin, who plays Maurice 
Minnifield, and a prominently displayed assortment of Bucket O' Blood red-hot 
bubble-gum balls, are just a couple of items to note. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Provenza, new to these parts and trying to explain how he got here, is 
sitting in his dressing-room trailer, the ever-present Seattle rain pelting the 
roof. Along with actress Teri Polo (who plays his wife), Provenza faces the 
formidable task of replacing soon-to-be-departed Rob Morrow. To shed a little 
light on who he is and where he gets his inspiration, Provenza reaches into his 
back pocket, pulling out the only photo he carries in his wallet. It isn't of 
his mother, his girlfriend or even his cat. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a picture of Provenza, smiling. And sticking his finger in Jerry Lewis' 
nose. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid, I had a lazy eye, and because I had to wear an eye patch my 
depth perception was less than stellar. So I was always knocking things over, 
falling into things, tripping and breaking stuff," Provenza says, explaining 
why the chance to shove his finger into Jerry's nostrils proved to be a pivotal 
moment in his life. "I watched Jerry Lewis movies and thought, 'He does the 
same things I do. Except he trips and falls and gets laughs. I might as well 
try that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Which is how Provenza, 37, became a comedian and actor and the newest 
ingredient in "Northern Exposure's" cosmic soup. His path to Cicely has been 
filled with left turns. He was a smart kid from the Bronx who went to the 
University of Pennsylvania and could have been a doctor or a lawyer but decided 
to be a comic instead. He started hanging around the Improv in New York when he 
was 16. At Penn, majoring in pre-law and minoring in biology, he did dorm 
lounge shows for his friends and worked clubs on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 His fate was sealed by a chance to study in London at the Royal Academy of 
Dramatic Arts. His career ever since has gone back and forth between serious 
acting and outrageous stand-up, everything from off-Broadway theater to hosting 
a cable talk show called "Comics Only" (where Provenza once opened a holiday 
broadcast by wishing everyone a Merry Christmas "and a Happy Hanukkah for those 
of you who killed our Lord.") 
</P>
<P>
 "I gravitate toward things you can't really categorize," he says, asked how he 
makes the shift from his often-confrontational stand-up to the subtle weirdness 
of "Northern Exposure." "I want to be as eclectic as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Provenza and Polo found themselves in Seattle barely a week after 
learning they'd been cast, leaving precious little time for either to adjust to 
the cultural rhythms of the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in the Bronx and I live in Los Angeles," Provenza says. "So I need 
crime nearby, which is hard to find here. I need to be able to walk down the 
street, get a cup of espresso, a quick bite to eat and some crime." 
</P>
<P>
 "People actually drive the speed limit here," says Polo, 25, a Delaware native 
who has lived in New York the last eight years. "And everywhere you turn 
there's an espresso sign. They have espresso at the local bait and tackle 
store. Seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Until a couple of years ago, Polo seemed to be building a feature film career 
of her own. (She played Meryl Streep's daughter in "House of the Spirits.") But 
she grew weary of auditioning for the string-bikini parts that inevitablely are 
offered to blond actresses in their 20s. "I didn't want to play 17 year old 
bimbos ... I've done that and it's time to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was willing to wait until the right thing came along," she says. "And this 
was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Rob Morrow's character, the perpetually disgruntled Dr. Joel 
Fleischman, Provenza and Polo's characters, Phillip and Michelle Capra, move 
willingly to Cicely from Santa Monica, seeking adventure and escape from urban 
life. But, like Fleischman, they will be outsiders, unfamiliar with the 
assorted peculiarities of greater Cicely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get a lot of scenes where at the end I just go, 'Ah,' " says Provenza, 
whose last steady gig on network television was on the considerably more linear 
"Empty Nest." "It's like, I don't know what planet I'm on, but I don't want to 
be rude, so ... Ah." 
</P>
<P>
 "And on the most superficial level, I'm going through the same things in real 
life that my character is. It's identical. Here I am coming into a situation 
where everybody has known each other for years and I'm the new guy, just trying 
to figure things out. And this is so different from what I'm used to doing, 
sitcoms where everything is just joke, joke, joke. Here we'll go through an 
entire script, with not one joke in it, and yet we're all laughing. Sometimes 
the whole joke is that nothing happened. Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "And that's when I go, 'Ah.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Northern Exposure" airs Monday nights at 10 p.m. on CBS.

<P>
 When I opened my TV Times one recent Saturday night, I was stunned to see that 
in place of "The Five Mrs. Buchanans" (CBS), a wonderfully funny show, was 
"Walker, Texas Ranger," which has no plot and is very violent and fake. I am 13 
and lately I have noticed that here aren't very many quality shows like "The 
Road Home," "Christy," "McKenna" and "Byrds of Paradise" on anymore.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce Beresford's 1985 King David (KCOP Sunday at 6 p.m.), with Richard Gere 
in the title role, starts out as a well-told Biblical tale only to falter in 
the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Journey of Natty Gann (KTLA Sunday at 6 p.m.) is an affecting 1985 Disney 
picture about a girl (Meredith Salenger) who crosses the country during the 
depths of the Depression with a wolf for a traveling companion. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectacle all but overwhelms Steven Spielberg's star-laden 1991 Hook (ABC 
Sunday at 8 p.m.), nominally a sequel to J.M. Barrie's "Peter Pan" but really a 
modern reworking of the 1904 play. Here, Robin Williams plays a corporate 
raider who must regain his true self -- Pan -- if he's to save his children; 
Dustin Hoffman has the villainous title role and Julia Roberts is Tinkerbell. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hughes' sometimes funny, sometimes tasteless 1989 National Lampoon's 
Christmas Vacation (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.) offers a hideous vision of a suburban 
Christmas gone totally amok. The movie is much like a Norman Rockwell 
illustration with a punk-rock beat and spiders nibbling through the frame. As 
in previous "Vacations," Chevy Chase and Beverly D'Angelo head the Griswold 
household. 
</P>
<P>
 This Miracle on 34th Street (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.) is the enchanting 1947 
original in which Edmund Gwenn plays a department store Santa who believes he 
is the genuine article. With little Natalie Wood and Maureen O'Hara and John 
Payne as her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 White Christmas (KTLA Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.) is an elaborate 1954 VistaVision 
reworking of the much-better 1942 "Holiday Inn," in which Bing Crosby 
introduced "White Christmas." Crosby returns, as do Irving Berlin's songs, and 
he's joined by Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera-Ellen. The plot has to do 
with Army buddies Crosby and Kaye jazzing up ex-officer Dean Jagger's winter 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
 With the 1992 cable remake of Christmas in Connecticut (KTLA Thursday at 8 
p.m.), writer Janet Brownell has embellished as well as updated the 1945 comedy 
in which non-cooking cooking columnist Barbara Stanwyck is maneuvered by her 
boss into preparing a holiday dinner for a soldier. Occasionally, Brownell goes 
over the top, but she and debuting director Arnold Schwarzenegger effectively 
suggest how far more complex our lives have become in the four decades since 
the original film. Dyan Cannon plays the star of America's favorite TV cooking 
show while her assistant (Kelly Cinnante) does all the real work off camera. 
With Kris Kristofferson and Tony Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 Romero (KCOP Saturday at 6 p.m.) has the good fortune to have the 
late Raul Julia in the title role of the martyred Salvadoran archbishop, but 
his solid portrayal (one of the actor's personal favorites) cannot redeem a 
trite film that in too many crucial ways goes wrong.

 Did you know that 17% of all relationships fail because of disputes over how 
late one partner reads in bed with the lights on? 
</P>
<P>
 Not really, we made that up. But reading after bedtime ranks right up there 
with the major cohabitational irritants. In our experience, no standing, 
suspended or wall-mounted reading light really keeps the peace as well as the 
little book-mounted lights that shine on the page and nowhere else. The 
granddaddy in this genre is the Itty-Bitty Booklight, but the latest is the 
NiteOwl, above, a lamp so slender that it doubles as a bookmark. Available at 
bookstores, from the Sharper Image stores, or by phoning Lumatec Industries at 
(800) 776-7945.

SINGING WITH 'MATLOCK' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, we would certainly prefer watching "Matlock" (ABC) as opposed to 
"McKenna.""Matlock" is a great program and we never miss it. Good, clean and 
entertaining. We enjoy the segments where he (Andy Griffith) conducts the 
church choir and they sing the lovely hymns.

 THE DIFFERENCE: Growing Up Female in America by Judy Mann. (Warner: $22.95; 
317 pp.) "For most gender differences, the argument that biology is destiny 
simply doesn't hold up.What is most devastating to the argument, however, is 
this: The differences are shrinking." So says Judy Mann in her book, "The 
Difference," an informative, yet poorly conceived look at how patriarchal 
culture smothers every aspect of a girl's life. The shrinking difference she 
refers to is the rise in girl's math scores if they are given proper 
encouragement at school and at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann's ideas are organized in short, blurb-like sections that often repeat the 
same information again and again. Her arguments are well meaning, and anyone 
with a feminist bone in their body would agree with most of what she has to 
say, especially concerning education, yet her evidence can be suspect. For 
example, to experience firsthand the advantages of an all-girls school, Mann 
visits Madeira, which is "Located on almost 400 acres of lush meadows and woods 
in Fairfax County, Virginia." She finds the girls to be curious, supportive and 
academically confident. One Latin class in particular, which has only four 
students, seems to be filled with a wonderful atmosphere of cooperation and 
trust. What a shock. Yes, gender bias is prevalent in our schools. It's a 
terrible problem. However, let's draw comparisons from a level playing field 
since most teachers would have an easier time explaining Latin to four German 
Shepards than 40 angry urban teen-agers in a dangerous, underfunded public 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Mann is obviously very committed to improving the fate of girls in the 
country. She is an intelligent, caring writer. It hurts not to like this book.

 THE HERO'S DAUGHTER: Through Myth, Story and Jungian Psychology, An 
Exploration of the Shadow Side of Father Love by Maureen Murdock. (Fawcett: 
$23; 250 pp.) There is a type of family structure that receives very little 
attention, yet is not at all uncommon. The father's daughter. This is a 
situation where the mother is in some way unavailable, and through chance or 
compatibility, an extremely intense bond is formed between father and favored 
daughter. Along with huge advantages, there is a terrible price to be paid for 
this type of relationship. Maureen Murdock examines both sides of this complex 
dynamic in her incisive, engrossing book, "The Hero's Daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Through case studies and compassionate analysis, Murdock explains how a 
father's daughter, in order to hold up her end of the relationship, must in a 
deep sense identify solely with the masculine and remain a diluted version of 
herself. Murdock says the father's daughter will, " . . . continue to define 
her identity, status, and value through the authority and power of the 
internalized father, whether this internalization is embodied by a spouse, a 
boss, (or) a corporation. . . . The rules and opinions of her father, present 
or not, alive or dead, will define the geography of her inner world." The 
Jungian aspects to this book are fairly minimal -- more like Jung Lite. This, 
however, will render it easily accessible to those not familiar with Jung, 
while still retaining interest for others. Murdock has beautifully illuminated 
an important aspect of many people's lives.

 THOSE THAT MATTERED by Barbara Angle. (Crown: $22; 307 pp.) In her highly 
autobiographical first novel, "Those That Mattered," Barbara Angle gives us a 
heartfelt account of what it's like to work in a West Virginia coal mine.The 
constant danger, slow poisoning of your body by coal dust, and merciless 
harassment from male miners are all written in a distant, somewhat pretentious 
prose that shows talent, but lacks polish. 
</P>
<P>
 Portia Crowe, granddaughter, daughter and sister of coal miners, is a smart, 
rebellious young woman. After college and a failed marriage she goes to work in 
the mines, an act which, as a woman, makes her the focus of intense hostility 
from the entire town. 
</P>
<P>
 Angle's writing is at its best when Portia is actually underground. There is 
an interesting relationship, almost an addiction, to the mine itself, the dust 
and danger, which seems to be at the heart of this story. As soon as Portia 
enters sunlight Angle's work loses immediacy. In a prologue to "Those That 
Mattered," Angle says, "I will not, must not, be shattered. Hence, a buffer, 
the invulnerable third person will speak to you." Yet, isn't writing, to a 
certain extent, about being shattered? This story may have been much more 
effective if it were handled as straight autobiography, perhaps with a 
co-writer.

 EXCUSE ME FOR ASKING by Janis Arnold. (Algonquin: $18.95; 378 pp.) Two women, 
Julia and Robin, meet in college and form a passionate, lifelong, somewhat 
symbiotic friendship.The course of that friendship, its effect on both of them, 
and others in the small Texas town where they live, is the subject of Janis 
Arnold's second novel, "Excuse Me for Asking." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold's structure -- alternating points of view between Julia, Robin, and 
their friends and family -- gives the whole book an eccentric, syncopated 
rhythm, which if the characters were stronger, would make it a real pleasure to 
read. Unfortunately, they are not. Almost everyone in "Excuse Me for Asking" is 
completely absorbed with Julia, including Julia herself. This might work if she 
were profound or even funny, but Julia is merely egocentric and doesn't seem to 
provide any real goods or services to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problems is Arnold's scope. For some reason, perhaps their solipsism, 
these characters seem to exist in a glass ball that doesn't really resonate 
with the world around us. This may make it difficult for many readers to come 
away with anything but a vague sense of dissatisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse Me for Asking" takes some interesting structural chances, has strong 
dialogue and nice description. Perhaps, Arnold's future work will deliver on 
her obvious potential.

 SNOW ANGELS by Stewart O'Nan. (Doubleday: $20; 305 pp.) With its simple prose, 
bleak subject matter, and icy landscapes, Steward O'Nan's first novel, "Snow 
Angels," shines with a cold, stark light.Set in 1974 in a small Pennsylvania 
town, "Snow Angels" is actually two stories -- the breakup of 15-year-old 
Arthur Parkinson's family, and the murder of a young woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Annie is a single mother with a short temper. Her pathetic ex-husband, Glen, 
desperately wants to reconcile, but Annie is too busy having an affair with a 
co-worker's boyfriend. The events leading up to her murder -- told in third 
person with a slightly mythic tone -- stands in sharp contrast to Arthur who 
narrates his own story. Here is Arthur in the middle of band practice at the 
moment Annie is killed. "'We have all worked very hard this year," he (the band 
teacher) said, and paused, breathing steam . . . and then we heard what I 
immediately identified (from my own .22, my father's Mossberg, the nightly news 
from Vietnam) as gunshots. A clump of them. They crackled like fireworks, 
echoed over the bare trees on the other side of the highway. They were close. 
The band turned to them in unison, something Mr. Chervenick could never get us 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The one serious flaw in "Snow Angels" is Annie's character. When a horrible 
tragedy happens that is partly her own fault, O'Nan seems to freeze, unable to 
give us any inner life. This is unfortunate since, even though Arthur dominates 
the story, "Snow Angels" is, on some basic level, Annie's book. Still, this 
novel has a strangely beautiful, desolate appeal.

'MAY YOU ALWAYS WEAR RED'; INSIGHTS INTO THE NUANCES OF INDIAN CULTURE; 
GRANDMOTHER'S TALE AND OTHER STORIES, BY R.K. NARAYAN (VIKING: $23.95; 320 PP.) 
 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Judith Freeman, Judith Freeman has recently completed a travel memoir, The 
Time It Takes Falling Things to Land: A Journey to India. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a saying in India, "May you always wear red," a phrase spoken among 
women, and offered as a sort of benediction. Widows, who do not have an easy 
time of it in India, are prohibited by custom from wearing the color red. And 
so what this saying means is: May you die before your husband. May you be 
spared the indignities of a solitary old age. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the sort of detail, a way of looking at things, that an American might 
never think of but which is an integral part of the world of R. K. Narayan, who 
has for many decades, in 13 novels, a half a dozen story collections, and in 
his memoirs and essays, described the nuances of his native culture with 
unparalleled tenderness and irony. 
</P>
<P>
 Narayan was once hailed by Graham Greene as "the novelist I most admire in the 
English language," a remarkable compliment considering the source. Reading 
Narayan is a bit like reading Greene. Both writers belong to a generation of 
elegant storytellers, masters of their craft. Along with V. S. Pritchett, 
Narayan is one of the last remaining voices from this era. And as his new 
collection of stories makes clear, age has not diminished his talent but simply 
added an extra dimension of wisdom to his remarkable and enduring vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the stories in "The Grandmother's Tale" are new, some have been 
collected from earlier works. A number are extremely short -- a mere three or 
four pages; others, like the title story, have the weight of a novella. In each 
we find ourselves once again in the town of Malgudi and its surrounding 
villages, Narayan's equivalent of Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, where the 
majority of his fiction has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner once wrote that "the primary job that any writer faces is to tell you 
a story out of human experience. I mean by that universal mutual experience, 
the anguishes and troubles and griefs of the human heart, which is universal, 
without regard to race or time or condition. He wants to tell you something 
which has seemed so true, so moving, either comic or tragic, that it's worth 
preserving." 
</P>
<P>
 It is precisely the combination of the comic and tragic that makes Narayan's 
stories worthy of the label "universal." That, and the very ordinariness of the 
lives he so lovingly renders in fiction. He takes a Western reader into the 
very heart of an Indian village and the family compounds where the little 
dramas of marriage and money and kinship inevitably result in a tangle of human 
ties. The foreignness of the setting, rituals and traditions may seem to us 
exotic, but the underlying humanity of Narayan's dramas can't fail to strike a 
familiar chord. 
</P>
<P>
 His characters are mirrors of history, men and women betrothed to each other 
as children, raised up in a post-colonial India, who find that their own 
children, infected by the evils of modern education, Western influence and 
torrid Hindi films, no longer wish to abide by the old rules. In "Second 
Opinion," a profligate son discovers his widowed mother has long ago arranged 
his marriage to a village girl when he was only 5. At first he rebels against 
the alliance, then, thinking his mother is on the verge of death, acquiesces, 
only to discover too late that his mother is in perfect health. 
</P>
<P>
 One finds this sort of ironic O. Henry twist in many of these stories. In 
"Lawley Road" the mayor of Malgudi feels he has not done enough to celebrate 
independence and orders that all British names be removed from road signs. A 
statue of Sir Frederick Lawley, perceived as the very incarnation of colonial 
evil, is torn down. The story is a sort of riotous send-up of forced political 
correctness: not only does the town become "unrecognizable with new names," but 
Lawley is discovered to have been one of the most enlightened men of his era, 
championing independence early on. The statue, very difficult to remove from 
its lead pedestal (Britain had erected herself on "no mean foundation") is put 
up again and newly venerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "A revolutionary change is needed in our society," says a character in the 
story "Guru," but what comes through in these tales is how firmly the old 
traditions prevail in modern India. Ninety percent of the marriages in India 
are still arranged with astrologers determining whether an alliance is 
propitious. The wheel of progress turns slowly, and yet the creaking can be 
heard. Annamalai, the gardener in the story of the same name, considers it a 
triumph that he can handle the telephone. In being able to distinguish the 
mouthpiece from the earpiece, he displays "the pride of an astronaut strolling 
in space." 
</P>
<P>
 Dowries, gossip, the favor or disfavor of family deities and all sorts of 
superstitions command a center place in the lives of Narayan's characters. 
These are simple people, shepards and knife sharpeners, child brides, 
housewives yearning to be novelists, yet beneath the simplicity of their lives 
is a rich tapestry of emotion. No story displays this better than "A House and 
Two Goats," a story I first read some years ago in V. S. Pritchett's anthology, 
"Best English Short Stories." In it, an Indian couple, childless, destitute and 
reaching the end of their lives, encounter a New Yorker on vacation in India 
("I told my wife, 'Ruth, we'll visit India this winter, it's time to look at 
other civilizations' "). Muni, the old man, is tending his two remaining goats 
in a field near an ancient statue of a horse when the New Yorker stops to ask 
directions. Prevented by a language barrier from understanding each other, they 
nevertheless engage in a long and extremely funny conversation, in which the 
New Yorker tries to negotiate a price for the horse statue in English, while 
Muni retells the tale of the Mahabaharata in Tamil. 
</P>
<P>
 The story reveals the depth and subtlety of Narayan's fictional sensibility, 
which is never overtly polemical, yet leaves a reader with much to think about 
-- in this case, the irony of cultural misperception. Like all good stories, it 
is layered with meanings. What is so lovely about Narayan's work, and what 
makes it so valuable in a world torn by racial misunderstanding, is the 
gentleness of his vision, the way he makes each of us a member of his wondrous 
universe. He left me longing to return to his country and yet feeling that I 
had already done so, simply by reading his stories.

HOW THE DIRTY WORK GOT DONE; IT'S NO GOOD COMPLAINING ABOUT BRUTALITY, THIS 
HISTORY OF THE LAPD SUGGESTS -- WE GET THE POLICE FORCE WE ASK FOR; TO PROTECT 
AND TO SERVE: THE LAPD'S CENTURY OF WAR IN THE CITY OF DREAMS, BY JOE DOMANICK

 "We're on the Freeway, upon the Highway, that's the place to be.  
</P>
<P>
 We're on the Right Way, there is no Left Way  
</P>
<P>
 Let's go, the road is straight and clear.  
</P>
<P>
 There are no bars ahead, there are no signs of red  
</P>
<P>
 All the land is for you and me."  
</P>
<P>
 Lumbering though it may be, this little ditty from one of the lavish stage 
shows the Los Angeles Police Department held to raise money in the 1950s 
perfectly captures the competing desires that have pulled at the heart of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, it glamorizes the free city ("there are no signs of red"), 
harking back to our origin as the kind of Old Western town made legendary by 
such films as "High Noon" and "Unforgiven" -- a place where everyone, from 
merchants to cowboys, gunmen to gamblers, could stake their own claim to the 
Great Frontier. On the other hand, the song also reflects the extraordinary 
social conformity that L.A. was striving to attain in the '50s ("there are," it 
also implied, "no signs of Reds "). 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty and conformity, the Free Way and the Right Way: With ideals as 
conflicting as these, is it any wonder that this city exploded in 1992? 
</P>
<P>
 "To Protect and to Serve," Joe Domanick's vividly reported history of the LAPD 
since its formal inception in 1877, shows how the department has often 
exacerbated these conflicts. But Domanick, a journalist whose 1990 L.A. Weekly 
piece on the LAPD won an L.A. Press Club award, refuses to scapegoat the police 
for their failure to resolve in the streets conflicts that really lie at the 
heart of our civic culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of us, for instance, have hungered for the kind of intimate social 
community where people know their neighbors and dare to converse with 
strangers. But such a community necessarily requires a measure of conformity. 
Conservative ideologue Charles Murray, for instance, has recently touted his 
vision of Utopian American living -- a town where Americans care about, but 
also to some extent control, each other. For better or for worse, such a 
closely knit community is the kind that the first modern police force, London's 
"bobbies," was designed to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 As attorney Andrew Peyton Thomas shows in his new book "Crime and the Sacking 
of America" (Brassey's: $25; 351 pp.), the bobbies practiced in the late 19th 
Century something traditionally regarded as an innovation of the late 20th 
Century: community policing. Wearing blue to distinguish their mission from the 
offensive one of Britain's red-coated regular army, the bobbies, Thomas writes, 
aimed to "ferret out crime before it actually occurred, mainly through getting 
to know members of the community and encouraging their cooperation." The 
bobbies successfully kept crime under control, but at the price of imposing 
sometimes rigid social mores on the people they served. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Angelenos, in contrast, historically have clung tenaciously to their Old 
Western roots, preferring another, more libertarian vision of community: one in 
which we remain virtually free from the influence of others. This vision -- 
which leads the police to function more as soldiers than social workers -- was 
championed most prominently by former LAPD chief Daryl Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates showcased his paramilitary strategies in a host of media events: Riding 
shotgun on an armored tank, for instance, he helped raze the walls of a 
suspected crack house with a 14-foot-long battering ram; appearing on CBS News, 
he effusively praised Philadelphia mayor Wilson Goode's "inspired and heroic" 
decision to bomb the headquarters of a black radical organization called MOVE 
(the first aerial bombing in the history of mainland America, the assault 
killed 11 people and set several blocks of housing ablaze). 
</P>
<P>
 The harsher Gates' rhetoric became, it seemed, the higher his public approval 
ratings soared: after a decade of touting programs with names like SWAT, CRASH 
and Operation Hammer and recommending to the U.S. Senate that "casual drug 
users ought to be taken out and shot," for example, Gates received a 74% 
approval rating in a 1988 Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 As novelist and former LAPD sergeant Joseph Wambaugh told Times media critic 
David Shaw shortly before the riots of 1992, Angelenos, who in 1981 and 1985 
had voted down ballot initiatives to improve the department's extremely low 
officer-resident ratios, had implicitly condoned Gates' "lean and mean" 
approach to policing. In exchange for the "unbelievable bargain" of policing 
the city effectively with so few men, Wambaugh said, leaders and voters in Los 
Angeles have "sort of given these people . . . a certain amount of latitude . . 
. (to be) very aggressive, paramilitary . . . stopping crime before it 
happens." People want that job done, "and they don't want to hear about the 
dirty side of it. This is the deal the city made and now the city's crying 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, once George Holliday's videotape of the King beating showed us just 
how lean and mean the department's policing could be, our disregard was 
replaced by genuine concern. Shaw's articles on the department offered one 
explanation for why we didn't realize the problem sooner: Not until after the 
riots did journalists give prominent play to the fact that L.A.'s violent crime 
rate had become the nation's highest in the mid-1980s and that city payouts for 
lawsuits against the LAPD increased from $891,000 in 1980 to $14.7 million in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Domanick's comprehensive review of L.A. history also underscores how difficult 
it was for ordinary Angelenos to develop much of a lively and caring communal 
spirit. The biggest blow came in the 1890s, when L.A.'s "boosters," in an 
effort to lure business from union-dominated San Francisco, attempted to stymie 
L.A.'s labor movement by refusing to give in to workers' strikes against wage 
reductions. By 1910, striking printers at the L.A. Times, along with their 
allies in the labor movement, grew so frustrated that they bombed the Times' 
main printing plant, killing 21 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible to exaggerate just how stunning and unmitigated a disaster 
the dynamiting of the Times was for L.A.'s labor movement," Domanick writes. 
"For decades afterward, visitors from London, New York, Chicago or San 
Francisco would be struck by the lack of a working class style, of a certain 
pride, a joie de vivre , a feeling that the city belonged to the people whose 
sweat made it go, as well as to those who owned it." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelenos' alienation from their city grew in 1920s Prohibition, Domanick 
shows, when cops coddled Mafia kingpins while at the same time arresting and 
jailing people in Little Italy who went so far as to have wine with their 
dinner. By the 1930s, as Raymond Chandler's gumshoe Phillip Marlowe put it, 
L.A. had become a "paradise of fakers . . . a city rich and vigorous and full 
of crime, a city lost and beaten and full of emptiness." 
</P>
<P>
 While LAPD chief William Parker ferreted out most corruption when he took over 
the department in 1950, his conviction that "society was running amok" led him 
to draw a thick blue line between his "superior" officers and the "venal" 
communities they patrolled. As Domanick writes, Parker's philosophy of "The 
Grip" discarded such "archaic" notions of policing as walking a beat, knowing 
the neighborhood and serving as a social mediator in favor of "patrol cars with 
faceless occupants detached from the community; enforcing all laws and keeping 
an intense 24-hour surveillance over an equally faceless population." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's cops policed with such zeal, Domanick writes, that "in 1956 alone, 
when crime was low and had yet to become the issue it is now in America, the 
LAPD would arrest 220,000 people, about 10% of the population of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker adopted a "kill-the-messenger" policy toward those who tried to warn 
him that his aggressive policing may end up fomenting more unrest than it 
stopped. (One such messenger, a young sergeant and mayor-to-be by the name of 
Tom Bradley, was summarily dismissed from his liaison work with the black 
community after sending the chief a memo about growing rage in that community.) 
</P>
<P>
 While Domanick unearths much dirt about the LAPD leaders, his book excels at 
drawing fair, empathetic, multidimensional portraits of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers such as 1930s Times reporter Harold Story, for instance, have vilified 
James Edgar Davis, LAPD chief in the late '20s and again through most of the 
'30s, as "a burly, dictatorial, somewhat sadistic, bitterly antilabor man who 
saw Communist influence behind every telephone pole." Domanick, however, 
ventures beyond that caricature to show how Davis won his post only after years 
of picking cotton, mucking out stables and walking a police beat in which he 
had, by his own estimate, to knock down "1,000 doors." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Domanick shows how Davis fell prey to the same hypocrisy as 
some of those who recently supported Proposition 187. The very man who came to 
California dirt poor and uneducated later ordered borders erected along the 
major points of entry to the state. At one border, a billboard showed a 
blue-uniformed cop with his palm thrust out near an imposing red "STOP!" sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "To Protect and to Serve" ultimately fails to analyze the city council's often 
heated debates over which direction the LAPD should head now: toward 
paramilitary or community policing? Chief Willie Williams, while a proponent of 
the latter strategy, realizes that it in a city spanning nearly 465 square 
miles, it's no mean feat to institute bike patrols and other intimate community 
policing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, community policing may be our only viable course, for history 
suggests that the only other direction may lead back to 1992.

 THE FIRST ANTHOLOGY: 30 Years of the New York Review of Books edited by Robert 
B. Silvers, Barabra, Epstein & Rea S. Hederman, illustrated by David Levine 
(New York Review Books/Hendra: $12.95; 345 pp.). The list of authors in this 
collection reads like a Who's Who of contemporary literature. Oliver Stone 
describes a hiking accident that taught him the knife edge that separates 
fitness and disability; Dwight Macdonald offers a sardonic memoir of Lyndon 
Johnson's controversial White House arts festival; Robert Hughes wittily 
dismisses Andy Warhol's later work. Not every piece is wonderful: Joan Didion 
makes political repression in El Salvador sound like a bad hair day. But the 
general level of writing is so high that the reader can only hope the editors 
won't wait another 30 years to issue volume two.

 CITY OF GOD by Gil Cuadros (City Lights Books: $9.95; 150 pp., paperback 
original) and THE LISTENER by Bo Huston (Saint Martin's Press: $8.95; 168 pp.). 
Two young authors use fiction to examine life with AIDS. The hard-edged stories 
and poems by Cuadros capture the triple alienation of being Hispanic, gay and 
HIV-positive in contemporary L.A. "Chivalry," a sharply observed vignette of a 
minority within a minority, contrasts poignantly with "Reynaldo," a study of 
love denied. This talented author reminds the reader that the sand in the 
hourglass is flowing faster than it should in "At Risk:" "I didn't dare ask how 
long I've got,/ palm over my mouth,/ I say mother/ softer than I ever did 
before." The title novella in the collection by Bo Huston focuses on a 
photographer who retreats to an isolated house on the California coast, seeking 
a respite from the illness and death of so many friends.

 SONGBIRDS, TRUFFLES AND WOLVES: An American Naturalist in Italy by Gary Paul 
Nabhan (Penguin: $10.95; 227 pp.). Shaken by a divorce, botanist Gary Nabhan 
undertook a walking tour of Umbria, following the path of Franciscan 
pilgrims.As he walks, he reflects on agriculture, nature and religion. Unlike 
the vast monoculture farms of America that deplete the soil, the Italian hills 
have been farmed for centuries to produce a variety of crops. Nabhan rejoices 
in this saner approach to agriculture: "As I walked, I could see that some 
resources had obviously been used, but much had been given back. There were as 
many or more signs of renewal as there were signs of elimination. Certain 
patches had been left for brambles, birds, hops, and herbs that spiced the 
larder so that a measure of wilderness stayed within reach."

 THE PORTABLE DOROTHY PARKER by Dorothy Parker (Penguin: $13.95; 610 pp.). 
Originally published in 1944, this collection has been reissued in conjunction 
with the film "Mrs. Parker and Her Vicious Circle," which opens later this 
week.It would probably surprise the author of "Big Blonde" to learn that her 
work has proved more durable than the other members of the Algonquin Round 
Table. Her well-crafted short stories remain models of their genre. Although 
not always profound, her criticism is invariably entertaining: She describes 
Dashiell Hammett as "so hard-boiled you could roll him on the White House 
lawn," and skewers A. A. Milne with withering bons mots. This comprehensive 
anthology proves there was more to Parker than the popular image of a clever 
alcoholic whose life spoiled her talent and vice versa.

 STUBBORN TWIG: Three Generations in the Life of a Japanese American Family by 
Lauren Kessler (Plume/Penguin: $12.95; 347 pp., illustrated). Masuo Yasui 
settled in Hood River, Ore., in 1908, attracted by the opportunities the 
fertile land offered. Fluent in both Japanese and English, he quickly became an 
important and wealthy figure within the community. But Hood River was also a 
center of xenophobia: Yasui, his children and grandchildren fought the 
anti-Asian prejudice that culminated in the relocation of Japanese-Americans in 
1942. Ironically, Yasui's prominence made him doubly suspect, and his 
internment shattered his dreams, his nascent agricultural empire and his family 
ties.

 TIGER'S DESTINY by Valmik Thapar, photographs by Fateh Singh Rathore and 
Mahipal Singh (Trafalgar Square: $22.95; 176 pp.) . Thapar traces the spread of 
the tiger through Asia at the end of the last Ice Age, and the hunting and 
environmental degradation that have decimated the elegant felines. A shrinking 
population is now largely restricted to small, isolated preserves, including 
Ranthambhore National Park in north-central India, where the arresting 
photographs of tigers hunting, resting, rearing cubs, etc. were taken. Although 
the recent CITES meeting produced a ban on the traffic in tiger parts, Thapar's 
unhappy conclusion is that the tiger may soon cease to burn bright in the 
forest of the night.

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: A WINTRY DAY AT THE BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the pleasures of life in Southern California is that we can go to the 
beach for a day's respite all year 'round -- and with the crush of tourists and 
slacker college kids gone for the most part, December is a particularly good 
time to play hooky and head for the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 ONE SMALL SQUARE: SEASHORE written by Donald M. Silver and illustrated by 
Patricia J. Wynne (Scientific American Books for Young Readers / W.H. Freeman & 
Co.: $14.95), and SEASHORE by David Burnie (Dorling Kindersley: $9.95) are two 
fine books to bring along for the trip. Neither is an activity book per se, 
though both have suggested small projects to work on; rather, these are 
wonderful guidebooks that inspire young readers to become young explorers and 
really see their surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "One Small Square" is part of a series that literally encourages the reader to 
"capture" a tiny segment of the planet and examine it fully (other works in 
this excellent series cover the Arctic Tundra and caves). The book is a useful 
tool for defining and learning about an ecosystem. "Square's" lessons cover the 
thousands of creatures who live in a timeless yet constantly dynamic 
environment. The writing is clear and well-supported by the art. 
</P>
<P>
 As is the work in "Seashore," which, pardon the expression, covers much the 
same ground in a slightly different format: one or two paragraph "chapters" 
with thorough, extensive text in the captions. 
</P>
<P>
 "One Small Square" and "Seashore" have much to offer. It is difficult to 
recommend one over the other -- get thee to a bookstore and look 'em over. You 
just might spring for both. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 You don't have to know a try square from a coping saw to have a good time with 
WOODWORKING FOR KIDS (Sterling Publishing: $12.95, paperback; $19.95, 
hardcover) but you better be prepared to labor and/or supervise a bit when you 
give this excellent, detailed work to your child. Author Kevin McGuire requires 
an adult guide -- not a master carpenter -- for many of the 40 projects, which 
range from a bike rack to adjustable stilts to a work bench. It's a good excuse 
to master the basics alongside your child -- all under the guise of "teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Each project comes with a materials list and all are easily identified as to 
skill level. The text is clear and works well with the copious photographs and 
illustrations. There's also a strong emphasis on safety. All in all a 
worthwhile effort -- and if you get lucky, the kid will build an apartment over 
the garage for his teen-age years.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles is in the grip of an economic slump. There is racial hostility 
directed especially against newcomers. There are too many firearms on the 
streets, the police force seems at times to be outgunned. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like 1994? 
</P>
<P>
 This is a description of Los Angeles 123 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The population was about 6,000, half Anglo, another 40% Hispanic. Smaller 
numbers of blacks, mestizos and Native Americans lived in town. Chinese, the 
most recent immigrant group, numbered no more than 200. 
</P>
<P>
 During the fall of 1871 tensions ran high between two associations of Chinese 
workers who competed for scarce jobs mostly in the businesses or houses of the 
wealthier whites. Some members started carrying weapons. Then a white policeman 
was killed during a skirmish between the rival factions and the situation spun 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 On the moonlit night of Oct. 26 a mob of whites gathered in the streets and 
saloons -- nearly 40% of the town's businesses were bars -- working themselves 
into a frenzy of hate. Numbering at least 500 they surged into the tiny Chinese 
neighborhood off the old Plaza near the Pico House hotel. A handful of police 
and a few others did what they could to protect the Chinese but they were 
vastly outnumbered. Some historical sources contend members of the police force 
were part of the mob. When morning came 19 Chinese were dead. Some had been 
bludgeoned, most were lynched. 
</P>
<P>
 Angi Ma Wong has based a short novel for young adults on this event -- "Night 
of the Red Moon." 
</P>
<P>
 To begin her story, Wong offers an epigraph that says, essentially: If we do 
not learn from history we are doomed to repeat it. This applies strongly to 
local history. Hate crimes are still with us, but each day the stage is set 
again for racial and ethnic relations to improve or stagnate or decline, 
depending on our actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot is simple and moves along briskly, all the action taking place in 
less than 24 hours. The story is crammed with details about life in 1871 Los 
Angeles. Wong conveys the horror of that night but keeps the age of her 
audience firmly in mind.

 One weakness of "Night of the Red Moon" is an overarching concern with 1990s 
political correctness. Ming's family and friends, including an "African" named 
Tobie are all saintly while the rioters seem to be personified by the town 
drunk, referred to only as "Crazy Joe," ethnicity unspecified, who may just be 
a candidate for a 12-step plan. And the narrow, run-down street that 
English-speaking Angelenos of that time translated as "Nigger Alley" is here 
always called "Calle de los Negros." Today's 12- and 13-year-olds may find all 
this a bit quaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The story follows 12-year-old Ming who runs deliveries for his father, an 
herbalist, and baby-sits for his 3-year-old sister, Moy Moy. Ming is bright and 
mature for his age. He knows the plaza and its denizens well, "a fascinating 
and colorful assortment of people . . . they were the best of Los Angeles, and 
the worst, people of every age, skin color, and circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 Tension builds through a sizzling Indian summer afternoon, Santa Ana winds 
gust along the dusty streets between the old adobes. Ming knows a policeman has 
been shot and knows that many in town are resentful. 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner Ming is forced to go out looking for his little sister who has 
wandered away unnoticed into the dangerous streets. He finds Moy Moy just as 
the mob approaches and must seek a hiding place beneath a wooden porch. Keeping 
his sister quiet he watches, paralyzed with fright, as ropes are thrown over 
tree branches and lampposts nearby. The vigilantes drag "heathen Chinese" out 
of nearby homes and shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the victims were missing their trousers which had been ripped off 
their bodies for the contents of their pockets. One man's finger had been 
sliced off and the boy knew it was for the diamond ring he always wore. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong's first work of fiction, if discussed with parents or teachers, could 
help students better understand L.A.'s past and present. And the events 
described are not the television or motion-picture myth-making kids are so 
familiar with, they actually happened.

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: GARGOYLES TO STINKY PIGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By day gargoyles give dutiful service as grotesque architectural ornaments and 
working waterspouts. But what happens at night? Writer Eve Bunting's prodigious 
imagination -- which has produced more than 150 books for young readers -- has 
provided a shiver-inducing answer. According to Night of the Gargoyles 
(Clarion: $14.95), they "creep on the stubs of feet" and gleefully give a hard 
time to a watchman at the museum whose parapets they, er, adorn. Bunting's 
cadenced prose is full of lovely turns of phrase. No wonder gargoyles seem 
grim, for example: "There is no space inside their solid stone for laughs to 
somersault." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Caldecott medalist David Wiesner has demonstrated wit and offbeat 
imagination in his accompanying illustrations. Grunting, glowering and 
giggling, his gargoyles are infused with midnight life and mischief. Working in 
richly gray and white pastels, Wiesner invests his artful drawings with a 
sculptor's weight and substance. In texture, his images are a perfect match for 
Bunting's carefully chosen words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carefully chosen" is an equally apt description of the historically 
appropriate art form -- the woodcut -- which author-illustrator Gary Bowen has 
employed in Stranded at Plimoth Plantation, 1626 (HarperCollins: $19.95). After 
all, as he reminds us in an end-note, this type of engraving was "the most 
widely used method of making multiple prints in the 17th Century." The book's 
premise is that it is the journal of an imagined 13-year-old orphan, 
Christopher Sears, who, en route to Jamestown, is stranded in Plimoth for a 
year. The boy is a budding engraver and the hand-colored woodcuts, which enrich 
the pages of his journal of daily life in the colony, are offered as his own 
work. Whether they are his or Bowen's, the hand-colored pictures are amazingly 
complex and, given the stiffness of their form, dynamic. Lovingly researched, 
brilliantly conceived and designed, Bowen's book brings history to engaging and 
memorable artful life. 
</P>
<P>
 Verna Aardema demonstrated her mastery of the African folk-tale as early as 
1976 in the Caldecott Medal-winning book, "Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's 
Ears." Her newest work, Misoso: Once Upon a Time Tales From Africa (Apple 
Soup/Knopf: $18), finds the author still at the top of her form; so is her 
illustrator, Reynold Ruffins, a professor of art at Queens College. The word 
Misoso comes from the Mbundu tribe of Angola and describes, Aardema explains, 
"stories told mostly for entertainment." Working in pencil and acrylic, Ruffins 
has captured this spirit exactly in the stylized and amusingly attenuated 
figures that fill his drawings for these 12 timeless tales. 
</P>
<P>
 And last, here are two books for the very youngest: a concept book about 
color, Pink, Red, Blue, What Are You? and a counting book, One, Two, Three, 
Play With Me! (Dutton: $3.99 each). Author-illustrator Laura McGee Kvasnosky 
understands that, when creating books for babies, less is more. Her text and 
drawings are minimalist, but full of energy and wit. Who can resist a book with 
a double-page picture of frolicking piglets who proudly proclaim, "We're pink. 
We stink!" Not this reviewer!

THE RIDDLE OF THE EXPUNGED WORDS; THE ANNALS OF CHILE, BY PAUL MULDOON (FARRAR,

By Katherine McNamara, Katherine McNamara is a poet and essayist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1794, the English poets Robert Southey and Samuel Taylor Coleridge planned 
to (but did not) come to America, meaning to set up a Pantisocracy, an equal 
rule for all, on the banks of the Susquehanna River. Paul Muldoon, an Irish 
poet who teaches at Princeton, nearly 200 years afterward, imagined what it 
would have been like if they had come West, and wrote a funny, tragic history 
of Western philosophy he called "Madoc, A Mystery" (1991). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, Ross Macdonald, who wrote his brooding, father-quest mysteries in 
Santa Barbara, said: "My fellow admirers of Coleridge will perhaps forgive me 
for suggesting that 'Christabel' is an unfinished mystery novel in verse, whose 
subject is the elucidation of guilt and the ritual exorcism -- a guilt which 
arises from man's ability to sin against himself, both consciously and 
unconsciously." 
</P>
<P>
 Making such a triangulation is good practice for reading Paul Muldoon's 
profound new poems, "The Annals of Chile." Muldoon, "this picaro of the 
information highway," is called "one of the most metaphoric poets alive." 
"Paul's changing the rules of the game," Seamus Heaney is said to have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, he's playing the poets' oldest game, but makes it new. As Robert Graves 
knew, "poetry is rooted in love, and love in desire, and desire in the hope of 
continued existence." In that human loam are planted Muldoon's ancient roots. 
He was a young man in the Sixties. His poems travel back through the sex, drugs 
and rock and roll (Clapton and Hendrix) of that age; but deep through them also 
flow themes, and figures, of Irish legends: love, the ecclesiastical 
frustration of its desire, the poet's circuit (a seasonal/eternal going away 
and coming back), the death of a lover or a mother, the poet's desire (and 
failure -- and so his grief) to restore life. 
</P>
<P>
 What are "the annals of Chile"? They are a riddle, and point to the 
mystery-riddle inside the poems. The poet calls up O'Higgins, (presumably, 
Bernardo, the liberator of Chile in the early 19th Century): 
</P>
<P>
 "There is inherent vice  
</P>
<P>
 in everything," as O'Higgins  
</P>
<P>
 would proclaim: it was O'Higgins who duly  
</P>
<P>
 had the terms "widdershins"  
</P>
<P>
 and "deasil" expunged from the annals of Chile.  
</P>
<P>
 Here is the mystery: these "expunged" words. Only by moving with him through 
the poems will we comprehend how their meaning may be uncovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yarrow," the book's most complex poem, is a vision-poem of atonement. 
Knowledge of disaster and loss suffuses it: "all of us would be swept away." As 
though watching a video, the poet reels back through memory and buried 
knowledge. His mother appears: she "thumbs through a seed-catalogue/she's 
borrowed from Tohill's of the Moy." His father "studies the grain in the shaft 
of a rake." 
</P>
<P>
 These images carry pain. For balm, he chews on yarrow, used by the Chinese for 
divination, and by medieval monks for healing medicines, and by Achilles to 
stanch the bleeding wounds of his soldiers. His "ma ticks off a list/of seeds: 
Tohill, from tuathal,/meaning 'withershins' -- with its regrettable 
overtones/of sunworship -- in our beloved Goidelic." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as O'Higgins said "There is inherent vice//in everything," so also this 
mother taught her son the Catholic vice inherent in sex, and it haunts him, 
nearly with the madness of King Lear. She is doubled and shadowed by S---, the 
poet's lover during the Sixties, done in by her own hand. In them he recognizes 
the deep and ancient link, for men, between women and (frustrated) desire and 
war. He is tormented, and his poems are haunted, by images of war. Even the 
sweet bucolic of "Cows" is menaced by a "command wire at the trough" that may 
be linked to a bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves said that the poet's ancient work was to reconcile warring partners. In 
an earlier book, we remember, Muldoon went looking for his missing father, who 
"disappeared/and took passage, almost for Argentina . . . /While he has gone no 
further than Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the poem called "Brazil" is one key to unriddling the title, for this 
Brazil is Breasal's Island, or Hy-Brazil, the mythic Irish land of pleasure and 
feasting. It is the world of dream and longing in which his mismatched parents 
lived while they spent their hard, hungry lives on the farmland, seeded from 
Tohill's catalogue, that is about to be swept away. It is the verbal video of 
the poet-son's boy's books of legendary heroes, his imagined flights of 
derring-do beside Mike Fink, Arthur and Cuchulain. But Hy-Brazil doubles, in 
the poem's mind-movie, into S---'s terrible, drug-filled dreams of "kingdoms 
naked in the trembling heart." 
</P>
<P>
 The poet (like Ross Macdonald) searched for the lost father ("It seemed I 
would forever be driving west"). He headed west in the Sixties and got as far 
as California. There, the vision goes psychedelic, as one image writhes against 
another and wipes it out. Drugs call up false prophecies; and he has a very bad 
trip. In his mastery of these images, Muldoon is the peer of Thomas Pynchon, 
whose "Vineland," a true myth-fiction of California in the Sixties, delineates 
an American naivete and our endless fascination with evil. 
</P>
<P>
 But why has the poet tried to solve the riddle of the expunged words? We can 
turn for insight to the companion to "The Annals," called "The Prince of the 
Quotidian," published simultaneously (by Wake Forest) and meant to resolve 
"questions" raised by that volume. The poet is visited by a revenant, "A man 
with a belly like a poisoned/pup . . . much the worse for drink," who demands 
he return to the real work: "making metaphors." 
</P>
<P>
 he slaps my cheek; "Above all else, you must atone  
</P>
<P>
 for everything you've said and done  
</P>
<P>
 against your mother: meet excess of love  
</P>
<P>
 with excess of love. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 The poet -- this must have been fearsome -- will go back to the beginning. 
"The Annals," dedicated to the memory of his mother, opens with a rendering of 
Ovid's Leto. In homage (he once had made light of that daughter of the Titans), 
he acknowledges her "vindictive" power to reduce men, who scorned to aid a 
woman and her children in need, to frogs, eternally cursing and babbling in 
their muddy pool. 
</P>
<P>
 We come to the last word: deasil, mentioned once and not repeated; this key we 
must find by ourselves. In Irish, deasil means to travel in the direction of 
the sun. For the ancients, wrote the scholar Thomas F. O'Rahill, "to go dessel 
or right-handwise, thus imitating the course of the sun, was not only the right 
way to make a journey, but it was likewise beneficial in other affairs of life, 
and was likely to lead to a prosperous result." 
</P>
<P>
 We now comprehend: in atonement, the poet has gone on a poet's circuit back 
through his poems; he has gone widdershins through the legends and history that 
enriched them, and the memories of experience that formed them, at every moment 
watching and listening for psychic echoes of the expunged words. By circling 
back through heart-wrench, he has tried to heal, and to reconcile all parties, 
to put them at one, as the poet once was obligated to do with his art. This 
poet longs for the gift of curing, but is given only perfect grief and the 
ashes of fury, as in the beautiful "Incantata," when he cannot call back his 
lover from the death she accepted. (Inversely, in "The Birth," weeping, he 
sings his new daughter into the world, by calling its lovely things to surround 
her.) 
</P>
<P>
 Deasil is a lost word of rightness; for the poet, its promise cannot be 
fulfilled in life. The wheel turns, his vision ends; and he is left standing, 
emptied (this is the real fate of visionaries) but minus relief, without 
respite. Nothing sentimental in this hard, clean end. 
</P>
<P>
 To go the right way, for us, is to read the annals from beginning to end, in 
their reasonable order, unearthing their meanings, for there is nothing 
accidental in these poems; every word, every reference, every allusion, carries 
meaning. That is the art, the gorgeous music of language, the poet has made of 
his harrowing vision-memories. As the poet -- this is his triumph, it is what 
marks this book with what may be greatness -- Paul Muldoon never flinches in 
his brilliant verbal workings, while his "I," the tormented boy/man, the 
ancient mariner singing to us his holy and unholy visions, endures real 
suffering; and if he is not granted rest, we who are reading are given a 
version of the perfected, the classical peace we might feel at the end of a 
sun-wise journey, in which we have seen revealed to us "how art may be made."

A COOK'S LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE MCKENNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ellen Rose opened the Cook's Library, a store devoted to cookbooks, in 
April of 1989, it was the only store of its kind in L.A.; five years later 
that's still the case. Similar stores are turning up -- you can find them in 
New York, Oregon and Toronto -- but Rose continues to corner the market in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Having monitored L.A.'s eating habits for five years, Rose reports, "I talk to 
Nach Waxman who owns Kitchen Arts & Letters in New York all the time, and 
there's a dramatic difference in what we sell. The biggest difference between 
the two coasts is that the West is much more health conscious. I have dozens of 
diet and health books, and vegetarian cooking is huge and growing -- probably 
because young people are choosing not to eat meat at a very early age. I've 
also noticed an increasing number of vegans -- vegetarians who eat no meat or 
dairy products at all -- but the publishing world hasn't caught up with this 
trend yet. There are only a few vegan cookbooks out, but they sell like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the emphasis on health, I think many people enjoy food a lot 
less," she adds. "They don't understand that if you do things in moderation you 
don't have to cut out everything, so they just go without. I have customers who 
buy cookbooks and take them to bed and read them, but wouldn't dream of cooking 
from them." Rose estimates there are about 4,000 cookbooks currently in print, 
and says her store carries about 2,700 titles. "When I first opened there were 
gobs of cookbooks coming out, but the publishing industry got scared by the 
recession, and by last year there wasn't much of a choice. This year feels like 
1989 again -- there are lots of new cookbooks this year." 
</P>
<P>
 It's surprising that the recession led to a decrease in the publication of 
cookbooks, as one of the repercussions of the dip in the economy was a move 
away from restaurant dining in favor of entertaining in the home. "The 
recession was good for me because the trend is to the home," says Rose. "The 
economy started it by pushing people back in, then they discovered they prefer 
socializing at home." 
</P>
<P>
 As to her criteria in selecting her stock, Rose says she's willing to look at 
anything. "I have some self-published books that are fabulous, many of which 
are imports. There are two out of England -- Margaret Shaida's 'The Legendary 
Cuisine of Persia,' and Mavis Hyman's 'Indian-Jewish Cooking' -- that are 
great, and a wonderful cake book from Ohio that's full of old-fashioned cake 
recipes. I have an entire section devoted to community cookbooks, and some of 
them are fantastic -- there's a terrific one from the 50s that came out of 
Charleston that's the most authentic Southern cookbook of that era I've ever 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to carry books that rely on processed foods, but I've never had to 
pass on a cookbook because the ingredients it requires were unavailable in L.A. 
You can get ingredients for just about any cuisine here now," adds Rose, who 
along with her staff of three, tests as many recipes as possible. "Some things 
you have to get by mail order, but we have books on that too. The weirdest book 
in the store is Calvin W. Schwabe's 'Unmentionable Cuisine,' which tells you 
how to prepare things most people wouldn't dream of eating, and the most 
expensive book we've ever stocked was Salvador Dali's cookbook -- we had a 
first edition that sold for $225. This year the imported books from France and 
England are my most expensive titles, but they're also the books that make the 
store unique. Most of my cookbooks can be found in other stores, but you can't 
get these anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "As to what the hippest food is right now, we just had a run on our Afghan 
cookbook, 'Afghan Food and Cookery' by Helen Saberi, and this is the year of 
deserts. French cookbooks are the poorest sellers because that cuisine is so 
high in fat. I wish more people were interested in cooking it, because it has 
the most depth and is the basis of most of food." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cook's Library located at 8373 W. 3rd St. is open Monday from 1-5 p.m., 
Tuesday through Saturday 11-6 p.m. Call (213) 655-3141 for holiday hours or for

A DREAM COME TRUE FOR 'HOSPITAL'S' LILLY MELGAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Lilly Melgar, who plays Lily Rivera on "General Hospital," the hardest 
part of daytime stardom has been adjusting to granting interviews rather than 
conducting them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so hard," confesses the interviewer turned actress. "It's so strange. I 
get this nervous feeling, because I have no control. And I'm used to being the 
one in control, the one asking the questions and gearing the conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 Melgar comes to soaps with three years of reporting experience as host of her 
own Latino television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first show, 'Tu Musica,' was a lot like MTV," Melgar explains. "I 
interviewed people like Santana, Luis Enrique, Yuri, and Ricky Martin when he 
was a member of the group Menudo. Then, I did 'Desde Hollywood,' which is like 
'Entertainment Tonight,' and 'Ritmo International,' a show done by the 
producers of 'Star Search.' " 
</P>
<P>
 While her reporting career flourished, Melgar admits that she never stopped 
dreaming of becoming an actress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had too much passion for it," Melgar says, noting that she took acting 
classes on and off over the years. "I knew I had to pursue it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, Melgar promptly landed an agent and began going to auditions. A 
meeting with "General Hospital" executive producer Wendy Riche was among them. 
As fate would have it, the show was looking for a love interest for Ricky 
Martin (Miguel Morez), who was a friend of Melgars from her television shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two of us did some scenes together, just to show (the "General Hospital" 
brass) my work," Melgar recalls. "We had such great chemistry. Wendy just fell 
in love with it." 
</P>
<P>
 By April, Melgar was part of "General Hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been watching 'General Hospital' since junior high school," she says. "I 
always knew I'd be on it one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom taught me that there's nothing you can't achieve if you really want it 
bad enough," Melgar continues. "All you have to do is go after it, and it's 
yours. She supported (my desire to become an actress) a lot. She always saw it 
in me. She gave me confidence in myself to go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Melgar also credits her mother with keeping her grounded throughout her fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I did the Hispanic market, I was pretty popular; everybody knew me," she 
explains. "It's easy to forget your focus. My mom has always been there to 
remind me of that, which is great. She's not one of those moms who says, 'Oh 
darling, everything you do is beautiful. My daughter is the best.' Her advice 
has been, 'Keep your feet on the ground honey, because as fast as (success) 
comes, it can be gone.' And I'm very aware of that. I thank her so much for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Melgar appreciates her wonderful colleagues at "General Hospital" too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is awesome," she says. "I'm so lucky to be working with Wendy, 
producer Francesca James, and the whole cast. For a first-time actress, it's 
great to be working with such talented people who are so sweet and willing to 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 "General Hospital" airs weekdays at 2 p.m. on ABC.

ON THE WATERFRONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your review of Marlon Brando's autobiography (Sept. 18) repeats an old 
revisionist chestnut about Elia Kazan's movie, "On the Waterfront." "Kazan and 
Budd Schulberg, who wrote the script," your reviewer writes, "had both been 
cooperating witnesses for (the House Committee on Un-American Activities). The 
movie is a defense of their position." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what really happened, though facts often get in the way of what some 
people want to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Elia Kazan came to me in 1951 and suggested we do a picture in the East with a 
social theme. We discussed the Trenton Six, the case of young blacks accused in 
a (New Jersey) grocery-store killing who were being railroaded to their deaths. 
I spent a few weeks in Trenton checking it out. I got the picture it wasn't a 
clear-cut case. Then I mentioned the waterfront. I had done a screenplay based 
on a newspaper series about the longshoremen's union. Kazan was interested. 
Coincidentally, he had worked with Arthur Miller on a waterfront project that 
had fallen through. 
</P>
<P>
 With Kazan urging me on (with absolutely no mention of answering his House 
Un-American Activities Committee critics), I threw myself back into the 
waterfront. I was drawn to St. Francis Xavier Church, and the Rev. John 
Corridan, and his longshoremen disciples. The film project because a potential 
weapon on the side of social justice. In the course of a year and a half's 
association with the reform element in the International Longshoremen's Union, 
I sat in on Father John's counseling the men when he was urging them to testify 
on waterfront crime to the Waterfront Commission. They were afraid for their 
lives if they got up and told the truth. But Father Corridan felt their 
testimony was needed to break the hold of the mob on the terrorized 
dockworkers. 
</P>
<P>
 I reported to Kazan on what I was learning. He came down and met Father 
Corridan and the men on edge about testifying. Out of this real crisis the 
film's climax evolved. I attended every day of the waterfront hearings. I wrote 
the film's ending out of this experience. It was my relationship with an 
unforgettable labor priest urging his flock to defy the mob in the name of 
democratic unionism that gave substance to the work. 
</P>
<P>
 The best you can say for the revisionists with their convenient theories is 
that Kazan's direction may have been energized by some sense that the climax 
justified his own position before HUAC. But to isolate that emotion as the 
inspiration for our film is to put the cart before the horse. 
</P>

<P>
 Reviewer David Freeman responds: "On the Waterfront" dramatizes a situation in 
which the naming of names is justifiable and brave. The director and writer of 
the film were cooperating witnesses for HUAC. I, and others, see a connection 
there. But I take Schulberg's point.

 In referring to Anna Kashfi's "spiteful" book, "Brando for Breakfast" (Sept. 
18), you omitted the co-author's name: E.P. Stein. Curiously, in the original 
review (Sept. 9, 1979), you committed the same oversight. It's E.P. Stein -- 
got it? Where can authors count on respect if not in Book Reviews? Anyhow, Anna 
Kashfi was married to Marlon Brando. In her case, spite makes right.

 Having Nina Totenberg review the books about Judge Clarence Thomas (Nov. 13) 
was a gratuitous insult to any of your readers who have seen her on PBS or 
"Nightline." Next you will probably have Bob Shapiro review the O.J. books.

 I write to take exception to Nina Totenberg's characterization of my book, 
"The Real Anita Hill," as factually flawed. Totenberg failed to note that the 
sole review of my book, which questioned its accuracy, was written by the two 
competing reporters whose book was under review by Totenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 More seriously, Totenberg did not disclose that my book seriously called into 
question her journalistic sense of fairness, accuracy and ethics. But readers 
do not have to accept my word on this. Even the book which Totenberg has so 
favorably reviewed, "Strange Justice," reports that one of her NPR reports on 
the Thomas-Hill confrontation contained "erroneous" information.

 I have over the recent weeks been noticing a decided shift to left-wing bias 
in the Los Angeles Times, despite the endorsement of Pete Wilson for governor. 
This has been reflected in the coverage of Proposition 187, the other 
endorsements of candidates and since the election a begrudging acceptance of 
the Republican victories. 
</P>
<P>
 But nowhere is this bias more evident, or more intellectually dishonest than 
the choice of Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio to review "Strange 
Justice," by Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone's memory is extremely short, or decidedly suspect. Totenberg is the 
original journalist who broke the Anita Hill allegations against Justice 
Clarence Thomas, with the undeniable help from the staffs of either Senator 
Metzenbaum, or Senator Simon, or both. Throughout the hearings, my memory is 
that Totenberg was a continued apologist for the lies put forth by Hill, on the 
various television programs she was on.

 Regarding Frans B.M. de Waal's review of "The Monkey Wars" by Deborah Blum 
("Please Don't Feed the Extremists," Nov. 20): 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to advise Times' readers and people everywhere to use their 
critical judgment when reading about animal experimentation because $10 billion 
of taxpayers' money is what funds a great deal of this animal research. It is 
fascinating to see the consistency with which letters of support for such 
research are written by researchers -- people making their living by doing 
animal research. De Waal is in no position to be objective while he defends his 
federal funding and his salary. If animal research has benefited anyone at all 
it certainly has benefited career researchers. You do the math, we're talking 
$10 billion and our health system hasn't made a dent in the top 10 causes of 
death. Why? Because they are largely preventable and very few federal dollars 
are earmarked for prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 The two most widely used measures of health are longevity and infant mortality 
and by either criterion our nation ranks nearly last among developed countries. 
This is not surprising given our devotion to expensive high-tech intervention 
instead of basic prevention. We can understand why a person whose life was 
prolonged by high-tech treatment feels that biomedical research is vital but 
the fact is that headline-making breakthroughs have little impact on the health 
of the nation as a whole. Most premature deaths are not due to a lack of 
high-tech methods but to a lack of basic prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Making medical progress is not the same as improving human health. According 
to government statistics from the U.S. Public Health Service lifestyle is the 
most important factor that determines health; second is the environment; third 
is genetics; and only fourth important is medical intervention (which is the 
practical application of research). We cannot improve health and reduce costs 
by investing in the least important determinant of health. We must invest in 
prevention for which we already have enough knowledge to prevent most disease 
and injury. If we are not willing to make a serious commitment to prevention 
using the information we now have amassing more scientific data will not help. 
And if we are not willing, why not? 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of our health care system must be to improve human health, to produce 
the greatest health benefit for the greatest number of people; any contrary 
goal would imply that one person or group is more important than another person 
or group which is not tolerable in our society. We can undeniably save more 
lives through prevention than through medical intervention -- they may be 
different lives but they are just as important. It is not that we don't care 
about those whose only hope is clinical research; it is that we do care about 
the much larger number of people who are being lost to utterly preventable 
illnesses and injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are we funding maternal deprivation studies in monkeys when we are not 
funding day care centers for children? Why are we making cocaine addicts out of 
dogs and cats while people are being turned away from mental health and drug 
rehabilitation centers? Why are we crash testing dogs and pigs in car accident 
studies while we delay air bag laws and close trauma care centers? The list 
goes on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 As is well-known, federal funds are not unlimited. Every dollar spent on 
animal research takes money away from programs that help people. 
</P>

 Calling opponents extremists is effective rhetoric, since the term connotes 
violent and unreasonable fanatics. But the fact remains that "extreme" 
positions are sometimes correct. In the era of slavery, abolitionists were the 
extremists, while "voices of reason" would urge only moderate reforms such as 
keeping slave families intact. The "extremist" had the better grasp of the 
fundamental wrongness of slavery -- and, one can plausibly argue, so it is with 
the antivivisectionist. Moreover, most abolitionists do not rely on "yelling" 
or violence, as De Waal intimates; they seek change through 
consciousness-raising and legislation.

 Researcher De Waal, in his self-serving review of "The Monkey Wars" (Book 
Review, Nov. 20), tells us that primates are similar to humans thereby making 
them valuable research models. On the other hand, it's OK to experiment on them 
because they are not like us. Animal experimenters have had it both ways for 
too long. The fact remains that despite billions of dollars and the death of 
millions of animals, the major diseases are still with us.

 The "Marvin's Room" company at the Tiffany Theatre will probably never forget 
last weekend. First, on Friday, the star-studded audience included Hillary 
Rodham Clinton and the Secret Service. Then, on Sunday, at what was to have 
been the final performance, a neighborhood power outage forced the show to go 
on in semi-darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 The excitement began two days before the First Lady's visit with the arrival 
of the Secret Service. The agents gave the Tiffany, a Sunset Strip complex with 
two 99-seat halls, "a complete exam," said Tiffany owner Paula Holt. They also 
did background checks on the theater employees -- though not on the cast, said 
Holt. Of course, one of the cast members was well known to the Clintons -- 
co-star Mary Steenburgen is a friend and was the draw for Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Holt had invited a number of Hollywood celebrities to Friday's performance -- 
"it makes it more comfortable if she's not the only celebrity in the room" -- 
and most showed up. "The phone rang all week long (prior to the show) from 
people insisting they were terribly important" and wanted seats that night, 
Holt said. The other audience members were invited by the cast and crew, she 
said, so everyone was known to someone with the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret Service agents were stationed around the perimeter of the hall, at each 
end of Mrs. Clinton's row, directly behind her, backstage at entrances to the 
stage, in the lobby and in the parking lot. A Secret Service dog sniffed for 
explosives before the show began and remained nearby. Several other dogs helped 
patrol the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, how was the play? Could anyone actually concentrate on it? 
Holt said the audience was very attentive, and a Secret Service agent later 
told her he "really enjoyed it." No, the members of the delegation from 
Washington didn't buy their tickets. "It was our pleasure to have them not pay 
for their seats," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fortunate that all this took place on Dec. 2 instead of Dec. 4. A half 
hour before the final scheduled performance of the play last Sunday evening, 
the power went out, leaving emergency lights on only in the lobby and above the 
audience section of the hall. The cast immediately agreed to reassemble five 
days later for a make-up performance and offered anyone in the audience 
(including Cher) a chance to come back then. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that not everyone would be free five days later, the cast also 
decided to try to perform Sunday night despite the blackout. Fifteen 
flashlights were found for backstage use, a boom box was recruited to handle 
the sound cues, director Dennis Erdman announced selected lighting cues, and 
three-fourths of the audience stayed (not including Cher), Holt said. Because 
of the emergency house lights, the audience was more fully lit than the cast -- 
who performed closer to the audience than usual. "You could hear the language 
very clearly," Holt said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, almost as if on cue, the emergency lights went out at the end of act 
one. At that point, it became too dangerous to go on, so the makeshift 
performance ended. Escorted by flashlights, the audience left, greeted by a 
largely darkened Sunset Boulevard.

ON THE RECORD: A WELCOME SCHUMANN REVIVAL; A SPATE OF NEW RECORDINGS RANGE FROM 
THE COMPOSER'S ORIGINAL SYMPHONIC INTENTIONS TO SHOSTAKOVICH'S BIZARRE VERSION 
OF THE CELLO CONCERTO. 
</P>

 Schumann's four symphonies periodically enter and leave the field of vision of 
conductors with clout. At the moment, the symphonies are out, which makes 
welcome their revival on recordings -- from which they have been equally absent 
of late -- especially when we're allowed to hear the notes of these much 
doctored and questionably improved scores pretty much as the composer himself 
set them down. 
</P>
<P>
 First out of the chute with the Urtext editions of all four is the 
period-instrument Hanover Band of London, conducted by Roy Goodman (RCA Victor 
61931, two CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 There is some marvelous stuff here, including the first (1841) version of the 
Fourth Symphony cleanly, clearly executed. The original Fourth is a tighter, 
more risk-taking creation than the composer's own, putatively corrected version 
of a decade later, which has been in the orchestral canon all these years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hanoverians, hardly the most elegant of ensembles in previous recorded 
outings, do themselves proud here (and indeed throughout the set) with playing 
of admirable crispness and sufficient breadth under Goodman's energetic 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Schumann's most daring orchestral writing and biggest tunes occur in 
the Second Symphony, and while we might want a bit more suggestiveness in the 
glorious slow movement, there is compensation in the clarity of delivery by 
Goodman's relatively small forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of the present "Spring" Symphony is, again, in Goodman's 
faithfulness to the composer's wishes. When there are instances of thick 
orchestration, they are mitigated not by re-orchestrating but by thoughtful 
re-balancing of the existing forces. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "Manfred" Overture is one of Schumann's most familiar orchestral works. 
But what is it an overture to? To a melodrama -- a free mixture of spoken 
declamation (here there is singing too) against an instrumental background -- 
in this instance, a German-language adaptation of Lord Byron's dramatic poem of 
the same name, whose eponymous hero is the quintessential Romantic outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 The score is rarely heard beyond the overture, which is understandable, not 
because of any subsequent lack of quality but because of its awkward form. It's 
a work that might have been born to be recorded but seldom has been. The two 
recent CD releases (esoterica come in pairs these days) deserve the adventurous 
listener's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The spoken title role is delivered with brooding grandeur by Klausjurgen 
Wussow for conductor Gerd Albrecht, who leads the Berlin Radio Symphony (Koch 
Schwann 10892), and with more extrovert intensity by Jorg Gudzuhn for conductor 
Michael Schonwandt, whose orchestra is the (formerly East) Berlin Symphony 
(Kontrapunkt 32181). 
</P>
<P>
 Both editions, which differ somewhat in the texts employed, amply convey the 
score's alternations of dramatic thunder and evocative lyricism, with the 
composer's imagination working on all cylinders in at least half a dozen 
numbers beside the overture. 
</P>
<P>
 The sung solo vocal portions are delivered by pleasing young voices in both, 
and the choruses -- the most subtle the composer created -- are in sensitive 
hands as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Why Kontrapunkt chose to play the overture as postlude as well is not 
explained. Whether or not this was Schumann's idea -- in context it makes no 
dramatic sense -- this repetition is a function the listener could have 
accomplished at a touch of a button, permitting a lesser-known Schumann 
overture or two to be included. 
</P>
<P>
 And now for something completely weird: Dmitri Shostakovich's orchestration -- 
with piccolo and harp, yet -- of the Schumann Cello Concerto, gone one, um, 
better in a new Deutsche Grammophon release (439 890). Gidon Kremer, the 
present soloist, has had the inspiration of grafting onto Shostakovich's 
aberration a recently discovered arrangement for violin (supposedly by Schumann 
himself) of the cello solo. Read that again. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is the first, and probably last, recording of this foul hybrid, Kremer 
plays with ferocious intensity and a good deal of quavery tone. His accomplices 
are the Boston Symphony conducted by Seiji Ozawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The coupling finds the same forces performing Shostakovich's neglected Second 
Violin Concerto. Some of its pained lyricism is captured here, but to 
experience the full force of this elusive music, apply to David Oistrakh, its 
dedicatee, and conductor Kiril Kondrashin (Russian Disc 11 025).*

 For its 39th summer season, Santa Fe Opera will offer its traditional mix of 
the new, recent, novel and standard: the world premiere of David Lang's "Modern 
Painters," with libretto by music critic Manuela Hoelterhoff; new productions 
of Kalman's "Countess Maritza" and Richard Strauss' "Salome"; and revivals of 
Mozart's "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Puccini's "La Fanciulla del West." 
</P>
<P>
 "Modern Painters," based on the life of English art critic John Ruskin, is the 
Los Angeles-born Lang's first opera.Conducted by George Manahan, it will 
receive three performances, July 29-Aug. 11, with a cast including Francois Le 
Roux, Ann Panagulias and Jeffrey Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe debutants Gwynne Geyer,, Kevin Anderson and Kenn Chester are 
principals in "Countess Maritza." Moving up (or down?) to the role of the Count 
in "Nozze" is baritone Rodney Gilfry -- who has sung Figaro in both Rossini's 
and Mozart's operas -- for nine performances, July 1-Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the late-spring season of Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, its 20th 
birthday season, promises two world premieres plus new productions of Haydn's 
"Armida" and Offenbach's "La Belle Helene," and a revival of Puccini's "Tosca," 
which opens the season, May 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Paulus' "The Woman at Otowi Crossing" is the third full-length opera 
the American composer has created for the Saint Louis company. 
</P>
<P>
 Cary John Franklin, OTSL's chorus master, is the composer of the new, 
company-commissioned young-people's opera "The Thunder of Horses," to be given 
its premiere June 10. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ravinia Festival, the 60th summer of concerts at the Highland Park, 
Ill., summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, coincides with the 
departure of music director James Levine and the assumption of that title by 
another celebrated conductor-pianist, Christoph Eschenbach.*

ART NOTES; CAILLEBOTTE A LACMA COUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Muchnic, Suzanne Muchnic is The Times' art writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a piece of fancy footwork that amounts to a coup, the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art has landed a major retrospective of works by French Impressionist 
Gustave Caillebotte. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition of about 90 paintings and 30 drawings by a keen observer of 
late 19th-Century Paris is scheduled to appear at the museum from June 23 
through Sept. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The show -- jointly organized by the Musee d'Orsay in Paris and the Art 
Institute of Chicago -- was a big event in Paris this fall when it premiered at 
the Grand Palais. Chicago was originally intended to be the only U.S. venue for 
Caillebotte (from Feb. 18 through May 28), but the itinerary has been extended 
to include Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good news for us," says LACMA curator J. Patrice Marandel. "The show was 
highly successful in Paris. We have every reason to think it will do as well in 
Chicago, and we should have a great attendance in Los Angeles, where there is a 
lot of interest in Impressionism." 
</P>
<P>
 Caillebotte's work is relatively little-known apart from his 1877 masterpiece 
"Rue de Paris: temps de pluie," a wide-angle street scene populated by elegant 
Parisians strolling under umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marandel expects the artist to find an appreciative audience in Los 
Angeles: "I think it's a good moment for Caillebotte. He is a very direct 
painter, very matter of fact, and I think people are receptive to that now." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Marandel looks forward to the June event, he heaves a sigh of 
relief over a narrowly averted disaster. Welcome as the Caillebotte show may 
be, it is a last-minute substitution for a long-planned exhibition that fell 
apart when loans of key works could not be secured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you exactly what happened," Marandel says, launching into a tale 
about the frustrations of organizing major international exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject in this case was "Cezanne and Pissarro: An Impressionist 
Collaboration," a joint project of LACMA, the Musee d'Orsay and the Royal 
Academy in London. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition was conceived as a comparison of works by the two artists, 
Marandel says. But loans were very difficult to get, he says, and indeed some 
became impossible. The premise of the show depended on drawing parallels 
between specific pieces, so substitutions wouldn't do. The project finally had 
to be abandoned, adding scheduling chaos to disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution for Marandel came when he visited the Caillebotte show in Paris 
and noticed that it was scheduled to close in Chicago exactly a month before 
"Cezanne and Pissarro" was to have opened at LACMA. Although other American 
museums had requested the Caillebotte retrospective, Marandel prevailed on his 
French colleagues who had been working with him on "Cezanne and Pissarro" to 
help bring it to Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Caillebotte (1848-94) was fascinated with modern life in Paris and often made 
the city his subject, depicting its architecture, bridges, boulevards and 
workers in dramatically receding space. He was also an important collector who 
used a considerable portion of his inherited fortune to buy the work of his 
better-known contemporaries -- Monet, Renoir, Pissarro, Sisley, Cezanne, Degas 
and Manet -- which he donated to the French government. 
</P>
<P>
 Four paintings by Caillebotte were shown at LACMA in 1984 in "A Day in the 
Country," one of the most popular exhibitions in the museum's history. All 
those works, including "Le Pont d'Argenteuil," will return in June, along with 
dozens of others that have never been exhibited here. Highlights include a 
luminous painting of three men scraping paint off a wood floor, from the Musee 
d'Orsay's collection, and "Rue de Paris: temps de pluie," a prized possession 
of the Art Institute of Chicago.

 EYE ON ANTIQUITIES: The J. Paul Getty Museum's lecture series on an exhibition 
of the Lawrence and Barbara Fleischman antiquities collection winds up Thursday 
at 8 p.m. with "The Collector's Eye: Connoisseurship in the Fleischman 
Collection," by Maxwell L. Anderson, director of the Michael C. Carlos Museum 
at Emory University in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "My talk will be a look at some of the finest works in the Fleischman 
collection, leavened with contemporary commentary on the place of classical art 
in an increasingly divisive intellectual climate," Anderson says. "I'll be 
navigating between the shock waves of multiculturalism and archeological 
reductivism," he adds, referring to debates about the hegemony of European 
culture and the propriety of collecting antiquities. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the lecture is free, but reservations are required: (310) 
458-2003.

 REMEMBERING BETTY: "The Art Cup," a memorial exhibition and sale in honor of 
Los Angeles art patron and collector Betty Asher, is at the Garth Clark 
Gallery, 170 S. La Brea Ave., through Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher was a pioneering collector of Pop art, but she was probably best known 
for her cup collection -- a huge cache of artist-made cups, most of which she 
donated to LACMA. Asher invited artists she admired to contribute original 
cups, as well as paintings and photographs of cups, to the current exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 She died on May 11 while the show was still in the works, but the gallery has 
completed her plans in a presentation of works by 57 artists.

 Warm and charming while sacrificing neither its integrity nor its point of 
view, this British film, released in the United States earlier this year, 
covers considerable personal and political territory without overreaching or 
condescending. Moreover, it never forgets to have fun.The debut film of 
director and co-writer Gurinder Chadha, it is the seriocomic story of a day 
trip to the seaside resort of Blackpool by several generations of Indian women 
living in Birmingham, England. The film's title comes from an only-in-England 
snack derived from a traditional Indian dish. The film's focal characters, each 
with her own romantic problem, are Ginder (Kim Vithana, center, with Amer Chada 
Patel, who plays her son, and Shaheen Khan, who plays her pal Simi) and Hashida 
(Sarita Khajuria) (Cinemax Wednesday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

 Neil Simon's play had a melancholy undertow, and Mercedes Ruehl and Irene 
Worth, who each won Tonys for their performances on Broadway, bring out its 
full, racking sadness under Martha Coolidge's 1993 film direction.Ruehl plays a 
womanly child whose will is stunted by Worth, her ogre of a mother. It's the 
summer of 1942, and Ruehl's recently widowed brother (Jack Laufer) deposits his 
two sons (Mike Damus, left, and Brad Stoll) with his unaccommodating mother. 
The atmosphere inside their Yonkers apartment over their candy shop is thick 
with dreams. A major dreamer is Ruehl's other brother (Richard Dreyfuss, 
right), a petty hoodlum hiding out there for a time (Cinemax Thursday at 8 
p.m.). Peter Rainer

POP EYE: RANCID DEPARTURE LEAVES BAD TASTE; EPITAPH RECORDS' BRETT GUREWITZ 
HOPES THERE WON'T BE MORE DEFECTIONS FROM HIS BOUTIQUE OPERATION TO MAJOR 
LABELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brett Gurewitz, who gained attention in punk-rock circles as a member of Bad 
Religion, should be celebrating these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Epitaph Records -- the label he founded in the early '80s as a way to showcase 
the kind of independent music that major labels weren't interested in -- has 
come up with one of the year's biggest rock hits: the Offspring's album 
"Smash," which has been in the national Top 10 for months. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gurewitz is nervous that success may ultimately write the label's own 
epitaph. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Offspring hasn't left the label yet, the group's growing sales have 
caused major labels to comb the company's roster in hopes of finding another 
Offspring and dangling a big-bucks deal in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
 And his fears have been realized: Rancid, a Bay Area band whose debut album on 
Epitaph has sold more than 100,000 copies, has just been signed by giant Epic 
Records after aggressive courting by Epic A&R executive Michael Goldstone, who 
also signed Pearl Jam and Rage Against the Machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were pilfered," says Gurewitz, calling this the first defection from the 
Epitaph "family" in the company's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancid manager Jeff Saltzman says that the decision to leave Epitaph was 
entirely the band's. In fact, he adds, the group nearly turned down Epic's huge 
offer -- as well as similar ones by several other major labels -- to stay with 
the independent company. Ultimately, though, it was simply "the right time to 
move," Saltzman says. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what has Gurewitz baffled and angry. He says his company was formed to 
give custom service and total artistic freedom to young acts, hoping to 
demonstrate that it's possible for bands to thrive outside the record industry 
corporate structure. 
</P>
<P>
 He's now hoping the Rancid move doesn't trigger a rash of defections. 
</P>
<P>
 Other indie labels have protected themselves by working out distribution and 
development deals with major labels -- the latest being Sub Pop, the Seattle 
company that launched Nirvana, which has just been bought in part by the Warner 
Music Group for a reported $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gurewitz remains adamant that he will not enter into any such arrangement, 
since it's his very independence from the majors that makes him attractive to 
many young punk bands in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know everyone's happy here, but that's what I would have said 
about Rancid a month ago," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The real wild card in the move: Jeff Saltzman and his partner Elliot Cahn also 
manage Epitaph act Pennywise and are the Offspring's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the pair -- who also manage Bay Area punk band Green Day -- are 
forming their own Oakland-based label, 510 Records, with a major-label 
distribution deal in the works. That could put them in direct competition with 
Epitaph for bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Saltzman would not discuss details of Rancid's Epic deal, but he hopes to put 
Gurewitz's mind at ease about future dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no intent of taking other bands away from Epitaph," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Offspring's manager, Jim Guerinot, is reportedly near to 
scoring his own deal for a major-distributed label.

 UNPLUGGED HOLE: Courtney Love is set to turn down the decibels when her band 
Hole tapes an "MTV Unplugged" episode in February. This will be joined by a 
separate taping of the Cranberries in an acoustic setting for the next crop of 
installments in the MTV series. But don't look for extravagant productions a la 
the recent Robert Plant/Jimmy Page "Unledded" and Eagles "Hell Freezes Over" 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'Unledded' and Eagles shows are clearly 'Unplugged'-inspired, but not 
sort of what you might call traditional 'Unpluggeds,' " says Doug Herzog, MTV 
senior vice president of programming. "We can get pretty parochial about that. 
We want to keep the idea of people just coming in and doing their songs in this 
setting." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Herzog says that MTV is looking for ways to keep the show "evolving." 
Among things being considered for next year are multi-artist Christmas and 
reggae specials. Steve Hochman

 Sade's "Best Of" is the hottest of this season's greatest hits collections, 
placing No. 5 on the Times' Southern California pop album chart and No. 18 
nationally. What's remarkable is that it doesn't offer any new material as an 
extra lure to buyers.

 ENGLAND SWINGS: "The world's greatest rock 'n' roll band" is preparing to 
conquer new territory. The Rolling Stones, having broken their own U.S. concert 
tour box-office record, are exploring the possibility of having concerts next 
summer or fall in Moscow, Istanbul and even Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "On this tour, the Stones are very keen to play unusual places and places that 
they've never been to before," says the group's British spokesman Bernard 
Doherty. "For instance, they've never played in South America, and they're 
going there in February." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been rumors that the Beijing concert would be a free show in the 
infamous Tian An Men Square, but Doherty says that is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also talk of a "Voodoo Lounge" tour documentary film. Crews have been 
shooting footage of both performances and backstage scenes. Dave Jennings, from

CRITIC'S PICK: 'SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kenneth Turan 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This splendid 1993 release is set in the world of chess, but it wouldn't be a 
fraction of the film it is if chess were all it is about. It is a story of 
childhood simultaneously exalted and at risk, of the demands of parenthood and 
the burdens of competition and of genius.It is also the most impressive and 
promising of directing debuts on the part of writer Stephen Zaillian, who won 
an Oscar for his adaptation of Thomas Keneally's "Schindler's List." "Bobby 
Fischer" tells what happens when a typical New York City kid (Max Pomeranc, 
pictured), who has dreams of playing second base for the Yankees, discovers 
that he has so much innate chess ability that he puts people in mind of that 
celebrated world champion of the film's title. Remarkably photographed by 
Conrad Hall (Cinemax Friday at 8 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

RETRO; SEPARATING DWAYNE FROM DOBIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though I have played many different characters and led many different 
lives, when people hear the name Dwayne Hickman, only one thing comes to mind. 
So, rather than fight it, I have decided to just go with it and enjoy it 
because it seems no matter where I go or what I do, for the rest of my life 
I'll be ... Forever Dobie." 
</P>
<P>
 -- from "Forever Dobie: The Many Lives of Dwayne Hickman," by Dwayne Hickman 
and Joan Roberts Hickman 
</P>
<P>
 When couch potatoes think of Dwayne Hickman, the image that usually pops into 
their minds is Dobie Gillis talking to the audience while sitting in front of 
Rodin's statue "The Thinker." 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman became part of pop culture playing the typical girl-crazy teen in the 
1958-63 comedy series "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis." Audiences adored the 
zany escapades of Dobie; his good friend, the far-out beatnik Maynard G. Krebs 
(Bob Denver), and Zelda Gilroy (Sheila James Kuehl, recently elected to 
Congress), the rather plain teen-ager who wanted to marry Dobie. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman's "'The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis" was introduced to a new generation 
recently when Nick at Nite aired the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman's new anecdote-laden autobiography "Forever Dobie: The Many Lives of 
Dwayne Hickman" (Birch Lance Press, $20), which he co-wrote with his wife, Joan 
Roberts Hickman, fans will discover there's a lot more to the actor than Dobie 
Gillis. In fact, he's almost had as many lives as a cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman, 60, the younger brother of actor Darryl Hickman, began his career 54 
years ago as an extra in the John Ford classic "The Grapes of Wrath." 
</P>
<P>
 "I started as a 6-year-old," says Hickman, who comes across just as nice as 
Dobie Gillis. "I think I worked two days. I know I made $21. I don't remember 
it very well. My brother had a big role in that, he played one of the Joads. I 
was always growing up around the studios." 
</P>
<P>
 In the '50s he became a teen idol, thanks to his roles as Chuck in the sitcom 
"The Bob Cummings Show" and his debut as "Dobie Gillis." In his book, Hickman 
writes about his hilarious and disastrous attempts to become a singer during 
those days. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Dobie" left the air, Hickman segued into motion pictures, appearing in 
"Cat Ballou" and low-budget A.I.P. flicks such as "Ski Party." When roles began 
to dwindle in the '70s, Hickman gave up acting and managed a Las Vegas resort; 
he also spent several years as a CBS executive. Recently, he's been a director 
and has written scripts with his third wife, Joan. Hickman, who has a 
30-year-old son, is also the proud dad of a 2-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman was approached about two years ago to write a book on "Dobie Gillis." 
He turned down the offer. "First of all, everybody was writing 'tell all' 
books," he recalls. "I didn't have anything to tell. There is nothing all that 
exciting. Not that my life is dull, but if I did have juicy details to tell I 
would be embarrassed for myself and maybe the other people would be 
embarrassed. I really didn't want to write a book about 'Dobie Gillis.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The agent then told Hickman the publishers wanted an autobiography. "I said, 
'OK. Let me talk to Joan.' I didn't know if I could write a book myself. I am 
really not that great a writer. I really depended on Joan. She is my secret 
weapon. I didn't want to work with a ghost writer or a person who comes and 
interviews you. I think those biographies are missing something. I don't think 
they really reflect the viewpoint of the person." 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you ever read any of David Niven's books?" asks Joan Roberts Hickman. 
"That's what we had in mind because I remember years ago reading 'The Moon Is a 
Balloon' and thinking this is so fun. This guy tells great stories. I wanted to 
give a feeling, the same feeling I have about Dwayne, that this is a really 
nice man, that you would be lucky if you got to know him." 
</P>
<P>
 And Hickman does have plenty of stories to tell, such as the time he 
accidentally used John Wayne's dressing room on the set of the 1944 movie "Tall 
in the Saddle"; his ill-fated attempt to ask Tuesday Weld, who played the 
beautiful Thalia on "Dobie Gillis," out on a date; his working relationship 
with the rather quirky Bob Cummings, and why the network dyed his hair blond 
for the first season of "Dobie." 
</P>
<P>
 "We just sat upstairs while Albert (his 2-year-old) took his naps and we 
literally wrote it," Hickman says. "Joan would kind of interview me and talk 
about things. When we first started on the project, I thought, 'How will I ever 
remember everything?' But it's funny. The little bits and pieces begin to come 
back. It was a real labor of love. It took forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman also talks about the state of television today in his book, laying out 
his opinion that TV was superior in the '50s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like I'm prejudiced to the old days, but each show had its own 
individual personality. Today it is, like, all the same. There is so much input 
from the networks and studios. The scripts on 'Dobie' and on 'Bob Cummings' 
were tight. They had been thought about and worked on. Changes were really 
minor. A staff of 12 writers (today) is often not as good as one writer."

 What do you get movie buffs for Christmas who think they've seen everything? A 
gift with a lot of extras. This season, video companies are featuring lavish 
gift sets of popular films with added attractions: restored prints, soundtrack 
CDs, stills, documentaries, posters and scripts.  
</P>
<P>
 Below is a select overview of the special editions currently available for the 
discerning film fan.  
</P>
<P>
 White Christmas Collector's Edition (Paramount Home Video, $60): This special 
edition of the 1954 holiday favorite contains goodies for fans of the Irving 
Berlin musical, which stars Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Rosemary Clooney and Vera 
Ellen. The set features the beautifully remastered letterboxed version of the 
movie. (Only the pan-and-scan scan version is available separately.) Also 
included on the video are the original and re-release trailers. Exclusive to 
the edition is a compact disc of the original soundtrack. There's also a copy 
of Clooney's personal script, a brochure with behind-the-scenes photos (with 
Clooney's personal captions), a still and a note penned by Clooney. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast at Tiffany's Collector's Edition (Paramount Home Video, $60): This 
deluxe set should thrill fans of Audrey Hepburn. The edition features a 
digitally remastered letterboxed video of the 1961 comedy-drama complete with 
the trailer. Also included is the CD of Henry Mancini's Oscar-winning score; a 
copy of Hepburn's own script with her handwritten notes; three stills; director 
Blake Edwards' remembrances of Hepburn; a brochure featuring Hepburn's personal 
note to Mancini, as well as remembrances from the late Mancini. 
</P>
<P>
 My Fair Lady: The 30th Anniversary Collector's Limited Edition (CBS Video, $80 
and $25): This "Lady" has never looked so good. The 1964 Oscar-winning musical, 
starring Rex Harrison and Audrey Hepburn, went through a major face lift this 
year when it was discovered that the original negative was in horrendous 
condition. CBS Video is offering two collector's editions of the restored 
version: The $25 set features the video in the inferior pan-and-scan format, 
the original theatrical trailer, a fun 1964 promotional film and CBS News 
footage of the 1964 premiere. The impressive $80 deluxe box set features the 
trailer, promo film and premiere footage along with the gorgeous letterboxed 
version of the film. A separate video documentary hosted by "Lady" co-star 
Jeremy Brett illustrates how the film was restored and features rare footage of 
Hepburn singing two numbers. Other delights are a limited imprint of six 
original sketches of Cecil Beaton's Oscar-winning costume designs, 
one-of-a-kind 70mm film frames struck from the original negative and a book 
about the production by Beaton. There's also a mail-in offer for the poster. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Entertainment III Deluxe Collector's Edition (MGM/UA Home Video, $100): 
This handsomely packaged set features the director's cut of the 1994 release, 
which includes eight extra minutes of footage. Also included is a video 
documentary complete with interviews with such MGM greats as Gene Kelly and 
Esther Williams and nine musical numbers that had been deleted from various MGM 
films. Eight full-color lobby cards, a souvenir program and a soundtrack CD 
round out the edition. There's also a mail-in offer for two separate posters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ultimate Oz (MGM/UA Home Video, $100): Fans of the 1939 classic receive 
the restored version of the Technicolor musical with a digitally remastered 
soundtrack created from the earliest generation audio elements. Also included 
is the 1990 documentary "The Wonderful Wizard of Oz: The Making of the Movie 
Classic." Angela Lansbury hosts the special that contains interviews with the 
cast and creators, the theatrical trailer, outtake footage and unused musical 
sequences. The edition features the original continuity script and five stills 
from the film. There's also a mail-in offer for the poster. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Me in St. Louis -- 50th Anniversary Edition (MGM/UA Home Video, $30): 
Celebrate the 50th birthday of the delightful Judy Garland musical with a 
digitally remastered version of the Technicolor film. Included on the video is 
a "making of" documentary narrated by Roddy McDowall, the 1955 reissue trailer 
and the deleted musical number, "Boys and Girls Like You and Me." Also featured 
is the CD soundtrack, which is not available in record stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegfeld Follies -- Collector's Edition (MGM/UA Home Video, $30): This 1946 
MGM musical extravaganza looks splendid, having been restored from original 
Technicolor elements. The set features the CD of the soundtrack, which is not 
available in record stores, and includes several songs excised from the final 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Dances With Wolves: Limited Collector's Edition (Orion Home Video, $80): The 
deluxe edition of Kevin Costner's Oscar-winning 1990 epic Western is nearly an 
hour longer than the theatrical version and features never-before-seen footage 
that expands several plot points, plus the never-before-released 22-minute 
companion video "The Making of 'Dances With Wolves,' " the book "Dances With 
Wolves: The Illustrated Story of the Epic" and six color lobby cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs Deluxe Collector's Video Edition (Walt Disney 
Home Video, $90): Kids and their parents should love this special set, which 
includes the restored version of the 1937 animated classic; an entertaining 
"making of" documentary, which includes scenes not in the final version; a 
special hardcover collector's book, "Walt Disney's Show White and the Seven 
Dwarfs & the Making of the Classic Film"; and 10 limited-edition lithographs of 
the original theatrical posters.

</P>
<P>
 Listen to these two reissues in chronological order -- collectively, they 
cover the years 1941 to 1965 -- and you witness the remarkable growth of a 
truly gifted jazz artist who evolves from prodigious, semi-ingenue to a mature, 
commanding performer fully capable of handling any sort of material. 
</P>
<P>
 The first CD of the two-CD Decca set finds Fitzgerald sounding particularly 
girlish and innocent -- her voice is bright and narrow, as one would expect 
from someone in her early-to-mid '20s. Still, she brings a remarkable sense of 
candor and believability to such tear-at-your-heart numbers as "Jim," "You 
Don't Know What Love Is" and "That Old Feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Though most of the 42 selections on "The War Years" are slow and -- despite 
Fitzgerald's consistently first-rate performances -- forgettable, there are 
also numerous medium and up-tempo numbers that show off her dynamic capacity 
for swinging and, occasionally, scat singing. The latter skill is deftly 
depicted on two versions of what became her theme song, "How High the Moon," a 
bustling version of "Flying Home," and "Lady Be Good," where she imitates both 
Lester Young and bassist Slam Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 She's in good company, too, backed by Bob Haggart's band, teaming up with 
Louis Armstrong, Louis Jordan and the Ink Spots. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Fitzgerald first records for Verve in 1956, her voice exhibits 
impressive grain and timbral color, and her renditions reveal depth and canny 
maturity. These 16 tracks, culled from the three-CD "First Lady of Song," offer 
wide variety as she sings mostly evergreens with orchestras led by Count Basie, 
Duke Ellington, Nelson Riddle and Buddy Bregman and then moves into combos and 
duets with the likes of Herb Ellis, Oscar Peterson, et al. 
</P>
<P>
 Here highlights abound. "Just a Sittin' and a Rockin' " finds Fitzgerald 
working with the wondrous wall of sound that was the Ellington band. The 
succulent "Can't We Be Friends" and the boisterous 'I Won't Dance" are both 
done with Armstrong, whose voice seems to split in two: a guttural bottom and 
breathy, resonant top. "Detour Ahead," with co-composer Ellis, is especially 
poignant. A few numbers, like "Swinging Shepherd Blues," are hardly gems. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, these packages together make for an insightful introduction into this 
jazz giant. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to four stars (excellent).

 If you or someone on your holiday gift list is a reader more than a viewer -- 
or, more likely here, likes to read about what they've been viewing -- there 
are plenty of choices in bookstores this year: Memoirs 
</P>
<P>
 "Back to the Batcave" by Adam West with Jeff Rovin (Berkeley, $12): Pow! Zam! 
Zowie! The star of the '60s cult series "Batman" unmasks behind-the-scene 
stories in this book that West states in the intro is "not the memories of an 
aging actor. ... This is a book for the many loyal Batfans who have asked for 
it." Included are candid photos and a complete episode guide. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the Stars: The Autobiography of George Takei, 'Star Trek's' Mr. Sulu" by 
George Takei (Pocket Books, $22): The Asian American actor, who came to fame as 
Sulu on another '60s cult series, "Star Trek," relates his journey from 
childhood in a World War II internment camp in Arkansas to his stint on "Star 
Trek." In it he discusses his feelings about William Shatner, who played Capt. 
James T. Kirk, and goes over his career in politics at local and national 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beyond Uhura: 'Star Trek' and Other Memories" by Nichelle Nichols (G.P. 
Putnam's Sons, $23): "Star Trek's" Lieutenant Uhura writes about being the 
first African American actress to have a major role in a dramatic TV series, 
offers up behind-the-scenes scoops on the series -- including her relationship 
with "Star Trek" creator Gene Roddenberry -- and her feelings about William 
Shatner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tinker in Television: From General Sarnoff to General Electric" by Grant 
Tinker and Bud Rukeyser (Simon & Schuster, $23): Acclaimed memoir and insider's 
look at the medium by the television executive who founded MTM Enterprises with 
then-wife Mary Tyler Moore and, as chairman of NBC, transformed the last-place 
network into a first-place proud peacock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just Farr Fun" by Jamie Farr with Robert Blair Kaiser (Eubanks/Donizetti 
Inc., $22): Farr is the first "MASH" regular to pen his memoirs. The actor, who 
donned the most outrageous outfits as the Section 8-seeking Cpl. Maxwell 
Klinger, discusses his Lebanese American upbringing; his big movie break in 
Richard Brooks' 1955 classic, "The Blackboard Jungle"; his family; his warm 
memories of 'MASH," and his typecasting woes after the series ended. The book 
concludes with Farr making his Broadway debut this year in the musical "Guys 
and Dolls." 
</P>
<P>
 "Forever Dobie: The Many Lives of Dwayne Hickman" by Dwayne Hickman and Joan 
Roberts Hickman (Birch Lane Press, $20): The personable star of the popular 
sitcoms "'The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis" and "The Bob Cummings Show" has 
penned a breezy autobiography. (Hickman discusses writing the book, Page 79.)  
</P>
<P>
 "Love, Alice: My Life as a Honeymooner" by Audrey Meadows with Joe Daley 
(Crown, $22): Fans of "The Honeymooners" needn't fret that Meadows, who played 
Alice Kramden on the series, has written a kiss-and-tell book. She writes with 
love and affection about her years playing Alice opposite Jackie Gleason's 
Ralph Kramden. In fact, Meadows states on the jacket that the book is a "love 
letter to my television husband Ralph Kramden (a.k.a. Jackie Gleason) in 
recollection of grand, rare, nutsy days and nights when 'The Honeymooners' was 
America's Saturday night ritual." Miscellaneous 
</P>
<P>
 "Please Stand By: A Prehistory of Television" by Michael Ritchie (The Overlook 
Press, $24): The director of such lauded films as "The Candidate," "Smile" and 
"The Positively True Adventures of the Alleged Texas Cheerleader-Murdering Mom" 
penned this amusing, informative account of the very early days of television. 
The book covers the history of TV from 1920 to '48 and offers such historical 
trivia as Eddie Albert being paid $5 for his TV debut in 1936. The book also 
includes 100 vintage photographs chronicling TV's infancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Smart Parent's Guide to Kids' TV" by Dr. Milton Chen (KQED Books & Tapes, 
$9): Mr. Rogers himself, Fred Rogers, penned the afterword of this guide, which 
offers parents practical techniques and strategies to control the type of 
programs and amount of TV children watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "How to Talk to Anyone, Anytime, Anywhere: The Secrets of Good Conversation" 
by Larry King with Brad Gilbert (Crown Publishers, $20): The talkmeister, who 
has chatted with the likes of Marlon Brando and Ross Perot on his live CNN 
series, shares his secrets on how to communicate confidently and effectively. 
Tributes 
</P>
<P>
 "The Official 'Dick Van Dyke Show' Book" by Vince Waldron with a foreword by 
Dick Van Dyke (Hyperion, $15): Oh, Robbbbb! Fans of the 1961-66 sitcom classic 
should enjoy this in-depth look at the Emmy-winning comedy series. The book 
features a guide to all 158 episodes, a who's-who of characters, candid 
photographs, anecdotes and new interviews with members of the show's original 
cast: Dick Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Carl Reiner, Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie 
and Larry Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Saturday Night Live': The First Twenty Years," edited by Michael Cader with 
photographs by Edie Baskin (Cader Books, $25): It's hard to believe NBC's 
irreverent late-night variety show is celebrating its 20th season this year. 
This amply illustrated history follows the format of the show, beginning with 
"cold openings," followed by cast and guest-host introductions and interviews. 
The book also features summaries of each sketch, an overview of the series' 
commercial parodies, a roundup of all the musical acts ever to appear and a 
look at world events as seen through the skewered sensibilities of "Weekend 
Update."

 OK, so you just got this big, imposing multimedia computer that was supposed 
to cut your workload in half. 
</P>
<P>
 And it did. Now what are you going to do with the extra time? 
</P>
<P>
 Play a game? Sure. There are thousands, almost every one an effective time 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Log on to cyberspace? Yes, indeed. CompuServ, Prodigy, America Online and 
lesser-known services provide colorful new electronic definitions of the town 
square. And pushing on through to the Internet literally opens up the world via 
your computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But suppose you're a music fan, and what you really want is to get more in 
touch with jazz or rock or classical music? No problem. CD-ROM is the medium 
that can take you there. With increasing momentum in 1994, music of every sort 
has begun to appear on CD-ROMs. Here's a sampling of what's available, with 
prices generally from $29.95 to $79.95: Classical 
</P>
<P>
 As far back as 1990, the Voyager Co. produced an interactive look at 
Beethoven. That title was the pathfinder for what has become Microsoft's 
growing Multimedia Music Series. The collection now includes "Mozart: The 
Dissonant Quartet," "Stravinsky: The Rite of Spring," "Schubert: The Trout 
Quintet" and "Beethoven: The Ninth Symphony." 
</P>
<P>
 Each title could easily serve as a music student's tutorial, with combinations 
of graphics, sound and text that describe, in illuminating detail, structural 
aspects of the music. But this is not dull, didactic stuff. At any given point, 
the listener has the opportunity to click on to an instant musical illustration 
of, say, the unusual harmonies that open the Mozart quartet or the feral 
rhythms of the Stravinsky work. Another mouse click describes different 
instruments (with audio examples), and another provides illustrated 
biographical information. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a potentially far greater array of sounds in "Microsoft Musical 
Instruments," which examines more than 200 instruments from around the world, 
as well as several dozen different musical assemblages. The disc is structured 
into four sections: "Families of Instruments," "Instruments of the World," 
"Musical Ensembles" and "A-Z of Instruments." Ever wonder what a zampogna is? 
Or a pipa ? Wonder no more. A few quick mouse clicks will provide full-color 
pictures and audio examples of, respectively, an Italian bagpipe and a Chinese 
lute. 
</P>
<P>
 Opera buffs are well-served by "The Viking Opera Guide" (Penguin Books/Attica 
Cybernetics). More than three hours of musical excerpts and the complete text 
of a 1,300-page opera reference book are packed into this disc. The excerpted 
performances are more informative than remarkable, but the inclusion of a 
timeline, a world map and a search facility that permits inquiries on title, 
librettist, composer and so forth makes the guide an invaluable tool for even 
the casual opera listener. Pop 
</P>
<P>
 The hits are coming fast, from Voyager's CD-ROM rendering of the Beatles' "A 
Hard Day's Night" (which includes the complete movie, with uncut scenes and an 
original script) to more recent showcase outings by Peter Gabriel, David Bowie 
and Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel's "Xplora 1: Peter Gabriel's Secret World" (Interplay Productions) has 
only been available for Macintosh computers since its release earlier this 
year. A Windows version, expected in January, will make the pioneering 
collection of videos, biographical material and interactive sessions available 
to a much larger audience. Typically, "Xplora 1" reflects Gabriel's thoughtful 
approach to his music. It sets a high pop music standard for the imaginative 
integration of sound, music and data in interactive media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jump: The David Bowie Interactive CD-ROM" (ION) fascinates primarily for the 
opportunity it provides to play around with new video and audio mixes of the 
title tune. Other segments contain interview clips with Bowie, while the 
primary interactivity involves video game-like movements through 3-D hallways, 
rooms and so forth, accompanied by not especially interesting visual effects. 
Not exactly up to the level one might have expected from an artist who would 
appear to be a natural for the far-reaching creative potential of CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince's "Interactive" (Graphix Zone) takes the form of a game, in which the 
viewer has various tasks -- like collecting jewels -- to do before moving on to 
the next one. Along the way, there are opportunities to sing-along, karaoke 
style, with KISS, to play a video-clip card game, do song mixes, check out 
interviews with Little Richard and Eric Clapton and take a close look at the 
Purple One's wardrobe. It's all good fun and, like the Gabriel CD-ROM, a model 
of interactive media production. 
</P>
<P>
 Other pop-oriented CD-ROMs include: "Heart: 20 Years of Rock & Roll" (New CD 
Music Show), a huge collage of videos, interviews, songs and photos that 
sometimes entertains and sometimes offers far more than one could ever care to 
know about the veteran rock group; "Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace and Music, 25th 
Anniversary" (Time Warner Interactive), yet another tour through the 
now-venerable and already overchronicled event, with documentary footage, 
videos, retrospective interviews from performers such as John Sebastian and 
eight tunes from Janis Joplin, the Who, Richie Havens, et al.; "Grammy Awards 
CD-ROM" (Media Vision), which includes video clips of award performances, 
backstage footage and a database of Grammy info. Jazz, World Music 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz: A Multimedia History" (Compton's New Media), released in 1992, was an 
early and moderately successful effort to provide a pictures-and-sound overview 
of the art. It features brief visual clips of Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, 
Ella Fitzgerald and others, as well as a rare segment of a performance by 
Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. Discography and bio sections include some 
point-and-click highlighting of names and terms that generate popup 
explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton also is distributing three similar collections devoted to the work of 
individual performers: "Jazz Series: Louis Armstrong, Count Basie, Billie 
Holiday." Each takes a similar tack via the use of text slides, video and sound 
clips and bio and discographical databases. There are, in addition, as many as 
a dozen straight-ahead audio tracks. Nothing is especially fancy, and the 
production does not remotely approach the high-powered interactivity of the pop 
CD-ROMs listed above, but the combination of informative data and entertaining 
audio and video makes for useful additions to anyone's jazz library. 
</P>
<P>
 "World Beat" (Medio Multimedia) is a generally excellent survey of world 
music, with one serious flaw. An interactive video segment, complete with 
narrative voice-over, includes point-and-click opportunities to hear a variety 
of musical sounds and styles. Another, text-oriented segment contains essays 
examining various world musics, and a third adds the complete data from the 
discographical "All-Music Guide." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, so good. But Medio falters with a "music studio" in which four-bar 
clips of such styles as rai , soca , and calypso are notated on screen; minimal 
mixing and editing opportunities are provided and the output can be exported to 
a MIDI device. Unfortunately, the sounds heard by the average listener are 
generated by the computer's sound card, not by the CD. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that the quality of what you hear will be determined totally by the 
quality of the sound card in your computer. Not a wise decision by Medio, 
compounded by the fact that, in the review copy, the music studio's metronome 
pointing device was consistently late by at least one full beat.*

 Since reality programming is popular with adults, it shouldn't come as a 
surprise that the latest trend in children's video seems to be "factual and 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Diana Huss-Green says, and she should know. As editor of Parents' 
Choice magazine, she watches a lot of children's video; each year the magazine 
selects the best.

 Fantasy, on the other hand, is on the "out" list. "The trend is also 
nonviolent," Huss-Green says from her Boston office. "Pre-school and school-age 
youngsters are interested in factual shows that go beyond their homes, 
incorporate nature, and family films that don't drip sugar." 
</P>
<P>
 With Parents' Choice highlighting documentaries about garbage collecting and 
puppies, it's clear that what intrigues children are things adults take for 
granted. As Huss-Green puts it: "Everything with wheels, wings or paws is in ." 
</P>
<P>
 Videos can make good gifts. And while the obvious choices may be such popular 
fare as "Snow White" (Walt Disney Home Video, $22) and "The Flintstones" (MCA 
Universal Home Video, $20), there are plenty of other new releases. Here are 
some suggestions, with help from Parents' Choice. For smaller labels, 
mail-order phone numbers are included. Ages 2 and Up  
</P>
<P>
 Disney Sing Along Songs: The Twelve Days of Christmas; Disney Sing Along 
Songs: The Lion King Circle of Life (Buena Vista Home Video, $13 each): "Twelve 
Days" offers Mickey, Minnie, Donald and friends in a live-action holiday 
songfest. "Circle" features songs from the hit feature. 
</P>
<P>
 Muppet Classic Theater (Jim Henson Video, $20): The Muppets' first 
direct-to-video offering has six versions of classic fairy tales, including 
"Rumpelstiltskin," "The Emperor's New Clothes" and "Three Little Pigs." 
</P>
<P>
 Puppy Love (ABC Video, $10): This video of purebred puppies at play can teach 
children the different breeds since each puppy is given such easily 
identifiable names as Dotty the Dalmatian, Benny the Beagle and Gerry the 
German Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow White (Sony Wonder, $15): Not the Disney version, but it is the classic 
fairy tale. It's part of the "Enchanted Tales" series, which happens to include 
a "Lion King"-ish The Jungle King. Ages 3-8 
</P>
<P>
 Aladdin and the Magic Lamp (Rabbit Ears, (800) 800-EARS, $10): Huss-Green -- 
who'll tout the movie on next Sunday's "Today" show -- dubs this "like no other 
'Aladdin' you've ever seen. It's much closer to the original story of 'A 
Thousand and One Nights.' He's a real rogue to whom things happen exclusively 
by chance. He's not a nice boy and doesn't become one until he loses the lamp, 
and then it becomes spiritual." 
</P>
<P>
 The Big City Construction Video for Kids! (Pelzer Productions, (800) 836-8742, 
$16): Powerful machines build skyscrapers, workers hoist a million-pound 
foundation over a highway, and kids are fascinated. A Parents' Choice 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brave Frog (Hemdale, $15): In this animated tale, an ambitious tree frog 
struggles for acceptance in Rainbow Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbage Day! (ChildVision Films, (800) 488-1913, $15): Who thought that refuse 
could be so interesting? The small video company that put out this movie did, 
and found that children are fascinated not only by the big trucks but by 
disposing and recycling. A Parents' Choice recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Linnea in Monet's Garden (First Run Features, $20): "The best fantasy," says 
Huss-Green, who adds that parents shouldn't consider this video 
gender-specific, even though it's about a girl's visit to Claude Monet. She 
also cites a dearth of good fantasies, with the exception of this title and 
"Aladdin and the Magic Lamp." 
</P>
<P>
 The Secret Garden (ABC Video, $17): This animated video version of the 
much-told tale, which aired on ABC last month, offers added footage. Honor 
Blackman (Pussy Galore in "Goldfinger") and Derek Jacobi lends their voices. 
Ages 8 and Up  
</P>
<P>
 Black Beauty (Warner, $25): Anna Sewell's much-loved tale is told from the 
horse's perspective in this Parents' Choice recommendation. Milton Chen, author 
of "The Smart Parent's Guide to KIDS' TV," suggests that parents consider 
videos, like this one, that come with companion books. Another among this 
season's offerings is "Little Women" (see below). 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy Hitter and the Hawaiian Slammers (DIC/Toon-Time, $13): This action tale, 
based on the ancient Hawaiian legend of round tablets, comes just in time to 
cash in on the pog craze and doles out a little history of the game in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Into the West (Buena Vista Home Video, $20): This tale, set in Ireland, tells 
of a magical horse and the two abandoned boys it helps. Gabriel Byrne and Ellen 
Barkin star in this Parents' Choice recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Women (CBS Fox Video, $20): Can't wait until Christmas Day for the 
upcoming feature version with Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon? Check out this 
1970 BBC adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's 1867 novel of family love, recently 
re-released by CBS Fox Video and the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
 The Littlest Viking (Hemdale, $20): Life's not easy for a 12-year-old Viking 
prince. This live-action movie is set against the scenic fiords of Scandinavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Temple Movies (Fox-Video, $15): The mop-top's latest colorized 
releases -- "The Littlest Rebel," "Wee Willie Winkle" and "Susannah of the 
Mounties" -- offer pluckiness personified. 
</P>
<P>
 Ren & Stimpy: Classics II (Sony Wonder/Nickelodeon, $15): The further 
adventures of the asthmatic hound and his happy-go-lucky kitty sidekick also 
come in gift packages featuring a squishy Ren toy and a "we-dare-you-to-hug-it" 
holiday-bedecked Stimpy (both $20). 
</P>
<P>
 X-Men 'Till Death Do Us Part: Parts 1 and 2 (PolyGram Video, $10 each):

IMMACULATE MISCONCEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I object to the insulting, anti-Christian tone of art critic Christopher 
Knight's review of illuminated manuscripts ("They're Still Glowing," Dec. 4). 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks about Fra Angelico's portrayal of the Annunciation, Knight 
compared the virginal conception of Jesus to the plot of "Jurassic Park." I am 
at a complete loss to understand why Calendar would subject its Christian 
readers to this snide affront to our Lord and our faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Knight demonstrates that he has not done his homework, thus compounding his 
sin, by his misuse of the term Immaculate Conception. The Immaculate Conception 
refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, who was preserved from all stain of original 
sin from the moment of her conception in her mother's womb. (The Annunciation 
describes the archangel Gabriel asking Mary to consent to becoming the Mother 
of God while maintaining her virginity, as recorded in Luke 1:26-38.) 
</P>
<P>
 If there's anything worse than a bigot, it's an intellectually lazy bigot.

<P>
 Christopher Knight stands corrected. The angel Gabriel did whisper to Mary 
that she would bear the heaven-sent Messiah -- and that occurrence is called 
the Incarnation. 
</P>
<P>
 Immaculate Conception relates to Mary's birth (as child of Joachim and Anne). 
Mary, because of her future calling, was privileged to be born without the 
stain of original sin (disobedience to God), which we are all marked with on 
entrance into the world. (Stain removed by baptism.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing "hard to swallow," Chris. Just a matter of "facts."

</P>
<P>
 From the point of view of Mary, it's known as the Annunciation; from the point 
of view of Jesus Christ, the same incident is his Incarnation (taking human 
flesh) in the womb of Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 This dual event is commemorated morning, noon and evening by praying the 
Angelus, from the first words of Luke's account: "In the sixth month (of 
Elizabeth's pregnancy with John the Baptist) the angel Gabriel was sent from 
God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth."

 Regarding "The Watchdog Is on the Case," by Donald Liebenson (Dec. 4): Tim 
Lucas has some kind of nerve getting on Rhino Home Video's case because it 
released videos of horror movies with a lot of commentary by the lovely and 
talented Elvira. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't he see that the Mistress of the Dark is the main reason people buy these 
videos? As far as I'm concerned, Elvira can talk through the entire movie and 
I'd love every second of it!

<P>
 Will this senseless Elvira-bashing ever end?

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reading your cover story on Michael Douglas ("Who Said Romance Was Dead?" by 
Michael Walker, Dec. 4) reminded me of an experience when I was an executive in 
charge of talent of the feature division of CBS Theatrical, Cinema Center 
Films. 
</P>
<P>
 I attended a production of "Desire Under the Elms" at UC Santa Barbara.A young 
actor, Michael Douglas, played the lead. Impressed with his talent, I gave him 
a card and told him to call me when he returned to L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 I had no idea who this young actor was when we decided to test him for the 
1969 film "Hail, Hero!" It was then that he told me who his father was, but I 
was sworn to secrecy. Michael's position was that if he were cast in the film, 
it would be because of his talent, not his namesake. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, the director of "Hero" was David Miller, who had directed Kirk 
in "Lonely Are the Brave" years earlier. In viewing the tests, David kept 
remarking how familiar the young actor looked. It was not until the decision 
was made to cast Michael that I told them about his father.

DECADE OF WARS CLAIMS LIVES OF 1.5 MILLION CHILDREN WORLDWIDE; VIOLENCE: GLOBAL 
CONFLICTS TAKE HEAVY TOLL ON THE MOST DEFENSELESS. YOUNG SURVIVORS FACE 
SHATTERED LIVES, LOSS OF INNOCENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From the battlefields of Bosnia to the killing fields of Cambodia and Rwanda, 
more than 1.5 million children around the world have been killed by wars over 
the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The millions who survive face an often uncaring world that cannot cope with 
their wounded hearts and shattered lives. 
</P>
<P>
 They cry out for parents who are dead or missing, for homes that have been 
blasted into rubble, for stolen childhoods filled with gunfire instead of 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammed Ajmal, 12, was trying to forget Afghanistan's civil war and indulge 
in one of the joys of childhood -- flying a kite -- when a rocket exploded in 
the yard of his house in Kabul, ripping his chest with shrapnel. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a month, he has lain in the Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital, 
which was hit by 62 rockets this year. There is no chest surgeon and his family 
has no money to go abroad for an operation. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nejra Sprzo was 15, her mother put her, her brother and five cousins on a 
bus from Sarajevo, Bosnia, to Zagreb, Croatia, where their grandmother lives. 
Her mother promised Nejra they would be back in a week and she would get a new 
dress. That was more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, when telephone lines to Sarajevo were finally restored, Nejra told 
her mother: "Mummy, I'm not your little girl anymore. Don't worry about us. We 
learned how to take care of ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Beata Uwimana, 11, is one of an estimated 100,000 Rwandan children who are 
separated from their families. The youngest of six children, she lost her 
parents and five brothers and sisters in the chaos at the Rwanda-Zaire border 
when 1 million Rwandans fled the civil war in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Nyirandenzi, 29, found Beata wandering on a road near Goma, a Zairian 
border town, and took her to the Mugunga Refugee Camp to share a tiny hut with 
her two children. Shyly, Beata said she wants to return to school -- but most 
of all she wants to find out if any of her family survived the cholera epidemic 
that killed an estimated 50,000 refugees in the Goma camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine out of 10 casualties of war are civilians, and children are very often 
the main casualties," said Mike Aaronson, overseas director for the relief 
group Save the Children. 
</P>
<P>
 Four million children have been disabled, maimed, blinded or brain-damaged in 
over 100 conflicts during the past decade, the group said in a recent report, 
"Children at War." Twelve million have lost their homes. Five million are 
living in refugee camps. One million are separated from their families. 
</P>
<P>
 During rebel sieges of cities in Angola, relief agencies were so flooded with 
starving children that only the severely malnourished -- "those a step away 
from death," said Ronald Fourcaud of Doctors Without Borders -- could be given 
a bowl of corn meal a day. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7,000 children live on their own on the streets of Angola's capital, 
Luanda, scrounging for food and falling prey to drugs, sexual abuse and 
disease. "We're seeing 14-year-olds turning up with gonorrhea," said Barbara 
Reynolds, an official with UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
 In Afghanistan, where children have one of the world's lowest literacy rates 
and most schools are closed, many youngsters take terrible risks to survive. 
Some have taken on adult jobs at metalwork shops. But running food and other 
supplies across the front lines is the main way to make money in besieged 
Kabul, and up to 3,000 people, many young boys, risk their lives daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am always afraid of the rockets and mortars, but my father does not make 
enough to feed the family," said Shiralam, 13. He works with his friend, Aziz, 
12, so they can carry more on their bicycle, which was laden with a huge bag of 
flour. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiralam can make the equivalent of $2 a day. His ambition is to go back to 
school, but if he had more money he would like to buy a kite and move his 
family somewhere safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Afghan teen-agers become soldiers, and most military checkpoints around 
Kabul are manned by illiterate youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Child soldiers have been reported in 35 countries over the last decade. 
Estimates put the number at more than 200,000, including thousands of girls. 
</P>
<P>
 In Liberia, UNICEF estimates 6,000 children under age 15 are among the 60,000 
combatants in the 5-year-old civil war. They are used as cooks, front-line 
soldiers, executioners and spies. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups say most of Liberia's child soldiers were forced into 
combat roles. The rebel groups deny that, claiming they help youngsters by 
giving them meals, clothes and protection, but children tell of being flogged, 
raped, drugged and tortured to ensure obedience. 
</P>
<P>
 Magne Raundalen, a child psychologist who is president of the Norwegian UNICEF 
Committee and has been visiting war zones for 10 years, said children in 
southern Sudan are traumatized by long separations from their families. 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, at least 20,000 Sudanese youngsters have trekked long distances 
across the vast African nation to escape fighting. Lions and crocodiles 
devoured some. Bombs and bullets killed others. Many starved to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Gideon Gatpan Thoar, one of the Sudanese wanderers now in a refugee camp in 
northern Kenya, said in a book written for UNICEF that he saw people killed and 
heard the sound of guns constantly. "When I am asleep, they come into my head 
like a dream or cinema. That is my suffering," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Children estimates 250,000 children have died because of the war in 
southern Sudan since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Raundalen said victims of land mines in Angola "may be the most traumatized 
children I've seen all over the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenness is a key element in trauma, and those children were suddenly 
wounded and handicapped for life, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of them were numb or paralyzed. When you talked to them, they said, 'I 
feel nothing.' This numbness masks all the horror," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Save the Children, 1 million people have been killed by land 
mines in the past decade, many of them children who are more vulnerable because 
of their size and curiosity. Afghanistan, Angola and Cambodia have the most 
land mines and highest casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediha Imamovic, a psychiatrist who works at the Doctors Without Borders 
guidance center in Sarajevo, said every child in the Bosnian capital is 
traumatized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our children have suddenly grown up. They became adults too soon; they began 
thinking only in terms of reality. The war overshadowed or completely destroyed 
their imagination," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what they would like, children in Sarajevo never say chocolate, 
nice toys or clothes, she said. They want to survive, to have heating and 
something to eat at home, and not to become invalids. They fear sniper bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rwanda, countless thousands of children were among the half-million or more 
victims of genocide. Some children, assumed by their attackers to be dead from 
machete wounds, survived for days in a pile of corpses before being found. The 
Red Cross has registered 32,000 children who are either lost or orphaned. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many, many infants. Someone just found them and carried them where 
they are and we can't get any information about where they came from," said 
Sarah Hill of Save the Children in Rwanda's capital, Kigali. "Some children 
come unable to talk about what they experienced. Others can't speak or have 
gone mad or are confused." 
</P>
<P>
 In most countries at war, children name one or two close family members who 
have died, but many Rwandan children can name 20 close family members who were 
slain, said Raundalen, the UNICEF psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was worse was that 56% of the 207 children we interviewed in Nyamata had 
seen children participate in the killings . . . and 42% had seen children 
killing children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UNICEF's Reynolds said it is impossible to help most of the estimated 1.5 
million Angolan children traumatized by years of combat because many have fled 
to the bush. Some of those she has seen are withdrawn into stupor, others into 
hyperactive aggressiveness and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children in almost every major Angolan city have been subjected to weeks of 
artillery bombardment, seen their parents killed, watched a sibling starve to 
death," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping the children of war takes time and training, Raundalen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who have lost trust in the adult world need to know "there is a last 
father left, the international community," he said. They must be allowed to 
unburden their grief, and those who are alone need "kind adults who can 
represent stability and continuity and commitment to the child." 
</P>
<P>
 In dealing with Iraqi children after the Gulf War, Raundalen told Muslim 
religious leaders to urge parents to put their children on their laps and tell 
all their worries and bad memories to Allah. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get feedback that now the children are sleeping better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Imamovic, the psychiatrist in Sarajevo, said she talks to children and has 
them draw about their experiences and hopes.

BOLIVIA PLANS 'ECOLOGICAL TOURISM' PARK; WILDERNESS: RAIN FOREST IS HOME TO 
HUNDREDS OF BIRD SPECIES, DOZENS OF ORCHID VARIETIES, CROCODILES, RIVER OTTERS 
AND DOLPHINS.

<P>
 The government is teaming up with private investors to build a program of 
"ecological tourism" it hopes will bring in $1 billion a year. An important 
part of the plan is this huge wilderness park, the size of West Virginia, 
carved out of a remote area on the border with Brazil in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 During a boat trip on the Guapore River, through dense rain forest, a group of 
environmental scientists and other visitors saw 60 species of birds, dozens of 
types of orchids, crocodiles, river otters and dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, named for a Bolivian scientist murdered by drug traffickers in 1986, 
contains more than 500 species of birds, as many as all North America, said Guy 
Cox, a British ornithologist studying at Louisiana State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox is investigating the effects of logging in adjacent areas on the bird 
population. The project is financed by the Nature Conservancy of Arlington, 
Va., and the Parks in Peril program of the U.S. Agency for International 
Development.

 "Bolivia is among the countries with the most diversity in the world, with 
over 40% of the bird species of South America found within its boundaries," Cox 
said, following a macaw through his binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the park fly from Santa Cruz across nearly 400 miles of farmland 
and forests to a camp run by the Friends of Nature Foundation, founded in 1989 
to preserve Bolivian wilderness areas and open them to scientists and limited 
tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation, also financed by the Nature Conservancy and USAID, built the 
comfortable Flor de Oro base camp on the Guapore, which forms part of the 
frontier with Brazil. It also has trained forest rangers and established trails 
and campsites in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 One function of the rangers is to keep out Brazilian loggers who used to cross 
the Guapore and cut down precious mahogany trees, and drug gangs who once had 
cocaine labs in the park. Kempff was killed when he landed at an airstrip 
controlled by traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This park has become an ecological buffer zone," said Hermes Justiniano, a 
nature photographer who directs the foundation. On the Brazilian side of the 
river, the rain forest has been virtually obliterated by loggers and settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists supported by the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York, the 
U.S. National Academy of Sciences and Conservation International in Washington, 
D.C., are studying wildlife in the park. Species include jaguars, tapir, deer, 
maned wolves, spider and howler monkeys, giant anteaters, turtles, piranhas and 
the endangered river otter. 
</P>
<P>
 Five scientists from the University of Nottingham, England, have identified 65 
river otters in the park, out of a global population estimated at 1,000. "This 
places the park as a vital stronghold to one of the world's most endangered 
mammal species," the Friends of Nature Foundation said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 For the tourism development program in national parks, "the government will 
provide the basic infrastructure needed for tourism while the private sector 
will provide the basic services," said Ricardo Rojas, secretary of tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to attract at least $300 million of foreign investment by 1997 and 
generate $1 billion a year in foreign exchange -- equal to Bolivia's current 
legal export earnings -- within a decade. Fewer than 400 people visited the 
Noel Kempff park in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have come to realize that Bolivia has great cultural traditions and a 
pristine and diverse environment to offer visitors," Rojas said. "We must now 
develop the services needed to attract foreign visitors." 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasized the need to protect the wilderness areas, as did Justiniano of 
the Friends of Nature Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first role of the national park is the conservation of natural diversity, 
and second any other activity such as tourism" Justiniano said on a trip to two 
spectacular waterfalls reachable only by a day-long boat trip and another day 
of trekking through the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 No signs of civilization are visible from the falls. Of 1993's visitors to 
Noel Kempff, only about 40 reached the second waterfall, which plunges 200 feet 
down a rock face, creating a rainbow at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Justiniano said his foundation is developing a master plan for the park and 
hopes for 1,000 visitors in 1995, but that the most it can handle each year 
without damage is about 2,000. "The greatest danger is the deterioration of 
ecologically fragile areas," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another foundation project is developing programs to help the few people who 
live in or on the edges of the park, descendants of workers brought in as 
rubber tappers in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 After the development of synthetic rubber, the tappers were thrown out of work 
and turned to hunting. Now, their children and grandchildren want to be tour 
guides and park rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "For communities near the parks, the income generated by ecotourism can grow 
in importance," Justiniano said. "You cannot preserve a park without taking 
into consideration the people who live around it." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation and foreign donors are supporting efforts to triple the size of 
Noel Kempff park, which would make it one of the largest protected wilderness 
areas in South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most international donors realize that Bolivia has a small population density 
and the potential of setting aside land for biodiversity and protected areas," 
said Gary Hunniset, an environmental expert for the World Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "That potential for rational development and preservation is hard to find in 
many places."

NO NEED TO HIDE IN A CLOSET IN THAILAND; SOUTHEAST ASIA: ONE IN EVERY 60 PEOPLE 
IS HOMOSEXUAL, AND ACCEPTED FOR IT. IN THE OPEN SPIRIT, A FLOWER TOWN IS BEING 
BUILT TO ACCOMMODATE THEM.

 Nestled in the lush mountains of central Thailand, a luxury town of karaoke 
bars, cafes, health clubs, swimming pools and massage parlors is being built 
for 2,000 gay men. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's first all-gay village is being promoted in a slick brochure with 
glossy pictures of handsome men dancing close, resting their heads on each 
other's laps beside a swimming pool and gazing romantically over the mountains 
with their arms around each other. 
</P>
<P>
 With 70% of the 800 luxury homes already sold, the $32-million project is to 
open next year as Flower Town. 
</P>
<P>
 And not a single protest has been lodged. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other countries, gays have to fight for what they need," said project 
owner Dejdeow Srichai, a 33-year-old homosexual. "But in Thailand, gays can do 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, gays are widely tolerated here. They are called "flowers" because, as 
Dejdeow says, gays are "clean, lovely, fresh, beautiful and refined." They make 
no attempt to hide their feminine mannerisms, whether they perform as 
waitresses and salesmen, or even in such high-profile jobs as businessmen and 
professors. 
</P>
<P>
 Seri Wongmonta, one of Thailand's most outspoken gays, confirms that while 
there is some pressure on those in politics and the military to be more 
discreet about their homosexuality, there is no social pressure here against 
being gay. And thus, he says, no need for a gay movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Seri works for advertising and public relations firms, as a marketing 
consultant, professor, radio and television host, and columnist. "I've been 
accepted in all these fields," he said. "They don't mind me being what I am. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not that open," while living in the United States in recent years, he 
said. "In America, when you are too open, people reject you." In Thailand, he 
says, gays are more likely to be pitied. 
</P>
<P>
 The devoutly Buddhist Thais believe people are homosexuals, lesbians, 
transvestites or heterosexuals because of their karma. They generally don't 
judge them for being different but attribute it to actions in their past lives. 
It is simply their fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with AIDS reaching epidemic proportions in parts of Thailand, there has 
been no backlash against gays who often bear the brunt of the blame for the 
fatal disease in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kongsak Boonyamwong, an effusively effeminate cashier at a major department 
store, says he had no trouble getting a job in Thailand despite his behavior 
and looks. He wears his black, shiny hair just below his ears and brushes 
powder across his cheeks and black pencil over his arched eyebrows before going 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never try to hide," said the girlish-looking 24-year-old. "I like to act 
like a woman. I like to have long hair. I like to walk like a woman. I have 
practiced for a long time until it comes naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody appears to object. "I don't care about being served by gays," said 
Paweenaa Rodmanee, an 18-year-old university student just outside the store. 
"They are the same as me -- human." 
</P>
<P>
 Transvestite beauty contests are held at village fairs and major festivals, 
where they are taken very seriously. And gays, lesbians and transvestites are 
common in Thai soap operas, with the sexual orientation of the actors or 
actresses often having no direct bearing on the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be a woman since kindergarten," said Chanchai Triwachirangkoon, a 
21-year-old cabaret dancer. "My parents said to me, 'Whatever you want to be -- 
a man or a woman -- go ahead. Just be a good person.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He had breast-implant surgery several months ago and is planning another 
sex-change operation in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Thailand, so many men want to be women," he said. "It's fashionable." 
</P>
<P>
 Wanlop Piyamanotham, a lecturer on sex at Srinakharinwirot University, says 
that is because they are treated well by everyone. Thai men like gays because 
they don't have to compete with them for women and Thai women like them because 
they are less domineering than typical Thai men and show more respect for 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 He says a study of gays in Thailand several years ago established there were 
more than 1 million homosexuals in a country of about 60 million people -- 
which he says is one of the highest rates in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarawut Thammee, a graceful, 25-year-old with smooth skin and long, black 
hair, has larger features than most Thai women but, nevertheless it would be 
hard to recognize him as a man. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pierced ears, wears lace bras and panties, and otherwise dresses like a 
woman. Sarawut even goes so far as to use women's restrooms, noting that, "No 
one pays much attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarawut, who likes to be called Sue, has taken hormones to develop his tiny 
breasts and shapely hips so that on-stage as a cabaret dancer, in his skimpy 
gold-sequined outfit and high-heels, he is a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarawut says that every time his father is in Bangkok, he comes to see his son 
slink around the stage as a woman to a house full of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, some adults who say they wouldn't want their sons to be 
gay, transsexual or transvestites, or their daughters to be lesbians. But many 
of them insist they would accept it if their children refused to be straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my son couldn't agree to stay as a man, I would have to accept that," said 
Wasan Thassanakrn, a 35-year-old office worker. 
</P>
<P>
 That tolerance is what Dejdeow is banking on to make his Flower Town a 
success. The project has attracted inquiries from gays across the country and 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He is busy these days picking through the stack of applications to screen out 
the most clean-cut, good-looking, courteous men to frolic in the town's 90 
acres of sculpted lawns, lakes and fountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thais are open-minded, not serious," Dejdeow said. "They respect other's 
privacy. They don't think it's a big deal."

RATINGS SOAR FOR BRAZILIAN SOAP OPERA; TELEVISION: SIX-NIGHT-A-WEEK SHOW ON THE 
NATION'S LARGEST NETWORK, TV GLOBO, WON RECORD RATINGS DURING ITS FIVE MONTHS 
ON THE AIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Spirits are rising in Brazil. Or at least their TV ratings are. 
</P>
<P>
 A blockbuster soap opera about reincarnation has brought the occult out of 
Brazil's closet. And its success suggests that the world's largest Roman 
Catholic country may be not so Catholic after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Journey," a prime-time, six-night-a-week soap on Brazil's largest 
network, TV Globo, won record ratings during its five months on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The final chapter in October was seen by more than 70 million people from the 
Amazon to the southern pampas, a whopping 90% of the people watching TV that 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers were eager to learn the fate of Alexandre, a young hoodlum who kills 
himself in prison. It is after his suicide that things really get interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexandre's spirit "wakes up" in the Valley of the Suicides, a nightmarish 
place of fire, mud and wailing souls. He shuttles back and forth to the land of 
the living to seek vengeance on his earthly enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Alexandre's sister, Dina, has a heart attack and joins him in the 
beyond. At first reluctant to accept her own death, Dina eventually tries to 
transform Alexandre into a "spirit of light" and release him from his 
purgatory. 
</P>
<P>
 In a happy ending, Alexandre joins the angelic community of evolving spirits 
and reincarnates as his brother's baby son. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic Church reacted sharply. In a commentary for the Rio newspaper 
Jornal do Brasil, Bishop Boaventura Kloppenburg condemned the doctrinal 
deviation in "The Journey." 
</P>
<P>
 "At least the TV series gave viewers a vision of an after-world. That's OK," 
Kloppenburg said in a telephone interview from his diocese in the southern city 
of Novo Hamburgo. "What's not OK is reincarnation. Church doctrine is specific 
in saying that human beings have only one life on earth." 
</P>
<P>
 But the occult has a strong pull in this country of 160 million people. 
Catholicism has long coexisted or competed with African spirit religions, 
witchcraft and European spiritualism, and now with fast-growing fundamentalist 
Protestant groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1990 survey, about 85% of Brazilians said they were Catholics. But that 
figure is highly misleading, said Andre Luis de Mello, a researcher at the 
Religion Studies Institute in Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic church attendance has fallen steadily in recent years, Mello said. 
Meanwhile, spirit cults and fundamentalist Christian churches are growing. 
</P>
<P>
 What is happening is a backlash to centuries of syncretism, or religious 
fusion, Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
 In colonial times, native Indians and African slaves were not allowed to 
practice their own religions. So they "disguised" their deities as white 
Catholic saints and feigned true conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 But when their masters went to bed, slaves would beat drums and chant in their 
Yoruba tongue invocations to the pantheon of African gods and goddesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, millions of Brazilians of all races openly practice African candomble 
or its offshoot umbanda, which incorporates elements of European spiritualism 
that took root in Brazil in the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The "pope" of spiritualism was French educator Allan Kardec. His 1857 book 
"The Book of Spirits" became a cult best seller in Brazil and the basis of a 
new religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardec believed in reincarnation and atonement in a later life for one's 
actions and sins. Death was simply a gateway, and spirits could come back and 
contact this world through mediums, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some estimates say there are more than 10 million "Kardecistas" in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello said that does not include part-time spiritualists. "Many people who 
identify themselves as Catholics go to Kardecist temples when they need to 
communicate with the supernatural," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Journey," which is based on Kardec's doctrine, sparked a boom in 
attendance at spirit temples and in the sale of books on the occult. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-selling author is Chico Xavier, who is credited with writing more than 
380 books. Xavier, 74, claims he simply puts on paper the words dictated by 
spirits. He was a consultant for "The Journey." 
</P>
<P>
 The evangelist rituals appeal to the poor with easy-to-understand language and 
high theatrics, often including on-the-spot exorcisms.

ARCHEOLOGIST RECREATES BRONZE AGE FARE; EUROPE: EVIDENCE COMES FROM GRAVES AND 
SETTLEMENT SITES OF PEOPLES WHO INHABITED THE CONTINENT FROM THE CASPIAN SEA TO 
THE ATLANTIC COAST OF SPAIN. 
</P>

<P>
 Stinging nettles aren't everyone's cup of tea, but archeologist Mike 
Corbishley says they make a pretty good soup. 
</P>
<P>
 He studies the food that Europeans ate during the Bronze Age thousands of 
years ago. He gathers the raw ingredients, cooks the dishes and eats them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nettle soup is delicious and tastes like spinach, but the bread made without 
yeast is rather bland," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An intriguing aspect of the long-ago diet is that the ingredients are still 
around. The wild plants growing in prehistoric Britain are still here, like 
nettles, sow thistle, sorrel, dandelion and lady's smock. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence about foods comes from the work of archeologists digging up graves 
and settlement sites to study the Bronze Age peoples who inhabited Europe from 
the Caspian Sea to the Atlantic coast of Spain from about 2500 BC to 700 BC. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called the Bronze Age because in that period tin and copper were widely 
alloyed to make bronze for tools, weapons, pots and jewelry. The Bronze Age 
people had no writing so all that is known about them is what comes out of the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bronze Age diet was highlighted at a conference put on in late October by 
the Council of Europe at the British Museum in London. 
</P>
<P>
 From its headquarters in Strasbourg, France, the council's cultural committee 
has begun a two-year campaign to widen knowledge of the Bronze Age because it 
sees in that period the first common pursuits of early Europeans. They had a 
network of trade routes and olive oil and wine were among the products traded 
in the later part of that era. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbishley, 50, a former teacher and archeologist, is head of education at 
English Heritage, the state body responsible for preserving historic and 
architecturally important buildings, ruins and sites. 
</P>
<P>
 "To help children to better understand the past we talk to their teachers 
about what we have discovered of daily life. The good thing about food is that 
everyone is interested in it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find seeds or fruits preserved in boggy ground, sea shells, fish and 
animal bones and clues to how meat was handled by looking at butchery 
techniques showing in the bones. The bones also show traces of cooking and 
splitting to extract marrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Corbishley said a number of recipes have survived into modern times in remote 
places like the Shetland and Orkney islands off the northern Scottish mainland 
where life is harsher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the late 20th Century people have gathered and cooked the same sorts 
of raw materials," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One recipe still in use is nettle puree, a sort of thick soup. 
</P>
<P>
 "At demonstrations people have quite a shock when they see us grab handfuls of 
stinging nettles, although we put gloves on," Corbishley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Hamilton, press officer at the British Museum, said he has tasted the 
puree. "It's very good, like soup made from lettuce, but the nettle leaves must 
be young." 
</P>
<P>
 Bronze Age bread is another story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I quite like non-yeast bread, but it wouldn't suit everyone," Corbishley 
acknowledged. "The barley gives it a strong taste." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a food made from a seaweed called laver that is spread on fried 
bread. The recipe is still used in southern Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of malnutrition has been found in Bronze Age skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
 "People living by the sea had that advantage but others inland were often more 
limited in what was available to eat," Corbishley said.

LATEST IN INCARCERATION OUTDOES ALCATRAZ; PRISONS: SUPER MAX FACILITY ABOUT TO 
OPEN IN COLORADO WILL HOUSE THE VERY WORST FEDERAL CONVICTS, THE KIND ONCE SENT 
TO ISLAND IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY. THERE'LL BE NO CODDLING HERE.

 "An uncommon level of security." That's the understated way wardens describe 
the "new Alcatraz" that soon will welcome the nation's most violent, 
incorrigible federal prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 The $60-million U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility will open in 
this southern Colorado community of 3,500 in a matter of days. It's the first 
federal prison ever built just for the most predatory inmates in the U.S. 
Bureau of Prisons. Nearly 500 of them will be sent here. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcatraz on an island in San Francisco Bay was the home of their sort in years 
past. Then a federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill., was modified for the 
purpose. Now comes Super Max. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt this is a severe program," said John Vanyur, the prison's 
associate warden. "This is not a typical prison facility. It's one of a kind. 
And it's only used for this very small number of people." 
</P>
<P>
 There are motion detectors in underground crawl spaces, 1,400 
remote-controlled sliding steel doors, cameras covering virtually every nook 
and cranny, and 12-foot chain-link fences topped with razor wire. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7-feet-by-12-feet cells could be described as Spartan. They contain a 
polished steel mirror (glass is a weapon) riveted to the solid concrete wall. 
The toilet and shower are steel and fixed to the walls, the bed is a slab of 
concrete covered with a mattress. The only other place to sit is an immovable 
concrete cylinder in front of a writing table, also concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Cells are designed so inmates cannot make eye contact with other prisoners, or 
see anything outside except the prison walls and the Colorado sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst inmates will be cell-bound 23 hours a day, five days a week. Those 
five days, they get an hour of solitary exercise in a cement-walled room; the 
other two days, they don't get any exercise, period. 
</P>
<P>
 In their cells, they will receive educational programming on a 12-inch 
black-and-white television, their meals on trays and their showers, with the 
water controlled from the outside. Inmates needing counseling from ministers or 
social workers will get it in their cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates will be sent here from Marion and other federal prisons. Prison 
officials are not allowed to discuss who will call Super Max home, but they can 
generalize. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've demonstrated through highly assaultive behavior, predatory behavior 
and escape-related behavior that they cannot function in a less-secure prison," 
said Louis Winn Jr., an executive assistant. "They've proven themselves to be 
extremely dangerous and violent." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-four percent of Marion's prisoners have committed murder or at least 
tried, Winn says. While many inmates sent to Super Max will be serving life 
sentences, it will not be their home for life. Officials expect inmates to stay 
no longer than three years before returning to the relative freedoms of 
ordinary federal prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 During their time at Super Max, they will be kept on short leashes and 
monitored constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 If inmates have to see doctors or dentists, they will walk only a couple of 
dozen paces and two correctional officers will accompany them, Winn says. One 
will walk in front with a baton, the only weapon allowed inside the prison, and 
one will walk behind, holding the chains connected to handcuffs the prisoner 
will be wearing behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates are allowed up to three paperbacks to read, but no law books (only 
copies of applicable pages) so no contraband can be smuggled. Visitors remain 
beyond inch-thick plate-glass designed to withstand hammer blows. 
</P>
<P>
 If an inmate participates in rehabilitation programs and stays out of trouble, 
his confinement can be modified so he can mingle with other inmates and visit 
the commissary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buildings are only one part of the program," Vanyur said. "The key part is 
what the staff do and how they interact. They're the ones who have to preserve 
self-esteem and humanity issues -- maintaining dignity but getting across the 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go back to the Alcatraz example. . . . You all had the same haircut, 
walked in lock-step down the hallway and didn't speak during meals. Those 
elements of dehumanization, we don't have that here. Every individual has his 
own program. Caseworkers, psychologists and chaplains are going to come down 
and deal with him." 
</P>
<P>
 But the security measures go on and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 Plumbing has automatic shut-offs so inmates cannot flood cells. Sprinklers and 
smoke containment systems are built in. Matches and cigarette lighters are 
forbidden. Smokers must use a lighter built into each cell wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Handles on toothbrushes are cut off to prevent use as weapons. Only pencil 
stubs are allowed. Pictures of spouses (no nudity) are allowed, but frames are 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Escape-minded inmates will have their hopes dashed. Between their cells and 
freedom lie seven layers of secured steel and cement. Beneath the building is a 
crawl space with no outlet, monitored by the motion detectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison is surrounded by cleared landscape, those 12-foot fences and razor 
wire, and six towers occupied by armed guards. Guy wires will be strung over 
open areas to prevent helicopter escapes. In addition, there are other security 
systems federal officers would rather not have prisoners know about and will 
not discuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's obviously a message here and the message is 'We're not going to 
tolerate your violent behavior or predatory behavior, and in fact if you change 
that behavior you eventually will get more privileges,' " Vanyur said.

8-YEAR STUDY SEEKS ROOTS OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR

 One balmy August evening, police say, 11-year-old Robert Sandifer gunned down 
a teen-ager. Days later, his own gang executed him for the heat the shooting 
generated. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the city, 16-year-old Corey Palmer -- model student, athlete and 
hospital volunteer -- eagerly prepared for another straight-A year. 
</P>
<P>
 Two poor neighborhoods, two radically different lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 A $4-million, eight-year study of 11,000 young people living in low-, middle- 
and upper-income white, black and Latino neighborhoods in Chicago aims for an 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking not only at how individuals shape their environments, but how 
their changing social and physical environments shape them," said project 
director Felton J. Earls, a child psychiatrist and professor of human behavior 
and development at Harvard University's School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no ivory tower question, according to Robert Sampson, a sociology 
professor at the University of Chicago and one of the designers of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prevention is the strategy we should be using when it comes to crime," 
Sampson said. "Current policy is after the fact. More police, more prisons. If 
we can pinpoint the causes of crime and anti-social behavior we can act to 
prevent it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods, which began in 
September, scrutinizes the lives and surroundings of its randomly chosen 
subjects, who range in age from newborn to 24. Half are male, half female. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a year, interviewers will visit the subjects, or their care givers, to 
query them on their beliefs, conflicts, influences, peer pressures, role 
models, health and relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The 52 interviewers will also examine housing in each of the 80 neighborhoods, 
along with streets, parks and recreational facilities, the condition of schools 
and such signals as the presence of crack houses or uncollected garbage and 
whether children play in the streets.

BRINGING THE INNER CITY TO WOODSTOCK; CULTURES: CHILDREN FROM A POOR, 
HIGH-CRIME NEIGHBORHOOD JOIN CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN A THRIVING COLONY OF ARTISTS, 
WRITERS, MUSICIANS AND SHOPKEEPERS IN THE LATEST CHAPTER OF AN EXPERIMENT IN 
DIVERSITY.

 When the four buses arrived at Woodstock Elementary School on a recent 
morning, they were greeted by children holding signs decorated with rainbows, 
peace signs and yin-yang symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hola," called the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Todos los ninos sonrien en la misma lenguaje" declared a banner in the main 
lobby. "All children smile in the same language." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the radiant smiles on the dark faces pressed against the bus windows 
-- children from New York City's Washington Heights neighborhood -- matched 
those on the fair ones waiting eagerly outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodstock kids and the New York City kids had corresponded, and now they 
would have a chance to spend the day together, the latest chapter in an ongoing 
experiment in multicultural learning. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, said Woodstock Principal Ronne Marantz, was to bring together 
children of different cultures so they can develop an appreciation for the 
diversity of language, customs, geography and lifestyle, not only on a global 
scale, but within their own state and nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spirit of multiculturalism really needs to be done one-on-one with kids," 
said Marantz. "It can't be experienced through textbooks." 
</P>
<P>
 The children are growing up in starkly different environments. The town of 
Woodstock, snuggled between Overlook and Ohayo mountains in the Catskills, has 
6,290 residents along winding roads lined with stone walls and woods. The 
population is mostly white, middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is on the edge of the village of Woodstock, founded as an arts 
colony in 1902 by English Utopian philosopher Ralph Whitehead. Today it's still 
a thriving colony of artists, writers, musicians and shopkeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Salome Urena Middle Academies are in a high-poverty, high-crime inner-city 
neighborhood 90 miles south of here. But while the neighborhood is poor, the 
3-year-old public school offers riches unknown to most schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,350 6th- to 8th-graders at Salome Urena choose among five academies: 
expressive arts, business, law, community service, and science and mathematics. 
The Children's Aid Society is housed within the school, providing extensive 
services. There are medical and dental clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our school is open seven days a week, and until 11 at night," said Alejandro 
Soto, a vice principal. "We have a 99% attendance rate." 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety-eight percent of the population around Salome Urena is from the 
Dominican Republic. "Many of our children are recent arrivals. They're still 
struggling with the language," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, half of the 310 pupils at Woodstock Elementary were matched as pen 
pals with 150 children from Salome Urena. The children exchanged letters and 
videos; they agreed to meet at Salome Urena to mark the feast of Santo Domingo 
in February, and to celebrate Thanksgiving in Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids bounded off the buses in baggy jeans, sweat shirts and untied sneakers. 
Many upstate children wore similar garb, but there was also evidence of the 
recent Woodstock reunion festival with plenty of tie-dyed T-shirts and faded 
overalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Pairs of pen pals gathered on the playground for recess. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play basketball better," said Daniel Curci, 11, of Woodstock. "And they 
do those clapping games." 
</P>
<P>
 Kadycha Morales, 11, and three friends were doing a complex hand-clapping 
routine to a Spanish verse. 
</P>
<P>
 "My pen pal's school is beautiful, but small," Morales said. "She lives in a 
house, I live in a building. She eats different food. We eat rice, beans, 
chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a lot alike," said Joey Carey, a fifth-grader in a tie-dyed T-shirt, 
sitting beside pen pal William Veras. "We both like sports." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful here," said Veras, a soft-spoken, bespectacled 11-year-old. 
"Nobody curses or kills each other. You can have your own house, with trees. 
You can have a dog and the landlord won't bother you." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in their classrooms, the Woodstock students gave talks about the 
mountains; about boating on the Ashokan reservoir, which supplies drinking 
water to New York City; and about the early days when nearby Kingston was the 
state's first capital. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, the children sat on the linoleum floor of the 
cafeteria-auditorium, beneath paintings of John Lennon and the Founding 
Fathers. They listened to a primary grade kazoo band playing Beethoven's Fifth, 
and a folk singer warbling peace anthems. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they stood with arms around each others' shoulders, swaying along with a 
guitar-strumming teacher as they sang "People Are a Rainbow." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so great," said Cynthia Kudren, mother of a fifth-grader. "The more 
kids learn that we're all just people, the better off we'll be."

90-YEAR-OLD WOMAN DENIED BENEFITS BECAUSE OF HER OAK COFFIN'S VALUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY MUTCHLER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Altona Brown, a 90-year-old hunter, fisherman and trapper, may die in debt 
because the U.S. government didn't consider the coffin she bought to be a 
"burial receptacle." 
</P>
<P>
 The government decided that the $2,946 oak box was a profitable asset -- like 
a house or a car -- and until she sold it, officials denied her a $30-a-month 
Supplemental Social Security income and Medicaid benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The government even wanted Brown, an Athabaskan Indian, to sell the beaded 
moccasins, skin mittens and braided rugs she made to give away as part of a 
native burial custom, said B. Jarvi, her court-appointed conservator. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown kept her coffin. But without her Medicaid benefits, she rang up $60,000 
debt at the Denali Nursing Center in Fairbanks where she lives because she is 
legally blind. Her care costs about $8,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a classic example of bureaucracy gone nuts," said Jarvi, a 
professional conservator who has been fighting the government on Brown's behalf 
since December, 1993. She waived all fees to handle Brown's case. 
</P>
<P>
 A Fairbanks newspaper columnist first detailed Brown's plight in August, and a 
public outcry followed. People called to offer help or pay for the coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska's congressional delegation stepped in and the Social Security office 
acknowledged that the coffin was a "burial receptacle," said Linda Shafer, 
assistant to U.S. Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska). 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was allowed to keep her coffin and qualify for the benefits but then 
Uncle Sam said the coffin wasn't the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The native elder also set aside $740 for a charter plane to fly her remains to 
her home village of Ruby on the banks of the Yukon River. 
</P>
<P>
 When an elder dies, the tribe holds a ceremony where stories are told about 
the deceased's life. It's at that potlatch that gifts are bestowed -- in 
Brown's case, the moccasins, mittens and rugs the government wanted to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The ticket and the casket pushed Brown over the $1,500 burial exemption limit 
allowed by Social Security officials, Jarvi said. The conservator, however, was 
able to persuade federal officials that the cost was acceptable because of her 
Indian heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Balasko, manager of the Fairbanks Social Security office, said privacy 
laws bar him from even acknowledging that Brown's case exits. 
</P>
<P>
 He said "it might sound coldhearted," but his office has a strict set of rules 
and laws and sometimes workers have to set aside their personal feelings about 
a case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not sitting here as fat bureaucrats making decisions willy-nilly that 
affect people's lives. We have to make interpretations based on the law as we 
see it," he added. "Sometimes we make mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The government has agreed to restore Brown's benefits and pay for all but two 
months in back bills, Jarvi said. That leaves Brown responsible for about 
$18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's 50 years of wilderness work does not make her eligible for regular 
Social Security. Her $30-a-month Supplemental Social Security and other monthly 
income, about $300, is applied to the debt, Jarvi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shafer and Jarvi contend that if the Social Security office dealt with the 
problem when Brown first applied for benefits in 1993, the $18,000 might not be 
an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they force you to jump in and sit on their chest before they'll even 
listen to you," Shafer said. "It was ridiculous."

SOME LUCKY CHILDREN IN BOSNIA FIND THEIR FAMILIES; OTHERS ONLY HOPE; REFUGEES: 
THE MUSLIM-CROAT TRUCE WAS A BOON TO SOME. BUT ONE 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL STILL HAS 
NO WORD, AND SITS SILENTLY, HALLUCINATING THAT HER MOTHER HAS RETURNED.

 Adisa Muratagic, 10, glanced at broken windows and a shattered wall in her 
small apartment, one of very few that survived the fighting on Bulevar Street, 
the former front line in Mostar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm home with my Mum and sister, and that's all that matters," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly a year away, Adisa is back home, where a March cease-fire between 
Muslims and Croats brought an uneasy peace between ethnic factions whose 
fighting wrecked much of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the time she was gone, she and her family feared the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 She was evacuated to Zagreb, the capital of neighboring Croatia, after her 
left arm was hit by a sniper's bullet last New Year's Eve. Then she went to a 
rehabilitation center in Krapinske Toplice, in northern Croatia, and waited in 
vain for her mother's call. 
</P>
<P>
 Adisa worried her mother, Angelina, was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But it turned out her mother simply had the wrong telephone number. Without a 
phone of her own, or contacts who could give her the right information, Adisa's 
mother could only hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I simply prayed to God that someone was taking good care of Adisa," said 
Muratagic, 32, an ethnic Croat whose Slavic Muslim husband died seven years 
before Bosnia's war began in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Mother and daughter were reunited via the International Red Cross' system for 
relaying messages through its delegates in Bosnia and 112 other countries. 
Despite the tension still gripping Mostar, and the danger of fighting erupting 
with nearby Serbs, Adisa returned home in September. 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of the fortunate children struck off a list compiled by the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees of some 2,000 "unaccompanied" children -- young 
refugees known to be separated from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, UNHCR announced "Operation Reunite," a project aimed at tracing 
what the agency estimated could be as many as 40,000 missing children. Computer 
centers were set up across former Yugoslavia and in Paris to coordinate the 
search. 
</P>
<P>
 Later calculations lowered the estimate of possible lost children to 10,000. 
But the agency does not have nearly that many names because registrations have 
been conducted in only a handful of countries and are incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 Few parents have used the centers. One problem is poor communications, like 
those that kept Adisa and her mother apart. Word of the system has not reached 
many refugees who straggled into cities from rural areas or who still live in 
the hinterlands, struggling for survival under siege or amid warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "This system will work better when peace comes, when all roads will be 
reopened and newspapers will reach all areas," said Alexandra Zivkovic of 
Unaccompanied Children in Exile, an aid group in Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 The war in Bosnia has displaced an estimated 2.1 million people from their 
homes. Thousands of parents scrambled to send their children from combat zones. 
Statistics justify their fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 17,000 children are among the 200,000 people reported killed or 
missing in the war, according to Bosnia's Muslim-led government. Some 34,500 
more children were wounded, the government says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that toll, some families have been determined to reunite as fighting 
ebbed in some areas after the Muslim-Croat cease-fire and the end to the Serb 
bombardment of besieged Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 17-year-old Nejra Sprzo and her brother, Mustafa, 16, returned to 
their battered home in government-held Sarajevo, 500 yards from the front line. 
They had left Sarajevo in April, 1992, expecting to return the following week. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than two years of safety living with their grandmother in an 
apartment in Zagreb, the teen-agers and grandmother came back. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bus service between Zagreb and Sarajevo -- which resumed after Serbs 
stopped artillery attacks on the capital -- took them only as far as Pazaric, 
about nine miles southwest of Bosnia's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Their anxious father walked out of the city, then trekked back with his 
children and a guide past Serb positions on dangerous Mt. Igman. They crawled 
through the improvised tunnel below Sarajevo airport, moving carefully and 
silently to avoid Serb fighters and U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lived two years for a return, and I don't regret it," Nejra said. "I choose 
war and a besieged city instead of peace in our refugee exile in Zagreb, but I 
feel I made the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be only for a week or two and wanted to get them out of 
the war zone, but it lasted too long," said Nejra's mother, Pehka, 39. "The 
danger is less now, so we decided it's better to share it than to be separated 
even longer." 
</P>
<P>
 The risk is high, since Nejra has yet to learn war rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two days ago, I walked through the streets, and somewhere close a mortar 
(shell) fell. Everybody started to run, but I just stood there," she said by 
telephone from her home. "I didn't feel fear; I just cannot perceive the 
danger." 
</P>
<P>
 She is only scared by the blood stains on the road to her school, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dina Hrbinic, 13, the hopeless search for her mother and the burden of 
refugee life led to a severe depression. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spring of 1992, Bosnian Serbs expelled all non-Serb inhabitants of 
Dina's native Foca, in southeastern Bosnia. Dina and her handicapped brother, 
Elvedin, 11, walked more than 40 miles with their aunt and uncle before they 
could get a bus to Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dina's mother, Magdula, was in the hospital in a part of Foca cut off by Serb 
forces. Her father died years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Dina has sent a dozen messages to parts of Bosnia where her mother 
was rumored to be. Negative answers came from everywhere, except Gorazde. No 
reply at all came from that eastern enclave isolated by Serb troops, and Dina 
clings to the possibility that her mother found refuge there. 
</P>
<P>
 Her plight caused a depression that recently hospitalized Dina for 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "She began seeing her mother's face through the window. She would run out, 
but, of course, it was just imagination," said her uncle, Zaim Aljkic. "And 
more often, she would hear her mother's voice calling her." 
</P>
<P>
 Dina lost interest in anything, became reluctant to speak, and sat for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "She never cried, she never showed her emotions, ever since we left Foca," 
Aljkic said. "She was just thinking and thinking about her mother, torturing 
herself." 
</P>
<P>
 "I only hope we will be with my Mum again. When the war ends," Dina whispered.

CHINESE DETAINEES HOUNDED BY GOVERNMENT AND GANGS; SMUGGLING: HUMAN CARGO IN 
GOLDEN VENTURE GROUNDING IN NEW YORK HARBOR FACE SPECTER OF ASIAN UNDERWORLD. 
AT THE SAME TIME THEY FEAR DEPORTATION ONCE ALL THEIR APPEALS ARE EXHAUSTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED ANTHONY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day a few months ago, a black limo with New York plates and tinted windows 
arrived at the York County Prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Asian men emerged. They had come for Lin Wu -- one of the detainees from 
the Golden Venture, the Chinese freighter that ran aground off New York City 
last year and spilled its human cargo into the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin Wu, just released on bail, engaged in a heated discussion in Chinese with 
the men. Then he hung his head and left with them; his whereabouts today are 
anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison Chaplain Bob Brenneman doesn't know the identities of the men who came 
for Lin Wu, but he has his suspicions. He believes they were emissaries from 
the underworld that smuggled the detainees across the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin Wu and the others had each promised to pay $30,000 for freedom. Now, said 
Brenneman, the gangsters are turning up and demanding their money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're out there watching," Brenneman said. "I don't know how active 
it is, but I know it's there. And I see the fear. And it's real." 
</P>
<P>
 The specter of gangs weighs on the Golden Venture detainees almost as heavily 
as the possibility the United States will deport them when all their appeals 
are exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can leave here, I'll just run away," a 19-year-old man from China's 
Fujian province said. A onetime pro-democracy activist who fears gang reprisals 
if he uses his real name, he calls himself "Sean." 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't go to New York, won't go to any Chinese place," he said. "I'll just 
find a job in some small town. It doesn't matter what the job is. If we stay 
away from Chinatowns, we'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten of the 288 passengers on the Golden Venture died in the Atlantic Ocean off 
Rockaway Beach when the ship ran aground June 5, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest were sent to jails in Pennsylvania, Virginia, New York, Louisiana and 
California for adjudication. The ones who made it to land before they were 
detained are entitled to deportation hearings, and to bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows just how many have been released, and the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service won't say. But freedom remains illusory when the gangs 
are waiting at the jailhouse door. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're talking about $30,000 to $35,000 a head, sooner or later 
somebody's going to come knocking," said Luke Rettler, chief of the New York 
County District Attorney's Asian Gang Office. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS won't discuss the matter. But police and sources who speak on 
condition of anonymity say they believe gangs are taking steps to make sure 
their investments don't skip town untracked. 
</P>
<P>
 There are stories, they say, some rumors and others verified: Telephone calls 
that come to the prison from former detainees requesting sensitive information 
about inmates; strange calls to the advocates' houses; rumors of attorneys 
being paid by the gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Little is done openly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with dealing with this perceived threat is that no one comes in 
and hands you a card that says 'Snakeheads, Inc.,' " said Craig Trebilcock, a 
York attorney who represents one detainee, Pin Lin, and has led the volunteer 
legal effort on behalf of the detainees.

VISITORS SAY 'AH' TO DENTAL MUSEUM IN BALTIMORE; HISTORY: DISPLAYS WILL PROMOTE 
CONSCIENTIOUS ORAL HYGIENE AND REGULAR CARE, AND RECAP ADVANCES.

 Faster than you can say "nex-x-x-t," Dr. Ben Swanson Jr. opens a drawer, 
extracts a clear plastic box and presents what will be the crowning glory of a 
museum dedicated to pearly whites and those who care for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The contents of the box don't look like much -- a fragile semicircle of 
hand-carved ivory held together with wire. But this lower denture, a rather 
uncomfortable-looking one at that, once sat on the gums of George Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks from a museum devoted to horror writer Edgar Allan Poe, the Dr. 
Samuel D. Harris National Museum of Dentistry will extol a profession that 
exemplifies the maxim "no pain, no gain." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum, scheduled to open in 1996, will promote the benefits of 
conscientious oral hygiene and regular professional care, and recap advances in 
dentistry, such as the invention of the high-speed dental drill. 
</P>
<P>
 An advancement, you say? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, said Swanson, when compared to the agonizing pace of slow-speed 
drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so smooth and fast," said Swanson, the museum's director and -- you 
guessed it -- a dentist himself. "Patient comfort has been improved 
tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 For many people, a trip to the dentist is not quality time. Even the museum's 
very own tooth fairy, retired 91-year-old Detroit dentist Dr. Samuel D. Harris, 
remembers his first visit as being none too pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who donated $1 million to the museum, judged himself to be independent 
enough to go to the dentist by himself at age 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of trouble with a tooth, and I wasn't going to tell my parents 
about it," Harris said. "He did take out the tooth -- a molar." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who also is a founder of the American Society of Dentistry for 
Children, wants his namesake institution to emphasize education, prevention and 
early care. 
</P>
<P>
 Children may find incentive to brush once they've seen some of the museum's 
exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 The "key," for example, introduced in roughly the 1730s, was used for 
extractions. Its hinged "claw" clasped the tooth, which was pulled by turning 
the instrument like a key. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of torque in this, and really it was a very quick way to 
perform extractions at a time when they didn't have painkillers," said Swanson, 
who has a master's degree in dental history. 
</P>
<P>
 Although practiced since the age of the pharaohs, dentistry didn't become an 
organized profession until recent times. The world's first dental school, the 
Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, was established in 1840. Before that, 
dentists trained through apprenticeships. In the Middle Ages, dentistry was 
performed by barbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Dental Assn. is supporting Baltimore's dental museum as the 
official museum of the profession, but there's one big question mark: 
</P>
<P>
 Will people who don't want to go to the dentist go to a museum about them? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people will be really fascinated by the notion that we're going to 
talk about pain and how bad it could be," said Richard Molinaroli of the 
Washington firm of Miles Fridberg Molinaroli Inc., which will design the 
exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40,000 artifacts will be displayed at the museum, located on the 
University of Maryland at Baltimore campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum also may pay homage to the more dashing and inventive among the 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
 John (Doc) Holliday was a dentist, as was author Zane Gray, said curator Dr. 
John M. Hyson Jr., a modern-day colleague. In 1844, a Connecticut dentist was 
the first to realize the anesthetic qualities of nitrous oxide, until then a 
novelty because it made people laugh.

MEDICAL BILLING ERRORS SPAWN HEALTHY BUSINESS; CONSUMERS: VIRGINIA WOMAN TAKES 
50% OF EACH REFUND AS HER FEE, BUT COLLECTS NOTHING IF SHE DOESN'T FIND ERRORS 
AND GET HER CLIENT A CHECK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 John Hale Sr. thought his medical bills for minor surgery were a bit too 
major. But they seemed to be written in some indecipherable code, so he 
grumbled, shook his head and paid up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't sit down and read those things," Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he heard about Pat Palmer, a Salem woman who makes medical bill blunders 
her business. 
</P>
<P>
 With Palmer's help, Hale, a diesel engine mechanic from Salem, received a 
refund check of more than $600 on bills during the past two years. He was 
surprised -- and upset. "It makes me wonder, in the 30 years I've been paying 
insurance, how much extra money I've paid." 
</P>
<P>
 During the previous three months, Palmer obtained $15,000 in refunds for 22 
clients. Only two were correctly billed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are paying thousands of dollars out of their own pockets that they 
shouldn't be paying," Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer's company, Medical Recovery Service, takes 50% of each refund as its 
fee, but collects nothing if she doesn't find errors and get her client a check 
from a medical provider or insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think their motto is, if there are enough hassles and hoops to jump 
through, you'll say forget it and pay your bill," said Palmer, 38. "Older 
people don't have the knowledge and stamina and younger people don't have the 
time to get them corrected." 
</P>
<P>
 James Goss, media relations director for Trigon Blue Cross Blue Shield in 
Virginia, said insurance companies have automated and manual cross-checking 
procedures to catch errors. They also do audits on claims routinely. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when some claims come in incorrectly -- sometimes 
intentionally and sometimes unintentionally," Goss said. "Most physicians in 
our networks understand and follow the rules and a small, minor number don't, 
and that's when we run into problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Clients give Palmer permission to have access to their medical records, and 
away she goes, running around the runarounds. In one case, it took 18 telephone 
calls to clear up one error -- a charge that wasn't paid by an insurance 
company because it was filed under the wrong code. "They filed it wrong three 
times before they got it right." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an unlikely business, and Palmer is an unlikely entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 She has no college degree. She was working for a Roanoke insurance company as 
a record keeper when she discovered something about her colleagues' work 
habits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes less time to deny a claim that process it, and they have to keep up 
with a quota," she said. "If they were falling behind before coming to lunch, 
you can see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when she decided to check out her father's bills. "My dad would always 
get these denials and end up paying most of his medical bills." 
</P>
<P>
 She obtained his itemized bills and then read the insurance policy manuals 
"from front to back" to determine if he was compensated correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned that her company, like most others, has a carry-over clause that 
requires charges in the last three months of the year to be applied to the next 
year's deductible. 
</P>
<P>
 In her father's case, it wasn't followed and "they called it an administrative 
error or a computer error." His refund: $147. Then she did the same for her 
husband, and determined that he was due $380 in overcharges. 
</P>
<P>
 After doing the same for friends and friends of friends, she decided to get a 
business license and eventually had enough clients to quit her job and run 
Medical Recovery Service out of her home. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer recommends that everyone ask for an itemized statement from hospitals, 
clinics and physicians rather than a summary of broad categories like room and 
board and medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They usually only give it to you if you ask," she said. "You would be amazed 
at what you pay for."

BACKWOODS TOWN CONSIDERS PACKING IT IN; NEW JERSEY: WITH ONLY SIX RESIDENTS 
REMAINING, PICTURESQUE PAHAQUARRY TOWNSHIP CONSIDERS MERGING WITH NEIGHBORING 
HARDWICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On a recent afternoon the busiest spot in town was Van Campen Brook, where the 
water rushed through rocks, the wind swished maple trees and two hikers set off 
for a walk to the mountain ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's about as eventful as it gets in the least populated town in the 
most densely populated state -- a town that may soon be forced out of business 
for lack of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The population of this isolated, 160-year-old Warren County municipality has 
dwindled. In 1970, there were 70 residents; now there are six. Only two are 
eligible to serve as township officials -- one short of the minimum for a 
municipal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Zipser is a 48-year-old newspaper editor and part-time mayor and Harold 
Van Campen, 74, is a bachelor farmer and the only remaining township committee 
member. Committeeman and one-time mayor Donald von Hagen died in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Two National Park Service workers and their two children also live in the 
township. As federal employees, the couple cannot hold partisan office. 
</P>
<P>
 A sliver of hills and farms between Kittatinny Mountain and the Delaware 
River, Pahaquarry is 12 miles long and 2 miles wide. Worthington State Forest 
and the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area take up nearly all the 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 The Appalachian Trail is about the most-traveled route through town -- not 
counting Interstate 80 which skirts its western edge just before crossing into 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes an attitude of self-reliance to live here. We're living on what was 
a frontier," Zipser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zipser and Van Campen have to go 11 miles to Blairstown for groceries, 
plumbers, doctors -- anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my water freezes, I have to haul water. If the fuel oil company can't get 
its truck over the mountain, I have to haul fuel oil. It becomes tedious," 
Zipser said. "The concept of living alone or far away from other people or 
living with hardship is not a popular idea." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pahaquarry's last longtime residents rather like living away from other 
people. Van Campen, whose riverfront property is dotted with firewood and old 
tractors, refused to talk to a reporter and photographer, saying it would "only 
bring people around." 
</P>
<P>
 And Zipser is committed to the place. She spent every summer as a girl here 
with her grandmother, and now lives in the 260-year-old farmhouse that belonged 
to her grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've traveled extensively, but there is something that moves my heart in a 
way I can't describe when I begin the drive down the mountain into the valley 
and home. It's an issue of the heart I think, much like love," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The township's name is derived from the Indian "Pahoqualin" -- which meant 
"end of the two mountains with stream between," according to Roger Rector, 
superintendent of the Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 If the federal government's original plans for the area came to pass, 
Pahaquarry would have disappeared years ago -- by submersion. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers planned to build the Tocks Island Dam nearby 
and to flood the township. "My house would have been 14 feet under water," 
Zipser said. 
</P>
<P>
 But because Congress declared the Delaware River a wild and scenic river in 
1978, the dam plan was postponed and eventually scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the property in the township still belongs to the federal government 
and is part of the national recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
 When the government bought the land from residents, it offered to let former 
homeowners stay in their houses as tenants. Zipser and Van Campen agreed. But 
Zipser said most of the other homeowners decided to leave rather than pay rent 
on what was their own property. 
</P>
<P>
 No new residents can move in because it's federal land, said Randy Turner, 
chief of visitor services for recreation area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being annexed would make life considerably easier," Zipser said. "With the 
death of Mr. von Hagen, I think we can continue until the end of the year."

WOMAN WHO LOST HER EYESIGHT TO DIABETES MOLDS ART FROM HER VISIONS; SCULPTURE: 
LYNETTE DENNEY'S PRIZED BRONZE CREATIONS, WHICH SHE MAKES BY HAND, DEPICT HUMAN 
FIGURES IN GRIEF, JOY AND CELEBRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynette Denney spent her youth amid the tall trees, blue waters and Green 
Mountains of Vermont. "I grew up looking at gorgeous landscapes," she says. "I 
sopped them up with my eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 She is grateful for that above all -- that and the anatomy class she once took 
in art school. "I remember having to draw every bone from every angle by 
memory. Our final exam was to draw a skeleton riding a bicycle with a balloon 
in one hand and the other hand on the handlebars, a three-quarter view. I thank 
God for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Years would pass before Denney would use what she learned in that art class to 
sculpt figures from wire and wax. She works by hand and by heart; she has been 
blind for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A gifted painter, Denney turned to sculpture after losing her sight to the 
diabetes she's lived with since childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 She has produced 21 figures, most of them female, ranging in size from eight 
inches to a couple of feet. Cast in bronze by area foundries, they dance, 
grieve and celebrate life with such power and emotion they seem almost human. 
They're prized by collectors and exhibited in galleries and museums. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something very real and very honest about them," said Susan Farrow, 
director of the Frog Hollow Crafts Center, where Denney recently had a 
one-woman show. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not only visually exciting, I also feel them when I look at them. 
They actually do something to me physically in a very deep way. There's an 
elegance about them, a quiet elegance." 
</P>
<P>
 Denney considers them gifts from God. 
</P>
<P>
 She says the images that inspired her came during meditation, a technique she 
learned to help cope with the prospect of losing her sight and with it, her 
ability to create art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been losing vision, batting around the house," she said. "I joined a 
group of women who taught me to meditate, to push everything out of my mind. 
The day went better. Everything seemed to go more smoothly on the days that I 
did it." 
</P>
<P>
 She began rising before dawn to practice while the house was still quiet, 
before her husband, Ray, and her two stepdaughters got up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Images began to come into my head," she said. "I began to see a woman walking 
along the beach, in the forest, always moving in some beautiful environment. I 
would come down and make coffee and sit and watch her, like watching a movie. I 
didn't tell anyone for a long time. I thought they would think I was crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one scene, there was an indoor pool that seemed lit from below the water. 
I looked at the other end, and there was a woman looking down with her hand on 
her hip. I saw her the next day, and the next. Finally, a friend said, 'Don't 
you think you should sculpt her?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Standing Woman" looks much like the artist herself, long-limbed and graceful, 
with a calm, quiet air. "I like my figures to speak my inner voice," Denney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of her pieces, the emotion comes not from a facial expression -- the 
face is smooth and featureless -- but from its bearing and body language. 
</P>
<P>
 Denney works bathed in sunlight in a small upstairs studio. She first forms a 
strong, lightweight skeleton from aluminum wire and mounts it on wood. She then 
melts wax in a Crock-Pot and wraps it in layers around the wire. She uses no 
tools other than her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Touch is the way that I see," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She prefers universal themes. "Praying Woman" depicts a female figure kneeling 
in prayer. "Defeat" consists of a woman's body thrown backward over a log. 
Another piece represents a blind mother holding her baby. The baby is smooth as 
silk; the mother highly textured. 
</P>
<P>
 Denney encourages people to touch her work. Her long fingers slide gently 
along the bronze surfaces and a smile lights her face as she recognizes each 
piece by its feel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some sculptors don't want people to touch their work. They say it's not good 
for the bronze, but in a thousand years, what difference will it make?" 
</P>
<P>
 Two pieces are tributes to Ginger, her first guide dog. "Dialogue" depicts a 
woman bending over a sleeping dog, a nightly ritual. "Ginger would sleep curled 
up in a ball at the foot of my bed, her nose tucked under her tail. Before I 
went to sleep, I would kneel down and thank her for her work, for being in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Threshold" shows a woman with a dog under one arm, "a goddess carrying Ginger 
over the threshold into heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Her current dog is Flory, a yellow Lab who wiggles with delight as Denney 
straps on her harness for a walk. Nothing dampens Flory's enthusiasm for these 
outings, despite an accident three years ago in which she and her mistress were 
run over by a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was walking home from work along the sidewalk, I was almost home, when I 
could feel something pressing against my thigh. I fell down, and thought 
someone must've parked too near the curb. Then I realized it was moving." 
</P>
<P>
 The car rolled over Denney's thighs. "I tried to crawl out and it dragged me 
15 feet. Flory was underneath the car. Her harness was twisted like a pretzel. 
She had oil stains on her back. I had tire marks on my flesh and my leg was all 
shades of purple, red and green. An ambulance took us to the hospital. Flory 
cried all the way, she was so frightened for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Though no bones were broken, Denney spent months on the sofa recuperating. She 
has yet to recover from her fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident marked a turning point in her life as an artist. She gave up her 
work as a job counselor to devote all her time to her sculpture. "I realized 
that if I went back to that job, this work would never get done." 
</P>
<P>
 She also visited the elementary schools in Middlebury to educate coming 
generations of drivers about the need to watch out for disabled pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm athletic. I didn't let blindness stop me. I got dogs and I ran. I was out 
there. This is different. You wouldn't believe the fear that I know now and 
never knew before." Not that it slows her down much; she and Flory still walk 
two miles a day. 
</P>
<P>
 It is easy to forget that Denney can't see. She wears no dark glasses, carries 
no cane, and her conversation is that of a visual artist, full of the colors of 
everyday life: the yellow leaves falling from the oak trees behind her house, 
the purple dress she is wearing in the photo she had taken to record how she 
looked before disease stole her sight. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sighted artist, Denney never thought much about sculpting. At the Boston 
Museum School of Fine Arts, where she studied in the '60s, she made just one 
piece, a female figure that turned out too heavy to lug home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I painted all the time. I would drive all around the backwoods sketching. It 
was always the primary thing about me and who I was." 
</P>
<P>
 She was in her late 20s when she found she could no longer distinguish 3's 
from 8's. That was the beginning. At the time, she was engaged to Ray Denney, a 
good-humored, easygoing graphic designer from Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 She wanted Ray to hear her prognosis firsthand "to give him a chance to back 
out." The doctor said she suffered from diabetic retinopathy, a progressive 
disease that could blind her within five or six years. "Afterward, we went to 
lunch and I said, 'So what do you think?' Ray said, 'About what?' " With her 
marriage, she became an instant mother to Ray's two young daughters. Two years 
later, in 1970, she was declared legally blind. 
</P>
<P>
 While she could still perceive shapes and colors, she asked Ray to take her to 
Maine for one last look at the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so excited at the thought of seeing the flat horizon, the surf. I 
struggled to climb over all the rocks to get down to the water. Finally I sat 
down and looked out. The sea wasn't flat. It was pulled into little peaks as if 
by fishhooks, distortion from my eyes. I cried for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the last colors she saw were yellow and white, the primroses and apple 
blossoms behind an old house Ray had found in Middlebury. "I walked through the 
garden and thought 'This is magic.' " Twenty years later, the Denneys are still 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1980, when she had her first one-woman show, Denney could no longer see 
anything at all. Though she still meditates, "There's no movie screen. The 
retina is gone. But if I sit very quietly, I feel directed. I seem to be told 
what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 She also relies on memory, the vast storehouse of images captured and 
preserved for more than 20 years. For those, she need only look within. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our minds are a universe of color, light, forms and imagery," she says, 
"whether we are sighted or blind."

HISTORY SHINES KINDER LIGHT ON 19TH-CENTURY NEW MEXICO PRIEST; CLERGY: ANTONIO 
JOSE MARTINEZ, ONCE PORTRAYED AS A WOMANIZER WHO RESISTED CHANGE, IS BEING 
RECOGNIZED FOR HIS LONG-LASTING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE REGION.

<P>
 Antonio Jose Martinez, the legendary 19th-Century priest vilified by novelist 
Willa Cather in "Death Comes for the Archbishop," is finally finding his proper 
place in history. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cather's 1927 novel, Martinez is portrayed as a womanizing priest who had 
illegitimate children and presided over "the old order," resisting change to 
the point of armed rebellion. Archbishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy -- called Latour in 
the book -- is cast, contrastingly, as a great reformer. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's accepted today that Martinez did have children -- descendants still 
live in his home just off Taos Plaza -- modern historians believe Martinez was 
ahead of his time. He established Taos schools that produced a new generation 
of New Mexico clergy, which the current Roman Catholic archbishop, Michael 
Sheehan, acknowledges in praising Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 The padre also owned one of New Mexico's first printing presses. He was a 
proponent of land reform and American democracy and was the first president of 
the upper house of New Mexico's first U.S. territorial legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very much an intellectual. He lived through Spain, he lived through 
Mexico and through the United States," says great-great-grandson Vicente 
Martinez, who is acting chief curator at the Millicent Rogers Museum in Taos. 
"The constitutional form of government was something he clearly understood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Willa Cather was tremendously unfair to him, and I think the church 
was unfair to him, but I think history has proven him to be truly a great 
leader and a man way beyond his time." 
</P>
<P>
 About Cather, he says, "She had to have a villain." 
</P>
<P>
 Vicente's son, the padre's namesake, Antonio Jose Martinez, 18, is proud of 
the heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think he was a hero," says young Martinez, a freshman at Amherst 
College in Massachusetts. "It's like being related to any great historical 
figure. Every time I sign my name I think of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Lamy, the first archbishop of New Mexico, was long believed to have 
excommunicated Martinez, but current church authorities say the prelate never 
formalized it. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Rev. Edmund Savilla, pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church 
here, held a Mass commemorating the church's first 160 years and honoring 
Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1793 in Abiquiu, N.M., Martinez grew up in his father's Taos hacienda, 
now a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Padre Martinez had been married as a young man, but his wife died before he 
sought to join the priesthood. His only child of that union died at 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was ordained in Durango, Mexico, in 1823 and was a strong influence 
in northern New Mexico for more than 50 years afterward, despite his conflicts 
with Lamy, who came to Santa Fe in 1850. 
</P>
<P>
 Those disputes centered on the archbishop's tithing demands, which threatened 
in some cases to withhold sacraments from church members who did not pay 10% of 
income, as well as on Martinez's support for the Penitente Brotherhood, a sect 
that practiced self-scourging. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest Martinez has never doubted he's a direct descendant of the 
priest. 
</P>
<P>
 The lineage is accepted by the Martinez family, the community and historians. 
Padre Martinez's will instructs Santiago Valdez to take the Martinez name 
because, the padre acknowledged cautiously, "he has not recognized any other 
father and mother but me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Juan Romero of Los Angeles, who this year completed a translation of 
Padre Martinez's autobiography, says too much has been made of the illegitimate 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody claims him as a patron saint," Romero says. "The guy functioned 
effectively as a parish priest for a long time. He was astute and in no way 
wanted to be public. . . . He did not flaunt, did not fly in the face of 
conventional public morality." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero has been in the vanguard of a modern movement to recognize Martinez's 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I would like to see," he says, "is a promotion of a consciousness that 
Padre Martinez did a lot more not only for Catholics but all people of the 
Southwest, that his contribution was more long-lasting. He was a great person 
in terms of a priest, of culture, protector of the poor, a deeply religious man 
who did a lot in establishing a native clergy."

'UNCLE ZEB' DOLES OUT QUIRKY ADVICE TO UC BERKELEY LAW STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE LOCKE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stuck in law school and wondering how to meet that cute undergrad in the 
department office? 
</P>
<P>
 Uncle Zeb knows how. 
</P>
<P>
 Torn between the high life of corporate law and the threadbare halo of public 
service? 
</P>
<P>
 Zeb can help with that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Hip, flip and quick with a quip, Uncle Zeb has been advising Berkeley legal 
eaglets since 1982, serving up everything from tort retorts to ruminations on 
adjudications to tips for young lawyers in love. 
</P>
<P>
 But Uncle Zeb cannot be consulted face to face. To reach him, students at 
Boalt Hall, the University of California-Berkeley's law school, must open a 
loose-leaf binder on a counter near the entrance to the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly a suggestion box in book form, the binder consists of pages divided 
into two columns. Students write on one side, Zeb answers on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Case in point: 
</P>
<P>
 "Zebby, you got to help me. I am absolutely lost in all my classes except Con 
Law IIA. Inspire me! Teach me! A confused 1L." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeb responds: 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point in the semester you should be lost. I'd worry about Con Law. 
You've probably been going to class again -- it just confuses you. Go to the 
beach for a few weeks and everything will be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To a third-year law student worrying about the real world, Zeb counsels, "This 
is your last year to enjoy life. Sleep late. Fall in love. Take undemanding 
courses, or just make your classes undemanding. Real life is waiting out there 
with slavering lips and very bad breath. Chill out while you can." 
</P>
<P>
 Sound advice. But who exactly is Uncle Zeb? 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, he's a mystery muse. But it's widely known that Zeb actually is 
the brainchild of Bob Berring, Boalt Hall's mild-mannered library director. 
</P>
<P>
 The Uncle Zeb book started out as a simple suggestion forum, Berring says. Zeb 
was a character he had earlier dreamed up to make unpopular policy decisions 
more palatable for his staff, i.e., I didn't want to do this, but my Uncle Zeb 
says we have to. 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point, Zeb got into the book. Zeb sort of took over," Berring says. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon students were straying from queries about the library to the bigger 
questions, such as "Can I find true love with a law student?" 
</P>
<P>
 Berring-Zeb kept writing back, injecting levity and perspective into pages 
often filled with tortuous self-doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's astounding how much unhappiness there is," Berring said. "They see 
what's happening to them and they don't like it, but it's happening anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeb takes a hedonistic approach, Berring says, reminding students, "There are 
no guards. You can split. You're young, you're bright. . . . My most frequent 
answer is just go to the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Berring's tips on surviving academia come firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 He graduated from Boalt in 1974 and has a degree in library science, is a full 
professor and teaches classes in Chinese legal history. He got his start 
writing humor as a student at Harvard University in the late 1960s, when he 
wrote for The Harvard Lampoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncle Zeb is Berring's third attempt at a free-form forum, following fizzled 
efforts at Harvard Law School (too many angry people) and the University of 
Washington law library (too mellow). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Similar comment books and bulletin boards have been established at other 
campuses, including "Uncle Ezra," a computer counseling service at Cornell 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 This semester, Berring is on sabbatical and Zeb is being ghostwritten by 
deputy library director Kathleen Vanden Heuvel in what appears to be a fairly 
seamless transition. 
</P>
<P>
 He, she or it, Zeb is a popular fixture at the library's front desk, giving 
harried law students a break from the pressure-cooker atmosphere of learning 
how to succeed in what is not, after all, the world's most beloved profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a nice thing to have," agreed Michael Garrity, who can relate to 
the columns devoted to whether it is better to go into public service or the 
more lucrative corporate field. "That's a definite struggle, especially for 
people with a lot of debt like me." 
</P>
<P>
 While profanity, naming names and politicking are off-limits, students can 
mostly ask Zeb anything. And they do. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a place to stay in Reno? Zeb recommends a place where "the rooms 
are cheap, the ceilings are mirrored, there's a casino in the lobby and the 
place smells like your Uncle Walter's sport coat." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes students ask about actual issues, like why there are no public 
bathrooms in the library, why it's either boiling or freezing and who keeps 
swiping the seat cushions. 
</P>
<P>
 Are they stolen for use in some satanic ritual? Zeb wonders. 
</P>
<P>
 But more often than not the questions take a broader view, like a recent query 
seeking the meaning of Zeb. 
</P>
<P>
 "In California it's Zebatma, a.k.a. god-light source-presence made manifest," 
was Zeb's reply. "Everywhere else it's Zebronsky."

THE NATION; JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS OVER, THE WHITEWATER SAGA RETURNS WITH 
A ROAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Garment, Suzanne Garment, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She is the author of 
Scandal: The Culture of Mistrust in American Politics (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's back. The Whitewater scandal, submerged under the political surface for 
so long that most people thought it long since drowned, is producing big, fat 
air bubbles again. And the circum stances under which it has re-emerged 
strongly suggest that Whitewater is going to get much worse for the President 
and First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Should we welcome this development as much-delayed justice? Lament it as 
scandal politics of the type that poisons public life? By now, it hardly seems 
worth asking such questions, any more than it would be productive to keep 
inquiring as to whether or not we approve of death, gravity or the changing of 
the seasons. The Clintons have tried to evade the modern scandal machine. It is 
about to show them that the more you struggle, the tighter it grips. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of their current trouble comes from the office of Kenneth W. Starr, the 
independent counsel investigating Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 When Starr was named to the job, two camps of critics called his appointment a 
sellout. First were those who claimed that because he had been an active 
Republican and had argued against exempting President Bill Clinton from 
prosecution in the Paula Corbin Jones case, Starr was a partisan who could not 
give the President a fair hearing. This criticism did not get very far: Starr 
had already built a reputation for professionalism, and it was hard to make 
people picture him as viciously vindictive. 
</P>
<P>
 Other critics attacked the appointment from the opposite direction. They 
pointed out that Starr, unlike his predecessor in the Whitewater counsel's job, 
Robert B. Fiske Jr., was not a prosecutor by training. So Starr would be too 
soft and too easy for his targets to fool. 
</P>
<P>
 This theory was never plausible: Even if Starr had the temperament of a dish 
rag, the organization he inherited from Fiske was chock-full of prosecutorial 
talents and temperaments. If Starr had tried to wimp out on a case, every 
political news gourmand in the world would soon have known about it. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, the prediction turned out to be wrong. Starr's attorneys, we 
learned last week, have been doing just what careful prosecutors do in order to 
develop a big case. In Little Rock, they have been letting relatively minor, 
tangential or low-ranking figures in the Whitewater scandal plead guilty to 
reduced charges in exchange for cooperation with the ongoing investigation of 
more important wrongdoers. 
</P>
<P>
 First came a guilty plea from Robert W. Palmer, a land appraiser who falsified 
and backdated valuations of real estate. One of his phony appraisals helped 
justify a loan, part of which went to the Whitewater Development Corp., half 
owned by then-Gov. and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Next came a guilty plea from Webster L. Hubbell, formerly the Clinton 
Administration's associate attorney general. Hubbell pleaded to charges not 
directly related to Whitewater. But the former Clinton official was a key 
figure in the Justice Department when the federal government was deciding 
whether or not to investigate Madison Savings and Loan, owned by the Clintons' 
partner in Whitewater, and Hubbell pledged cooperation with Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton White House has, as they say, tried to distance the President and 
First Lady from these goings-on. But you would be hard put to find a 
criminal-law specialist who thinks that Starr's prosecutors would have allowed 
the pleas if Palmer and Hubbell had not offered information implicating others. 
It wouldn't take all that much to put the Clintons under criminal suspicion: 
For instance, even if they simply had knowledge of these matters and hid it 
from investigators, they might be swimming in the famously murky swamp of 
obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, when you see prosecutors start to make potential defendants offers 
they can't refuse, you can be fairly sure that more action is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 There will probably be more journalistic action as well -- from, among other 
media, the New York Times. Last week's pleas, according to the Times editorial 
page, mean "those who have questioned the entire business of investigating 
Whitewater have been answered" and "(t)here is every reason . . . to keep 
seeking" still further answers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not hard to understand why the New York Times would especially welcome 
Starr's progress. The paper was in the forefront of media reportage on 
Whitewater. But the scandal has been hard to pin down and, so far, no one has 
been able to say for sure what particular illegal or grossly unethical act the 
Clintons actually committed. The White House has derided Whitewater suspicions 
as old news. Not long ago in Harper's magazine, a long article by columnist 
Gene Lyons of the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, using documentary evidence and 
sources friendly to the Clintons, called the New York Times' reporting on the 
issue a stew of false innuendo. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember something like this happening to me and my colleagues when I was in 
daily journalism. We were writing pieces in pursuit of a moderately sleazy, 
immensely self-righteous political figure. We hadn't quite gotten him. He knew 
someone in the publisher's office and had the chutzpah to use this connection 
to summon some of us to a meeting -- where he berated us for lousy journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 We reported back to one of our editors, who sighed and said, "Well, I guess 
that means next time we're really going to have to roll right over this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 So, children, do not try to humiliate a marauding journalist unless you are 
sure you have no more little sheep left out there in the pasture for him or her 
to feed on. In the Whitewater scandal, the current activity by the independent 
counsel's office looks like it's going to be a veritable mutton-producing 
assembly line, and the journalists in question are busy tying their napkins 
around their necks. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout American political history, individual scandals have come and gone. 
Waves of scandal have stormed the beach and receded. But 20 years ago, the 
Watergate scandal, when it finally washed out to sea, left an unprecedented 
pile of institutional debris on the beach. We now have the institution of the 
independent counsel, whose charter usually grants him or her an extremely broad 
mandate to investigate crimes in and around a high official's neighborhood. 
Because the appointment of an independent counsel is generally a public event, 
it especially encourages the type of additional charges that, as prosecutors 
say, tend to "come out of the woodwork" during a big investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Watergate also left us with a press corps with a strong investigative ethos. 
From time to time, journalists engage in bouts of self-criticism on this score, 
worrying that they have become too mistrustful and aggressive. So far, though, 
this ambivalence has been nowhere near enough to turn around the powerful 
organizational and professional incentives that keep investigative journalists 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you want to bet even money, put it on further Whitewater scandal 
involvement for the White House. The news from Little Rock is not just unseen 
thunder on a distant horizon; it is a warning to run home right now and break 
out those umbrellas.

AN UNLIKELY TEAM -- LAW CLERK AND NOVELIST -- WRITE 'PRETTY BOY FLOYD'; BOOKS: 
DIANA OSSANA WAS AN UNKNOWN, A WOMAN WHO HAD DONE A LOT OF WRITING BUT NEVER 
HAD ANYTHING PUBLISHED. LARRY MCMURTRY IS ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST SUCCESSFUL 
WRITERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just who does Diana Ossana think she is, anyway? The 45-year-old former law 
clerk gets second billing on the most recent novel by Larry McMurtry, one of 
America's most popular and prolific authors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana had never been published before she sat down with the Pulitzer 
Prize-winner to write "Pretty Boy Floyd," McMurtry's 17th novel. 
</P>
<P>
 While the book was released in September to mostly positive reviews, critics 
are wondering why the man who wrote "Lonesome Dove" and "Terms of Endearment" 
worked with a collaborator for the first time in his 33-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 But to McMurtry, the decision to write with Ossana was no act of charity -- it 
was she who pulled him out of a slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that I couldn't write it without her," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana might not have taken on the project had she known that some critics 
would accuse her of daring to write with "the icon," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 They filled in the details during a stop in Seattle on a national book tour, a 
first for both Ossana and McMurtry. He decided to do one this time because the 
collaboration has finally given him something to talk about, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale of their alliance reads like McMurtry's fiction -- rich in folksy 
detail and melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, both divorced, met through mutual friends almost 10 years ago in a 
catfish restaurant in Tucson, Ariz., where Ossana lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana was star-struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just finished (reading) 'Lonesome Dove,' " she said. "It was 
intimidating; I couldn't imagine what I would have to say that would be 
interesting to this man." 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, I was in awe of this silent, beautiful woman sitting at the end of 
the table," McMurtry says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually the two became friends. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry described his lifestyle in the 1980s as peripatetic. He would flit 
around the country almost weekly to oversee his rare-book stores in Tucson, 
Texas and Washington, D.C., and he also had a home in Los Angeles. He wrote 
seven novels during the decade, as well as screenplays, essays and book 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the fall of 1991, the now-58-year-old Texas native had quadruple 
bypass heart surgery and was forced to stop moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just so happened that I stopped at Diana's kitchen table," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A side-effect of the surgery was a debilitating fear of going outside, a 
reaction McMurtry says doctors call common. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent his time sleeping in Ossana's guest room, writing "Streets of 
Laredo," the sequel to "Lonesome Dove," on a manual typewriter in her kitchen, 
or just staring out the window from a couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana, who lived with her teen-age daughter, called his behavior 
"disconcerting." 
</P>
<P>
 "I let him stay at my house because he seemed to be comfortable there, and 
waited, hoping that this would subside," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The collaboration began when McMurtry asked Ossana, who had written for 
pleasure since childhood, to help edit "Streets of Laredo." He had been so out 
of it that the story seemed "faxed from a former self," he recalls, but Ossana 
improved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he was rejecting screenplay offers, insisting that he couldn't 
focus on a job that was structured. 
</P>
<P>
 When Warner Bros. wanted a script for "Pretty Boy Floyd," Ossana put her foot 
down. She researched the story and persuaded McMurtry to tackle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Arthur Floyd was a small-time, Depression-era bank robber from 
Oklahoma who found himself on J. Edgar Hoover's most wanted list as Public 
Enemy No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of trouble persuading Diana to actually put her name on it, 
although it was her research, and it was a full collaboration," McMurtry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana says she would have been content to just be paid for her time without 
taking credit. "I didn't want to deal with Hollywood, I didn't want to deal 
with the press, I didn't want to deal with all the things that go along with 
it. I just wanted to write, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing the script, the two were so fascinated by the story they 
immediately began the novel. They wrote 10 pages a day, with McMurtry punching 
out a five-page framework in the morning and Ossana filling in color and 
details on her computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very worried about our styles merging at first," McMurtry said, "but 
(it) just happened without anyone noticing . . . and sort of got lost in the 
daily activity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One day during the project, he sneaked a glance at Ossana's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read two pages of her novel, and I was very, very moved," he said. "I 
realized then that my instinctive choice to try to persuade her to be my 
partner was correct, because there was something in that prose that I don't 
have in my prose." 
</P>
<P>
 While "Pretty Boy Floyd" features McMurtry-esque down-home slang and humor, 
the two authors say the female characters have a sensibility that comes from 
Ossana. 
</P>
<P>
 She is now working on a novel of her own about Italian immigrants. When that 
is published, readers will see clearly how Ossana contributed to "Pretty Boy," 
McMurtry says. 
</P>
<P>
 The collaboration helped pull McMurtry out of his daze. The pair wrote three 
more screenplays together. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry and Ossana plan to begin another joint novel in 1996, this time about 
two real-life Cherokee outlaws in the late 19th Century. Right now, Warner 
Bros. has asked them to alter the "Pretty Boy Floyd" screenplay a bit, based on 
new details in the novel. The film is not yet in production. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana is still trying to deal with the media scrutiny "Pretty Boy Floyd" has 
drawn. She likens her experience to the story of Charley Floyd, whose impulsive 
decision to pull a minor heist changed his life forever.

GREEN GUILT OR GRACIOUS LIVING? NEW ENVIRONMENTALISM GETS PERSONAL; NORTHWEST:

 In a city known for environmental righteousness, Carl and Anya Woestwin are 
among the most righteous of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Anya hoards plastic produce bags, washing and reusing them until they fall 
apart. Carl urinates into a milk carton, then uses it to fertilize their 
organic garden. What's more, Carl and Anya insist, they enjoy every minute of 
their low-impact lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not privation," Anya said. "The basic goal is to use as few external 
resource inputs as possible, produce as much as possible -- and have a really 
good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Good time? Environmentalism? Not many people would mention those ideas in the 
same breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental responsibility, once a comfortable enough notion when the 
villains were corporate polluters with belching smokestacks, has become more 
personal. Pollution control increasingly focuses not on the likes of Acme Slag 
& Sludge but on small excesses committed daily by ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you know anybody, like maybe yourself, who can't be bothered to sort trash 
into recycling bins? Or who uses a smoke-billowing lawn mower that's been 
kicking around the garage since the 1960s? Or who, when nobody's looking, dumps 
the black ick from an oil change in the back yard? 
</P>
<P>
 Such penny-ante polluters have become the environmental scoundrels of the 
1990s, judging from all the new rules cracking down on them: 
</P>
<P>
 * The federal Environmental Protection Agency last spring proposed new 
air-pollution standards for lawn mowers, then followed up in October by 
clamping down on recreational motorboats. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last winter in Denver, residents were ordered not to use fireplaces or wood 
stoves 132 times, or nearly half the days that anyone would want a fire, in an 
effort to clear up the city's infamous Brown Cloud. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 6,600 communities nationwide now have curbside recycling programs, 
up from about 1,000 just five years ago. Many are mandatory, requiring 
households to use separate bins for glass, cans and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 * Smog-control officials in the San Francisco area urged residents in 
September not to use aerosol deodorants, barbecue lighter fluid or even 
alcohol-based perfumes, all in the name of reducing gases that create smog. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we have gotten the biggies under control, the smaller sources of pollution 
become more important," said Jerry Martin, spokesman for the California Air 
Resources Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cracked down on industry, and the cheap and easy things have been done," 
agreed Carol Piening, an air quality planner with the Washington state 
Department of Ecology. "If we want the air to continue to get cleaner, it's 
time for people to take personal responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 How to promote that responsibility, and how much responsibility is really 
necessary, are matters of fierce debate -- a debate that's sure to continue as 
the new Republican-controlled Congress takes a hard look at the proliferation 
of environmental regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Should government mandate environmental consciousness, with stiff fines for 
violators? Should it try to shame people into less-polluting lifestyles with 
education campaigns? 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, some conservatives say, environmentalists and their allies in 
government are threatening the economy by forcing an excuse-me-for-living 
mentality on Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a deliberate, calculated, longstanding agenda to gain control over 
people's personal lives," said Ron Arnold, executive vice president of the 
Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise and a leader of the 
anti-environmentalist Wise Use movement. 
</P>
<P>
 People would revolt if they were told "you have to do these things because you 
must obey us," Arnold said. "But if you catch them in this green guilt, then 
they go along with it like sheep. They beg for regimentation. They say, 
'Enslave me, please,' and America begins to look like a bondage movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Carl and Anya Woestwin disagree. They believe the new 
environmental laws are a needed antidote for Americans' wasteful ways. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is surprising is that Arnold and the Woestwins agree at all, which 
they do. 
</P>
<P>
 After railing for 45 minutes against liberal, anti-business tree-worshippers, 
Arnold caught his breath by boasting how he and his family recycle their trash 
at home in Bellevue, across Lake Washington from Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Seattle, the city of Bellevue provides recycling bins and curbside 
pick-up, then charges for unsorted trash by the can. The more a family 
recycles, the less trash it produces and the less it pays. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold is proud that his family uses the smallest trash can allowed. But 
rather than call it environmental responsibility, he considers it old-fashioned 
frugality. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic incentive is the key, Arnold said. "There is some genuine 
personal benefit" to voluntary recycling, he said. "If a person wants to be a 
wastrel and a spendthrift, there shouldn't be a law against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Frugality is something the Woestwins appreciate. Nearly all of what they do to 
live lightly on the earth also happens to save them money. 
</P>
<P>
 They buy their clothes secondhand, and they own one car, a Honda Civic that 
they drive about 6,000 miles each year. Carl, 49, bicycles to work at the 
Seattle Solid Waste Utility, where he manages waste-reduction programs. He 
totes his lunch in a nylon bag, returning at night with a newspaper scrounged 
from the employee lunchroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Their modest two-story house sits on a 52-by-110-foot city lot that they've 
filled with fruit trees and edible shrubs. Chickens scratch beneath their deck, 
laying organic eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Anya, 42, never goes to the natural foods store without her shopping kit of 
three canvas bags, old bottles for bulk purchases, reused plastic bags and a 
little bundle of frayed twist ties. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, while neighbors raked their leaves into the street to be picked 
up by city crews, Carl raked them back into his yard to mulch his blueberry 
bushes and garden. 
</P>
<P>
 While Arnold complains about feeling hemmed in by the new, more intimate brand 
of environmentalism, the Woestwins say their trimmed-down lifestyle feels 
liberating. They say they're not into guilt, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel like I'm wearing a hair shirt at all," said Carl. "This is sort 
of a hobby for us. There's a learning curve, but there's no pain in doing it -- 
and there's a lot of satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
 Purists would find fault even with the Woestwins, especially now that there's 
a toddler in their house. The thermostat has crept up from 60 degrees. And Carl 
uneasily confesses that they use disposable diapers on 3-year-old Sam, because 
cloth diapers give the boy a rash. "If some people see this article, they'll 
think I'm a real traitor," Carl said. 
</P>
<P>
 An anti-green activist who recycles religiously? Environmental zealots who use 
Pampers? Perhaps it was inevitable, as the environmental movement grew more 
personal, that ideological lines would blur. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's good," Carl said. For him and Anya, the essence of 
environmental responsibility lies not in the details, not in a thousand 
thou-shalt-nots, but in the spirit of living less destructively. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're mindful about your life and the choices you want to make, you keep 
finding little ways to move in that direction," Anya said.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: WHAT'S GATT GOT TO DO WITH IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: I understand that there are some changes planned in how interest will be 
paid on savings bonds. Unfortunately, I cannot find an authoritative source of 
information about this. Can you help? -- H.G . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Buried within the legislation authorizing GATT -- the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade -- was a provision giving the Treasury Department full 
authority over the setting of interest rates on U.S. savings bonds. Currently, 
federal legislation in effect since 1976 requires that bonds pay a rate of 4%. 
(Bonds held for more than five years can pay even more, depending on current 
market interest rates.) The new legislation removes the 4% guarantee and allows 
the Treasury Department to tie all rates to fluctuating market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to emphasize that this program, which is expected to take up 
to three months to be fully developed and implemented, will affect only bonds 
sold after it goes into effect. Bonds sold between now and then and, of course, 
bonds currently held will not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The details of the new system have not been completely worked out. One plan 
under strong consideration would peg the interest rate paid during a bond's 
first five years to 85% of the rate paid on the six-month Treasury note. (Bonds 
held for more than five years will continue to accrue interest as they 
currently do, at 85% of the average rate paid by Treasury notes with five years 
left to maturity.) 
</P>
<P>
 This change can be a big plus -- or minus -- for bond buyers, depending on 
prevailing interest rates. When market interest rates were low in the early 
1990s, the guaranteed 4% paid by U.S. savings bonds was among the best deals in 
town -- and the Treasury Department came to regret it as taxpayers used savings 
bonds as little more than a bank account or money-market fund, buying bonds one 
month and cashing them out a few months later when they needed the money. Under 
the possible changes, when market rates sink, so will the rates paid on savings 
bonds. However, when rates rise, savings bondholders will no longer be held to 
a 4% interest limit. That change would benefit bondholders in today's interest 
rate environment because 85% of the most recently issued six-month T-bill works 
out to 5.15%.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest change under consideration is how all this interest will 
be accrued. Now it accrues monthly. But the Treasury Department is 
contemplating accruing it only semiannually. What does this mean? Nothing to 
bond buyers who hold the bonds to maturity. However, bondholders who sell 
before that would be wise to keep careful track of the dates of the yearly and 
half-yearly anniversaries of their bonds. Selling before those anniversaries 
would mean forfeiting up to nearly six-months' interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly the Treasury Department is counting on bondholders forfeiting some of 
that interest. According to a department spokesman, the government estimates 
that savings under the new interest payment plan could reach $120 million over 
a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 One big question still remains: why would a savings bond interest payment 
scheme be included in GATT? The answer tells us much about how the government 
operates. It seems that the Treasury Department has yearned for years to be rid 
of the 4% guarantee. It is also true that new legislation passed by Congress 
must be "deficit neutral." To meet that requirement, the GATT bill needed to 
generate some revenue, and the Treasury Department's desires offered a portion 
of the needed cash. Thus was born the link between GATT and savings bonds. 
Sometimes It's Better to Wait to Join 401(k) 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I was not eligible to join my company's 401(k) plan this year. May I make a 
contribution to an individual retirement account? -- D.G . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Even if you are an "active participant" in a qualified pension plan, such 
as a 401(k) plan, you may always have an IRA. The real issue is whether your 
IRA contributions will be tax-deductible.  
</P>
<P>
 Tax-deductible IRA contributions are available to taxpayers participating in 
another qualified pension plan, such as a 401(k), if they meet specific income 
limitations. For couples filing a joint tax return, the limit is an adjusted 
gross income of up to $50,000. For individuals, the upper income limit is 
$35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, tax-deductible IRA contributions are available to taxpayers 
ineligible or unwilling to join their company's 401(k) plan during the tax 
year. There is one exception: If your employer makes contributions on your 
behalf to a 401(k) account, even if you make no contribution, you are deemed to 
be covered by the 401(k) account and thus not eligible for a tax-deductible IRA 
unless you meet the income limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, taxpayers who have a choice are better off enrolling in their 
company's 401(k) plan rather than making a tax-deductible IRA contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Many employers match their employees' 401(k) contributions -- sometimes 
up to 50% -- and thus increase an employee's savings beyond the $2,000 an 
individual taxpayer is allowed as a deductible IRA contribution. Of course, if 
you are not eligible for enrollment in your company's 401(k) plan until late in 
the year, it is likely that the $2,000 you are allowed to put into an IRA is 
greater than any 401(k) contributions you could make in that brief time. In 
this case, you would be wise to wait until the beginning of the new year to 
enroll in the 401(k) plan.

NO MONSTER TO BONDHOLDERS IN IT FOR THE INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Based on the portrayal in "The Bond Market Monster" (Nov. 20) by columnist Tom 
Petruno, prudent investors would have to be out of their minds to buy bonds. He 
forgets the large groups of individuals who invest their savings in bonds for 
income. 
</P>
<P>
 These investors just received a raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Petruno's comments may be accurate for bond traders who measure success 
solely by their portfolio's market value. They make profits by trading bonds, 
not by holding them. 
</P>
<P>
 However, most individuals own bonds for the income they generate, not for 
trading profits. They spend or reinvest the interest income and also reinvest 
the proceeds when the bonds mature. By reinvesting those proceeds at maturity 
in higher interest rate instruments, they now have more money to spend. Buyers 
of five-year U.S. Treasury notes will receive 48% more annual income now than 
at the beginning of 1994. These investors are not devastated, they are elated. 
Sure their bonds have fallen in value, but they do not have to sell and intend 
to hold their bonds to maturity. For most individuals, the true test of 
prosperity is how much they can spend. The recent increase in interest rates is 
welcome relief. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a huge population of retirees and others who have sidestepped the 
fluctuating equity markets to rely on the more secure return available in debt 
instruments such as CDs, notes and bonds. For the first time in a decade, they 
are getting relief from falling interest rates. They are now able to obtain 
higher returns from their investments, which I suggest is cause for 
celebration.

 Regarding the news that Bill Gates "harbors directing ambitions" ("Dream Team 
May Get New Player -- Bill Gates," Dec. 2): 
</P>
<P>
 The Industry is breathlessly awaiting the announcement of Spielberg's animated 
version of "Windows95," with a soundtrack by longtime Geffen clients the 
Eagles. "Somebody's gotta do it," said a source close to Spielberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Jeffrey Katzenberg is rumored to be hard at work on another of his 
famous memos. Sources say that the memo decries the current computer industry 
practice of using new, tight, fresh, expensive computer code when there is 
plenty of bulky, slow, older, cheaper code around that doesn't have an agent. 
"Microsoft is way ahead of the curve on this already," says a Dream Team 
executive who declined to be named.

'FREE TRADE' EXACTS A HUMAN COST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, well, well: The snow job seems eternal. I just read James Flanigan's 
column "GATT Reality Check Draws on a Vault of Strong Reserves" (Nov. 27).All I 
can say is: 'What was the big hurry?' GATT is 28,000 pages long. Standing on 
end it is eight feet high. Who has read it all? All one has to do today is say 
he is for free trade and you're an idiot if you oppose it. It doesn't matter 
what the details are. "It's for free trade, so vote for it." Oh, I forgot -- we 
didn't vote for it, our wonderful, moral, representatives did. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we compete with other countries that have slave labor? There must be a 
fair playing field in regards to trade. I have stopped buying any foreign goods 
if I can help it; besides, most of the goods made in Singapore and other 
international sweatshops are not any good anyway. The unfortunate, tragic 
situation is that soon there might not be any quality alternative.

HEALTH INSURERS CARE MORE ABOUT MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why was "State Fines HMO $500,000 in Case of Girl With Cancer" (Nov. 18) in 
the business section? It should have been on the front page, where every reader 
would be sure to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary S. Mendosa of the California Department of Corporations 
called the TakeCare HMO case "particularly egregious" and said the insurer's 
actions "put the patient's life in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 The HMO refused to cover the $57,000 medical expenses for the surgery and 
services that saved this child's life. Yet earlier this year, when TakeCare was 
acquired by FHP, a Fountain Valley-based HMO, their CEOs and other corporate 
executives awarded themselves millions of dollars as a reward for accomplishing 
the acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, when admonished by the corporations commissioner, a financial 
representative called those millions of dollars "chump change." 
</P>
<P>
 Count how many life-saving surgeries could be paid for with those millions of 
dollars in "chump change." The "chumps" are the care-givers and the patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The article concluded with a quote from Consumers Union's Judith Bell, who 
said: "There are plenty of complaints, but consumers either don't know they can 
file with the Department of Corporations or they don't think the agency will do 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 This is another example of the fact that while care-givers care about 
patients, insurance companies care only about profits.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: VALUES THAT LEAVE A FAMILY FATHERLESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a case rife with irony and absurd circularity: A man who believes he is 
saving lives from murder commits murder and is condemned to die for his 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who claims to prize the family destroys his own. 
</P>
<P>
 And anti-abortion hypocrisy reaches a new low. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Paul Hill, a 40-year-old former Presbyterian minister, was 
sentenced to die in Florida's electric chair for the murders of Dr. John 
Britton and James Barrett at a Pensacola abortion clinic last summer. Hill, 
barred by the judge from claiming justifiable homicide, presented no defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Britton and Barrett, his volunteer escort, were ambushed by Hill, who hid 
behind a tree praying before shooting his victims with a 12-gauge pump-action 
shotgun as they pulled up to the Ladies Clinic in Barrett's truck. Barrett's 
wife, June, who rode in the back seat, was wounded in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said that before he turned his weapon on Britton and the Barretts, he 
also prayed that he would not have to kill any police officers, whom he 
considers murder accomplices because they offer protection to abortion 
providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," he said, "I was prepared to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's conviction puts an effective end to the argument advanced by many 
anti-abortion activists that bombings, shootings and murder at abortion clinics 
are "isolated incidents" and not part of orchestrated efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was the head of a small group called Defensive Action and had, according 
to news reports, traveled the country in the past year telling fundamentalist 
church groups that the murder of abortion providers (and cops, too, by 
implication) was "justifiable homicide."  
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly think that what I did was honorable and I'm unquestionably 
encouraging others who are called by God to do the same thing," Hill said after 
the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 If one were to get ridiculous (and why not, since everyone else is?), one 
could blame Newt Gingrich for Paul Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich tried to pin blame for the psychopathic acts of confessed child 
killer Susan Smith on a liberal society, remember?  
</P>
<P>
 Well, what kind of values give rise to killers like Paul Hill? Could they be 
the ones we see now parading across the front pages in the form of vicious 
rhetoric from the far right? The intolerance toward women's reproductive 
rights, for instance? 
</P>
<P>
 It's a thought. 
</P>
<P>
 And here is another: Paul Hill is the father of three children -- a 9-year-old 
son and two daughters, 6 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
 What of them? Now they are fatherless. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the family will have to go on welfare. Who knows? Maybe they are already 
on welfare. Maybe, as per the "Contract With America," they will be kicked off 
welfare after two years. Maybe the kids will be put in orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in an extremist pro-life magazine called Life Advocate, Hill penned 
what amounts to a long Bible-based defense of killing doctors who perform 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the rambling essay, he wrote, "Suppose your own precious 
children were pleading for you to help them as a murderous man was about to 
destroy them? Would you do whatever was necessary to protect them?" 
</P>
<P>
 What is Paul Hill? A murderous man who has destroyed his own family. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion-rights advocates reacted with muted cheer to the news that Hill had 
received the death penalty. They acknowledged that the sentence may do nothing 
to deter other fanatics from taking up arms, and that there is danger in the 
creation of a martyr to the anti-abortion cause. 
</P>
<P>
 This fear is not unfounded. As Hill was sentenced to death, a woman in the 
courtroom yelled out: "This man is innocent and his blood will be on your 
hands, the hands of the people of the State of Florida and on the jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever position you take on the death penalty, Paul Hill's sentence is most 
assuredly not a case of martyrdom. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a case of vigilantism, of religious zealotry. 
</P>
<P>
 And of another fatherless family, possibly headed for the dole.

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: A BIG PLACE TO HAVE SMALL TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are plenty of night clubs in town where you can go to see and be seen. 
The beauty of the very newest of them, Sanctuary, is that you can do all that 
and be heard at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little louder than most restaurants," says Dimitri Cristoforidis, one 
of Sanctuary's owners (there are 20), "but it kind of upsets me when people 
call it a club. We had the idea to do something different. We want to 
rediscover the lost art of conversation. I'm thinking of Paris, or Barcelona." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a great place for celebrity spotting and people-watching, the beauty 
of it being you don't have to wait until you get home to gossip about them.  
</P>
<P>
 The women tend to favor outfits that reveal their underwear through creative 
uses of sheerness and brevity, while the men are mostly GQ model types in 
fabulous sport coats, especially the dark, foreign-looking ones at the bar who 
wiggle their eyebrows up and down like the crocodile in "Peter Pan" every time 
a blonde in a see-through dress walks by. 
</P>
<P>
 You can, and should, wear your best dress here, as long as it's black, short 
and less than a week old. The lights are dim enough to disguise wrinkles on 
your face, but not so dim they'll hide a party frock that screams Ross Dress 
for Less. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three separate spaces here, each with its own design theme. The 1931 
building on Robertson Boulevard is familiar as the former Cafe Morpheus. Before 
that, it was the headquarters for the Beverly Hills chapter of the American 
Legion, which still meets here once a month. "I do think there are ghosts 
here," says Cristoforidis, happily perpetuating a cherished rumor. 
</P>
<P>
 The decor in the main dining room is inspired by the Barcelonan architect 
Antonio Gaudi. The walls undulate and ripple in sensual abandon, like the firm, 
sculpted muscles of an expensively kept boy toy. Barcelona meets Beverly Hills, 
and the result is tastefully decadent. 
</P>
<P>
 Basking in the warm muted color scheme and light this night were part-owner 
Pamela Anderson of "Baywatch," at a banquette with several friends. Across the 
room were actor Jim Carrey and girlfriend Lauren Holly, guests perhaps of 
part-owner Costas Mandylor, Holly's co-star on "Picket Fences." 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, the Frank Lloyd Wright-inspired lounge is gothic, torchy and 
claustrophobic, just the way Wright would have wanted it. "The tiles, the 
sconces, the mirrors, all are Frank Lloyd Wright designs," Cristoforidis says. 
This is where the live music for the main room originates, the band squeezing 
around a grand piano on a balcony overlooking the main dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 The back room is a tall-ceilinged space that manages to be cavernous and 
voluptuous at the same time, with a huge fireplace and curtained booths. Live 
blues and jazz are on offer Tuesdays through Thursdays.  
</P>
<P>
 Two walls are dominated by enormous reproductions of paintings by Gustav Klimt 
and Francis Bacon, while a third is taken up by a pencil drawing of a nude by 
Renoir. The picture is enlarged to such a terrifying extent that Paul Bunyan 
could use it as a marital aid. You won't see this on "Baywatch." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's fabulous," Cristoforidis says, "though there were people who 
found it a little lewd." The implication is that those people can stay away in 
droves and not be missed.

 Mama's Pearls: With only 154 shopping days left till Mother's Day, we thought 
you should know about a one-of-a-kind gift: a handwritten letter from Bette 
Davis to her daughter, B.D. Hyman, on Hyman's 21st birthday. The five-page 
dispatch, estimated to be worth between $200 and $400, will be on view along 
with other items from Hyman's collection (including her mother's christening 
dress) at Sotheby's in Beverly Hills on Tuesday and Wednesday. The auction is 
Dec. 19 in New York.

 Financed Romance: Warren and Annette probably won't be among the thrilled, but 
the Grill has put together quite the romantic New Year's Eve-delivered dinner 
baskets for stay-at-home types. Included with the four-course meal and bottle 
of wine is a videotape for all lovey-dovey couch potatoes -- "An Affair to 
Remember," the 1957 classic that inspired the Beattys' current, although not 
terribly successful, remake, "Love Affair." The price tag: $150 for two.

BRIEF MENTION FAILS TO FULLY EXPLORE A LIFE TOUCHED BY ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roy Rivenberg's story ("Heaven," Dec. 2) mentioned Emanuel Swedenborg, but it 
failed to mention that he spoke with angels almost daily for 28 years. During 
that time he wrote 30 volumes detailing his experiences and conversations.Each 
of those volumes contains information about angels and other spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably his most popular book is "Heaven and Hell," telling about the lives 
of the angels, what they do, what they eat, where they live, how they are 
governed.  
</P>
<P>
 It tells about the devils, too, how they live and eat and fight. And it tells 
what happens to people when they die and how they get ready for either heaven 
or hell.

 Thank you for the delightful article ("Heaven," Dec. 2). It was nice to read a 
lively discussion of what heaven might look like. 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly a lot more agreeable than the acrimonious manner by which some 
groups rant and rave that they have the only way to get there.

TEAM TRULY DESERVING OF RECOGNITION

 I was very pleased to see your article on a surgical team in action ("Team 
Players," Nov. 29). In an age in which professional athletes and movie 
characters are treated as relatively important role models, I welcome the media 
coverage of professionals of real significance to society.

 "Team Players" had special meaning to me. In October, 1993, I had open heart 
surgery at St. Vincent's with Dr. Taro Yokoyama and the team doing the honors. 
I'm glad I was unaware of all the procedures set forth in the article. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not know Ed Gillespie, the patient you mention, but having the same 
surname seemed ironic. My brother Tom also had Dr. Yokoyama for his cardiac 
surgery at St. Vincent's. The Gillespie clan is all doing well, thanks to the 
real "Dream Team."

WHY THE NEED TO CRITICIZE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "New Power in Family Court" by Lynn Smith (Dec. 1): While I applaud 
the initiative and courage exhibited by women who rightfully take on our 
judicial system, I fail to understand how some of the same people belittle the 
majority of women in our nation.  
</P>
<P>
 Beth Waggoner, as founder of the Denver chapter of the Alliance for Divorce 
and Marriage Reform, describes divorced women as looking exhausted after a hard 
day of work, kids and evening school functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, many women in our country do have a place to live, a job to work 
at, kids to take care of and occasional social functions to attend. It's called 
a hectic, yet fulfilling life, even though we are often tired and do 
occasionally look a bit older than we really are.  
</P>
<P>
 My advice to my two daughters, 24 and 10, is "Make your own money, honey. Then 
there's no need to marry it and lose your identity."

BEAUTY THEORY -- IN THE EYES OF THE BEHOLDER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article about the work of anthropologist Randy Thornhill ("Attracted to 
That Healthy Glow? Nov. 22) raised interesting questions. I will address two. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill seems to assert, as an evolutionary biologist, that certain 
biologically dictated standards of beauty are constant across cultures and 
throughout human history. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the evidence he uses to make the case appears limited to current 
generation "beauties" in Western cultures. History, an evolutionary discipline, 
generally requires that supporting evidence must be presented from a series of 
historical periods. Art history seems a likely place for Thornhill to begin 
demonstrating the universality of human perceptions of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill's assertion that beautiful symmetry dictates sexual choice flies in 
the face of what we know about the history of the family. In recent centuries, 
marriage choice has been restricted worldwide by social structure and the power 
of elders. Marriages arranged by parents and matchmakers were restricted by 
clan, caste, class, and within those structures, often dictated by the size of 
dowries and bride prices. Reproductive partnership has almost everywhere been 
governed as a primary cultural institution.

WESTSIDE WATCH: RED CROSS SELLS COFFEE TO PERK UP ITS FUND RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Always there in times of need, the American Red Cross is selling hot cups of 
caffeine to weary holiday shoppers at its World Village Coffee Co. in the Fox 
Hills Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case the Red Cross' effort is not completely altruistic. Its donations 
dwindling, the organization is trying out a new way to raise funds, according 
to a Red Cross spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, the nonprofit Red Cross will sell coffee, espresso, pastries, 
juice, gift baskets and Red Cross memorabilia -- including coffee mugs and tote 
bags -- at its World Village location. 
</P>
<P>
 World Village gives a new twist to nonprofit fund raising, but there is a 
historical link between the Red Cross and coffee. Etched in the minds of many 
Americans are the images of Red Cross volunteers comforting disaster victims 
with cups of the stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The coffee shop opened its doors late last month, but its official grand 
opening is Dec. 14. The Red Cross hopes its Fox Hills Mall location will be the 
first in a nationwide chain of coffee shops.

 MITZVAH TIME: What better opportunity to perform a mitzvah, or good deed, than 
the one national holiday, Christmas, that has little meaning for most Jews? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the thrust of a one-day volunteer campaign being launched this year by 
the Jewish Community Relations Committee and ACCESS, a newly formed 
organization of young leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is for Jewish people to devote Dec. 25 not to traditional pastimes 
such as going to the movies, but rather to volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a day planned that's more heartwarming than anything you'll see in 
a darkened theater," an ad for the program declares. 
</P>
<P>
 Assignments will range from delivering food to people with AIDS to painting a 
retirement home to doing crafts projects with runaway teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will meet at 9 a.m. at the Jewish Federation Building, 6505 
Wilshire Blvd., where they will be given a light breakfast and assigned their 
tasks for the day. Snacks and socializing are scheduled for 2 p.m.

 BLIND JUSTICE: What does a law student do when the lights go out while he's 
taking the bar exam? Sue, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's what David Hollander is doing. Hollander contends that he 
failed the intensive three-day bar exam in July, 1993, because the overhead 
lighting in his area of the testing room took a 16-minute break during the 
test. Test administrators deemed that there was enough surrounding light and 
continued the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollander argues that operators of the Los Angeles Airport Hyatt Hotel, the 
test site, were negligent in allowing the lapse. "Lights don't just go off in 
absence of someone's negligence," said Michael Mirharooni, Hollander's 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Phooey, says Hyatt attorney Robert Anderson, who argues that Hollander should 
be suing the State Bar of California. "If the lights go out in the last minute 
of a football game and the referee requires the kicker to kick the winning 
field goal in the dark, who's to blame, the referee or Con Edison?" Anderson 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Anderson said he sees the lawsuit as a frivolous publicity stunt, 
Mirharooni disagrees. "I think this is a really important case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollander is seeking unspecified damages to compensate for the "economic 
injuries, mental distress and other injuries" he incurred from the incident, 
Mirharooni said.

HAM RADIO OPERATORS FORM EMERGENCY NETWORK; VOLUNTEERS: MEMBERS OF C-CARES WILL 
INITIALLY BACK UP POLICE AND FIRE PERSONNEL. MEMBERS WILL LATER BE TRAINED AS 
DISASTER-RELIEF WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Amateur radio operators in Culver City will be taking their civic duty to the 
airwaves as members of a new emergency communications network supporting the 
city's fire and police units. 
</P>
<P>
 C-Cares (Culver City Amateur Radio Emergency Service) met for the first time 
at the end of November, when nearly 30 ham radio operators showed up to 
volunteer. There are roughly 250 registered amateur radio operators in Culver 
City, said H.L. Marks, one of the coordinators of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to providing emergency communications services, the group plans to 
back up fire and police personnel during public events in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are other possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was a baby missing in Culver City, we could coordinate . . . the 
communication between search teams and the police or fire departments," Marks 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City's police and fire departments have been squeezed by tight budgets, 
creating an even greater need for groups such as C-Cares. 
</P>
<P>
 "These folks have equipment that would be very helpful to us -- they could 
become an extra set of eyes and ears for us," said Lt. Tom Gabor of the Culver 
City Police Department. "There is just no way that we can have a police officer 
on every corner, although in some situations, we'd like to." 
</P>
<P>
 The Culver City Fire Department is coordinating C-Cares. The department, out 
of its civil defense fund, has purchased four radios, three antennas and a 
radio room, which will be C-Cares' headquarters during emergencies. The 
equipment is worth about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll buy whatever they need, within reason. That's how important the group is 
to us," said Asst. Fire Chief Paul Francis. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the volunteers officially become members of C-Cares, the Culver City 
Police Department will check their backgrounds. Those who are eligible to join 
C-Cares will be sworn in as disaster-relief workers, covered under the state 
worker's compensation program for any injuries they suffer during training 
exercises and emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the Fire Department will train the volunteers in CPR, first aid and the 
details of Culver City's disaster plan. 
</P>
<P>
 C-Cares has patterned itself after other emergency amateur radio programs in 
the area. Los Angeles County runs the Disaster Communications Service, whose 
members include Santa Monica's disaster relief program -- 40 ham operators who 
have helped out during the floods, earthquakes and fires that have ravaged 
portions of the Westside. Last year's Malibu fires were a true test of the 
group's ability, said Laura Hernandez, emergency services coordinator for Santa 
Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were able to track the path of the fire, coordinating through Malibu and 
Pacific Palisades," said Hernandez. "We also used (the amateur radio operators) 
to find out who needed shelters and where there were beds available." 
</P>
<P>
 "It works as long as you gain their cooperation, support and understanding, " 
she said. "You don't want them going off and doing their own thing."

LOCAL CITIES STEER CLEAR OF HIGH-RISK INVESTMENT STRATEGIES; FINANCES: IN THE 
WAKE OF BANKRUPTCY FILING BY ORANGE COUNTY, OFFICIALS SAY THEIR CONSERVATIVE 
FISCAL POLICIES HAVE PROTECTED PORTFOLIOS FROM HEAVY LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For years, the finance managers of Westside cities envied the high yields that 
Orange County earned on its risky investment strategy. Now, they're glad they 
didn't follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Westside officials say they guessed right by following more conservative 
investment policies than did Orange County, which recently reported a loss of 
at least $1.5 billion in its investment portfolio. Guided by County 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, the fund followed a complex 
investment strategy involving derivative-based securities, essentially betting 
on the future direction of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the county was involved in transactions known as reverse 
repurchase agreements, or "reverse repos." As such, Citron borrowed money, or 
leveraged funds, in the short term to invest in long-term securities and used 
the funds of clients -- cities and other agencies that allowed Citron to invest 
money for them -- as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an opportunity to place money with them, but I didn't have a lot of 
interest," said Don Oblander, finance director for Beverly Hills. "We knew 
Orange County couldn't guess right forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Only two Westside cities say they have money in reverse repurchase agreements, 
and in both cases it's a small portion of their invested funds. Such 
investments account for $10 million of Beverly Hills' $130-million portfolio 
and $5 million of Culver City's $100-million portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 The finance managers of Culver City and Beverly Hills say there is no need for 
residents to worry. Reverse repurchase agreements are risky if a city or county 
borrows money on a short-term basis, usually for a month, and invests it in 
long-term securities -- those with maturities of five years or more, said Eric 
Shapiro, deputy city treasurer of Culver City. Unlike Orange County, Beverly 
Hills and Culver City have not invested in long-term investments with the money 
they borrowed as part of their reverse repurchase agreements, according to 
Oblander and Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills, the only city that includes any type of derivative in its 
portfolio, is somewhat more aggressive in its investments than other Westside 
cities. Oblander has a small portion of the city's portfolio invested in 
federal agency securities that have floating interest rates, similar to a 
variable rate mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest rates on these securities move contrary to the direction of 
market rates, so they are considered derivatives. However, the city did not 
borrow money to invest in the securities, which protects Beverly Hills from 
losses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, investment officials in Westside cities have avoided using 
leveraging strategies and derivatives. They have chosen instead to use an array 
of more conservative investments, from Treasury securities and federal agency 
securities to commercial paper and certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the Westside cities have invested some money in the Local Agency 
Investment Fund, an $8.5-billion pool of money from cities, counties and 
special districts that is invested by the state. Malibu, for one, has its 
entire portfolio invested through the state fund, which invests conservatively 
and projects a rate of return of about 5.35% by the end of December. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing it safe has given finance officers in Westside cities a secure return 
on their investments, but not the high yields that Orange County enjoyed. When 
the Orange County fund was averaging returns of 9%, Westside cities were 
earning between 5% and 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the tables are turned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like someone who has a lot of money to spend and you envy that 
person, but at the end of the day you have money to spend and they have lost it 
all," said Paul Brotzman, city manager for West Hollywood. "Then you feel good 
about what you've been doing."

GENERATION X; 'REVOLUTION X' CALLS A GENERATION TO ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On his wrinkled "things to do" list Jon Cowan keeps tucked inside his wallet, 
there's no entry that says, "Organize the hall closet" or "Change the oil." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan's goals are a little more ambitious: "Help master a social problem," 
"Replace fear with love," "Work with major political official or hold public 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 And that might be the easy part. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my job as an activist to get tens of millions of people in my generation 
to vote," said Cowan, 29, co-author of "Revolution X," a political call to arms 
for the twentysomething generation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cowan says he is no revolutionary. After graduating from the Brentwood 
School in 1983 as president of his class, he went off to Dartmouth College to 
major in English. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was politically apathetic, but I was socially conscious," he said. "I think 
that's where most people in this generation are." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how his father remembers it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he got out of college, he really had no idea what he wanted to do," said 
Bob Cowan, president of Search West, a Century City executive recruiting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon tried working for an advertising agency, but that didn't last long. It was 
boring and unfulfilling, he said. In 1987, he decided to go off to Washington 
to do something bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to sound arrogant," he said with an embarrassed smile, "but I 
felt like I had something to give back to the country." 
</P>
<P>
 After a few years working in a think tank and as press secretary for former 
Rep. Mel Levine (D-Santa Monica), Cowan was planning to go to Harvard's Kennedy 
School of Government. Rob Nelson, a friend and political confidant, was headed 
to Stanford Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they took stock of the political campaigns in the summer of 1992, 
they saw that no candidates had solid positions on the issues that concerned 
them: the deficit, the environment, the lack of high-paying new jobs. And no 
one was acting as an "activist social-change agent in our generation," Cowan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over a beer, we struck up this conversation about how so many people in our 
generation felt disenfranchised from politics," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They decided graduate school could wait. They hammered out a letter to former 
U.S. Sen. Paul Tsongas (D.-Mass.), who had appealed to many young voters in his 
failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. They wanted his help in 
starting a "post-partisan" political group to campaign for lowering the 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsongas agreed to lend a hand. Then they found a second adviser -- Warren 
Rudman, retiring Republican U.S. senator from New Hampshire. The result was 
Lead . . . or Leave, a nonpartisan political action group consisting of young 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's first idea was to persuade candidates to sign a pledge 
promising to cut the deficit in half over four years, or resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsongas warned them no one would sign, but in the end they enlisted about 100 
candidates. Their biggest success was in helping generate public debate about 
the deficit, Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pledge drive landed them in national newspapers and on CNN, MTV, "Good 
Morning America" and the network news shows. They sparred on "Nightline" with 
lobbyists for the American Assn. of Retired Persons, which bitterly opposes 
their call for limiting Social Security payments for high-income senior 
citizens and eventually replacing the system with private retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Their Op-Ed piece in the New York Times lead to a book deal with Penguin for 
"Revolution X," which came out this fall. The revolution is coming, Cowan and 
Nelson warn in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 If such problems as street crime, AIDS and violence in the schools continue, 
young people will be loathe to shoulder the tax burden that will result when 
baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
 They might take to the streets, burn their Social Security cards and refuse to 
foot the bill, the book warns. The bloated government debt and the relative 
increase in the number of retirees could spark the biggest crisis since the 
Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 So who are Cowan and Nelson counting on to steer the country away from that 
abyss? Their generation of "slackers," a term they scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a generation of people who are out to survive, to get by," Cowan 
said. "We didn't make this mess, but we're willing to be part of the cleanup. 
It's not like we're whining and saying, 'Why did you do this to us?' " We're 
saying, 'Let's start fixing it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan's family, friends and even his fifth-grade teacher turned out for a book 
signing in Santa Monica last month. Barbara Levine, who still teaches at 
Franklin Elementary School, said she did not peg young Cowan as a budding 
revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great kid, a terrific student, high energy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 His father also said he didn't raise a radical. In fact, his son convinced him 
of the dangers of the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he (said) you're mortgaging my future, that put it in perspective, 
because that's what we're doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the title of the book, Cowan agrees the ideas are not revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing in "Revolution X" that most people who spend any time in 
Washington don't realize is the truth about the situation in our country," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a veteran of countless interviews, Cowan sprinkles his conversations with 
statements from the book and pithy sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the passion and the commitment to make this happen," he says, "but 
we've constantly had to tap the resources and experience of the older 
generation." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the popular notion that his generation is made up of apathetic cynics 
who don't vote, Cowan said people his age are willing to do their part.

COMMUNITY NEWS: VENICE; NEW DISPUTE OVER BOARDWALK SURFACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Venice groups are promoting a plan to resurface the community's boardwalk 
in brick, but critics say it would be too costly and anathema to the 
boardwalk's funky ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is about $10 million in funding earmarked for Venice Beach from 
Proposition A, a $500-million ballot measure for improving parks and recreation 
facilities. The closed Venice Pier will be restored with $3 million of the 
allotted funds, leaving $7 million for refurbishment of the boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 The current proposal, includes resurfacing of the boardwalk, new street 
lighting and upgraded restrooms, among other improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice Boardwalk Assn., an organization of business owners, and the Venice 
Action Committee, a group of neighborhood residents and merchants, would like 
to see the boardwalk resurfaced in sand-set brick, arguing that it will stay 
clean longer and can be reassembled following earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the brick idea favor asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the limited amount of money available, it would be irresponsible to use 
designer brick," said Richard Abcarian, president of Friends of the Venice 
Boardwalk Assn., a group of Venice property owners that formed last summer in 
opposition to the Venice Boardwalk Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asphalt is serviceable, safe, easy to maintain and at least four times 
cheaper . . . (and) I think that designer brick is utterly out of character for 
the boardwalk." 
</P>
<P>
 Other resurfacing materials being considered by the city are asphalt and 
concrete with tile inlays. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Ryavec, executive director of the Venice Boardwalk Assn., said brick 
resurfacing of the boardwalk from the Santa Monica border to Venice Boulevard 
North -- about 100,000 square feet -- would cost roughly $650,000, excluding 
subsurface preparations that might require removing the existing foundation and 
pouring a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier estimate for the cost of the brickwork, which included subsurface 
preparations, came in at $1.6 million. That estimate would have extended the 
brick overlay from Santa Monica to Washington Boulevard, Ryavec said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Board of Recreation and Parks Commissioners will hold public 
workshops on the refurbishment plan in the spring. KATHLEEN KELLEHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: PLAYA VISTA; COURT REJECTS MOVE TO COLLECT LEGAL FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An environmental group that lost a lawsuit attempting to halt the mammoth 
Playa Vista development near Marina del Rey took some comfort last week as a 
judge rejected a motion by the developer to recover attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Maguire Thomas Partners had filed a motion Nov. 8 in Santa Monica 
Superior Court against Save Ballona Wetlands, asking for recovery of court and 
legal fees of almost $500,000 resulting from its successful defense of the 
lawsuit.Judge David Rothman rejected the portion of the motion that asked for 
attorney fees of $486,697 but ordered the environmental group to pay court 
costs of about $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Knight, treasurer of Save Ballona Wetlands, said that despite the ruling 
on court costs, the group is pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important ruling -- a victory for all citizen groups who are up 
against well-financed developers," she said. "This was an attempt to discourage 
and intimidate any citizen's group from challenging their project." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Gardner, project manager for Playa Vista and a vice president of Maguire 
Thomas Partners, said he was "disappointed but not surprised" by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major, real substantive issue was that the lawsuit was judged 
emphatically in our favor," Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Save Ballona Wetlands had filed suit in October, 1993, arguing that Playa 
Vista's environmental impact report had failed to reveal the cumulative effects 
the project would have on traffic, air pollution and water quality. Opponents 
argued that Los Angeles authorities erred by approving the first phase before a 
master plan was in place. ADRIAN MAHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: CULVER CITY; MAYOR PROPOSES PUTTING NEW TAXES TO A VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taxation without representation is the latest battle cry of Culver City Mayor 
Albert Vera, who is proposing that all new city levies be put on the ballot for 
voter approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is expected to come up for discussion during Monday night's City 
Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Vera's plan, all new taxes and assessments levied in Culver City and any 
increases to levies that currently exist would need initial approval from the 
City Council. If approved, the measures would be placed on the ballot in the 
next regular election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard of any proposal where cities have said they want blanket 
restrictions on themselves that give voters the right to provide permission for 
taxing," said Steve Kroes, senior research analyst for the California Taxpayers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some question about the legality of a local government putting tax 
measures on its ballots. In a precedent-setting case in 1991, the 5th District 
of the California Court of Appeal ruled that a utility tax that had been 
approved by the Woodlake City Council and then collected by Tulare County could 
not subsequently be put on the city's ballot for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the tax already had been enacted by the council, having taxpayers to 
vote on it after the fact constituted a referendum, the court decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our state Constitution prevents the power of referendum from being applied to 
(local) taxes or in order to reverse tax decisions," Kroes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of other similar cases does not bode well for Vera's effort, said 
Jonathan Coupal, legislative director for the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say there has been a trend against what Culver City is doing," Coupal 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera says he remains unconvinced that his plan would be vulnerable to legal 
challenge. Said the mayor: "They'd have to show me." 
</P>
<P>
 Vera says his proposal is aimed at preventing the city from creating new taxes 
or assessment districts every time it needs more revenue. By requiring a public 
vote on all new and increased levies, Vera says, the city will be forced to 
first consider cutting costs. Some, however, fear that the city will wind up 
having to cut vital city services. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the public says they don't want to pay, we may have to dip into public 
safety funds," said Mark Ambrozich, the city's accountant. MARY MOORE

COVER STORY; STANDING FIRM; AREA PIERS SURVIVE THE RAVAGES OF TIME AND TIDE TO 
ENJOY A NEW WAVE OF RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW and MATHIS CHAZANOV, Times staff writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 WE ARE PERCHED ON THE westernmost portion of the continent, at the water's 
very edge, and yet somehow it still isn't quite far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 So we build piers. 
</P>
<P>
 They jut from every beach town, from Malibu to Manhattan Beach, fingers of 
wood or concrete reaching out to the sea. For more than a hundred years we have 
built them, enjoyed them, watched them get knocked down by waves or fires, and 
then built them up again. No matter how well-constructed they are, no matter 
how many tons of concrete or miles of reinforcing steel are put into them, the 
piers are destined to crumble and topple, victims of time and salt and pounding 
surf. 
</P>
<P>
 But, eventually, the piers rise again. It's a constant cycle of construction 
and destruction and reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 We're in a reconstruction cycle now. Newly renovated piers are busting out all 
over. Even the long-threatened Malibu Pier seems likely to benefit from $3 
million in county funds, and a private developer is about to add an 
$11.3-million "Fun Zone" to Santa Monica's pier, the busiest on the bay. The 
city of Santa Monica has already put about $12 million into rebuilding the 
85-year-old structure, which was savaged by harsh storms in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the City Council last month approved a $3.2-million outlay to 
restore its Venice Fishing Pier, which was closed in 1986 after pieces of 
concrete fell from its upper deck. Plans call for 600 feet of new decking, 
handrails, walkways and replacement of some pilings, and additional repairs as 
needed for the pier's second 600-foot stretch. Plans for a snack bar at the end 
of the pier depend on how much money is available once the pier work is done. 
</P>
<P>
 In Redondo Beach, city officials are planning a January opening for the new 
Municipal Pier, nearly seven years after storms and a fire dumped much of the 
old horseshoe-shaped pier into the ocean. In Hermosa Beach, plans are under way 
to renovate its 30-year-old fishing pier with new railings, beacons, a new 
snack shop and, maybe, a lighted neon tube running the pier's entire 1,140-foot 
length. In Manhattan Beach, a restoration of that city's 928-foot, 
1920s-vintage concrete pier, including the Roundhouse at the end, was completed 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 It's considered an important process, this pier renewal, more important than 
simply providing platforms for fishermen or diners or strolling lovers. Piers 
reflect as well as define the cities that they connect to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways, a pier provides an identity for a community," says James 
Crumpley, of Moffatt & Nichol Engineers in Long Beach, who has designed piers 
up and down the West Coast -- including the Hermosa Beach Pier in the early 
1960s. "Sometimes you can tell a lot about a community just by looking at its 
pier." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Malibu Pier, home since 1972 to Alice's Restaurant, the famous and the 
unknown take in vistas of surfers, romantic sunsets and flying squads of 
pelicans. To the south, there's the bustling Santa Monica Municipal Pier, 
offering fast food, sit-down dining, carnival-style games of chance and views 
stretching from Point Dume at the tip of Malibu to Point Vicente on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, and beyond to Catalina. Before the pier closed in Venice, a 
few steps down its planks took visitors to a world of seagulls and fisherfolk, 
away from the gritty reality of the beachfront, with its tattooed gang members, 
gawking tourists and oddball entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the South Bay, the graceful lines and stately light towers of the Manhattan 
Beach Pier suit a town so traditionally staid that until the 1930s even men 
weren't allowed to wear topless bathing suits on the beach. The spare look of 
the Hermosa Beach Pier likewise matches that city's unassuming style. Under 
reconstruction in Redondo Beach, the Municipal Pier, with its collection of 
arcades, seafood restaurants and bikini shops, harks back to the days when 
Redondo Beach was one of the wildest, bawdiest waterfronts on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of piers along the Santa Monica Bay has not always been one of 
sunny good fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 The first were built in the late 1800s, when entrepreneurs decided that Santa 
Monica and Redondo Beach were natural port sites -- at a time when the now 
mighty Port of Los Angeles on the other side of the Palos Verdes Peninsula was 
a mosquito-infested swamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, these piers were strictly commercial ventures, not recreational 
ones. A little wharf at Santa Monica's Shoo Fly Landing, near the foot of what 
is now Colorado Avenue, provided a platform for ships to take pitch from the La 
Brea Tar Pits to feed the building boom in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, after much politicking, San Pedro won favor as the site for a 
deep-water port, and the bayside piers began to be used more for fishing and 
recreation than for maritime commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1983, the Santa Monica pier was an amalgamation of a 1,900-foot-long, 
35-foot wide municipal fishing pier and adjoining structures originally put up 
by private parties. There was an elaborately decorated carousel -- still there 
-- and, once upon a time, the La Monica Ballroom, which could hold 5,000 
dancers and an equal number of onlookers, among other attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 And then disaster struck. 
</P>
<P>
 In the winter of 1983, a series of storms battered the Santa Monica pier, 
dumping a restaurant, the harbor master's office, two huge cranes, a large 
refrigerator truck and three cars into the ocean, cutting the pier's length by 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents called for demolition of the entire structure. After much 
debate, prompted in part by neighbors who were afraid that crowds and crime 
would return, the City Council decided to rebuild instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a Mexican restaurant graces the far end of the pier, along with a bait 
shop and a history exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to shore, 12 new rides will make up the heart of a new "Fun Zone," 
including a roller coaster, a swinging dragon ship, an 85-foot Ferris wheel, 
bumper cars and other attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 All except the roller coaster are slated for installation next summer, along 
with an indoor area for the carnival games, and the coaster is scheduled to be 
in place by the summer of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's intended to be profitable . . . and when the Fun Zone is in place it 
will be profitable," said John E. Gilchrist, executive director of the Santa 
Monica Pier Restoration Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a part of Santa Monica," Gilchrist said. "It's known 
internationally, and it's a major amenity for the community and Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the area's other piers have already been renovated, or may be in line 
for face lifts in the near future, among them the 89-year-old Malibu Pier, 
whose condition has worried state and local officials for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1905 as part of the private domain of Malibu rancher Frederick 
Hastings Rindge, it was nearly destroyed by a storm in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilt in 1944, it served as a U.S. Coast Guard station during wartime, when 
it was purchased by a private entrepreneur. It was wave-battered and neglected 
when the state took it over as a recreational site in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some pilings were shored up earlier this year, making it safe for 
public use, it is still in a deteriorated state, said Russell G. Guiney, Malibu 
sector superintendent for the state Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 The pier got a promise of rejuvenation when the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors voted on Dec. 1 to set aside $2.9 million in bond funds to fix it 
up, although it is still not clear whether the repair project will take place. 
Under a proposed deal, the state would lease the pier to the county to make it 
eligible for the restoration funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to require the city, state and county to work together, but at 
least the money has been identified to save the Malibu Pier from total 
disrepair," said former county Supervisor Ed Edelman, who pushed through the 
4-0 vote on his last day in office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pier has a public benefit," Edelman said. "You can fish off it. . . . You 
can get the feeling of being on the ocean without swimming in it and without 
being in a big yacht on top. It's giving everybody a way to access the ocean in 
a unique way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Malibu City Council rejected an earlier version of the financing 
agreement, which would have required the city to spend $125,000 a year, City 
Manager David Carmany said the deal is not dead. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of pieces we're going to have to put together from the city's 
side," he said. "We haven't pieced it together yet, but we're working on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The news also shed a ray of hope on the dispute between the state Department 
of Parks and Recreation and the operators of Alice's Restaurant, who were 
served with an eviction notice for non-payment of rent last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant co-owner Bob Yuro, who has long complained about lack of repairs, 
now says he hopes for a settlement in the case next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would make our issue a little easier to handle," he said. "Malibu always 
shines in the 11th hour." 
</P>
<P>
 In Venice, where community protest thwarted the city's original proposal to 
demolish the fishing pier, recent studies have shown that the structure can be 
salvaged, said Kathleen Chan, project manager for the Department of Recreation 
and Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to look for funding because the department unfortunately doesn't have 
$2 (million) to $3 million to throw at every problem," Chan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to start next year, thanks to voter approval of a 
countywide measure to pay for the restoration of recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the cycle continues. Storms, fires, political squabbles and lack of 
money have been crashing against Southern California's piers for more than a 
century. Yet, somehow, the piers endure.

GARDEN GREETINGS; SIGNS OF THE THYMES? SENTIMENTS OF ALL KINDS ARE POPPING UP 
IN TODAY'S PROPERLY EQUIPPED GARDENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 What's this? Signs in the garden? 
</P>
<P>
 As unlikely as it might seem, signs of all kinds are the latest garden 
phenomenon, and one may be the perfect holiday present for the gardener on your 
gift list. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Heard thinks it began with a simple sign made to hang on the front 
door that told visitors, "I'm Out Back in the Garden," so they wouldn't stand 
there too long knocking. At Heard's Country Gardens in Westminster, that one 
sign has grown to dozens with countless sayings, poems, hymns and homilies, and 
they're selling like hot cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs may be painted on wood, pressed into terra-cotta tiles, scratched 
onto concrete or molded in metal. They cost anywhere from a few dollars to a 
hundred or more for some very large hand-painted kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 All have something to say, and you're likely to find messages anywhere in the 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 On the front gate, a simple hand-painted sign hanging from a rusty wire might 
say, "Welcome to My Garden" or "Garden Tours 5." Over by some herbs, attached 
to a wall, a much larger sign quips, "Never Enough Thyme," and a little further 
down the garden path, a sign attached to a wooden stake proclaims, "My Garden 
Was Perfect Last Week." By the feeder, one advertises, "Birds Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Choose from homey and often humorous maxims like, "Let All Your Weeds Be 
Wildflowers" or homilies such as, "Bloom Where God Plants You." 
</P>
<P>
 The gardener's thoughts can even be found underfoot, scratched into a concrete 
steppingstone. "Plant Till You Drop" says one, and "Flowers, Herbs and Hugs 
Found Here" reads another. 
</P>
<P>
 If the person you know gardens in containers, many of these messages can be 
stuck in pots. The Garden Gate, a flower shop in Yorba Linda, sells a variety 
of large and small signs, including a number on stakes that will work in the 
ground or in containers. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular signs are made of painted and distressed wood so they don't 
look too new. One of the craftspeople who makes these signs for retailers, 
Susan Haight in Perris, thinks people like them because "they're affordable and 
add color to the garden, no matter what the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Some add what could be called seasonal color. You can get bright red signs 
that say, "Merry Christmas" with sleighs or snowmen painted on them, and there 
are signs with pumpkins and American flags for other holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 For that someone special, there are signs that say, "Grandma's Garden" or 
"Dad's Garden." 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Booth of Santa Ana, another artisan who makes signs for the garden, has 
even done custom portraits of gardeners, painted on wooden cutouts that peek 
out from behind a shrub or flower bed to surprise guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most popular are the animal crossing signs," said Jamie Platt, who 
manages Roger's Gardens in Corona del Mar. These might say, "Cat Crossing," for 
those cat fanciers, or "Duck Crossing," for those with more exotic tastes in 
animals. In most gardens, you can't go wrong with "Snail Crossing," also 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 There is even an international symbol for "No Snails Allowed," with a bright 
red circle and slash through it, printed over a picture of a snail, though it's 
a bit of wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Platt thinks that gardeners like the signs because they take the formality out 
of a garden and make it a little more fun. "But I'm just guessing," he said, "I 
really don't know why they're suddenly so popular." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Lou Heard is convinced that what these signs really say is: "We love this 
little place." 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to announce to the whole world that they love their gardens," she 
said, "and signs are one way of doing that."

HOT PROPERTY: ACTRESS FINDS LIFE'S A BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actress PAMELA ANDERSON, a former Playboy centerfold who stars in the 
syndicated series "Baywatch," has purchased the Malibu townhouse she had been 
renting for a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, 27, was detective Mike Hammer's secretary Velda in the CBS movie 
"Come Die With Me," a Mickey Spillane mystery that aired Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of British Columbia, Anderson became a spokesmodel for a beer company 
after her image was projected on a scoreboard screen at a Canadian football 
game in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to pose for five Playboy covers, including the one in November, 
and to play Lisa the Tool Girl, TV handyman Tim Allen's assistant on ABC's 
"Home Improvement," which she left after the '93 season to focus on "Baywatch," 
playing flower child C.J. Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson bought the Malibu townhouse for $270,000. She had been renting it at 
$1,725 a month. The unit, in a security-gated complex with a pool, has two 
bedrooms in about 1,700 square feet. Anderson spent more than $100,000 in 
remodeling before buying it, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The townhouse has been described as being "scented with incense and furnished 
in pine." Anderson, a dedicated meditator, learned about meditation from her 
Finnish grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's purchase was handled by Ira Greenspon and Bob Rubenstein, both of 
Malibu Realty. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar-winning actress/singer SHIRLEY JONES and her husband, actor/comedian 
MARTY INGELS, have leased out the Brentwood townhouse they bought a year ago 
from singer Janet Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,000-square-foot townhouse at Mountaingate was Ingels' idea to buy as a 
scaled-down, in-town alternative to the 5,200-square-foot Beverly Hills house 
Jones has owned since 1967, when she bought it with her then-husband, late 
actor Jack Cassidy. 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner was Ingels' offer accepted, however, than Jones started making it 
clear that she didn't want to move into the townhouse or sell her Beverly Hills 
home. "I call it the ongoing saga of the three houses of Ingels," the 
actor/comedian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple also has a Big Bear home, which he expanded at a cost of $400,000 
as a surprise to Jones when she was on tour in Europe. Luckily, Jones liked the 
rehab, but Ingels still wasn't sold on the mountains, which he calls "too high 
and too quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the townhouse, which he calls his "dream retreat," seemed to 
be "slipping through my fingers," as he puts it, with its homeowners' fees, 
mortgage payments, fix-up costs, impending remodeling. "And Shirley said sell." 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, at least for a year, was to lease the condo to West Coast 
garment magnate John Macaluso and his family. Sherwin Mitchell of Fred Sands' 
Beverly Hills office had the listing on the estimated $5,000-a-month lease. 
"The lease meant time to think out our needs," Ingels said. 
</P>
<P>
 They have discussed retiring, but it won't happen soon. In January, they go on 
tour in "Love Letters," then they resume running TV roles. She is in "Burke's 
Law" and "Murder, She Wrote;" he is in "The Young and the Restless." She also 
did a pilot for Aaron Spelling for her own TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Frank Lloyd Wright-designed "La Miniatura," on about an acre in a ravine 
in Pasadena, has come on the market at $3.45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright designed the textile-block house in 1923 for Alice Millard, the widow 
of a rare-book dealer. She died in the 1930s, and sculptor Donald Potter 
Daniels, a neighbor of Millard's, bought the home from her estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels' granddaughter, Nicole, inherited it several years ago. She grew up in 
the house and just completed revamping it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a young son who likes to surf, so she wants to move to Laguna to be 
near the beach," said listing agent Barry Sloane of Dalton, Brown & Long in 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-bedroom house, on the December cover of Architectural Digest, was 
the first of Wright's four textile-block houses in the Los Angeles area, and it 
signaled a turn in Wright's work toward designing buildings in cast-concrete 
blocks. Lloyd Wright, Wright's son, designed a studio with a loft that was also 
built on the property.

APARTMENT LIFE: IF RENT CHECKS ARE ACCEPTED, YOU'RE A RENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: In August I moved into an apartment in West Hollywood with a renter 
who already had occupied the unit for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord would not add my name to the lease because he didn't want to 
"inherit another renter." 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord accepts my rent checks each month, and I always pay the rent on 
the first of the month. I believe that I am entitled to all rights of a tenant 
since each month the landlord accepts rent checks made out to him from me. 
</P>
<P>
 My question is, if my roommate moved out would I be able to stay on as a 
renter? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: It would be extremely difficult for this owner to prove that you are 
not a renter. He, willing or otherwise, very likely will "inherit" you as a 
renter if your roommate moves out. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Craig Mordoh, senior attorney with the California Apartment Law 
Information Foundation, "Although there is no state or local legislation on the 
subject, there is a Court of Appeal case dealing with a similar situation in 
West Hollywood. The case of Getz vs. City of West Hollywood held that a tenancy 
can be created by the knowing acceptance of rent." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the case, the new tenant also is entitled to all of the protections of 
the West Hollywood rent control law, as are tenants in other rent-controlled 
jurisdictions in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in a city without rent control, knowing acceptance of rent may create a 
tenancy. Seller Should Disclose Tenants' Unpaid Rents 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I had my house up for sale for quite some time while renting it out to a 
family. Recently, I signed a purchase agreement with a buyer to take over the 
house by Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owner indicated that he would like to keep renting the house out to 
the existing renters. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that over the past few months they have fallen behind on the 
rent. Since the house was on the market, the chances of finding new renters 
were slim. Therefore, instead of trying to evict them, I have been trying to 
collect the rents by phone calls and letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the house will most likely sell, I need to know the best way to 
collect the rent without jeopardizing the sale. Please help. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I am assuming that you have not yet informed the buyer of the delinquent 
rents. You or your realtor, if you have one, should do so immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 You are failing to disclose a material fact about this sale, and therefore, at 
a minimum, could be liable to the new buyer for these unpaid rents. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the buyer may be able to cancel the sale because of this non-disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 As for collecting rents, there is no easy way to do this, which you seem to be 
seeking. You should file a three-day pay or quit notice immediately. If the 
renters don't pay up or move by the expiration or the term of the notice, you 
should seek competent legal assistance in order to commence with an eviction 
action.

REFINANCING ACTIVITY HIT FIVE-YEAR LOW IN OCTOBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Refinancing activity in California hit its lowest level in more than five 
years in October, a victim of rising interest rates, a real estate information 
service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 11,247 homes were refinanced in the six-county Southern California 
region in October.That was down 13.8% from 13,053 the month before and down 
82.7% from 65,151 for October a year ago, Dataquick Information Systems 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 October's total was the lowest since January 1988 when 10,840 homes were 
refinanced. The number for October last year was the highest on record. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, about 30% of all loans made by lending institutions are home 
refinances. A year ago it was up to 69.8%; in October it was down to 26.6%.

TRAVEL INSIDER: PROTECTING VALUABLES FROM HOTEL THIEVES; SECURITY: IT'S NOT

CLOTHES UNDER CASUAL.; SEEK OUT HOTELS AND MOTELS THAT PROVIDE ELECTRONIC 
CARD-KEY SYSTEMS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few months ago, a leather tie case disappeared from my room in an upscale, 
security-conscious hotel in New York. It was the first loss I've ever 
experienced on the road, so the incident came as a jolt. It also was a reminder 
that even when hotel rooms come equipped with high-tech locks and other 
protective gadgetry, you and your belongings remain vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Any well-informed traveler knows it is unwise to leave valuables laying about 
in a hotel room. But these days, lots of travelers tote such costly items as 
video cameras, lap-top computers and cellular phones. You don't want to carry 
these bulky devices with you to dinner, but are they safe in your room? Leather 
jackets and other costly fashions also have been reported stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 And what happens if you do discover something is missing? Can you prove it? 
It's a touchy matter -- since claiming a theft often becomes a question of your 
word against the word of a hotel employee. 
</P>
<P>
 I am convinced my tie case was stolen while my wife and I were out of our 
room. The hotel security officer, whom I called as soon as I noticed the case 
was gone, was polite and apologetic. Maybe I'd left the case at home or 
misplaced it in the room? "Nope," I replied, somewhat miffed. But there was 
reason for his doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Items reported stolen from hotel rooms frequently turn up in the guest's 
possession. And there is the not-uncommon possibility that the guest's claim 
may be fraudulent. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime friend who is the manager and part owner of a busy, mid-priced 
motel near LAX says his guests occasionally report what he suspects is a fake 
theft in the hope that the room charge will be waived. But the motel insists 
that guests notify the police of losses, which the manager believes deters 
guests with invalid claims. It might also deter guests who decide that the 
missing item is not worth so much bother. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, that's what I concluded. I made my report to hotel security, 
phoned back a few days later to find out if my case had been recovered -- it 
hadn't -- and then bought a replacement. A hotel's liability for items reported 
missing is limited unless the hotel can be shown to have been negligent.  
</P>
<P>
 How serious is the problem of theft from guest rooms? Across the United 
States, thefts occur with enough frequency to cause concern, say police and 
lodging industry spokesmen, and occasionally a high-stakes heist from a luxury 
hotel makes the headlines. But in recent years, as the nation has become 
acutely conscious of the threat of crime, many hotels and motels have invested 
heavily in security -- both by carefully screening and training employees and 
by installing electronic locks and safes in guest rooms. You and your 
belongings are safer in a property where guest security is a top priority for 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Precise statistics on thefts from guest rooms are hard to come by. "We've 
looked for that kind of number," says Mary Jo Marvin of the National Crime 
Prevention Council, "but it's not the kind of information (the lodging 
industry) likes to release." It is a problem worrisome enough that World Cup 
officials sought the council's help in preparing a safety brochure -- including 
tips on protecting valuables in a hotel -- for foreign visitors coming to the 
United States for this year's soccer championship. 
</P>
<P>
 In an article last year, Security Management, a magazine published by the 
American Society for Industrial Security, cited unnamed sources in the hotel 
industry who consider theft from rooms "a common, almost routine problem" -- 
which, it notes, "is exacerbated by guests who leave their valuables 
unprotected." Not surprisingly, spokesmen for firms that market hotel security 
devices say many of their customers are located in destinations with a 
reputation for high crime, such as New York, Miami and Washington. "The problem 
is pretty prevalent in any major business area," says Joe Rook, vice president 
for marketing and sales of VingCard, an electronic card lock system. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel thieves may be outsiders who force their way into your room while you 
are away. Or the thief can be a stranger you have invited to your room, who 
lifts your wallet before he or she departs. Or it can be a hotel employee. My 
friend the Los Angeles hotel manager says that in the past 11 years he has had 
to fire two members of his staff of 64 because they were discovered stealing 
from guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing guests fail to understand," he says, "is that the people who 
service rooms -- the housekeepers and the maintenance men -- are not 
high-salaried people. When a guest leaves an expensive watch in the room, it's 
like leaving the door open to a world not available to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, my friend is quite proud of his staff's record of honesty. In July, 
guests departing the 154-room property left behind 376 items ranging in value 
from used toothbrushes to watches and silver belt buckles, all of which the 
housekeepers turned in to the motel's lost-and-found office. In that month, he 
received only eight calls from guests in which an item they had missed could 
not be located, and in these instances the guests were not sure they had left 
the item at the motel. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid loss of valuables from a hotel room and the hassle of reporting it, 
consider these safeguards recommended by law enforcement agencies, the lodging 
industry and other security experts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seek out hotels and motels that provide electronic card-key systems. A safe 
in the room is a security bonus. So is a hotel or motel in which non-guests can 
enter only through a front door that leads to the front desk. In addition, 
Virginia Duncan, a security spokeswoman for Budgetel, maintains that the sort 
of economy lodging she represents -- where there are no bars, restaurants or 
meeting rooms -- is safer because the lack of public facilities keeps 
non-guests away. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you are carrying valuables, place them in the room safe or a 
safety-deposit box at the front desk. "Better still," says the National Crime 
Prevention Council, "leave them at home."  
</P>
<P>
 * Keep briefcases, computers, cellular phones and similar expensive items out 
of sight in your room, or check them with the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the hotel issues you two keys, don't leave one in the room. An employee 
picking up an electronic card key, for example, could use it to return to your 
room in an off hour, and the printed record would indicate only that it was you 
who had entered the room. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid motels where room doors open to the outside, advises Stacey Ravel 
Abarbanel, author of "Smart Business Travel: How to Stay Safe When You're on 
the Road" (First Books, $12.95). Instead, find properties where the rooms open 
to an inside corridor, because they are less likely to be broken into. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lock windows and patio doors when you leave your room. Consider doing the 
same while you are in the shower if you are on the ground floor. And make sure 
doors to connecting rooms are locked. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't hang one of those tags on your door requesting immediate maid service. 
It's "an advertisement that your room is presently unoccupied," says Abarbanel. 
If you haven't fully unpacked, keep your suitcase locked and out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hang a costly or unusual item of apparel in the closet beneath casual 
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't flaunt money, jewels or other valuables in public places. It is a 
temptation to a break-in.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: EGYPT OPENS 6 ROYAL TOMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attempting to lure back wary tourists whose numbers have dropped off in Egypt 
since the onset of terrorist attacks, antiquities authorities have opened six 
new royal tombs in and around the Valley of the Kings never before open to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Restored at a cost of $448,000, the burial chambers now on view include the 
tombs of three pharaohs -- Ay, an official in the court of King Tutankhamen who 
followed the boy king as ruler of Egypt; Ramses VII, and Siptah -- along with 
the noblemen's tombs of Hijoti-Mes, Ne-Nefer and Nefer-Serkheru. The openings 
on Nov. 27 coincided with a new outdoor production of the Verdi opera "Aida" at 
the temple of Queen Hatshepsut in Luxor, which Egypt says will be a recurring 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The openings come amid reassurances that torrential rains in Upper Egypt last 
month did not result in irreparable damage to the Pharaonic tombs. Twelve of 
the 62 tombs in the Valley of the Kings -- including those of Tutankhamen, 
Ramses I and Ramses III -- were exposed to water leakage. The worst hit was the 
tomb of Seti II, where water 2 1/4 inches deep collapsed the gate and part of 
the fence. No drawings or etchings inside the tombs were affected, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have also moved to block construction of a controversial new ring 
road around the historic pyramids in Giza, the only survivors among the seven 
wonders of the ancient world. 
</P>
<P>
 President Hosni Mubarak ordered a temporary halt to the road, located less 
than a mile and a half from the large Cheops pyramid, after UNESCO argued that 
the road will endanger the historic site, rich in unexcavated antiquities that 
could possibly include even some undiscovered pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
 UNESCO has demanded that the highway be moved at least 12 miles back from the 
pyramids. But Mubarak's order merely halts work until a scientific study is 
undertaken to measure the road's impact on the archeological area. KIM MURPHY

 Ship holiday gifts ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take an empty suitcase to pack gifts for the return trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remember: a direct flight is not always a nonstop flight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dress for duress: Wear flat-soled, lace-up shoes so you can loosen them if 
your feet swell. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the plane, use a rolled-up blanket for lumbar support and a pillow for 
neck support. If you can, rest your feet on a carry-on bag or a blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arrive at the airport at least an hour before departure to allow for 
congestion and to avoid being bumped. 
</P>
<P>
 * Order special airline meals in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put luggage tags inside and outside your bags and lock your luggage. If you 
check bags, use a carry on for a toothbrush, prescription glasses and 
medications and a change of underwear,anything you must have if your bags go 
missing.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: GLOBE THEATER RISES AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William Shakespeare's Globe Theater -- where "Hamlet," "King Lear" and 
"Macbeth" were first performed -- is being re-created near its original 
location beside London's River Thames, and the site is open to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Globe, built in 1599, was the most illustrious of several theaters in an 
area known as Bankside, the cradle of English theater and the main 
entertainment district of Elizabethan London. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-sided timber building -- 13 sides are in place so far -- is scheduled 
to be completed in 1996. Guided tours give visitors a chance to see building 
crafts techniques that were used during Shakespeare's time. For more 
information, call the British Tourist Authority at (800) GO2 BRITAIN. New 
Center for Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington, D.C., Convention and Visitors Assn. will close its information 
center at 1455 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W., on Saturday in preparation for the 
spring opening of the White House Visitors Center in the Department of Commerce 
Building, 1450 Pennsylvania Ave. N.W. The new center will be operated by the 
National Park Service and will offer free timed tickets for touring the White 
House, historical exhibits, educational videos and other visitor services. 
Power Curtailed in Dar es Salaam 
</P>
<P>
 Power is being shut off in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's capital, from 6 a.m. to 9 
p.m. every day because an unusually dry year has left water levels too low at a 
major hydroelectric dam. Power rationing in the rest of the East African nation 
began Sept. 8. Most areas go without electricity for up to four days a week.

 AGUIRRE; THE RE-CREATION OF A SIXTEENTH-CENTURY JOURNEY ACROSS SOUTH AMERICA 
by Stephen Minta (Henry Holt & Co., $20 hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 Lope de Aguirre was a murderous Basque-born adventurer who blazed a bloody 
trail across Peru and down the Amazon in the mid-16th Century. He stole and 
cheated, killed Indians and his fellow Spaniards alike, razed villages. (His 
misdeeds were vividly depicted in the 1972 Werner Herzog film "Aguirre, Wrath 
of God.") "No one who knew Aguirre," Stephen Minta tells us in this volume, 
"ever wrote a good word about him." That fact didn't deter Minta, a senior 
lecturer in comparative literature at the University of York, in England, and 
the author of a scholarly work on Gabriel Garcia Marquez, from following in 
Aguirre's footsteps -- the physical, not the metaphorical -- on a journey of 
his own through the upper portions of South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired, he says, by both the beauty he saw and the cruelty he felt in the 
Peruvian city of Cuzco, whence Aguirre himself had set out, Minta and a 
childhood friend (identified only as Jane) travel across Peru, into Brazil and 
then to Venezuela. Along the way, Minta crosses not only rivers and borders but 
timelines, weaving past and present together with surprising grace. The result 
is a work that seems neither history nor travel book, but rather a kind of 
portrait of a region through time, well-written and often riveting. (I also 
like the epigraph with which Minta begins his acknowledgments: "Contrary to 
popular belief, those who travel are more dependent than those who stay at 
home, and they incur more obligations.")

 GUIDE TO RETREAT CENTER GUEST HOUSES by John and Mary Jensen (CTS 
Publications, $15.95 paper) and GUIDE TO VACATION RENTALS IN EUROPE by Michael 
and Laura Murphy (The Globe Pequot Press, $14.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 There's something enormously appealing about the idea of renting a villa or a 
cottage or even an apartment in Europe. Not only are such rentals almost always 
less expensive than hotel stays for comparable periods, but they allow us at 
least the all-too-fleeting illusion that we're actually living somewhere else, 
somewhere exotic and/or romantic -- that we somehow belong in Italy or France 
or Portugal or wherever, at least for a week or two, and aren't just passing 
through like all those tourist types. There are a number of source guides 
available for potential vacation-renters, but this one is unusually detailed, 
and has the great advantage that the authors have personally inspected each 
type of accommodation they list (though not each available example). Sample 
prices and transportation information are included. 
</P>

 And there's something enormously appealing about the idea of really getting 
away from it all -- getting away from the world and its travails, and from 
tourists and villa-renters alike. The Jensens' guide is a directory of retreats 
-- religious facilities, including monasteries and convents, as well as centers 
built specifically for this function -- in the United States, Canada, Europe, 
Japan and Australia and New Zealand. Many of these are Roman Catholic, though 
none are limited to adherents of the denomination in question. Typically, 
according to this volume, the retreats are located in rural areas, forbid 
smoking and drinking, offer ample opportunity for solitude and spiritual 
meditation, as well as for light physical exercise -- and are reasonably priced 
($30-$40 a day including all meals, seems about average). There is one curious 
omission here: Spain, which has a large network of beautiful monasteries open 
to the public on a retreat basis, isn't even mentioned.

 For many retired Americans dreams come true in Mexico where, according to the 
U.S. State Department, more than a million Americans and Canadians live 
permanently. Since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement 
(NAFTA), interest in Mexico has increased among seniors, and many are traveling 
there for vacations with the added purpose of scouting potential retirement 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 An area preferred by many retirees is in the state of Jalisco, which includes 
Guadalajara, nearby Lake Chapala and the lakeside colony of Ajijic. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates of the number of retired expatriates in this area range from 40,000 
to 80,000. Visitors find clean, modern shopping centers and such familiar names 
as Sears, Price Club, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried Chicken. There are about 80 
English-speaking fraternal organizations and social clubs for language study, 
dancing, bridge, charities and other diversions for English-speaking residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine cultural and educational tours of the Guadalajara area are being offered 
in 1995 by South of the Border Tour & Travel. The tours address such issues as 
costs, living conditions, finances, investments, cultural differences, safety 
and inexpensive, quality medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour includes 13 meals -- five breakfasts, four lunches and four dinners 
-- in restaurants. The completely escorted tour with bilingual guides is $1,269 
per person double occupancy. For single supplement, add $289. The price does 
not include transportation to and from Guadalajara. 
</P>

Educational Community. The focus of the trip is the culture of several native 
groups, including the Mayan, Zapotec and Olmec. Lectures and presentations 
include topics on contemporary social issues in Mexico, early church history 
and political history. Field trips and excursions offer visits to Indian 
marketplaces, archeological sites, churches and monasteries, monuments and 
natural scenic vistas.

activities. The tour includes comfortable hotels with private baths, three 
meals daily, all admissions to museums, galleries performances and ground 
transportation. City visits include Oaxaca, Palenque, San Cristobal de Las 
Casas and Tuxtla Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour departs from Dallas, and the cost, including round-trip air fare from 
Dallas, is $2,395 per person. Single supplement is $395. For a copy of the

BACKPACK & BUDGET: YACHTING ON SOMEONE ELSE'S NICKEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 21, Greg Becker was lucky enough to do many of the things that most young 
people only dream about -- surf on tropical beaches, explore long-lost 
shipwrecks, witness the wildlife of Africa -- and he traveled around the world 
for next to nothing. Now he's written a book to help other like-minded 
adventurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker joined on as a crew member on ocean-going yachts. He spent the better 
part of three years circling the globe almost twice. 
</P>
<P>
 While working in a dockyard in California, he connected with a family looking 
for assistance with sailing their 97-foot vessel. The relationship was a good 
one, and after the first year he was made captain. He spent almost two years 
with the family and covered 35,000 miles, visiting 42 countries. Eventually he 
was even able to arrange for two high-school buddies to join the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every arrangement is as ideal, but with the right information and skills, 
good opportunities to travel do exist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Seagoing Hitchhiker's Handbook: Roaming the Earth on Other People's 
Yachts," covers the skills that would make you most desirable, such as pre-trip 
planning, money matters, where to look and when, what to consider before 
signing on, captain and crew relationships and a listing of the best-traveled 
cruising routes. 
</P>
<P>
 The handbook describes how ship owners are influenced by the weather to travel 
known routes during certain seasons. This is the kind of information that's 
invaluable to would-be crews. Being in the right place at the right time, with 
some desirable skills (seamanship, cooking, engine repair or coastal 
navigation) puts you in the strongest position. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also learn that although you might be lucky enough to travel for next 
to nothing, you can't count on it. Some owners require crews to contribute to a 
food kitty. Because you are not traveling with a round-trip plane ticket, you 
may also need to have money available for posting a bond (i.e. $1,500 in the 
South Pacific), which is refundable when you leave a country. This ensures a 
country, especially one such as Tahiti, that you will indeed go home and not 
become a beach bum. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequent question Becker is asked? How safe is this for women? 
</P>
<P>
 After talking with women who have traveled this way, he offers the following 
suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 * The best arrangements to look for are ships sailed by families or couples. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't pick a ship that has you heading right out to sea. Try to hook up with 
one that is traveling down a coast first so there are ports and opportunities 
to change your plans if you are not comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before you commit, pay attention to where the ship is going to wind up. You 
should try for a ship that is going to leave you at another busy port, so 
you'll have the opportunity to be choosy about whom you'll join up with for the 
next leg of your journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker never really had a bad experience, but he attributes this in part to 
trusting his gut. There was a time when he was in New Zealand and was 
approached by a woman looking for crew. Although he couldn't put his finger on 
a problem, he just wasn't comfortable and decided to pass. Several years later 
on a beach in California, oddly enough, he met the man who had signed on 
instead of him. It had been a terrible journey, in tight quarters with an owner 
with unpredictable behavior. The crew had departed at first opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of opportunities, so you should be able to filter out the bad 
situations," Becker says. Erring on the side of caution is wise though. You 
want to be sure that you won't be crossing any borders with illegal goods that 
you could be held responsible for. 
</P>
<P>
 You can order "The Seagoing Hitchhiker's Handbook: Roaming the Earth on Other 
People's Yachts," by calling High Adventure Publishing at (800) 352-6657. The 
price is $11.95 plus $3.50 for shipping.

 My husband and I are third-generation Californians, born and raised in San 
Francisco, and when we travel to our favorite city to visit friends and 
relatives, we also go there to eat at our favorite restaurants. I cannot 
understand how S. Irene Virbila recommends mostly French restaurants and 
eliminates the excellent Italian places ("Where Should I Eat?" Oct. 16).Also, 
in selecting the Top 10 why not mention Tadich's (best seafood restaurant) or 
one of the many excellent Chinese restaurants? For travelers with just three 
nights, don't make it mostly French, even though Virbila loves it!

RIO CRUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My husband and I took the cruise from Buenos Aires to San Juan, Puerto Rico, 
on the Crystal Harmony ("Shipboard Samba Down to Rio," Oct. 2). Everything 
Shirley Slater and Harry Basch reported in their article was accurate and we 
also enjoyed the trip.However, our experience at the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro 
was not the delight we expected (especially at $180 each), and I really laughed 
when I read, "Security at the stadium is well enforced, and you're sitting 
among your fellow cruise ship passengers in a reserved area."  
</P>
<P>
 After the buses dropped us off at the Sambodromo, the tour leader asked us to 
follow him into the stadium so he could show us to our seats. What a sight! 
Thousands of people were jostling and pushing trying to find any seat, let 
alone their "reserved" one. The tour leader pointed to a certain section, told 
us to look for our seats and then he left us. It was absolutely impossible to 
find our assigned seats since they were all taken. Some of the people from the 
ship left, but we decided to stay, so we jostled, shoved and pushed, too, until 
we found two spaces. To add to the discomfort of the evening, it was raining, 
hot and humid.  
</P>
<P>
 Would I recommend this excursion to the Carnival? Yes, but people should be 
warned of what can happen. We enjoyed the experience -- it was breathtakingly 
beautiful.

IS IT SPEAKER GINGRICH -- OR PRIME MINISTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David M. Kennedy, David M. Kennedy is the Donald J. McLachlan Professor of 
History at Stanford University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newt Gingrich, former historian and future Speaker of the House, recently 
described himself as a "student of Walpole, Jefferson and Gladstone." The 
Jefferson part is clear enough; but the other refer ences are intriguing -- and 
more than a little unsettling. Robert Walpole, of course, was the 18th-Century 
English statesman considered the first prime minister of Britain. William 
Gladstone was the great 19th-Century Liberal reformer whose clashes with his 
Tory rival, Benjamin Disraeli, still echo loudly in the history books. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1879, Gladstone, then age 70 and a once-and-future prime 
minister, was a candidate for election to Parliament from the district of 
Midlothian, near Edinburgh. He betook himself aboard a train in London, 
proceeded north toward his constituents in Scotland -- and made history. The 
"Midlothian campaign" marked the first time in British political experience 
that a party leader made a "national" electoral appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Political etiquette had dictated that parliamentary candidates should 
communicate rather formally with their limited electorates, often in writing, 
and virtually never campaign outside their districts. But in 1879, Gladstone 
"stumped the country," rousing audiences at train stations in Liverpool, 
Glasgow and other stops with his passionate oratory, redolent of high Victorian 
moralism. 
</P>
<P>
 Disraeli and Queen Victoria alike were disgusted at this vulgar display -- a 
lamentable product, they sniffed, of the recent democratization of the 
electorate in the reform law of 1867. When the results came in, returning 
Gladstone as prime minister in a new Liberal government, Disraeli and the queen 
were not merely disgusted but also, in the measured words of a standard British 
history, "sincerely surprised -- which shows how little the workings of a 
democratic electorate had yet come to be understood." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, history offers to stunned and reeling American Democrats, a century and 
a quarter later, a rare opportunity to share the experience of fellow-feeling 
with both a monument of conservatism and a famous monarch. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gladstone was waging the Midlothian campaign, Woodrow Wilson, then a 
graduate student who, like Gingrich, would abandon academia for politics, 
published an appreciative essay, in which he declared, "I do not know of anyone 
among modern statesmen whose character is worthier of study and imitation than 
is Mr. Gladstone's" -- a sentiment Gingrich evidently shares. Admiration for 
Gladstone, and for the British parliamentary system in general, animated 
Wilson's Ph.D thesis, published in 1885 as "Congressional Government" and still 
a classic diagnosis of the U.S. political system.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, given Wilson's later career, "Congressional Government" analyzed 
the presidency only briefly. Its main concern was Congress -- specifically, the 
House of Representatives. Even today -- especially today -- it makes for 
interesting reading. For it offers a stinging indictment of the House for its 
obscurantism, inefficiency and unaccountability. "Its complicated forms and 
diversified structure confuse the vision," Wilson wrote. Its customs "baffle 
and perplex and astound the new member." Bills were introduced in profusion, to 
no effect. "A bill committed (to committee) is a bill doomed," said Wilson. "It 
crosses a parliamentary bridge of sighs to dim dungeons of silence whence it 
will never return." 
</P>
<P>
 The House worked, Wilson mocked, on the principle of "disintegration," 
fracturing power among 47 standing committees whose deliberations were largely 
cloistered from public view and where the special interests of the day could 
quietly work their will. "Power and strict accountability for its use are the 
essential constituents of good government," Wilson wrote. Yet, "the more power 
is divided, the more irresponsible it becomes. It is, therefore, manifestly a 
radical defect in our federal system that it parcels out power and confuses 
responsibility as it does." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody stands sponsor for the policy of the government," Wilson complained. 
"A dozen men originate it; a dozen compromises twist and alter it; a dozen 
offices whose names are scarcely known outside of Washington put it into 
execution." This deliberate unaccountability, said Wilson, was "the defect 
which interprets all the rest." One odd result of this systematic splintering 
of power and responsibility, Wilson marveled, was "the extraordinary fact that 
the utterances of the Press have greater weight and are accorded greater 
credit, though the Press speaks entirely without authority, than the utterances 
of Congress, though Congress possesses all authority." Remember, these comments 
were made in 1885, not 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers in Wilson's day had abundant reason to be exasperated with Congress 
-- indeed, with government in general. A series of weak presidencies after the 
Civil War effectively devolved power to the House and Senate, where slender and 
unstable party majorities produced protracted deadlock. Reconstruction 
sputtered to an inconclusive end, depression racked the country in the 1870s, 
rapid urbanization, quickening industrialization and swelling immigration were 
all transforming the character of the country, yet the federal government 
wallowed and floundered in partisan paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the figure of the House Speaker, Wilson saw some hope. The Speaker, he 
wrote, was "a constitutional phenomenon of the first importance." As a 
presiding officer, the Speaker had to be impartial. But as majority party 
leader, the Speaker potentially possessed the power of "an autocrat of the 
first magnitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years after "Congressional Government" appeared, a Speaker arose who 
seized that potential and exercised it robustly: Republican Thomas B. Reed of 
Maine. A huge and caustic man with a restless impatience, Reed had chafed since 
his election to the House in 1876 at its preposterously cumbersome procedures 
-- "like trying to run Niagara through a quill," Reed said, in a characteristic 
flourish of the rhetorical lash that kept his adversaries cringing. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected Speaker in 1889, Reed almost single-handedly rewrote the House rules 
to strip the minority Democrats of power -- especially the power to obstruct by 
dilatory motions and filibuster. Most notoriously, he changed the definition of 
a quorum from a count of members voting to members present, while frustrated 
Democrats, waving the old rule book, vainly denied they were legally present. 
</P>
<P>
 The new "Reed Rules" ended the minority's ability to filibuster. Combined with 
Reed's iron control over his own party -- including his appointment of all 
committee chairs and committee members -- the new rules earned their author the 
title "Czar Reed." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed broke the legislative logjam of the preceding two decades, and unloosed a 
flood of legislation that won for his 51st Congress a lasting historical 
reputation as the first "Billion-Dollar Congress." But however much his fellow 
Americans may have appreciated his legislative efficiency, they gagged on his 
fiscal profligacy, and turned Reed and his Republicans out of power at the next 
election. (They were back again in 1894, and controlled the House for the next 
decade and a half.) 
</P>
<P>
 The "Reed Rules" remained largely in place until egregiously misused by Reed's 
uncouth protege, Rep. Joseph G. Cannon, sometimes known as "the Hayseed from 
Illinois" or, simply, "Foulmouth Joe." In 1910, a coalition of Democrats and 
progressive Republicans clipped Cannon's wings, taking away his power to 
appoint committee chairs and members, and denying him membership on the 
powerful Rules Committees, the principal loci of power in the House, in a 
reversion to the diffused, unwieldy system that had so agitated Wilson. For 
better or worse, we have essentially lived with that system ever since. No 
Speaker since 1919 has exercised the kind of power Reed and Cannon did -- until 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gingrich now proposes, like Reed a century ago, to streamline House 
procedures, effectively silence the minority's voice and whip his own party 
into an obedient body that can govern effectively and legislate into being the 
much ballyhooed "Contract With America." Like Reed, he may well earn the 
gratitude of his countrymen for resurrecting the moribund legislative branch, 
palsied for a generation by its own Byzantine procedures and accumulated 
deferences. 
</P>
<P>
 But make no mistake: Gingrich intends not only to revivify Congress but also 
to establish what Wilson called "congressional supremacy." This concentration 
of power in the legislature, and especially in the Speaker, implies nothing 
less than making the American system into a de facto version of the British 
system of "party government." 
</P>
<P>
 "The British system," Wilson wrote, "is perfected party government. No effort 
is made in the Commons, such as is made in the House of Representatives, to 
give the minority a share in law-making. The responsibility for legislation is 
saddled upon the majority." 
</P>
<P>
 This system may answer our demand for action in Washington -- but it also 
implies a fundamental challenge to our constitutional traditions. It shifts to 
the Speaker the kind of powers of initiative wielded by the President. It 
elevates the legislative branch over the executive. Indeed, in its ambition to 
invest the voice of the nation in a single person who has not stood for 
national election, it arguably usurps the chief function of the President. 
</P>
<P>
 That such a system can be made to work is not in doubt -- we have only to look 
to the British model. But it has never been the American system -- and Reed's 
and Cannon's attempt to adopt these methods to the nation's political habits 
did not end well. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich has already gone beyond Reed and Cannon, taking a leaf from 
Gladstone's book. His own phenomenally energetic campaigning for House 
candidates in the recent elections is without precedent in U.S. history. It 
constituted a kind of American version of Gladstone's Midlothian campaign -- an 
attempt by a legislative leader to go outside the precincts of his legislative 
institution and appeal directly to the people to be granted the mantle of 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Walpole? Does Gingrich intend to emulate his other British idol 
and become the first U.S. prime minister? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson modified his views on the proper balance between Congress and President 
when he ascended to the White House in 1913. The President, he then said, "is 
at liberty, both in law and in conscience, to be as big a man as he can." For 
the health of our own constitutional system, sanctified in more than 200 years 
of trial and triumph, it is time for President Bill Clinton to be as big a man 
as he can and check the unprecedented usurpation of power that is afoot at the 
other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.*

A PREVIEW OF LIFE IN SACRAMENTO UNDER TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 California voters may have gotten the Legislature of their electoral dreams. 
Last November, they voted against government and gridlock. Now, with the 
Assembly thrown into organizational chaos by a bruis ing speakership battle, 
Californians won't see governance for a while and gridlock is something to 
which lawmakers can only aspire. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bargain, Californians also got an Assembly that is a throwback to 
another era. Before the late Speaker Jesse M. Unruh used political favors and 
parliamentary skills to transform the job of Speaker into one of unrivaled 
legislative clout, Assembly leaders shared power with their colleagues, and the 
lower house was ruled by bipartisan coalitions. Today, with neither Republican 
Jim Brulte or Democrat Willie Brown yet able to snare the 41 votes necessary to 
seize the speakership, some legislators are reconsidering the model of a 
speakership based on bipartisan power-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 As Brown acknowledged, "It's a whole different world. . . . There never again 
will be the power that was exercised by Jesse Unruh, Bob Monagan, Leo McCarthy 
and Willie Brown . . . that era has passed. And for those of us who really 
care, it's time to build a structure that works in light of the new 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 This latest speakership battle, like others before it, mirrors the political 
environment in which it plays out. It offers a preview of life under term 
limits in a cynical, mean-spirited and rootless political world. 
</P>
<P>
 Term limits will produce a more inexperienced, less institutionally grounded 
breed of legislator. The 40-member Assembly Republican caucus includes 18 
lawmakers who are serving their first term. Twelve have served no more than one 
full term. GOP leader Brulte has only four years of service, as compared with 
Brown's 30-year tenure. Many voters will breathe a sigh of relief at those 
statistics. But hold on. 
</P>
<P>
 The inexperience of Assembly Republicans has contributed to their ineptitude 
in sparring with Brown. If legislative greenhorns can't count to 41, how long 
will it take them to learn how to pass a budget? 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly's ability to organize, let alone govern, may be hampered by 
chronic instability -- a condition triggered by the need for special election 
after special election to replace legislators who jump to other offices to 
cheat the term-limit clock. 
</P>
<P>
 That's already boxed in Brulte. GOP Assemblyman Richard L. Mountjoy, who won 
both reelection to the Assembly and a special election to the state Senate, is 
in the middle of the fight over lower-house control. Mountjoy wants to stay in 
the Assembly until a GOP Speaker is installed; the Democrats want him gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the voters may be the biggest losers in this game of musical chairs. 
In a closely divided Assembly, each vacancy can trigger a battle for control of 
the house and every political fight takes time and energy away from the making 
of public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall election is fast emerging as the new political weapon of choice. 
Republicans have already launched a recall drive against Republican Paul V. 
Horcher, whose political apostasy deadlocked the house. Democrats are 
threatening a retaliatory recall against GOP Assemblyman Steve Kuykendall, a 
Brulte supporter, whose narrow victory was propelled by a huge last-minute 
contribution by the Philip Morris tobacco company. If legislators must 
continually fight holding actions to retain their seats, when will they find 
time to serve their constituents? Will there ever be a quorum ready to do the 
public's business? 
</P>
<P>
 Before Unruh institutionalized the Speaker's role in selecting, electing and 
protecting Assembly members, loyalty to the leader was based on personal and 
ideological factors rather than on partisan affiliation or campaign support. 
Lacking the modern leaders' institutionalized system of rewards and 
punishments, pre-Unruh Speakers relied on collegiality and sociability to build 
and sustain governing coalitions. Indications are that these leadership 
characteristics will again assume heightened importance in the post-Proposition 
140 Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher's defection underscores that. His decision to support Brown over 
Brulte was more about personal revenge than political expediency. He has long 
smarted from slights by, and clashes with, Brulte and the GOP caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte hasn't been around the Legislature long enough to remember that there 
are two axioms of politics that apply to a leader who has little power to 
punish his membership. The first is: "Get it in writing." (Brulte, it appears, 
never did.) The second is, as an old-school legislator put it: "Friendship is 
the most corrupting influence in politics." Brown's been around long enough to 
have served in a legislative process in which friendship frequently outweighed 
partisanship; Brulte hasn't. That's why Horcher's behavior threw the GOP 
leadership so badly off balance. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, all the political maneuverings, closed-door plotting and 
blueprints for ballot-box revenge are just so much inside baseball to most 
Californians. The current Capitol tomfoolery has not really hit the 
electorate's radar screen. Perhaps that's what Democrats and Republicans are 
banking on. But the fracas is bound to get voters' attention if things aren't 
settled in a timely manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the 63-day state budget impasse a couple of years back? Voters only 
turned their attention to it when the lack of a budget agreement began to 
adversely affect their lives, when the specter of suspended government services 
and payments threatened to hit them directly. Or, in most cases, when the media 
finally told Californians they were being affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The media has already embraced the speakership saga as the political 
equivalent of the soap opera "Dynasty." That increases the odds that voters 
will focus on the leadership dilemma. And when they do, it can only increase 
their cynicism and disgust with politics-as-usual. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news for Democrats is that they will likely get a stronger dose of 
voter anger than their GOP colleagues. This has little to do with GOP charges 
that Brown and the Democrats have "stolen" the speakership election. It's just 
that Californians continue to view Brown as the poster child for everything 
that's wrong with Sacramento. And they are more likely to visit their 
frustration with government on him and his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown long ago began relinquishing the real power of the speakership -- the 
ability to shape and move a broad policy agenda -- to maintain his hold on the 
perks and privileges of the office. On one level, this latest speakership 
battle is another round in Brown's -- and the Assembly Democrats' -- effort to 
"hold on." But it's also more. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, the Unruh model of an activist leader has given way to the Brown 
model of a Speaker who is little more than a glorified commodities broker, 
bartering deals among competing interests. Now it appears the role of Speaker 
will change dramatically once again. 
</P>
<P>
 There can be no doubt that there is need for bipartisan cooperation, if a 
closely divided house is to function in this volatile political climate. But if 
things continue as they are in Sacramento, whoever wins the speakership fight 
will assume an office far removed from the Unruh model and closer to that of 
the Queen of England -- the powerless head of a very large, dysfunctional 
family.*

MARGIN CALL; ORANGE COUNTY'S ROMANCE WITH HIGH YIELDS HAS A HIGH PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles R. Morris, Charles R. Morris, a Wall Street consultant, is the 
author of The Cost of Good Intentions, an analysis of the New York fiscal 
crisis. His most recent book is Computer Wars: How the West Can Win in a 
Post-IBM World (Times Books). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you borrow money from your Uncle Eddie to bet at the race track, it's fun 
as long as you keep on winning, but very unpleasant if you lose -- particularly 
if he kept your car as collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 That's basically what Robert L. Citron, the just-resigned Orange County 
treasurer did with the money in the county investment pool. He borrowed about 
$12 billion to buy government bonds and notes that he thought would rise in 
value. But he guessed wrong, and his lenders, like your Uncle Eddie, have sold 
off the collateral. The eventual cash losses to the participating local 
governments could far exceed earlier estimates of $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as shocking is the failure of oversight, from the state Treasurer's 
office right down to the Orange County Board of Supervisors. Citron made no 
secret of what he was doing, and any competent professional would have 
understood how exposed he was. But because his returns were so good for so 
long, everyone pretended that merry-go-rounds never stop. The behavior of 
Merrill Lynch, Citron's primary investment adviser over the past year or so, is 
even more disgraceful. By all accounts, Merrill rang up huge investment fees by 
feeding Citron's recklessness like a bartender pushing drinks on a drunk 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
 The root cause of the fiasco is that California, as is now so painfully 
obvious, has no effective standards for monitoring how local governments 
invest. With so much taxpayer money at stake, such neglect is indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years ago, California kept control by imposing rigid legislative limits 
on local investment alternatives. Citron himself pushed through reforms that 
lightened up the old rules. He was not wrong to do so. Intelligent use of 
derivatives, for example, will allow a conservative manager to insulate his 
portfolio from sudden ups and downs in the market. But it appears, despite 
warnings, that no one ever looked over Citron's shoulder to see what he was 
doing -- not the state Treasurer, not the bond-rating agencies, not the county 
supervisors. If they had, they would have seen that he was behaving recklessly, 
to the point where a massive comeuppance was virtually inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The local jurisdictions investing in the Orange County pool -- some were 
legally mandated to keep their funds in the pool -- are not the sort of 
high-rollers who can afford unpleasant surprises. This is taxpayer money 
targeted for specific public purposes, like pensions and capital construction. 
Preservation of principal by low-risk investing at market returns should be the 
core strategy. Allocating a small portion of the pool for so-called "enhanced" 
return investing would have been reasonable -- but never the kind of wholesale 
gambling Citron indulged in. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, Citron's portfolio looks conservative since it consists 
almost entirely of high-quality government bonds and notes -- but few amateur 
investors realize how risky such instruments can be. If the government makes a 
promise to pay you interest of, say, $5 a year, forever, there is no question 
it will keep that promise. The risk comes when you need cash and try to sell 
that promise on the open market. If interest rates are 5%, the promise to pay 
$5 a year forever will be worth about $100. If interest rates are 10%, the same 
promise will be worth only about $50. The resale value of the bond, that is, 
changes quite dramatically when interest rates move up and down. The 
government's 30-year bond changes in value about 10% for every 1% change in 
interest rates. The 10-year note moves about 7% for every 1% change in rates. 
Since 10-year rates have gone up about 2% this year, the market value of a 
10-year note has gone down about 14%. If you bought $1,000 worth of 10-year 
notes a year ago, you could sell them today for only about $860. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Citron's problems are being blamed on investments in mysterious 
"derivatives," it is far simpler than that. He borrowed money to buy bonds, 
betting interest rates would fall and the value of the bonds would go up. He 
could then sell the bonds, pay off his loans and pocket a big profit for the 
pool. (He didn't actually have to sell anything; instead, he would just book a 
daily paper profit, and renew the loans.) Since interest rates fell year after 
year for more than 10 years, it was a strategy that paid big dividends for a 
long time. Citron looked like a genius, and the pool investors began to count 
on his hefty returns to infuse cash into local budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's luck turned when the long downward trend in interest rates bottomed 
out in late 1993, then began to turn sharply up earlier this year. Instead of 
helping Citron unwind his positions and minimize his losses, Merrill stuffed 
the Orange County portfolio with some $4 billion in government mortgage-pool 
investments -- far more volatile instruments than conventional bonds and notes. 
</P>
<P>
 As Citron's cash reserves began to run out, Merrill even underwrote a 
billion-dollar Orange County note issue, allegedly without telling investors it 
was designed to shore up Citron's collapsing position with his lenders. If 
investors were not fully informed of the purpose of the note sale, and the 
state of Citron's pool (on first blush, it is not likely that they were -- even 
by Wall Street's elastic standards), both Orange County and Merrill could be 
guilty of fraud. The Securities and Exchange Commission has already begun an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier last week, Orange County officials stressed that Citron's losses were 
just "paper" losses -- since the government will eventually pay off all its 
bonds and notes. But that's not the way the world works. When banks lend money 
to buy bonds, they keep the bonds as collateral. As the value of Citron's bond 
portfolio dropped, he had to keep coughing up additional collateral in the form 
of cash. As a consequence, the bank loans were always fully secured -- while 
the pool's cash reserves ran down from more than $2 billion to almost nothing 
in just a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 When the banks finally decided that Citron could no longer come up with cash 
to meet their collateral calls, they refused to renew their loans, plunging the 
pool into default and precipitating the current crisis. Ironically, Merrill, 
who was obviously getting paid coming and going, was one of the banks that cut 
off the loans and forced the default. Most people might find that slimy, but it 
apparently fits Wall Street's notion of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the bank loans were fully collateralized, the banks are not at risk. 
They will keep the cash and sell the bonds for whatever they can get. CS First 
Boston has reportedly already gotten out of a large position relatively 
cleanly. As the banks unwind their collateral positions, Orange County's 
losses, now estimated at somewhere between $1.5 and $2 billion, will be 
"realized" -- that is, will become actual cash losses. The bankruptcy 
proceedings will slow that process down, but there's no question how it will 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy is a scary word -- but in all likelihood, it will not have a 
disastrous impact on the county. Local government operations will continue 
unimpeded, although there may be temporary cash squeezes that could cause some 
districts to delay payments on their bonds. The main reason for the bankruptcy 
declaration is to head off a run on the investment pool, so Citron's positions 
can be unwound in a more or less orderly fashion, which is just common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact remains that Citron and his allies on Wall Street managed to 
spirit away at least $2 billion of local government money. That is not chump 
change. The county, and its constituent local governments, are rich enough to 
absorb the blow -- but over the next few years, local taxpayers will have to 
stump up that much extra cash, or endure reduced levels of government services 
until their nest eggs are back in order. 
</P>
<P>
 There are scattered reports from around the country that many other local 
governments may have been lulled, or lured, or wittingly walked into, the same 
kind of dangerous investment strategies. One hopes that state Treasurers or 
controllers are hopping on their motorcycles. There is no need to legislate 
permissible investments or to outlaw "derivatives," but merely to exercise 
common sense. The huge risks in Citron's strategy were so apparent to 
professionals that they were even a campaign issue in his last election. 
Waiting for accidents to happen will only ensure they are far worse than they 
ought to be.*

THE WORLD; IN THE KNOW: THE LOSS OF DENIABILITY ON INTELLIGENCE OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Powers, Thomas Powers, a contributing editor to Opinion, is the 
author of The Man Who Kept the Secrets: Richard Helms and the CIA (Knopf). His 
most recent book is Heisenberg's War: The Secret History of the German Bomb 
(Little Brown). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin marched to the brink of war with a 
breakaway region of the Caucasus Mountains recently, then backed off at the 
last minute when friends and enemies alike raised a clamor of protest. Then 
late last week, he authorized the use of force against unspecified militias in 
the region. This back-and-forth approach reveals much about the operating style 
of Russian intelligence organizations since the dissolution of the old KGB in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 As always with intelligence operations, the story is complicated. Indeed, 
complexity is the first guarantee of secrecy for intelligence operations the 
world over. But the case of the mountainous homeland of the Chechen people, 
once sorted out, proves covert operations in the classic style are increasingly 
difficult to conceal in a world where even ordinary citizens have caught on to 
the unmistakable signs of hidden manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Readers will recall that the numerous republics trapped in the old Soviet 
Union separated quickly after a failed coup attempt in Moscow by hard-liners 
back in 1991, but it may have been forgotten that many regions of what has been 
called Russia since the time of the czars were also eager to go their own way. 
One, the autonomous region (not republic) of Chechnya, declared independence 
under the leadership of a former Soviet air force general, Dzhokar Dudayev. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chechen people were never reconciled to their conquest in the 19th 
Century; and their expulsion from their homeland by Josef Stalin during World 
War II is still bitterly resented by survivors who returned. Dudayev was widely 
supported, but ethnic Russians living in the region did not want to sever ties 
with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 In desperate need of Western aid and fearful of alarming potential donors in 
the West, Yeltsin let the republics go -- but did what he could to hold on to 
the restive regions in Russia itself, short of sending in the army. He refused 
to recognize Dudayev's declaration of independence and offered quiet support -- 
many details are still lacking -- for Chechnya groups who wanted to remain part 
of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the struggle turned military in nature and fighting began to 
escalate. Chechen rebels supporting Dudayev charged that the opposition was 
financed and controlled by Russia. Moscow denied it. The Chechens claimed the 
opposition forces were commanded by Russians and included Russian soldiers. 
Moscow denied it. The Chechens protested that an air raid on the Chechen 
capital of Grozny, killing nine civilians Dec. 1, was conducted by Russian 
planes flown by Russian pilots. Moscow denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Yeltsin issued an ultimatum: If a cease-fire was not reached in the 
region of Chechnya, Russia would formally intervene with its army to restore 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 Does all this sound familiar? Detail by detail, the unfolding events in 
Chechnya mirrored the U.S. plan of nearly 35 years ago to invade Cuba and 
topple Fidel Castro's government -- plans formed and half-carried out not once, 
but twice. The initial attempt was too big to hide. First, U.S. bombers raided 
Castro's airfields. The State Department, backed up by the U.S. ambassador to 
the United Nations, Adlai E. Stevenson, insisted the pilots were Cuban 
defectors, the planes belonged to Castro, the government of John F. Kennedy had 
nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a flotilla of ships landed a thousand armed men on a beach along a 
stretch of Cuba's southern coast called the Bay of Pigs. The U.S. State 
Department again insisted the fighters were simply Cuban patriots, the force 
had armed and trained itself, the United States had nothing to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 If Castro had taken longer to crush the invading force, the plan would have 
called for the invaders to declare a new provisional government. Then, 
according to the scenario worked out by the CIA officers behind the operation, 
Washington would have recognized the rebel government and intervened with U.S. 
troops "to restore order," if necessary -- or so it was hoped by the principal 
puppet-masters, CIA director Allen W. Dulles and his deputy, Richard M. Bissell 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy manfully shouldered the blame -- but was furious at the failure. Less 
well-known is the fact that the President charged his brother, then Atty. Gen. 
Robert F. Kennedy, with overseeing a second attempt. Brought in to run the show 
was Maj. Gen. Edward G. Lansdale, the psychological-warfare expert who had 
helped the government of the Philippines defeat a communist insurgency. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansdale's master plan, often derided as unrealistic, called for an aggressive 
campaign of covert operations culminating in a victory parade through the 
streets of Havana before the congressional elections in November, 1962. What 
actually happened in November, 1962, it will be remembered, was a collective 
worldwide sigh of relief at the peaceful resolution of the Cuban missile 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Lansdale's program and his paramilitary raids on Cuban sugar refineries and 
the like were overshadowed by the Soviet-U.S. confrontation that appeared to 
threaten the outbreak of nuclear war. Castro knew what was going on, of course, 
but the U.S. public did not begin to see through the veil of secrecy until the 
mid-1970s -- when a Senate committee investigated the Central Intelligence 
Agency, including the efforts to assassinate Castro that had been a central 
feature of Lansdale's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The comic side of these plots -- which involved poisoned cigars, the Mafia, a 
fountain pen rigged to inject a deadly toxin and even exploding sea shells -- 
convinced many observers that Lansdale's whole program promised nothing more 
than an embarrassing sideshow dominated by keystone cops. 
</P>
<P>
 But whenever an intelligence operation looks like a joke, look again. In this 
case, as is so often, there is a missing piece in the Lansdale timetable 
between blowing up sugar refineries and the victory parade. CIA officers who 
worked with Lansdale point out that major U.S. military exercises were carried 
out in the Caribbean in August, 1962, and insist Lansdale had the agreement of 
the White House to provide in 1962 what had been refused at the Bay of Pigs -- 
open U.S. military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 This has always been denied by those in the Kennedy Administration, but a 
former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who must remain nameless, 
once told me that there were plenty of people I might ask for the details of 
the anti-Castro operation in 1962 -- that it was discussed in detail at regular 
meetings of high officials from the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, most Cuban planning meetings were attended by the secretary of 
the Army at the time -- Cyrus R. Vance. If he couldn't make it, the Army's 
chief lawyer might attend in his place, Joseph A. Califano Jr.; or perhaps his 
military aide would sit in, a bright young Army major named Alexander M. Haig 
Jr. More recently, one of Lansdale's assistants at the CIA said his boss was no 
fool; he had no illusions that paramilitary "boom and bang" would topple 
Castro, or that propaganda leaflets dropped by the CIA would trigger a popular 
uprising. All that was just window-dressing. The victory parade would follow 
direct U.S. military intervention -- "to restore order." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kennedy-Lansdale plan never worked out -- and neither did Yeltsin's. In 
his case, the problem was that everyone caught on to the "secret" plan from the 
start. Dudayev's forces captured a score of Russian military men who said they 
had been recruited and paid well by the Federal Counterintelligence Service, a 
remnant of the old KGB now known by its Cyrillic initials, FSK. Political 
opponents ridiculed the Yeltsin government's feeble claim that the soldiers 
were "volunteers" -- an excuse that worked better for President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower back in the more-innocent 1950s, when U.S. pilots involved in a CIA 
operation were captured in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 The story about the "volunteers" was the first to go, exploded by detailed 
reports of dealing with the FSK. Next was the Yeltsin threat to send in Russian 
troops to "restore" order -- fighting had been started by the Russians in the 
first place, and everyone knew it. Instead, Yeltsin sent his defense minister, 
Pavel S. Grachev, to meet with Dudayev and call a truce. They met in 
Ordzhonikidzevskaya, a small town named after Sergo Ordzhonikize, one of the 
founders of the Soviet Union's first intelligence service. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ordzhonikidzevskaya, Grachev took back all of Yeltsin's threats of war, and 
then conceded, almost as an afterthought, that yes, it was true, the planes and 
pilots who raided Grozny were Russian. There was no secret to give away -- the 
Chechens and everybody else knew an old trick when they saw one.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; JACQUES PARIZEAU; CREATING A NEW NATION FROM 
FRENCH QUEBEC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Craig Turner, Craig Turner is The Times' Canada correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To his admirers, Jacques Parizeau is the avuncular, albeit formal, ex-college 
professor and economist, focused with brilliant intensity on a nearly 
30-year-old dream of making his native province of Quebec a new nation, 
independent from the rest of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 To detractors, he is an arrogant fantasist, dwelling on archaic rivalries 
between English- and French-speaking Canadians and bent on breaking up a 
country that a recent U.N. study ranked the world's most livable. 
</P>
<P>
 Parizeau, 64, was elected premier of Quebec on Sept. 12, on a platform of 
independence and a promised province-wide referendum on the issue within 10 
months. It should have been a moment of undeniable triumph for Parizeau, leader 
of the Parti Quebecois, which has long advocated separation as the best route 
for preserving Quebec's French language and culture in North America. Instead, 
his victory was immediately cast as ambiguous, at best. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parti Quebecois won only 44.7% of the popular vote, well below what was 
forecast. That was good enough for 77 seats in the 125-member provincial 
Parliament, only because the opposition was split between two other major 
parties, the Liberals and the Parti Action Democratique. Meanwhile, polls show 
support for independence -- or sovereignty as it's called here -- dropping to 
between 32% and 42% of the Quebec electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline troubles some separatists, notably Lucien Bouchard, opposition 
leader in the Canadian national Parliament and Parizeau's sometimes uneasy 
partner in the movement for Quebec sovereignty. Bouchard has said there 
shouldn't be a referendum until the separatists are sure they can win. (This 
interview was conducted before Bouchard's recent life-threatening illness.)  
</P>
<P>
 If Parizeau is disheartened, however, he does not show it. His only concession 
to the polls is a slight adjustment in his target date for the referendum -- 
now slated, he says, for some time in 1995. As is his custom, he concedes few 
obstacles to Quebec independence, whether it's the large public debt it would 
inherit or the concerns of Quebec's influential English-speaking minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Parizeau's politics extend into his personal life. A widower with two 
children, Parizeau, in 1992, married Lisette Lapointe, an activist in his 
political party. Talking recently in his office in the provincial capital, 
Parizeau speaks flawless English with a plummy accent -- perhaps influenced by 
his study at the London School of Economics. He is fond of irony and underlines 
it with deep laughter, but the dominant impression is of the former professor 
imparting a lesson. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: Most Americans probably see Canada as a success and a good place to 
live, even with its problems. Their first question to you might be, why do you 
want to leave it?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It's something that has matured for a long time, and that's why it 
takes such a democratic form. There is no violence. Everything is concentrated 
on the vote . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Here you have a lot of people living in a country that has an excellent 
reputation abroad, but we just refuse to live with each other . . . . 
Quebeckers have had a long history on this continent, and they've been shoved, 
moved, into all sorts of situations within Canada. When the Canadian 
confederation took place in 1867, a lot of people in Quebec said, "Could we 
have a referendum?" They said, "Oh, no. In the British tradition, the 
Parliament can do anything, excluding changing a man into a woman, and, 
therefore, no referendum" -- and that was that. We entered confederation. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, we're nice. We say we're going to have a referendum before 
we get out. That's a remarkable improvement in relation to the shoving that 
we've known in the past . . . . People (in Quebec) are rather confident that 
they can define their own future, and we've come to the point where we're going 
to define our own future. So it's a long, long evolution, with times when it 
was one step forward, two steps backward, and times when it was two steps 
forward, one step backward. But we're coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it still your intention to have the referendum on independence in 1995?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The latter part of '95, the early part of '95? When?  
</P>
<P>
 A: On the path of history, who gives a damn? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The latest polls show opposition to sovereignty at around 60% of Quebec 
voters, and no sovereigntist party or position has ever won a majority vote in 
Quebec. Given that, what's the source of your optimism that you will win a 
majority vote for independence?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I'll put the question the other way around: How do you have an idea as 
potent as the independence of a country that, in vote after vote, gets between 
40% and 50% of the votes and say, "I'm sure it'll vanish"? Some politicians can 
be more skillful than others and get beyond the 50%. Others might be less 
skillful and get below 50%. I can't say, "I'm a superb tactician and I'm sure 
I'll get beyond 50%." Other people will have to comment on how skillful I am. 
But it's now a question of tactics and strategy. Get me a half-dozen Ontarians 
who put their feet to the Quebec flag, and I've got it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does the United States come into this equation? Obviously, you have an 
interest in keeping the United States neutral and in getting quick U.S. 
recognition of Quebec if you win a referendum.  
</P>
<P>
 A: I can't and shouldn't imagine that the (Clinton) Administration would do 
anything other than the usual words: "'We prefer that Canada remain as a whole, 
but the future lies in the hands of Canadians and Quebeckers." We're happy with 
this and, by the way, everyone is in Canada, both federalist and separatist . . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 We've been discussing with the State Department and Commerce and the National 
Security Council, "What happens, if . . . . " And it really boils down to . . . 
will we be a member of NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement)? I 
think, in relevant circles in the United States, it's well known that the trade 
between Quebec and the United States is 40% of the trade between the United 
States and Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 There are people in the States who have been discussing the fate of Chile 
within NAFTA. Trade between Quebec and the United States is nine times -- nine 
times! -- the trade between Chile and the United States. Trade been the United 
States and Quebec is 2 1/2 times the trade between the United States and 
Brazil. So, of course, we will become members of NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's quite clear, within the relevant circles in the United States, that 
the main reason why the free-trade agreement between the United States and 
Canada came through, despite considerable opposition within English Canada, was 
the fact that in Quebec it was a nonpartisan issue. Both parties (within 
Quebec) were, in fact, free traders . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There are going to be hitches. Some of the negotiators in the United States 
have never quite stomached the fact that cultural properties were excluded from 
these agreements. They obviously are going to try to reopen these talks with 
Quebec. But we won't be without allies, under such circumstances. Our best 
allies, our strongest allies, will be English Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Over the last 20 years, Quebec has become increasingly multicultural. Yet, 
the roster of Parti Quebecois members in the National Assembly is entirely 
white and only one member comes from a family that speaks English at home. Is 
this a concern to you and, if so, what do you do to improve your credibility 
with minorities and English speakers?  
</P>
<P>
 A: What you say is not entirely historically correct . . . . Mr. (Joseph) 
Facal (the Parti Quebecois M.P. from Fabre, near Montreal) does not belong to a 
visible minority, but he comes from Uruguay. He was born there. I know Uruguay 
is not among the so-called minorities, but it just happens he's from there. I 
suppose there are presentable minorities these days and non-presentable 
minorities or cultural communities. We'll never have a great number of them 
until such time as these cultural minorities split their vote. At the present 
time, they're all voting Liberal. So be it. But it doesn't represent a smear on 
our reputation . . . . It's not that we don't try, but until such time as some 
of these people in the cultural minorities will accept, will take a chance, 
with the Parti Quebecois, we won't have many representatives . . . . We always 
reach out. We will and we continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Restrictive language laws have created much controversy here. Some members 
of your party favor reimposing the ban on English on outdoor signs. Some also 
favor extending the requirement that all business be conducted in French to 
small businesses with as few as 10 employees. Do you anticipate such changes in 
the law?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We want a society that normally functions in French. Undoubtedly, that 
legislation, to start with, was a shock in our society. But it did help a great 
deal to have that thing understood, that we want to operate normally in society 
in French. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the essential things here is that businesses operate, at least 
internally, in French. Externally, if you're in contact with markets in the 
United States, you won't start to negotiate in French with St. Louis. But, 
internally, they should operate in French, as they do in French in France and 
as they do in German in Germany. That is the logical thing to do. Laws help. At 
one point, laws overkill. And that's always a question of judgment. At what 
point have your laws created enough of the environment that you've accomplished 
your purpose? 
</P>
<P>
 . . . There's a great deal to be done with respect to businesses, particularly 
small business. It's not a normal situation where you ask people here if you 
can't speak English, you can't have this or that job in a company that has 20 
employees. It's not a normal situation. So, we'll insist, and we'll go on doing 
that sort of thing, until we think we've reached a normal situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you say to young English speakers who say they don't think they can 
fulfill their potential in Quebec and need to move elsewhere?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, it's probably inevitable as a reaction, and life corrects this as 
time goes by. You can imagine being 17 or 18 and saying that sort of stuff, and 
then you realize that when you become a young parent, you send your kids to the 
English school where you went, it's still there. And when your wife is sick, 
you send her to the (English-speaking hospital) and that half the radio 
stations in Montreal are English speaking . . . . All these kids are bilingual, 
the large majority. But they say, are they (the Parti Quebecois) going to 
suppress our schools? Will the (hospitals) still be there? Well, the (hospital) 
will be there. Their schools will be there, the Montreal Repertoire Theater 
will still be there . . . . The constitution of a sovereign Quebec will 
incorporate all these things . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'd like to ask a few economic questions. Some recent analyses suggest that 
with its provincial debt and its share of Canada's national debt, an 
independent Quebec would be among the most indebted nations on Earth.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh yes, heavens, because of Canada. Canada is, and because Canada is, we 
are. They're quite right. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would that affect Quebec's ability to take on the additional 
responsibilities that come with independence?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The additional responsibilities come with additional tax sources . . . . We 
want to administer our own taxes. And we can make an effort, once we have 
shouldered our part of the debt, to try to start to stop that indebtedness. The 
situation of the federal . . . deficit is much worse than the provincial 
situation. They're in a jam now . . . . Government programs on top of one 
another, both governments trying to do the same thing with respect to the same 
people. There's a huge wastage. There's something like at least $3 billion of 
wastage because of that overlapping of federal and provincial programs . . . . 
Until we've conducted our own studies, and they've just been started, we can't 
be any more specific, but $3 billion seems a reasonable explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've said you intend to use Canadian money as Quebec currency should 
Quebec achieve independence. Isn't it a distinct disadvantage for an 
independent country to turn over its monetary policy to another nation, as you 
would be doing?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You're quite right, but as the judge says, it's the balance of 
inconvenience. We won't have anything to say on monetary policy for quite a 
while, but what else is new? All we're saying, for the present time, is look, 
we're going to have a go at administering our own taxes, defining our own laws 
and signing our own treaties. And who knows, as time goes by, and as people in 
English Canada recover their smile again, maybe we can talk a little about 
monetary policy.*

MILITARY SPENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial, "A Crucial Investment for America" (Dec. 5), is a replay of 
the Reagan years for more money for the military. The only difference is that 
your call for more money to enable the military to be able to meet assigned 
missions is different than the fight to stop communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it that throwing money at the military is always acceptable, but budget 
cuts are the only acceptable choice for all social problems? 
</P>
<P>
 Why isn't $270 billion-plus enough for the armed forces? Why do we need three 
air forces? Why do we need each of the services competing with each other 
regarding supplies, etc.? Why do we still have armed forces in Europe? Why do 
we need to spend billions of dollars on weapon systems that in many instances 
are never used or completed or become obsolete before they are completed? 
</P>
<P>
 How much could be saved by an overall review of the military and its methods 
of squandering billions of dollars? This review would provide sufficient 
dollars to meet the assigned missions.

military spending. If he trembles so at the thought of sending in ground troops 
against a motley force of tenth-rate Serb fascists, then in what situation 
could he possibly envision using such a newly fortified military? This request 
is just one more (goose) step to the right for this "liberal" President.

for Defense Isn't Enough?," Dec. 6). Living away from home is expensive, even 
if educational. Congress would not need to find so much extra money for Defense 
Department readiness if it precluded foreign adventures (Haiti, Somalia). This 
it could do by specifying that appropriated funds for consumables (fuel, 
ammunition, rations) be expended only at established bases and sea lanes, 
unless in time of war or national emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 It is high time for the legislative branch to reassert its proper role in 
foreign affairs. As things stand, Congress cowers in a shadow whenever the 
President (whoever is President) starts the meter running on a new enterprise. 
The power of the purse should be in play, because the purse is not of infinite 
capacity.

 Re "Brown Blocks GOP Assembly Takeover as 1 Republican Bolts," Dec. 6:

<P>
 I was a disappointed Republican when Diamond Bar Assemblyman Paul Horcher 
bolted our party and voted to reelect Willie Brown as Speaker. My sadness 
disappeared when I read the Rev. Louis Sheldon's implied murder threat against 
Horcher.I now congratulate Horcher for standing up to the right-wing radical 
fringe of my political party. Willie Brown is less a threat to our society than 
is Sheldon's Christian Traditional Values Coalition.

 If he felt so strongly that the Republicans in the Assembly were leaning too 
far to the right, he should have run as an independent in the election. He did 
not because he would have lost.

TAPIA REMIGIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Life at a Slow Clip" (Dec. 1) brought back memories of Tapia Remigio's act of 
kindness toward me around October, 1948. I lived in the immediate Chinatown 
area.All my peers would get their haircuts ("flat tops") from Mr. Remigio. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day after he had finished cutting my hair, I reached into my pocket to 
pay him. I rummaged through my pockets and no money was in sight. Embarrassed, 
humiliated and scared, I looked at Mr. Remigio with tears in my eyes. 
Additionally, the barber shop was filled with customers, which made my 
situation more embarrassing. He accepted my excuse that I lost the money, 
patted me on the shoulders, smiled and told me not to worry and that I could 
come back tomorrow and pay him (which I did). 
</P>
<P>
 This act may seem insignificant to many. However, his kindness to a teen-ager 
of 14 will never be forgotten. Again, thank you, Mr. Remigio.

A-BOMB STAMP

</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Re "Truman to Displace A-Bomb on Stamp," Dec. 9: 
</P>
<P>
 Scrapping the atomic bomb mushroom cloud stamp by the post office was the 
right idea, but for the wrong reason. The stamp should have had two mushroom 
clouds.It took the second bombing to convince the die-hard Japanese authorities 
to surrender a week after the first one. 
</P>
<P>
 We are dismayed that the U.S. State Department has intervened on behalf of the 
Japanese government, instead of representing the interests of millions of 
Americans (and Japanese) who are alive today because the atomic bomb brought 
such a swift end to the war.

little sense to ignore the paramount event of the war, if not the century. Wars 
are all insensitive and in bad taste and the stamps should commemorate this 
fact, regardless of whom they offend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese government still suppresses the truth about World War II; I don't 
see why the United States should collude in the Japanese amnesia.

 Richard Falk of Princeton calls them the "black holes of geopolitics." To 
others they are simply failed states, countries whose governments have become 
powerless or ceased to exist, countries collapsing in on themselves as ethnic, 
religious or tribal hatreds and fears surge over the tenuous structure of 
multiethnic community life. These are states experiencing or threatened with a 
reversion to barbarism that mocks the dream of a world where the rule of law 
prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 Somalia, Rwanda and Bosnia, victims of frightful and even genocidal civil 
strife, are the most prominent examples of failed states. Haiti provides a 
different kind of textbook case. There, for the better part of two centuries, 
an indigenous rapacious political class has thwarted progress while using 
terror to condemn the mass of people to chronic economic misery. ETHNIC 
FRICTION IS BUT ONE BREEDER OF VIOLENCE 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other potential members of this tragic club. By one estimate 
fully 40% of the world's countries count five or more sizable ethnic minorities 
among their populations. Most of these are states whose boundaries were drawn 
in the latter half of the 19th Century by expanding colonial powers or those 
carved out of the carcasses of defeated empires in the first part of this 
century, without reference to the interests or the historical grievances of 
their inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Heterogeneity does not, of course, make civil strife inevitable, any more than 
homogeneity -- witness Haiti -- assures domestic tranquillity. But it is a 
major component. Add economic crisis, selective and unforgiving historical 
memories and active political demagoguery -- all of which exist in abundance in 
crucial parts of the world -- and the stage is set for unrestrained conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 States whose disparate populations are unable to reconcile their differences 
can, of course, separate politically and territorially without collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 British India divided at independence into mostly Hindu India and mostly 
Muslim Pakistan, though not without suffering a terrible toll during the 
accompanying mass population transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently Czechoslovakia, one of a number of states to emerge out of the 
dissolved Austro-Hungarian monarchy in the aftermath of World War I, chose to 
split peacefully into two independent republics. But Czechoslovakia represents 
more of an anomaly than a model. It is hard to conceive of the feuding and 
sometimes closely intermixed populations of the states of the former Soviet 
Union or of sub-Saharan Africa, those in that "zone of conflict" where internal 
strife is most likely to occur, agreeing to peacefully put aside their 
suspicions and hatreds or suppress their often-ancient cultural differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The ugly fact confronting the world now is that the end of the Cold War has 
allowed the re-emergence of a narrow, exclusionary nationalism that demagogues 
in much of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union have been eagerly 
encouraging. Simultaneously it is all too clear that longstanding ethnic, 
tribal or religious rivalries in much of Africa could explode in horrifying 
conflict at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 The terrible suffering and political instability that are characteristic of 
collapsing states are not going to disappear. What, if anything, can 
international efforts do to prevent other states from collapsing or, absent 
that, to alleviate the brutal and tragic human consequences of their failure? 
GRIM FAILURES IN SOMALIA, BOSNIA AND RWANDA 
</P>
<P>
 Experience so far is anything but encouraging. Somalia, despite a $1.5-billion 
humanitarian rescue operation, appears even with 15,000 U.N. troops still in 
the country to have reverted to predatory clan warfare. Limited military 
"peacekeeping" operations in Bosnia under U.N. auspices have failed to stop the 
killing or deter Serbian territorial expansionism. In Rwanda quick and probably 
low-risk outside intervention mobilized by the United Nations or even 
undertaken multilaterally without official U.N. blessing almost surely could 
have prevented much of the slaughter of the Tutsi minority, which continued for 
months. But there was little stomach either in Africa or elsewhere for 
interposing a military shield between the Tutsis and their Hutu tormentors, so 
there was no organized lifesaving effort of sufficient scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Sir Brian Urquhart, former undersecretary general for special political 
affairs at the United Nations, likens dilatory U.N. actions when life-consuming 
crises erupt to a policeman getting to the scene of a crime weeks after it was 
committed. In these circumstances, he asks, how can the institution retain any 
public credibility? The Bosnia debacle gives added point to the question. 
</P>
<P>
 A fundamental part of the problem is of course institutional. The United 
Nations can act only when the Security Council authorizes it to do so, meaning 
only when there is a consensus among its five permanent, veto-empowered 
members. But even then the Security Council can only authorize; individual 
members must respond by voluntarily providing the actual military forces for 
intervening. Right now there are about 70,000 U.N. peacekeepers in the field. 
They have no trouble keeping the peace where the parties they stand between 
want the peace kept, as on Cyprus or the Golan Heights. But they cannot keep 
the peace where one or another belligerent would rather fight, as in Bosnia, 
nor can they make peace when -- again as in Bosnia -- the mandate under which 
they operate requires an impartiality that renders them all but impotent. 
</P>
<P>
 Urquhart's proposed way around at least part of this problem is for the United 
Nations to have its own troops, a small, all-volunteer standing force with the 
ability to move quickly to deal with low-level political violence. Such a rapid 
deployment force (RDF) would constitute only an initial presence, a fire 
brigade that would serve as an earnest of international intentions. By its 
ability to intervene fast, it would eliminate that "sickening pause" that 
typically occurs between the time the Security Council authorizes military 
intervention and the actual arrival of troops in the area of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Yale historian Paul Kennedy supports a U.N. RDF, noting among other reasons 
that in the absence of such a mechanism for intervening "everyone will 
(continue to) look to the United States for leadership," laying a moral and 
political responsibility on this country that in fact must be shared by the 
international community. Political scientist Richard Falk agrees, observing 
that a U.N. RDF "would actually help reduce U.S. involvement in regional crises 
while also responding to the 'CNN factor' -- the tendency of the public to 
agitate for action after viewing televised human disaster." PROBLEM OF 
'IMPARTIAL' ARMED INTERVENTION 
</P>
<P>
 The notion, though, has its cogent critics. Michael Mandelbaum, professor of 
foreign policy at Johns Hopkins, notes that the conduct of military operations 
is strictly the business of sovereign states, and "sovereignty can't be 
transferred by fiat to an international organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard K. Betts of Columbia, writing in Foreign Affairs, argues forcefully 
that U.N. military operations -- whether as currently conducted or employing a 
RDF -- will fail to arrest conflicts so long as their mandate is to remain 
evenhanded and not take sides to help shape the outcome. Impartiality works 
only when two sides are ready to stop fighting. Otherwise it only helps the 
stronger and more aggressive party. In Bosnia, "the West's attempt at limited 
but impartial involvement abetted slow-motion savagery." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear -- indeed, the high probability -- of more savagery yet to come in 
volatile parts of the world demands hard thinking about what can be done to 
prevent or mitigate such calamities. Yale's Paul Kennedy fears that Nigeria, 
Africa's most populous country, could fall apart within the next six months. He 
further points to Algeria, where success of the Islamic fundamentalist 
rebellion could jeopardize the more secularized middle-class Muslim population. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, 50 million people have been displaced by the internal conflicts of 
recent years. Millions more may soon be threatened. THE MOST BASIC QUESTION: 
JUST WHO WOULD DECIDE? 
</P>
<P>
 There are manifold practical problems with the notion of developing a standing 
U.N. interventionary force: How large would it be and how would its members be 
recruited? Where would it be based, what transport and logistics provisions 
would be made for it? How would it be paid for, who would give it orders, what 
would happen if it needed reinforcing? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps trickiest of all is the most basic challenge: How would it be decided 
where a U.N. force could be used most effectively? Plainly the number of 
possible crises in the world at any given moment that might call for 
intervention could exceed the capabilities of a U.N. rapid deployment force to 
intervene. How then would the hard choice of where to put possibly lifesaving 
resources be made? And by whom? 
</P>
<P>
 These are difficult questions that have to be carefully addressed before a 
U.N. force could become a reality. The world continues to look to the United 
States for leadership. Washington therefore should take the lead at the United 
Nations in directing thinking toward experimenting with an international RDF -- 
and in offering logistics support for its missions. That such a force will not 
lack for future employment seems sadly, grimly all too certain.

 Re "Why No Country Can Stand on Its Own," editorial, Nov. 26: 
</P>
<P>
 A North American Free Labor Agreement (NAFLA), like that called for by The 
Times, will find many friends among corporate America, but vigilant citizens 
will properly see this as a potential vehicle for revival of the much despised 
bracero program, which gave exploitation a bad name before it was killed by 
Congress decades ago. Under such a program, workers from Mexico and elsewhere 
will be given visas to work temporarily in the U.S., at permanently low (and 
poorly enforced) wages, and with no real right to organize a union on the job. 
Thousands of residents (both citizen and undocumented) already living here will 
find these bracero-assigned jobs forever closed to them and the wage and 
benefit standards in the remaining jobs severely depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Imported temporary workers, like Filipino and Chinese workers decades ago, 
will be denied the basic right to bring their families with them, and 
discontented workers will be deported. They will never have the right to vote. 
We will have the hands to tend our crops, sew our clothing, raise our children 
and wash our dishes, without the painful accountability imposed by extending to 
these new "untouchables" the American dream of family life, economic justice 
and citizenship.  
</P>
<P>
 A revived bracero program is favored by California's multimillion-dollar 
corporate agricultural industry, which wants a cheap, pliant work force to 
labor in what the Sacramento Bee called the "fields of pain" because of rampant 
wage and hour abuses. Garment manufacturers, anxious to keep their notorious 
urban sweatshops filled with powerless workers, also want to import temporary 
workers as well under a new bracero program. 
</P>
<P>
 While our community remains divided over Proposition 187, and about one-eighth 
of California's population voted to approve it, most Californians share a 
common belief in the value of family life and in the right of working people to 
eventually become citizens. We do not want disposable workers to go with our 
disposable lifestyles.  
</P>
<P>
 With politicians increasingly answerable only to the political fund-raising 
power of corporate of America, citizens can no longer accept uncritically the 
international treaties negotiated by Washington bureaucrats. Let us openly 
debate the substance of the immigration issue and reach a consensus before we 
go to the bargaining table and negotiate a NAFLA.

PANHANDLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Evanston, Ill., effort to wipe out panhandlers by "warning" or "advising" 
donors ("City Uses 'Interveners' to Thwart Panhandlers," Nov. 24) reminds me of 
an incident a year ago when I -- as usual -- handed a dollar bill to a 
panhandler on Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley. As we walked away, I told my 
companion, "Well, I may have been taken, but if he decides to buy drugs or 
booze with it, so be it."Twenty minutes later, coming back to my car, I spotted 
the bearded young man sitting on the curb, gnawing a huge turkey drumstick 
outside a cafeteria with a sign in its window: "Drumsticks, 95 special." 
</P>
<P>
 I would rather be taken 30 times than miss giving my dollar to a hungry man.

FLEEING PUBLIC SCHOOLS: THE SRB FACTOR; EDUCATION: WHY DO PARENTS SPEND BIG 
BUCKS FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS WHEN AN EXCELLENT PUBLIC SCHOOL IS NEAR? IT'S A WHITE 
THING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS F. JONES, Thomas F. Jones is a writer in Berkeley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's damned hard sustaining the illusion of a neighborhood school when you're 
the only family among nine on the block that hasn't pulled its children from 
the public-education system. And on the face of it, the reasons for this 
apparent exodus are difficult to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
 For it is generally agreed that Emerson Elementary (K-3), situated in the 
center of Berkeley's upscale Claremont-Elmwood area, is one of the safest, 
highest-rated, best-equipped and best-staffed educational institutions in the 
district. So why the antipathy? Why the relatively abrupt abandonment of their 
corporeal commitment to public education? Why, instead of conveniently walking 
their 5- to 8-year-olds to Emerson each morning, do our neighbors choose to 
shuttle them across town to private grammar schools costing up to $8,000 a 
year, with such expressively upward-driven names as Bentley and Head-Royce? 
</P>
<P>
 One can only assume there is something terribly wrong with Emerson. Is it 
class size? Religious concerns? Political objections? Possible remedies for 
these issues might have at least been discussed in the neighborhood PTA. Yet, 
inexplicably, there is nary a record of expressed concern by these parents 
either at PTA meetings or at public forums held by the school board. 
Apparently, they just cut and ran. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a classic case of "white flight," exactly -- only the subtle prelude. 
For though our neighbors have removed their children from the local school, 
they have no intention of abandoning their homes. The health of the local 
school may deteriorate, but the value and well-being of the neighborhood -- and 
for that matter, the private schools -- will probably remain constant. No, we 
must assign another name for what may be a subconscious reaction to the 
changing racial demographics (Caucasians now being virtually a minority) at 
Emerson: To be as discreet as possible, let us term it a subliminal response to 
busing -- the SRB factor. 
</P>
<P>
 However, remembering that Berkeley is a predominantly liberal town, it is 
hardly surprising that the majority of these SRB parents have also been 
supportive (at least tacitly) of Berkeley's historic voluntary desegregation 
program and doubtless voted against the 1993 voucher initiative. Operating in a 
haze of self-deception, they might easily fail to appreciate that, by denying 
less-advantaged parents economical access to private education, the SRB parents 
are essentially forcing others to bear the burden of their political beliefs 
for them. There is no hypocrisy here: For our SRB neighbors it is simply a 
matter of choice -- a preference for the finest education that money can buy. 
They know not the harm they have done. 
</P>
<P>
 The syndrome is obvious, a pattern repeated in many towns across the country 
since 1968. As wealthier neighborhood children leave the public school, a 
significant percentage of local participation and interest in the operations of 
the school and PTA (especially as regards classroom volunteering, fund-raising, 
curriculum decisions and administrative policy) evaporates. In other words, the 
SRB parents become disengaged, not only from the local public institution, but 
in a broader sense from the neighborhood school's function as a focus of 
community spirit, civic pride and the local culture itself. 
</P>
<P>
 For the remaining non-SRB parents, a feeling of betrayal soon sets in. It is 
as if their neighbors had deserted the ship, leaving them to shoulder alone the 
practical consequences of perhaps overly ambitious liberal philosophies: that 
the poorer children in the neighborhood become the sacrificial fodder in a 
two-tiered education system wherein, ironically, the upper middle class manages 
to segregate itself not only from other races, but even from the middle class. 
Thus are sown the seeds of social and economic privilege, from whose rank 
flowering comes the divisive harvest of bitterness, alienation and, ultimately, 
the flight of the average middle-class family.

PERSPECTIVE ON MIDDLE EAST; CYBERFADA -- PEACE ON THE INTERNET; HATRED AND 
WARMONGERING ARE CLOGGING THE MIDDLE EAST INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELDON TEITELBAUM, Sheldon Teitelbaum, a Los Angeles-based senior writer 
for the Jerusalem Report, served in the Israel Defense Forces as a paratroops 
corps officer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one forum for Mideast news junkies, you'll find people who insist that 
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is a fascist brute and war criminal; that 
the state of Israel has either lost its soul or never really had one, and that 
no Jewish state should seek acceptance in a region where the Koran holds sway. 
</P>
<P>
 In another forum, Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat is 
reviled as a terrorist with no place on the world stage. Here, Palestinian 
autonomy is seen as a moral travesty, arming Palestinian police with AK-47s as 
sheer lunacy and peaceful coexistence between Arab and Jew as a sacrilege. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like the same old Middle East? Not on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 The first forum is called JPOL -- standing for Jewish politics. Here, mostly 
ultra-right-wing American Jews willing to fight to the last living Israeli rage 
over the perfidies of the Israeli government while adopting the rabid rhetoric 
of their Arab enemies. The second list is called P-NET, or Palestine Net. Here, 
Palestinians and supporters -- P-Nutters -- regularly slam the terrorist leader 
they once insisted Israel recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the superhighway monkey house. 
</P>
<P>
 Common wisdom holds that the Internet contributes directly to global unity. It 
certainly helped the news get in and out of crisis spots like Beijing, Moscow 
and (after our last major earthquake) Los Angeles. But it hasn't quite wrought 
that Wellsian Utopia globalists anticipate. Indeed, in the opportunities it 
presents for frank and even vitriolic exchange of views, it may even be 
contributing to global extremism, intolerance and Balkanization. 
</P>
<P>
 This is especially true for the Middle East where, ironically, the first 
fledgling steps toward regional coexistence have been taken. In an area where 
good walls and recognized borders may make for even better neighbors, the net 
is encouraging Arabs and Jews worldwide, as well as ideologically opposed 
members of both tribes, to invade each other's living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in America would probably regard this development as ideal. Americans 
seem to believe that no problem can't be talked to death. But those Jews and 
Arabs attracted to the sudden novelty of exchanging views with lifelong enemies 
via Internet often discover that their respective self-images and world views 
have, during a full century of strife, become almost mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of such exchanges is often an embittered state of cyber-shock, not 
conducive to neighborly relations. It's not for nothing that Israelis and 
Jordanians now crossing into each other's countries in buses (rather than via 
e-mail) are urged, at least for the moment, to keep their voices down and to 
refrain from talking politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are all Arabs and Jews well-meaning -- especially on the net. Because of 
its easy accessibility and relatively wide distribution, no other venue boasts 
a greater concentration of unabashed anti-Semites, Arab bashers, skinheads, 
white supremacists, Holocaust deniers and other racists. One can certainly 
ignore the Hamas supporter who, in a recent post to a cultural discussion group 
in Israel, insisted that since Jews had killed Christ and Mohammed, it was only 
a matter of time before Hamas members too would take their places as martyrs. 
But, within several ostensibly mainstream Jewish discussion forums, right-wing 
rejectionists now hold sway. As during the heyday of the Likud, when many 
Jewish-American organizations toed a maximalist line on Israeli territorial 
aspirations, they dominate discussion through personal insult and invective, 
silencing or scaring off alternate voices with endless shouting and wanton 
charges of treason.  
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, among the Palestinians of P-Net and other such groups, there are 
many who sniff at any form of Jewish participation within their forum -- even 
from boosters like Yigal Arens, the anti-Zionist son of the former Likud 
Israeli defense minister, Moshe Arens. For many here, Jews have as much right 
to a place on the Internet as they do in the Middle East -- none. 
</P>
<P>
 For both camps, the net is a strategically placed hilltop from which to lob 
the computer equivalents of Katyusha rockets and artillery shells at the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 This behavior goes against trends on the ground. In 1967, Israel fended off a 
threatened pan-Arab military assault with a preemptory strike that led to the 
occupation of the West Bank, Sinai and Gaza. After the dust settled, the 
architect of that victory, Moshe Dayan, began to argue that day-to-day 
interaction between Arabs and Israelis within the occupied territories would 
ultimately dispel their cumulative mutual hatred. It's probably a good thing 
that Dayan didn't live to witness the Palestinian uprising that spelled an end 
to his delusions. Most observers now believe that Israeli-Palestinian 
coexistence can be achieved only by putting up a solid block wall between the 
warring parties. The problem isn't that Israelis and Palestinians don't know 
each other. As in a terminal marriage, they know each other too well. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the net is not such a good place for disengaging. Many people do not 
maintain a modicum of civility anywhere on the Internet. Gibbering and 
jabbering, those who occupy the Middle Eastern arenas threaten each other 
regularly with extinction. They do so oblivious to the fact that in the real 
world, Israelis, Egyptians, Jordanians, Tunisians, Kuwaitis and even Saudis are 
schmoozing each other routinely in places like Morocco and Cairo and the United 
Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the pitfalls of net-bound Middle East dialogue, Jewish and 
Palestinian netters alike will probably tell you the Net is ideal for dispersed 
people. Palestinians need it for community-building, Jews need it as a weapon 
against assimilation and Israelis find it a helpful, if sometimes unnerving, 
antidote to their inherent geographical claustrophobia. As for me, I suppose 
that if there has to be shooting, better it should go down in cyberspace than 
in the streets of Hebron or on the Golan Heights. Just do me a favor -- let's 
not talk about it.

LOS ANGELES CITY HALL JOURNAL: A SUMMARY OF SELECTED CITY HALL ACTIONS THIS

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * PARKER CENTER: Approved a $182,000 contract with the Sherman Oaks consulting 
firm of Kosmont and Associates to evaluate the feasibility of replacing the 
police headquarters at Parker Center with a new building. If the building is to 
remain in use, it will require extensive upgrading and remodeling, and this 
study will determine the more cost-effective course of action. 
</P>
<P>
 * REPAIRED BUILDINGS: Removed three properties from the city's Rent Escrow 
Account Program, which is designed to encourage landlords to quickly repair and 
better maintain their buildings. Once a building is placed into REAP, the 
tenants place their rents into a city account; the city keeps $50 of every rent 
payment until the landlords make the repairs. The properties were removed from 
the program because their problems, which in all cases involved earthquake 
repair, have been fixed. They are at 504 S. Bonnie Brae Street, 725 S. Witmer 
St., and 4814 S. Vermont Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 * WILSHIRE ZONING CHANGE: Approved a zoning change along Wilshire Boulevard 
between Fairfax Avenue and the Beverly Hills border that will limit the size of 
new buildings. The impetus for the change was a planned 19-story building on 
Wilshire at La Jolla Avenue that sparked outrage from residents of neighboring 
6th Street, who complained that the structure would block much of their 
sunlight. The building will be redrawn as a tapered 14-story structure designed 
to limit light blockage to nearby properties.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sylvia Lacy is looking for a few good neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that she doesn't have a few already. For two years, the dry-cleaning plant 
owner's Wellington Square Improvement Assn. has worked with close to 35 other 
block groups to assist the Los Angles Police Department's Wilshire Division in 
community crime-fighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is strength in numbers, and in order to truly effect change, a 
greater number of city blocks in the area need to join the cause, said Lacy, 
who serves on the Wilshire Community-Police Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacy and other watch-group leaders have launched a campaign to recruit block 
leaders from Mid-City neighborhoods not active in community improvement to fill 
geographic gaps in the area's crime-fighting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the area's worst zones is the Washington Boulevard corridor between La 
Brea and Redondo avenues, where motels lure prostitution and drug traffic, Lacy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of that activity gets pushed onto residential streets," she said. "On a 
street where there is a block group, it (crime) doesn't last a minute. They get 
on the phone to the police right away and nip it in the bud." 
</P>
<P>
 New block groups joining the informal coalition, which has no official name, 
learn ways to clean up their neighborhoods and get assistance from police and 
city agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Block captains from each group meet every three months to discuss trouble 
spots, distribute information, put together plans for community improvement and 
receive updates on progress, Lacy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to working with motel owners to help curb drug activity and 
prostitution along the Washington Boulevard corridor, one of the group's main 
goals is to work with local liquor store owners to decrease loitering and crime 
near the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Another goal is to polish the Washington Boulevard streetscape. Last month, 
the combined block groups planted several trees, donated by the Los Angeles 
Conservation Corps, along the corridor. A week ago, they tied 250 Christmas 
bows onto the boulevard's light fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Another tree planting is scheduled for Feb. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to really feel like a community, and improve the quality of life 
in this neighborhood," Lacy said.

 The Los Angeles Conservation Corps is joining forces with several community 
groups and businesses to spread holiday cheer through the promise of trees -- 
though not the traditional Scotch pines that grace countless corner lots this 
time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 The corps is encouraging the public to come out Saturday for "Mulch Madness" 
to help workers begin beautification of a stretch of Exposition Boulevard by 
laying down mulch as a precursor to tree plantings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulch consists of environmentally friendly wood chips that eventually 
decompose into the soil, providing a foundation for later plantings. The chips 
will be laid along Exposition from Crenshaw Boulevard to La Brea Avenue, 
sprucing up an eyesore of weeds, gravel and litter. 
</P>
<P>
 The mulching will be from 8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., beginning at Crenshaw and 
winding up at Farmdale Avenue near Dorsey High. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will also provide corps members, many of them young men from local 
neighborhoods, the opportunity to come together for a large-scale project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to bring our corps members from both sites together," said Martin 
Ludlow, who directs the Main Street conservation corps site. "The Exposition 
Boulevard project gives the (Conservation Corps) the chance to work together on 
a larger scale and impact the Los Angeles community." 
</P>
<P>
 Corps members from the Main Street and Hammel Avenue sites will work with 
volunteers from Common Grounds, Councilman Nate Holden's office, Dorsey High 
School, Los Angeles Unified School District, Expo Neighbors Assn., Graphic 
Experience, L.A. Harvest, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Sparkletts 
Water and the West Angeles Community Development Corp.

CITY ARTS; A LANDSCAPE OF LANDMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed with cameras, a diverse group of eight people, ages 10 to 18, were sent 
out on the streets of Los Angeles by the Getty Conservation Institute. Their 
mission: capture what they deemed to be significant social and architectural 
landmarks of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, on display at City Hall's Bridge Gallery, is "Picture L.A.: 
Landmarks of a New Generation," a dramatic collection of images ranging from 
freeway on-ramps to the neighborhood barbershop; from Downtown homeless camps 
to the last fish shop on the Santa Monica Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, a privately funded organization dedicated to restoring and 
preserving landmarks and monuments throughout the world, lent cameras to the 
children to explore the concept of landmarks in the ever-changing Los Angeles 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a landmark is something you see every day, that's like a part of 
you," said 18-year-old Raul Herrera, one of the photographers, who attends Los 
Angeles City College. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Herrera's work focuses on a group of people occupying the 
graffiti-covered Belmont tunnel near Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young people see the other side of L.A. that everyone else tries to ignore," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Picture L.A." will be on view until Jan. 6 at the Henry P. Rio Bridge Gallery 
at Los Angeles City Hall, 200 N. Spring St. Hours are 8 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 
Mondays through Fridays and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays. Free admission.

VOICES: 'NOW I HAVE SOME DIRECTION'; CONSERVATION CORPS MEMBER JEROME GREEN 
MADE GOOD ON HIS VOW TO TURN HIS LIFE AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerome Green, 21, was born on the Eastside of Los Angeles and grew up there 
and in Texas. His involvement with gangs led him to crime and a stretch in 
prison for robbery. Since his release he has joined the Los Angeles 
Conservation Corps and become a model member of the organization. He recently 
spent 10 weeks in Australia doing conservation work through an exchange program 
sponsored by the California Conservation Corps and the Australian Trust for 
Conservation Volunteers. Green was one of only 12 corps members chosen for the 
trip out of thousands who applied statewide. Corps Director Martin Ludlow 
describes Green as extraordinarily determined to change the circumstances of 
his life. "He's had to overcome incredible hurdles in a short period of time," 
Ludlow said. "He doesn't seem to have been discouraged in any way. . . . His 
experiences here have tapped into leadership abilities he didn't know he had. 
He's really taking control." Green was interviewed by Erin J. Aubry.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I joined the corps this past January. I liked the work. I had done 
firefighting work for 18 months before in fire camps, which I did while I was 
incarcerated for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up, I went to a lot of different schools, but I never went to class. I 
liked school, but I wanted to be doing other things. I knew school was 
important, but being the age I was, I wanted to run around in the streets, like 
everybody else was doing. I was having fun. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in prison for robbing a jewelry store. I was young, running with gangs, 
I felt that peer pressure. I wanted to do it. I didn't necessarily need that 
money, it was more for the thrill. I wasn't thinking about the bad consequences 
at first, just the good ones. I wasn't thinking about the fact that I could've 
gotten killed. 
</P>
<P>
 But when I was incarcerated, I had a lot of time to think about things. I had 
a little daughter. I thought about her, and that changed my life around. When I 
got out and came home, I thought, "This is what I want to do. I want to leave 
that (bad) stuff alone." 
</P>
<P>
 When I got out, I started working in a restaurant in Hollywood, but that 
didn't work out. Then I came here to the corps, which was right on time because 
the other job wasn't going well. Right now, we're moving people out of 
earthquake-damaged buildings. It's been almost a year since the earthquake, but 
that's still going on. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two months, I took a lot of the classes here, like personal 
development, driver's training, and I took classes toward my GED. I really 
wanted to get that, so I really worked hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia was real fun. The most exciting thing was the plane ride; it was 22 
hours. We stopped in New Zealand for an hour. I had been in a plane before, but 
not that long. The first few weeks, I wasn't on track because of the time 
difference. I really didn't realize I was there for a few weeks; I was 
dragging. But then I started having fun and started meeting a lot of people, 
going to clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The part I really liked was when we first got there. We went to this little 
deli and asked for some French fries. We're standing there waiting. The guy 
didn't give them to us. Then, he said, 'Oh, you mean hot chips.' That's what 
they call them there. 
</P>
<P>
 The people were real friendly, the whole country. We traveled around a lot. 
Once we even stayed in an old governor's mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 I worked mostly in the outback and the bush. We planted a lot of trees. We 
also did an animal survey; we set traps to see what kind of animals lived 
where. We saw wombats, wallabies and plenty of kangaroos. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to be a firefighter with the Forestry Service eventually. The work is 
kind of dangerous, but I still like it. It's exciting, but fun, like being on a 
roller coaster. It's cool. 
</P>
<P>
 We (the LACC) got commended by the California Department of Forestry. It makes 
you feel good, like you're doing something. The danger makes it more 
adventurous to me. Sitting in an office with papers all day would drive me 
crazy.  
</P>
<P>
 I've been out of prison for a year now. I don't feel any more of that peer 
pressure. I don't have to worry about looking over my shoulder now, the way I 
did when I was out there not caring about nothing. Now I have some direction. 
</P>
<P>
 In our communities, there aren't too many leadership programs, at parks and 
places like that. Kids have parents who are alcoholic, take drugs or fight . . 
. so the kids don't care no more. There needs to be people who'll take the time 
out for you.

 Bell High football Coach Henry Santiago was able to do in his first year what 
his predecessors had failed to accomplish--win a championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind a defense that surrendered only 122 yards, Bell defeated Birmingham, 
25-3, to win the City Section 3-A Division championship Friday night at Gardena 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 "Offense scores points and defense wins championships," Santiago said. "The 
defense was awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 So was running back Vern Benard, who rushed for 185 yards and a touchdown in 
16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Benard's 70-yard touchdown run put Bell ahead 25-3 in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham intercepted Eagle quarterback Gus Valenzuela four times, twice in 
the third quarter, but failed to capitalize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some plays, but could not make the big one happen," said Birmingham 
co-Coach Chick Epstein, who coached his final game. 
</P>
<P>
 Benard had a 48-yard run that set up Valenzuela's one-yard touchdown run to 
extend Bell's 10-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter, Dicky Purcell, who caught four passes for 93 yards and 
a touchdown, had a 45-yard reception to the Birmingham 29-yard line. Two plays 
later, Purcell scored on a 13-yard pass from Valenzuela to give Bell an 18-3 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela completed eight of 20 passes for 169 yards and a touchdown with 
four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' defense held Birmingham to 35 total yards in the first half. The 
Braves only score came on Luis Salguero's 36-yard field goal in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Bell 11-3; Birmingham 6-6-1.

SEGURA FALLS IN STRAIGHT SETS, 6-4, 6-0; TENNIS: TAFT'S FELDMAN DENIES DORSEY 
SOPHOMORE'S BID TO REPEAT AS CITY GIRLS' SINGLES CHAMPION.

 Dorsey High's Kendra Segura, in an attempt to repeat as City girls' singles 
tennis champion, could not overcome the effects of a slight cold as she fell to 
second-seeded Julie Feldman of Taft, 6-4, 6-0, Friday at the Racquet Centre in 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first set, Segura, a sophomore, fell behind 4-1, but won three of the 
next four games.Utilizing her strong serve, Feldman won the next game to win 
the set. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next set, Feldman gained the upper hand with a variety of passing shots 
to wear Segura down. She broke Segura's service three times in each set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I beat myself out there today," said Segura, who suffered her first high 
school career defeat in singles. I made so many unforced errors. My feet 
weren't moving and my mechanics weren't with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman finished with a three-year record of 48-2, the losses coming to former 
teammate Brahna Pastorini in the 1992 final and Segura in the 1993 semifinals. 
The only challenge left for Feldman was to win the crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels very good," Feldman said. "I wanted it really bad. I've been wanting 
to win this for the last three years. I have a lot of aspirations in tennis, 
and this is one step toward what I want to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game, Los Angeles' Ilona Kordonskay beat Dorsey's Delana 
Daniels, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Segura advanced to the finals Wednesday after beating Daniels, 6-4, 6-2, after 
trailing, 4-3, in the first set. Feldman beat Kordonskay, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're proud of both Kendra and Delana," Dorsey Coach Dave Gordon said. "They 
had a great season."

NOTEBOOK; TITLE HOPES OF EAST L.A. COLLEGE'S SOCCER TEAM TURN TO MUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles College soccer team was prepared for just about anything 
in last Sunday's state final against De Anza College. But the Huskies weren't 
quite ready for the weather during the two-day tournament at Consumnes River 
College in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 East L.A. lost, 2-1, in overtime on a muddy field, doused from heavy 
rainstorms over the previous three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded De Anza (19-0-2) from Northern California played the match with 
shoes equipped with longer cleats for slick playing conditions. Only two East 
L.A. players had the studded shoes. The rest played with their regular molded 
shoes designed for dry surfaces and fine-cut grass. 
</P>
<P>
 The state tournament was the first time second-seeded East L.A. (20-3-1), the 
top team from Southern California, had played in inclement weather this season. 
East L.A. beat American River, 3-0, in the semifinals the previous day to 
advance to the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipated a situation like this and we let the players know," said East 
L.A. Coach Orlando Brenes. "We don't have a whole lot of money and couldn't buy 
shoes. We didn't have them and it was a detrimental factor. When I saw the 
conditions, I knew we were in deep (trouble)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies, making their third appearance in the tournament in seven years, 
were in good shape late in the second half against De Anza. East L.A. took a 
1-0 lead on a 35-foot looping shot by Jose Recinos with eight minutes left in 
regulation. De Anza's Troy Pinnock tied the game a few minutes later and scored 
again in the first overtime session to deny the Huskies their second state 
title in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't blown out and we were in the game," Brenes said. "We gave De Anza 
fits and they had to earn the victory. We really have nothing to be ashamed 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Jefferson High girls' basketball team opened the season, winning four of 
their six four games. Not bad for four days work. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of scheduling conflicts with the Eagle Rock tournament and 
Southeastern Conference games, the Democrats were twice forced to play two 
games in the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to check the schedule next time to make sure nothing like this 
happens again," Coach Curtis Hughes said. "The girls were disciplined, but all 
these games helped get us in shape. Now we can run with anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson lost to Roosevelt in its season opener Nov. 30. The Democrats 
rebounded with a win over Cleveland in the first round of the Eagle Rock 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson lost to Taft in tournament play Dec. 1, but the Democrats didn't 
have to wait long to redeem themselves, winning two games the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson beat visiting South Gate in a conference game. The team then fought 
rush-hour traffic to make its way to Eagle Rock to play Bell less than an hour 
later.

SOCCER ROUNDUP; SALMERON'S HAT TRICK IS ONLY THE BEGINNING

 Jose Salmeron nailed a hat trick and Jose Huarez got two more goals as Belmont 
defeated Bravo, 9-1, in a Northern Conference soccer match Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With her team leading 7-0 at halftime, Belmont Coach Nancy Carr-Swaim pulled 
her starters and Bravo tallied its lone goal. The Sentinels improved to 4-0 
while Bravo dropped to 0-4. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Thursday's matches: 
</P>
<P>
 Bell 3, Fremont 1 -- Sergio Armidas and Abraham Saragun each scored as the 
Eagles (3-0-2) beat visiting Fremont (3-1-1) in a Southeastern Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Moreno scored on a free kick for the Pathfinders' lone goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield 1, Huntington Park 0 -- Oscar Romero got the only goal as the 
Bulldogs (3-0-1) beat the visiting Spartans (1-3) in a Southeastern Conference 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero's goal came on a header in the 60th minute, converting on a lofting 
pass from the corner by Fermin Diaz. The Spartans have lost three games by one 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt 1, Locke 1 -- Locke freshman Jonathan Garay came through in a big 
way, scoring the tying goal with only a minute left in the match. The tie left 
the Roughriders (1-1-2) and the Saints (0-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson 3, Jordan 0 -- J.J. Angiano scored a hat trick in leading the 
Democrats (2-2-1) to a victory over visiting Jordan (2-2-1) in a Southeastern 
Conference match. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis Vargas controlled the play in Jefferson's end of the field with sound 
defensive play. 
</P>
<P>
 Salesian 6, Mary Star 1 -- Eddie Garcia and Albert Vasquez each scored two 
goals as Salesian (2-1) pounded Mary Star in a Santa Fe League match. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Wednesday matches: 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts 1, Venice 1 -- Sloppy defensive work in the second half forced a 
tie between the Coastal Conference teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Arturo Piedra knocked a rebound off a Venice defender to give the 
Toilers a 1-0 halftime lead. However, the Toilers (1-2-1) were not so fortunate 
in the second half as Venice scored on a kick from midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Narbonne 3, Dorsey 0 -- Jorge Garcia scored twice from inside the penalty box 
as the Gauchos defeated the visiting Dongs in a Southern Pacific Conference 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of communication between Dorsey sweeper Marvin Gonzalez and goalie Frank 
Figeroa proved critical as Garcia was able to convert turnovers into goals.

SEATTLE STOPS HOT CLIPPERS; PRO BASKETBALL: THEIR WINNING STREAK ENDS IN 
DOUBLE-OVERTIME AGAINST SUPERSONICS, 132-127. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly before the beginning of his first season with the Clippers, Bill Fitch 
confessed that his team wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my rathers, I'd like to have another 30 days with these guys," Fitch 
said. "I hope we're better 30 days from now, just playing games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are a lot better than they were during their season-opening 
16-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who were coming off a 25-point victory over the Lakers on Friday 
night, overcame a 14-point third-quarter deficit and extended the Seattle 
SuperSonics to double-overtime before losing, 132-127, Saturday night before an 
announced 9,048 at the Sports Arena after Pooh Richardson, Loy Vaught and Eric 
Piatkowski fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson said the Clippers never gave up on themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like OJT. It's like on-the-job training for a lot of us," said 
Richardson, who had a season-high 32 points and 15 assists. "And you know how 
that on-the-job training can be. I think it's taken us a while to start 
jelling. We haven't played with each other before." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson thinks it's too early to consider the possibility that the Clippers 
might break the NBA record for most losses in a season set when the 
Philadelphia 76ers compiled a 9-73 record in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
 "People that make those statements, that's kind of unfair, especially when 
they're not out there performing against the Shawn Kemps. That 9-73 stuff is 
for people to talk about who don't have to go out and play these All-Star 
players. It's easy to sit down on your couch and say that a team will go 9-73 
when you don't have to play against Shawn Kemp, Patrick Ewing and (Hakeem) 
Olajuwon." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, who had 17 points and 11 rebounds in the SuperSonics' 115-90 victory 
over the Clippers on Nov. 13, scored a career-high 42 points and grabbed 14 
rebounds. He made 20 of 22 free throws as Seattle made 38 of 46 from the line. 
Gary Payton had career highs of 33 points and 14 assists as Seattle ended the 
Clippers' two-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson made an 18-footer with 11.6 seconds left in the first overtime to 
tie it, 121-121, and the Clippers had a chance to win it, but Piatkowski missed 
a desperation shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp then scored eight points in the second overtime as Seattle pulled away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers were also forced to play without Richardson, who fouled out with 
3:08 remaining; Vaught, who had 20 points and 14 rebounds before fouling out 
with 1:49 remaining, and Piatkowski, who had a season-high 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stayed together through the hard times and as long as we stick together 
we'll be all right," said forward Charles Outlaw, who had a career-high nine 
blocked shots, including a key block of a layup attempt by McMillan with 19 
seconds left in the first overtime. "People don't play with us, they just watch 
us." Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Former Clipper coach Bob Weiss, fired after leading the team to a 27-55 record 
last season, returned to the Sports Arena with the SuperSonics. Weiss, hired 
after SuperSonic assistant Tim Grgurich was named head coach at Nevada Las 
Vegas, refused to criticize the Clippers. "I've always liked Bill (Fitch) and I 
certainly don't wish him any ill will, although I'm not a Clipper fan," Weiss 
said. "I certainly don't enjoy seeing Bill lose or any the players that were 
here when I was here." 
</P>
<P>
 SuperSonic forward Detlef Schrempf, who had 15 points, five rebounds and four 
assists, was ejected with 10:53 remaining after drawing two technical fouls. 
Schrempf complained after referee Bill Alexander didn't call a foul on Clipper 
forward Tony Massenburg, who accidentally floored Schrempf with an elbow to the 
face. . . . Guard Terry Dehere, sidelined for two games because of a sprained 
right ankle, said he hopes to play in the Clippers' next game Wednesday night 
at Portland.

BRUINS CLOG TITAN TRAFFIC, THEN FILL DIAMOND LANE; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: ED

 A second-half burst of UCLA defense transformed a struggle into a strangle 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading Cal State Fullerton by only six at halftime, second-ranked UCLA tipped 
passes, jumped into passing lanes, bumped bodies and generally obliterated the 
Titan offense in the second half on its way to a 99-65 victory before 7,243 at 
Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 After the surge was over, the Bruins had racked up 19 steals -- a team record 
-- and held the Titans to 25% shooting in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "They definitely turned up the heat, and we kind of wilted under their 
defensive pressure," Fullerton Coach Bob Hawking said. "They're awfully big, 
awfully strong, awfully talented, and that certainly showed up in the second 
half." 
</P>
<P>
 After a sedate first half, UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said he challenged his team 
to come up with the same kind of effort that lifted it over Kentucky last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just told us to dig deep, stop sleeping, pick up the defense and 
everything will come," guard Tyus Edney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Harrick: "At halftime, I asked them, 'Which team do you want to be, the 
one that played Kentucky or the one that played the first half out there?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He got a quick answer, filled with Bruins plucking errant Titan passes and 
UCLA streaks to the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (3-0) outscored the Titans, 16-7, to start the second half, 
including a stretch during which their defense caused Fullerton (1-3) to turn 
the ball over six times in 11 trips down the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 A 22-4 blitz in the middle of the second half put the game away, climaxed by 
the last of Charles O'Bannon's dunks. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half, though, had none of that intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first 20 minutes, Fullerton center Winston Peterson created UCLA 
headaches by beating the Bruins down the floor for several layups and by 
driving past Bruin center George Zidek in the halfcourt offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harrick switched 6-foot-8 forward Ed O'Bannon, not usually known for 
dominating defensive play, to the 6-6 Peterson, and suddenly the Titans went 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, Coach wanted me to guard Peterson and pick up the team's intensity 
on the defensive end," O'Bannon said. "I just tried to stay in front of him, 
deny him the ball as much as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 With the easy passing lane to Peterson closed, the other Bruin defenders 
throttled the rest of the Fullerton offense, causing 26 total turnovers -- 15 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Peterson finished with a game-high 26 points, he had only nine in the 
second half and Fullerton did not score baskets on consecutive possessions in 
the second half until there were less than five minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon, for one, reveled in his new role as UCLA's defensive stopper. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice change for me," O'Bannon said. "In the first half, my shot wasn't 
falling, so I blanked it out, came out in the second concentrating on 
rebounding and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we've said it all year, when you play good defense, the offense follows." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon, who had only six points on three-for-nine shooting in the first 
half, made four of six in the second and made both of his second-half 
three-point attempts. He finished with 18 points, 11 rebounds and one steal. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Bannon and Edney led the Bruins with four steals each, and UCLA got 
three apiece from Toby Bailey, Cameron Dollar and J.R. Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the UCLA sports information department, the previous team record 
for steals had been 17, set in the Great Alaska Shootout four years ago against 
UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pretty much fell apart in the second half," Hawking said, "shot selection, 
defense. . . . They're obviously an outstanding team." 
</P>
<P>
 And off the turnovers, UCLA flew. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Bannon, who fouled out of the Kentucky game early, led UCLA with 23 
points, which tied a career high, and four dramatic dunks, which probably did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly why I play basketball," Charles O'Bannon said. "You get one 
early in the game, and you get the feeling it's going to be a great night." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edney: "You can see it in his body motion, like he's getting ready for 
it. I just watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O'Bannon made 10 of his 15 shots and grabbed 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Said his older brother, Ed: "His athletic ability is second to none, I think. 
For him to get those dunks, especially at the times he got them, they were very 
crucial. We needed someone to get us into it emotionally."

QUESTIONS COME WITH CANSECO TO RED SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN HORGAN, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Other than bolstering the middle of their batting order and offering Mo Vaughn 
the best protection money can buy, how will Jose Canseco fit in with the Red 
Sox? 
</P>
<P>
 Will he be a veteran leader or will there be more of the off-field incidents 
that helped make his a household name during his time with the Oakland 
Athletics? 
</P>
<P>
 Will there be more late-night speeding tickets? Will there be more firearms 
charges? How about Madonna at Fenway Park? 
</P>
<P>
 And, will the Red Sox be able to sign him beyond this season? 
</P>
<P>
 Those were some of the questions after the Red Sox acquired Canseco, 30, 
Friday night from the Texas Rangers for center fielder Otis Nixon and minor 
league third baseman Luis Ortiz. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Dan Duquette conceded the trade is a bit of a risk because 
Canseco has only one year remaining on his contract and will be eligible for 
free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 And Canseco, who will make $5.1 million in 1995, told the Red Sox that it will 
take a contract commensurate with that of the Astros' Jeff Bagwell (four years, 
$27.5 million) to keep him more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want him to stay with the Red Sox," Duquette said. "We're happy to have 
him on a one-year deal and we'll address that (extension) later." 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco and Duquette said they would not start negotiations on an extension 
until the strike is resolved. Duquette also said he doesn't envision 
negotiating after the 1995 season begins. If the 1995 season begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't like to negotiate during the season," he said. "That's the time to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco, who will DH and possibly play the outfield, gives the Red Sox the 
right-handed power they need to balance their lineup and make sure Vaughn won't 
be pitched around, as he was last season when Andre Dawson was out of the 
lineup or playing hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco, who hit .282 with 31 home runs and 90 RBI in 111 games last season, 
now is with his third team. He has 276 home runs in 10 seasons, and again is 
linked with at least one other outstanding hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oakland, Canseco and Mark McGwire combined to form the Bash Brothers. In 
Texas, it was Canseco and Juan Gonzalez for one year and they were joined last 
season by Will Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's the Jose and Mo Show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always thought that Boston lacked a right-handed power hitter, 
especially the type of fly ball hitter I am," Canseco said from his home in 
Miami. "I know Mo is an up-and-coming superstar and I think it's going to be a 
lot of fun. That ballpark is very conducive to right-handed power. You have to 
take advantage of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Canseco's career average at Fenway Park is .286 (50-for-175), with 14 home 
runs and 37 RBI.

BIG D NEEDED TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIGGER; PRO FOOTBALL: COWBOYS' DRIVE COMES UP 
INCHES SHORT, GIVING BROWNS AN IMPORTANT VICTORY, 19-14. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Upon the Dallas Cowboys' coat of invincibility, there has appeared a seam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six inches," Coach Barry Switzer muttered Saturday after a 19-14 loss to the 
Cleveland Browns. "Four inches. Three inches." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny how so much can escape through something so small. 
</P>
<P>
 In that short distance between Jay Novacek and the potential winning touchdown 
in the final raucous seconds against the Browns, the Cowboys lost mystique, 
bravado, and most of their chance to be hosts of the NFC championship game next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 In that same distance, the Browns gained the sort of chest-thumping confidence 
that can make a team believe it belongs in a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Switzer who said it best in a single word shouted from the chaotic 
Texas Stadium sidelines after the Browns had stunned the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "What?? " 
</P>
<P>
 What, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game the Cowboys should have lost after the first 59 minutes, they nearly 
won in the final tick after driving 50 yards with no timeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 But they needed to drive 51 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Or Novacek, the Cowboys' 6-foot-4 tight end, needed to be 6-10. 
</P>
<P>
 With 10 seconds remaining, Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman threw a slant pass 
to Novacek from the six-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Novacek caught it on the two, and slipped as he was diving for the end zone. 
As he stretched to place the ball over the goal line, Brown safety Eric Turner 
leaped on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the kind of thing every defensive player dreams of," Turner said. "I 
saw him coming and I thought, 'It's either you or me, I'm the hero or the 
goat.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The officials properly ruled that Novacek did not get into the end zone. Time 
expired. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Cowboys had lost a game after Thanksgiving for only the second time in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys have got to get off their butt, study and play football instead of 
thinking we're the best damn team," Cowboy defensive end Charles Haley said 
angrily. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys were so dazed after only their third loss in 14 games, many of 
them did not shake hands with the winners during the postgame chaos at 
midfield. The Browns were not so dazed that they didn't notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were sore losers," said Brown special teams star Bennie Thompson. "They 
are not true champions because true champions shake hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland tight end Frank Hartley put it another way. 
</P>
<P>
 "How 'bout them Cowgirls!" he shouted in the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Browns (10-4) now have a chance to gain home-field advantage 
throughout the AFC playoffs with victories in their final two games, the 
Cowboys must rely on the San Francisco 49ers to lose two of their last three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 If that doesn't happen, the road to a record third consecutive Super Bowl 
championship runs through San Francisco, where the Cowboys were whipped earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Cowboys are thinking about anything now but avoiding the road to 
slow ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a mental letdown; it was a physical letdown," running back Emmitt 
Smith said. "Everybody is talking about San Francisco. We're trailing everybody 
as far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 How it happened that they were trailing the defense-rich but quarterback-poor 
Browns for most of the game is something that could haunt this team until 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their defense, confronted for one of the first times this year with a 
bruising running back not afraid to stick the ball down their shirts, spent 
much of afternoon backpedaling. 
</P>
<P>
 Leroy Hoard, with more rushing yards this season (791) than in his previous 
four seasons combined, gained 99 yards in 25 tries. This helped the Browns hold 
the ball for 11 minutes of the third quarter while outgaining the Cowboys, 
65-1, in that period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense is steadily going downhill," Haley said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their quarterback, playing for the first time in three games, looked like a 
typical young man who has been rocked this season with head, thumb and knee 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that final drive, Aikman was mostly terrible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I threw the ball well at any time in the game," Aikman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw two interceptions, but could have thrown four others that were 
dropped. He lost a fumble with 2:11 remaining that led to Matt Stover's fourth 
field goal and forced the Cowboys to go for a touchdown to win. 
</P>
<P>
 And that final pass to Novacek was even slightly second-guessed by Switzer. 
The coach acknowledged that with 10 seconds remaining, it is preferable to 
throw into the end zone so you can run two plays if the first one doesn't 
result in a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a couple of options on that play," Switzer said. "Things happen so 
fast. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 They were happening so fast for the reeling Browns' defense that players were 
screaming at each other after calling timeout with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the guys were yelling for us to play zone, other guys were yelling 
for blitz, but I was just yelling one name -- Novacek," Turner said. "I knew 
that is who Troy likes in those situations." 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of throwing to Alvin Harper in the corner of the end zone, Aikman 
threw the shorter pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns will not soon forget what happened next, just as Turner will not 
forget needing to sink a free throw in the final seconds for Ventura High that 
would send a game into overtime against Oxnard High many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made that too," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>

MATER DEI: NO. 1 IN DIVISION I; SOUTHERN SECTION: MONARCHS HAVE THE ANSWER FOR 
BISHOP AMAT'S MCCUTCHEON IN A 28-21 VICTORY IN CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Daylon McCutcheon did nothing to dispel the notion that he is one of the 
nation's finest high school football players Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 26,295 at Anaheim Stadium, the La Puente Bishop Amat High senior showed 
skills and speed not often seen on this level. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing strength and balance on both sides of the ball, Santa Ana Mater Dei 
beat Bishop Amat's one-dimensional attack, 28-21, to claim the Southern Section 
Division I crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Bishop Amat was considered the favorite because of McCutcheon. The 
5-foot-10, 175-pound running back averaged 175 yards a game this season against 
one the area's toughest schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished the season with 28 offensive touchdowns, two as a defensive back 
and two on special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 On his second carry of the game, he broke loose for an 84-yard touchdown run 
that tied the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there would be other impressive runs, including a 37-yard touchdown 
in the fourth quarter, Mater Dei took control of the game in the second quarter 
and made Bishop Amat try its seldom-used passing game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just a good football team," said McCutcheon, who finished with 185 
yards and two touchdowns rushing. "I'm the leader of this team. I take this 
loss upon myself. I guess I didn't do what I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The title is the second for Mater Dei in the last four years. The Monarchs 
defeated Rialto Eisenhower, 35-14, in 1991, but were embarrassed by the same 
team in last year's championship, 56-3. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Mater Dei team was balanced and deep. Second-year starting 
quarterback John Flynn got the Monarchs going in the second quarter with a 
56-yard touchdown pass play to running back Steve Bodnar. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn threw his second touchdown pass in third quarter, a 23-yard connection 
with Rod Perry that gave the Monarchs a 21-10 lead. Although the pass was 
intended for teammate Peter Campbell, Perry was in the back of the end zone to 
make the catch. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of a night for Mater Dei, which seemed to get all the right 
bounces. The Monarchs controlled the ball for nine minutes more than Bishop 
Amat (13-1). 
</P>
<P>
 A Mater Dei punt in the third quarter, for example, bounded off the head of 
the Lancers' Ralph Brown and the Monarchs recovered at Bishop Amat's 16-yard 
line. Four plays later, Bodnar scored on a one-yard run to apparently put the 
game out of reach, 28-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat continued to try its passing game, but quarterback James Free 
never got on track. 
</P>
<P>
 On the game's final play, with Mater Dei leading, 28-21, Free's desperation 
pass was intercepted by Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew they were going to go to Daylon on that play," Campbell said. "He's 
90% of their offense. I was reading him until I got my hand on him, and then I 
turned and looked for the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, the Monarchs were ready to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played great defense and played great football," Mater Dei Coach Bruce 
Rollinson said. "We're 14-0 baby. It was just like a New York street fight."

LAKERS SHOW THERE'S LIFE AFTER CLIPPERS; PRO BASKETBALL: ONE NIGHT AFTER A 
MISERABLE DEFEAT, THEY BEAT JAZZ, 120-113, BEHIND THREATT'S 38 POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers put the upstarts, and the embarrassment, in their rearview mirror 
Saturday and set out on the road to recovery, picking on someone their own size 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the Utah Jazz waiting for them at the Delta Center, not the Clippers, 
so the coast was clear. The Lakers re-attached the heads that had been handed 
to them 24 hours earlier and made like a good team again, building a 17-point 
lead in the third quarter and winning, 120-113, before 19,911. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedale Threatt replaced the injured Nick Van Exel and scored 38 points. No 
Laker has scored more since Threatt had 42 on March 10, 1992, at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Working largely against John Stockton, considered one of the league's best 
defensive guards, Threatt made 13 of 19 shots -- including three of seven 
three-pointers -- and nine of 10 free throws. Playing a season-high 40 minutes, 
about 15 more than his average, he also had eight assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just filling in," Threatt said. "This is definitely Van's spot." 
</P>
<P>
 The temp may have to stay on a bit longer, depending how long it takes Van 
Exel to recover from the sprained left ankle that kept him in street clothes 
against the Jazz. He is already making progress, but trainer Gary Vitti, while 
officially listing the second-year point guard as day to day, said Van Exel 
might sit out the final three games of the trip that continues to Dallas, 
Houston and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 It got worse for the Lakers. With one starting guard on the bench, the other, 
Eddie Jones, picked up his second foul only 5:43 into the game. He played only 
13 minutes in the first half and 24 for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing what could have been dire straits against a team that came in having 
won nine of its previous 12 games, Coach Del Harris looked down the bench for 
help. From a distance, he spotted Anthony Peeler. 
</P>
<P>
 Averaging only 8.4 minutes, the second-lowest on the team, and shooting a 
team-low 31.3%, the former starter came in to save the day, but quickly missed 
badly on a jump shot from the right side. The next possession, he bricked a 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he recovered. Peeler made the first of two three-point shots, 
bringing the Lakers within one point of the Jazz. When Harris went with three 
guards during the second half -- all shooting guards, with Tony Smith the point 
guard pro tem -- Peeler was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Peeler finished with 11 points in 26 minutes, 10 more than his previous season 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was wonderful to have him back," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peeler had never really left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been sitting down there," Peeler said, laughing. "Maybe he just couldn't 
see me." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no missing him Saturday, with Harris saying the Lakers don't win 
without him. Peeler couldn't blend in any more than Cedric Ceballos (27 points) 
or Vlade Divac (18 points, 13 rebounds and three blocked shots). 
</P>
<P>
 Now bring on the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a big-time victory," Harris said. "These guys (the Jazz) are very 
difficult to beat here. They're a good team. Coming off last night, it took a 
lot out of us physically as well as emotionally. It would have been very easy 
for our team to just crawl into a hole, and I feared that would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Threatt: "It is a statement. You can beat us one time, but we'll be back. 
That game is forgotten. We're back." Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Van Exel and the Lakers get a break in that he has two full days to 
recover before the next game, Tuesday at Dallas. Van Exel suffered the ankle 
injury in the fourth quarter against the Clippers and went to the hospital for 
X-rays that confirmed it was nothing more serious than a sprain. . . . Jazz 
Coach Jerry Sloan was ejected with 2:58 to play in the third quarter after 
getting his second technical.

HARD-EARNED YARDS IN 18-7 VICTORY. MONK SETS CONSECUTIVE-GAME RECEPTIONS 
RECORD.

 While Barry Sanders was going backward much of the time, the Detroit Lions 
took a big step forward Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions (8-6) enhanced their playoff chances with an 18-7 victory over the 
sliding New York Jets. After Art Monk set an NFL record for consecutive games 
with a reception on New York's first play, the Jets rarely did much against the 
league's 23rd-ranked defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders gained 127 yards, many of them on a final drive as Detroit clinched 
the victory with Jason Hanson's fourth field goal, a 23-yarder with 3:02 
remaining. Often facing an eight-man front, Sanders was thrown for losses nine 
times. But he also had runs of 29, 27 and 22 yards as the Lions remained in the 
middle of the NFC playoff chase with their third victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been through stretches like this before," said Sanders, who has 1,721 
yards this season. "You just don't let it worry you. Our offense is well 
balanced enough where, sooner or later, we are going to break it open." 
</P>
<P>
 That never really happened. But with 15-year veteran Dave Krieg at 
quarterback, the Lions never lost control, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sent a lot of guys up front to stop Barry and that opened up the passing 
game," said Krieg, who completed 18 of 24 passes for 189 yards -- at one point 
hitting 11 in a row -- and found Sanders for a five-yard touchdown. "Because of 
the way defenses gear up to stop him, we should always be able to throw the 
ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The bungling Jets (6-8) fell for the third consecutive week. Their main 
highlight was Monk's five-yard catch on the game's opening offensive play. He 
caught the short pass from Boomer Esiason on a crossing pattern, giving him 178 
consecutive games with a reception, breaking Steve Largent's NFL mark. Largent 
was on hand to congratulate the 15-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad it happened on the first play," Monk said. "I thought that 
might have been the spark to generate us, but it didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than one long second-quarter drive, the Jets did nothing offensively. 
New York's attack showed little interest in keeping alive the team's flickering 
playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no consistency right now that we can find," Coach Pete Carroll said. 
"We are hurting right now. We didn't throw the ball well today. They were 
crowding us and we couldn't hit anything up top." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions still think they can finish atop the NFC Central, even though they 
trailed Minnesota and Chicago heading into the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions didn't use Sanders much to get their first score, Hanson's 37-yard 
field goal. Krieg had passes of 14 yards to Herman Moore and 20 to Brett 
Perriman, while Sanders gained only two yards on the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders was busier on the next scoring drive, a 79-yarder on which he rushed 
for 24 yards and caught a five-yard pass in the front corner of the end zone. 
It was his first touchdown reception this season.

DE LA HOYA FINDS HIMSELF IN A FIGHT, BUT MAKES THE CUT; BOXING: HE STAYS 
UNBEATEN BY STOPPING AVILA IN THE NINTH ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya was looking to fight someone who wouldn't get all wobbly 
kneed merely reading his press clippings. 
</P>
<P>
 He was looking for someone with a chin, a brawler who would get hit and keep 
charging like a bull. 
</P>
<P>
 He was looking for someone not so easily impressed by him. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya found what he was looking for Saturday in Johnny Avila, who took 
every thing De La Hoya threw at him, which was plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya unleashed an impressive arsenal of punches, survived a 
seventh-round scare and finally finished off Avila in the ninth round with a 
technical knockout before 4,242 at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, who improved to 16-0 with 15 knockouts and retained his World 
Boxing Organization lightweight title, had peppered the right side of Avila's 
face from the outset. In the ninth, he opened a cut over Avila's right eye and 
the bout was stopped by Dr. Adam Karns at 1:07 of the round. 
</P>
<P>
 So who was that guy? 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones you don't hear about, they're the tough guys," De La Hoya said 
afterward of Avila. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth was, De La Hoya didn't really know what to expect from his opponent, 
which excited him. He didn't have any film on Avila and only heard he was a 
tough fighter who could take a punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila (20-2-1), of Palmdale, lived up to his billing. De La Hoya dominated 
almost every round, often using Avila's head as target practice. Two of the 
three judges gave De La Hoya every round except the eighth, when De La Hoya 
received a deduction for a low blow. 
</P>
<P>
 With a left hook he calls his "45," De La Hoya raised a welt on the right side 
of Avila's face in the first round. By the fifth the welt had swollen to the 
size of a walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya said he knew early it was going to be a long day unless he knocked 
Avila out or cut him so badly the bout would have to be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya settled for the latter plan, using his reach advantage to work on 
Avila's right cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya also answered some questions about his ability to take a punch. In 
the seventh round, by far the bout's best, Avila landed a right to De La Hoya's 
face and backed him into the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit him and felt it all the way up my arm," Avila said later. "I knew I hit 
him good. I wanted to take him out, but he's real cagey, he really knows how to 
slip a punch." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya said the punch did not hurt him, and seemed to take offense to the 
blow as he countered with a massive attack near the end of the round. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a very good right hand," De La Hoya acknowledged. "But I'm in great 
shape. I was never out of balance. I took that shot. People thought he hurt 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth, De La Hoya worked Avila with powerful body punches, one so low 
that he was penalized a point by referee Raul Caiz. 
</P>
<P>
 As impressed as he was with the punches De La Hoya threw, Robert Alcazar, the 
boxer's trainer, seemed as happy with the one that his fighter took in the 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that punch answered a few questions," Alcazar said. "That was a 
serious punch. But he just took that punch. It must have stunned him, like it 
would anybody. But I hope that punch answers questions about his chin." 
</P>
<P>
 For De La Hoya, Saturday's outing was the workout he needed in preparation for 
his Feb. 18 fight against John John Molina at the MGM Grand. Molina, Alcazar 
said, is similar in style to Avila. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya needed the work. He had disposed of his last three opponents in 
three, two, and three rounds, respectively. He barely broke a sweat in his Nov. 
18 victory against Carl Griffith. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd rather have a fight like (this one)," De La Hoya said. "It means more 
experience, and more TV time. He was very, very difficult. That's what happens 
when a fighter's not scared out there. He kept coming. That's the fight I want 
to be in. My last few fights have only lasted two, three rounds. The public is 
saying, 'Wow, I want to see more of you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the heart and head of Avila, De La Hoya's public got its wish. 
Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In a junior-welterweight bout, Pepe Reilly (11-1, 9 KOs) of Glendale scored a 
first-round knockout over Antonio Ojeda (6-10, 5 KOs), although Reilly was 
knocked down once. In a matchup of featherweights, Roberto Garcia of Oxnard 
survived a cut over his eye to score a technical knockout victory over Roberto 
Villarreal at 2:09 of the fifth round.

BASEBALL'S EMANCIPATION; IT WAS TWENTY YEARS AGO WHEN CATFISH HUNTER, SPORT'S 
BEST PITCHER, WAS DECLARED A FREE AGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL BOCK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years ago this week, the seeds for baseball's economic revolution were 
planted, first in a suite of law offices in New York City and then in a small 
town in rural North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial landscape of the game changed forever when arbitrator Peter 
Seitz declared Catfish Hunter, the best pitcher in baseball, a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer of 1974, Hunter was on his way to the Cy Young Award, pitching 
the Oakland A's to their third straight world championship and working on a 
good-not-great $100,000 contract. It was a well-known fact among the A's that 
they'd never get rich playing for penurious Charles O. Finley. Hunter, however, 
would change all that. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter's Oakland contract was exceedingly simple. He would be paid $50,000 by 
Finley. The other $50,000 was to be sent to a North Carolina bank in monthly 
payments on an insurance annuity. The pitcher's paychecks arrived punctually. 
The annuity payments, however, did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Periodically, the bank sent out late notices and Hunter would confront Finley. 
Each time, he said he got the classic response. "Charley would say, 'Oh yeah, 
the check's in the mail."' 
</P>
<P>
 They were not. 
</P>
<P>
 By season's end, the A's were in the American League playoffs, due in no small 
measure to Hunter's 25-12 season and 2.49 ERA. Press reports were speculating 
on the broken contract and its possible implications when the pitcher was 
summoned to Finley's office. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn was there as the owner 
reached into his desk drawer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charley said, 'Here's the money."' Hunter said. For an instant, the pitcher 
reached for it. Then he stopped himself. "I told him, 'I don't want it that 
way. Pay the insurance like the contract read.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the annuity affair had caught the attention of Marvin Miller, 
executive director of the players' association, and union attorney Dick Moss, 
who prepared to file a grievance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw this as an open and shut case, a real winner," Miller said. "The 
contract language wasn't even negotiated language. It was there before me, put 
in there by the owners and their lawyers. Any ambiguity would go against you in 
that circumstance. This language was clear cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a violation of the contract, the player has the right to send 
notice to the club, calling attention to the violation. Hunter did that. The 
club has 10 days to correct the violation. If the club does that, that's the 
end of it. The Oakland club did not correct the violation." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller viewed the arbitration as a cut-and-dried matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing worried me," he said. "The remedy was free agency. That was 
drastic. I thought it might be too drastic for an arbitrator." 
</P>
<P>
 This, remember, was two years before players would be freed from the 
restrictions of the reserve clause that tied them to their clubs in perpetuity, 
unless traded, sold or released. Granting a player free agency, especially one 
at the zenith of his career, was revolutionary stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the union pressed ahead, hopeful that the arbitrator would rule 
according to the evidence and the letter of the contract. "He would either find 
a violation or he wouldn't," Miller said. "If he did, the remedy was right 
there in the contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitrator Seitz was a pipe-smoking lawyer, a labor veteran. He had served on 
the National Wage Stabilization Board and been both counsel and assistant to 
the director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. He also was 
director of industrial relations for the Defense Department. This was no 
rookie. 
</P>
<P>
 "My confidence grew as the hearing developed," Miller said. "Seitz was a 
perceptive, acute man. It was clear he was not buying Finley's story when 
Charley said he knew nothing about this and claimed he did not understand the 
deferred payments." 
</P>
<P>
 During his cross-examination of Finley, Miller cornered the A's owner. The 
union boss glanced over at the arbitrator and noticed him shake his head. "I 
knew then Seitz knew what he was hearing," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days after the hearing, on Dec. 16, Seitz rendered his decision. "The 
grievance is upheld," he wrote. There was, however, no mention of the remedy. 
Miller was alarmed. "I pointed it out to Seitz. He said it was understood. I 
asked that he include it in the opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 For 15 nervous minutes, Seitz considered Miller's request in a private office. 
Then he returned and agreed. The remedy would be spelled out in the opinion. 
There could be no question. Hunter was a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pitcher got word of the decision, he was a little shaken. "I hung up 
the phone, turned to my wife and said, 'We don't belong to anybody.' I was 
scared. I didn't have a job. I didn't realize the implications." 
</P>
<P>
 They would become clear in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter lived a farm in rural North Carolina. His contract negotiations would 
be handled by J. Carlton Cherry, a country lawyer whose offices were in nearby 
Ahoskie, N.C. This is not exactly a major metropolis, but if the barons of 
baseball were interested in signing the best pitcher in the game, that was 
where they would find him and that was where they would have to come. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, they trumped through the law offices of Cherry, a peanut and 
tobacco lawyer, bearing offers. "Cherry didn't know what he had," Miller said. 
"He called me to say Finley had offered to forgive a loan and give Hunter a 
three-year guaranteed contract. He thought that was pretty good. As politely as 
I could, I explained that Hunter was the first free agent superstar. I told 
him, 'You haven't seen anything, yet.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And, indeed, he hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland came through with a $2 million offer, stunning Hunter. It may have 
been Monopoly money, though, because the Indians rarely had many dollars to 
toss around in those days. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City's bid included an offer to fly attorney Cherry's daughter home 
from college in the midwest each weekend. A nice touch. Hunter recalled the 
Royals offering him $50,000 a year for the rest of his life. "What if I die?" 
he asked. "They said, 'The contract is for you, not your wife and not your 
family.' They were out of it after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching all this was Peter Bavasi, general manager of the San Diego Padres. 
He had checked into the Tomahawk Motel -- there was no Hyatt and no Hilton in 
Ahoskie -- and plotted his strategy. His orders from owner Ray Kroc were 
simple: Bring back Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray asked what I thought it would cost," Bavasi said., "I told him Catfish 
made $100,000 the year before and from all indications, he wanted a long-term, 
guaranteed contract. I thought it would take $400,000." 
</P>
<P>
 He was off. Quite a bit off. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi thought his best chance was to let other teams make their offers first. 
He got a late appointment and arrived in a new gray suit, purchased especially 
for the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, tiring of the talks, also showed up, dressed in hunting togs. "It was 
the last day of the hunting season," Bavasi said. "He had his dogs in the 
truck, ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 As the conversations began, Hunter was chewing tobacco. At various intervals 
he would spit the juice into a Styrofoam cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the cup overflowed, right on to the sleeve of Bavasi's new suit. The GM 
never wavered. The stakes were too high to be deterred by a little tobacco 
juice. He could clean the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bavasi glanced furtively at the stain, Cherry, who by now knew what he 
had, presented Hunter's demands. "He wanted a variety of things that added up 
to $3,750,000," Bavasi said. "It was almost $4 million, a far cry from our 
$400,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Cherry said, "Now, young man, does that scare you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure doesn't," the GM said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the room, however, were shaken. Bavasi had brought along manager 
John McNamara and pitching coach Bill Poesdel, both old pals of Hunter's. They 
slumped in their seats when they heard Cherry's price. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi staged a strategic retreat, asking for a 90-minute recess. Back at the 
Tomahawk, Poesdel told the GM, "You'll get us all fired." Bavasi, though, was 
cool. "I didn't say I would pay, I just said I wasn't scared," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Bavasi called Kroc, who was on a cruise with his wife, Joan. A 
ship-to-shore line was established and through the static, Bavasi delivered the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Kroc, there's an offer on the table," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much will it cost?" Kroc answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi gulped and as the telephone line crackled, he said, "Four million." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's great," Kroc said. "You brought it in right where you said. Four 
hundred thousand." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, Mr. Kroc. The price is $4 million." 
</P>
<P>
 "Four million?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Joan Kroc heard her husband say that, it triggered what might best be 
described as a spirited domestic discussion. The bottom line was it was Kroc's 
money and he'd spend however he chose. And at that moment, he chose to spend it 
on Catfish Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi had the go-ahead. He told Cherry the contract was acceptable and to 
start drafting the papers. The deal was done. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then," Bavasi said dryly, "from Wilson, N.C., here comes Clyde Klutz." 
</P>
<P>
 Klutz was an old catcher and longtime scout who had signed Hunter to his first 
contract. By 1974, he was working for the New York Yankees and he was 
dispatched by Gabe Paul, president of the club. His arrival meant trouble for 
the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a key player," Paul said. "He talked to Catfish and convinced him he'd 
be better off in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee owner George Steinbrenner was under suspension at the time but Paul 
admits the boss was kept appraised of the Hunter negotiations. "Sure, I talked 
to George," he said. "No parameters were set but as the talks went along, we 
knew we were in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees were not scared off by Hunter's demand and offered him $3.75 
million. "The competition was so fierce," Paul said, "We knew it would take 
that much." 
</P>
<P>
 When Bavasi checked in with Cherry, he noticed a distinct reduction in 
enthusiasm. Finally, the lawyer told him, "Things have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-oh. 
</P>
<P>
 As lawyers for both sides reviewed the deal line by line, it seemed nothing 
had changed. And then, Kroc's attorneys said they wanted one more thing, for 
Hunter to serve as a spokesman for McDonald's in the southeast. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's impossible!" Cherry raged. "My client doesn't smoke, drink or 
dissipate! We don't have a deal!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Cherry seized the opportunity to get out," Bavasi said. "Kroc went ballistic. 
I thought I would be fired. The lawyers understood what was going on, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gabe was a savvy old guy. He stayed in the weeds until the end and then he 
played his trump card with Klutz." 
</P>
<P>
 On New Year's Eve, the Yankees unveiled their prize pitcher. It was a defining 
moment in modern baseball history, a turning point in what would become an 
economic revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams had been bidding blind, with no idea what the competition was 
offering. They were falling over each other, trying to sweeten the pot for 
Hunter. The price just kept on escalating. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, now out of the game after running the Toronto and Cleveland franchises 
as well as the Padres, puts it this way: 
</P>
<P>
 "Isolate that signing and it tells you all you need to know about how baseball 
got in the mess it is in. All of this was created and sustained by the owners 
themselves. It was simply a complete lack of self-restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Catfish Hunter with a Styrofoam cup in his hand. He didn't have a gun 
to my head."

IRVINE MAKES IT TWO IN A ROW, 73-70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a toddler taking its first tentative steps, UC Irvine was alternately 
swaggering and staggering Saturday night, but the Anteaters clung to a 73-70 
victory over the University of San Diego in front of 1,767 in the campus Sports 
Center gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in almost a year that the Anteaters (2-2) have won two 
in a row. And it's a streak that might have been three had they been able to 
make a free throw in the final seconds of regulation last week against 
14th-ranked Ohio University. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the exact same situation tonight as we were against Ohio and the 
difference was that this time we made one of the free throws," Coach Rod Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Bobcats, freshman Kevin Simmons missed the front end of a 
one-and-one situation and Irvine lost in overtime. Against San Diego, senior 
Mark Odsather made one of two free throws with seven seconds remaining and Zuri 
Williams blocked David Fizdale's three-point attempt at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a monster game for us," Baker said. "It's a win on the road against 
a good team. If we're ever going to be any good, we have to win these." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, which began the game shooting 63% from the line, made 14 of 18 free 
throws in the final 7:14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters seemed to have command of the game when Williams made one of two 
free throws to put the Anteaters ahead, 71-64, with 24 seconds remaining. But 
Doug Harris, who made four of six three-pointers and led the Toreros (3-2) with 
23 points, made a three over Williams' outstretched arm with 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalid Channell, who had nine points and eight rebounds, made a free throw to 
give Irvine a 72-67 advantage with 15 seconds remaining, but Sean Flannery made 
a shot from about a yard beyond the three-point stripe to cut the Anteaters' 
lead to two with seven seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I missed the first free throw, I was thinking, 'Oh, no, another Ohio 
U.,' " Odsather said. "But I was determined to make them have to make one from 
20 feet instead of two feet to get this one into overtime."

 Things went from bad to worse for Pepperdine's basketball team Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves committed 28 turnovers and lost to Boise State, 74-53, in a 
nonconference game at Boise, Ida.

<P>
 It was the fifth loss in a row for Pepperdine (1-5), the team's longest losing 
streak since a six-game skid in 1986-87. 
</P>
<P>
 The start is Pepperdine's worst since the 1973-74 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two Pepperdine players scored in double figures. Junior center Gavin 
Vanderputten scored 13 points, and sophomore guard Gerald Brown had 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State's All-Big Sky center John Coker, meanwhile, had 21 points and 
eight rebounds. Sophomore forward J.D. Huleen had 14 points and senior guard 
Sherman Morris 10 for the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State (4-1) led only 29-23 at halftime, but outscored the Waves, 45-30, 
in the second half.

 The coach of winless York College ordered his players to make three 
consecutive baskets for the other team to put them over 100 points Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 After Midland Lutheran went up, 98-51, with about eight minutes remaining, 
York inbounded the ball and a York player took it for a layup on his own 
basket.It happened twice more before the referees called timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a team is beating us badly, then we're not going to let them score the 100 
points on us," Coach Rod Baxter said. "We're going to do it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Keith Krabbe, Midland's sports information director: "I had absolutely no 
idea why he did it. I was standing there with my jaw hanging open, wondering 
how to score it." 
</P>
<P>
 Midland (5-2) ended up winning 124-69. York dropped to 0-15.

MURRAY HITS FROM LONG RANGE AND HELPS USC TO 95-89 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 After showing he could play defense when he set a school record for steals in 
his previous game, freshman Cameron Murray demonstrated another skill Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray made five of nine three-point shots in USC's 95-89 victory over Houston 
at Hofheinz Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenzo Orr led the Trojans with 26 points, but the play of Murray -- who shot 
only once from inside the the three-point line -- was critical in giving USC 
(3-3) its second consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, it was fighting fire with fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston made four of five three-point shots in building a 27-10 lead in the 
first 6 1/2 minutes. The first answer came from Claude Green, who scored all 15 
of his points in the first half. The Trojans used a 27-14 run to help whittle 
that deficit to 53-50 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was Murray's turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Two free throws provided his only first-half points, but he starting shooting 
from long range shortly after halftime. Murray made two three-point baskets in 
lifting USC to a 60-57 lead with 17:33 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans were never headed. 
</P>
<P>
 His other three-point baskets came over the next 7 1/2 minutes, helping USC to 
a 10-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Cougar was not surprised. "I knew he could do that," said Tommie 
Davis, who played in high school for Crenshaw and was on an AAU team with 
Murray. Davis had 10 points for Houston (1-4), which has lost four in a row.

 Nine months after taking a drubbing at the hands of Maryland in the NCAA 
tournament, Massachusetts wilted once again in the second half against the 
Terrapins on Saturday. This time, though, the Minutemen survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Williams scored 12 of his 18 points after halftime as No. 5 Massachusetts 
beat the 11th-ranked Terrapins, 85-74, at Baltimore, overcoming a 30-point 
effort by Joe Smith and gaining some revenge for last season's bitter loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, the Minutemen blew a 10-point second-half lead in a 95-87 setback 
that put Maryland in the final 16. The Minutemen lost a nine-point lead this 
time but rallied to win, closing with a 15-3 run. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's December. This means nothing," UMass Coach John Calipari said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Camby scored 15 points for UMass (3-1), playing its third game against 
a top 25 team. Lou Roe, saddled by foul trouble throughout, was held to six 
points -- his fewest in 39 games. Maryland is 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Arkansas 94, Murray State 69 -- Clint McDaniel and Corey Beck made six 
of eight three-pointers in the first half and Dwight Stewart hit three 
consecutive three-pointers in the second half as the Razorbacks (6-1) beat the 
Racers (3-2) at Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel finished with 17 points and Beck 16. Corliss Williamson added 13.

 Arkansas was without injured forward Scotty Thurman (sprained ankle) for the 
second game. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 Kansas 96, North Carolina State 91 -- Sean Pearson led a record-setting

</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Florida 91, Texas 73 -- Dametri Hill scored 17 points and grabbed a 
career-high 11 rebounds to lead the Gators (4-1) past the Longhorns (3-1) at

suspension, sparked the Gators throughout en route to his first career 
double-double. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas was led by guard Roderick Anderson, who scored 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 7 Kentucky 90, Boston University 49 -- Tony Delk and Antoine Walker each 
scored 13 points as the Wildcats (4-1) turned up the defensive pressure in 
crushing the Terriers (3-2) at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky scored 30 points off Boston University's 26 turnovers and limited the 
Terriers to 17-for-63 shooting from the field (27%) in scoring a season low. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky turned the ball over 24 times, but Coach Rick Pitino substituted 
often against his former school. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Duke 69, No. 23 Michigan 59 -- Coaches Mike Krzyzewski and Steve Fisher 
had to answer questions about their teams' impressive runs and terrible 
droughts. Duke (5-1) had two of the former and Michigan (4-3) two of the latter 
as the Blue Devils won at Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines' 24-0 run turned a 17-point deficit into a 35-28 lead in the 
first half. Duke, however, held Michigan scoreless for 8:57 of the second half 
as the Blue Devils turned a five-point deficit into a 61-51 lead with 3:52 
left.

held on to hand the Badgers (4-1) their first loss of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Kareem Carpenter added 21 points and pulled down 18 rebounds as the Eagles

 Wisconsin's Michael Finley tried his best to overcome the loss of Griffith 
with a career-high 42 points. 
</P>

 Nebraska 96, No. 15 Michigan State 91 -- The Cornhuskers (6-1) scored the 
first seven points of overtime and made five of six free throws in the final 27

 According to reports, William J.F. Hongach and Michael Bertolini, who ran a 
1989 show at the Tropicana Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J., featuring 
11 sluggers with 500 or more homers, said at plea hearings that they made many 
payments in cash "with the understanding it wouldn't be reported to the IRS."

 The Cincinnati Enquirer reported that Bertolini is a former business partner

AFTER A DULL YEAR, JANZEN STRIKES A MATCH; GOLF: HE REACHES FINAL WITH MEDIATE. 
PALMER AND NICKLAUS ADVANCE IN SENIOR TOUR EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a golf hangover: You win the U.S. Open and then spend the next year and 
a half trying to figure out what you did right. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lee Janzen, winning the 1993 U.S. Open at Baltusrol was so long ago, it 
feels as if it happened to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think next year will be my best year," Janzen said. "I know it will be." 
</P>
<P>
 It probably can't be any worse than 1994. Sure, Janzen won the Buick Open in 
June and finished fourth at the Kemper the week before, but he also missed 
seven cuts and had only two other top-20 finishes. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, not the kind of year a champion is supposed to have. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never found it difficult to come back after winning a major," Jack Nicklaus 
said. "I mean, you can't let your career end with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Janzen doesn't plan to. He and Rocco Mediate play Jeff Maggert and Jim 
McGovern in the PGA Tour final of the $2.1-million Diners Club matches today at 
the Nicklaus Resort Course at PGA West. 
</P>
<P>
 The way things are going now, Janzen feels he is playing his best golf of the 
year, a year he would just as soon forget. 
</P>
<P>
 He changed equipment twice, changed management firms, broke his finger playing 
pickup basketball, had hernia surgery and became a father. Other than that, 
nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly nothing much happened on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had big expectations; I really didn't put the effort out," Janzen said. "I 
think I needed a vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Floyd, who has won the PGA Championship twice, the U.S. Open and the 
Masters, said he always came back from good years with no goals except to 
improve as a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you win a major championship, the next year will be a bad year if you 
forget what got you there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So there's some advice for Janzen, who has some for himself about what to do 
with 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, I started my year over in May," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer birdied their way into the Senior PGA Tour final 
with a 4-and-3 victory over Jim Dent and Chi Chi Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably the best final of the day, with Floyd and Dave Eichelberger the 
opposition after a 3-and-2 victory over Gibby Gilbert and Larry Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer defined his role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still giving Jack all the moral support I can muster," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer also contributed two birdies. Nicklaus had four, including a curling 
15-footer on No. 11 to go 2 up. 
</P>
<P>
 Tammie Green's 25-foot birdie putt on the 17th hole enabled her and Kelly 
Robbins to defeat Laura Davies and Karen Lunn, 2 and 1, and reach the LPGA tour 
final against Dottie Mochrie and Julie Inkster. 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins won three holes on the back nine for the team and impressed Green. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know how to ride a horse," she said. "I just put the whip to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Mochrie and Inkster, who defeated Beth Daniel and Meg Mallon, 1 up, got the 
edge they needed on No. 12 when Mochrie rolled in a 25-footer for birdie. 
Inkster said she knew it was going in. 
</P>

NCAA WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS; LONG BEACH STATE FALTERS, OHIO STATE 
HEADS FOR TEXAS 
</P>

 Those confused expressions and frustrated grimaces told the story. 
</P>
<P>
 After finding a little something extra to overcome challenges so many times 
before, the Long Beach State women's volleyball team could search all it liked, 
but it wouldn't come up with what it needed Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending national champion 49ers were overpowered by Ohio State, 15-5, 
14-16, 15-9, 15-5, in the Northwest Regional championship match of the NCAA 
tournament in front of 1,219 at Long Beach's Gold Mine gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State (29-2), the region's top-seeded team, moves on to the national 
final four at the University of Texas. The Buckeyes will play Stanford (30-1) 
on Thursday at Austin. The championship game is scheduled for Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buckeyes last played in the final four in 1991. They lost to eventual 
national champion UCLA, 15-8, 15-8, 15-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State dominated the deciding fourth game Saturday night, hitting .529%. 
The Buckeyes led, 13-2, at one point. Junior middle blocker Jenny Jackson ended 
the match with a kill. Jackson led Ohio State with 21 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended the career of 49er senior outside hitter Nichelle Burton, who 
had a match-high 24 kills. Burton, the Big West Conference's player of the 
year, was a two-time All-American selection. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the teams' third meeting in the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach defeated Ohio State in the Northwest Regional semifinals last 
season at the Gold Mine. Ohio State defeated Long Beach Sept. 3 during the Long 
Beach Invitational at the Gold Mine. 
</P>
<P>
 After three games Saturday night, Ohio State led, 2-1. The 49ers (27-6) led in 
the third game, 8-6, on a kill by Burton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buckeyes tied the score at 8-8 and then controlled the game, limiting the 
49ers to one score the rest of the way. The game ended, 15-9, when a kill 
attempt by 49er senior middle blocker Traci Dahl went long.

NBA ROUNDUP; ABDUL-RAUF FABULOUS IN NUGGET ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If this keeps up, everyone will start skipping practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, fined by the Denver Nuggets for missing Thursday's 
workout, scored 31 points as a reserve -- including five three-pointers -- as 
the Nuggets won their fourth in a row, beating the Washington Bullets, 111-89, 
Saturday night in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Rauf's exploits overshadowed the reunion of three-fifths of Michigan's 
Fab Five -- Jalen Rose, Chris Webber and Juwan Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose had a career-high 14 points for Denver. Webber had 15 points and 10 
rebounds and Howard had only four points for the Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how they say when you're in a zone," Abdul-Rauf said. "This was one 
of those games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good. It's been a long time since I've played this many minutes. My 
shots were falling and guys were looking for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 106, Chicago 103 -- Rookie Glen Robinson's three-point play with 5.3 
seconds remaining lifted the Bucks to a victory over the Bulls in Milwaukee, 
snapping a nine-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first game-winning play for Robinson, the top pick in the June 
draft. He finished with 18 points in his first game against the team he rooted 
for while growing up in Gary, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 B.J. Armstrong had 21 points for the Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 109, Atlanta 98 -- Shaquille O'Neal dominated at both ends of the 
floor, scoring 33 points and grabbing 13 rebounds to lead the league's hottest 
team, the Magic, to a triumph over the Hawks in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the 13th in 14 games for Orlando, which improved the league's 
best record to 15-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Mookie Blaylock led the Hawks with 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 108, Houston 96 -- Avery Johnson led a balanced Spur attack with 
24 points and Chuck Person hit six of nine three-point shots in a victory over 
the Rockets in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio played without Dennis Rodman, who was removed from the team's 
suspended list Saturday but did not suit up. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon led the Rockets with 20 points. David Robinson scored 18 
points and had 11 rebounds for the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 99, Charlotte 86 -- Jamal Mashburn scored 31 points and Jim Jackson 
added 20 as the Mavericks beat Charlotte for their ninth victory of the season 
-- a total they didn't reach until April 5 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dick Motta moved into third place on the NBA's all-time victory list 
with 865, breaking a tie with Jack Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonzo Mourning had 20 points and Larry Johnson 19 to pace the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 106, Golden State 94 -- Brian Grant scored 23 points, including 11 
of Sacramento's final 20 points, as the Kings handed the Warriors their fifth 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Richmond led the Kings with 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Hardaway had 23 points to pace the Warriors, who scored only one point in 
the final 3:42. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 107, Philadelphia 103 -- Patrick Ewing hit two crucial hook shots 
down the stretch, finishing with a season-high 28 points and 15 rebounds in the 
Knicks' victory in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Weatherspoon had 29 points to lead Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 117, Miami 103 -- Hot-shooting Reggie Miller tied his season high with 
33 points as the Pacers earned their fifth consecutive victory in beating Miami 
Heat in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Rice led Miami with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 87, Detroit 79 -- Chris Mills scored 17 points, including the final 
five of the clinching 13-3 run, as the Cavaliers beat the injury-riddled 
Pistons in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit, which lost its sixth consecutive road game, had only nine players -- 
and only one of its top five scorers -- in uniform. Lindsey Hunter (broken 
ankle) and Oliver Miller (broken hand) were placed on the injured list earlier 
in the day, and Joe Dumars (bronchitis) and Grant Hill (flu) did not make the 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's Allan Houston, starting for the first time this season, scored a 
season-high 28 points. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 108, Boston 96 -- P.J. Brown hit four baskets and finished with 15 
points as the New Jersey Nets took command by hitting their first 10 shots in 
winning in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The Celtics' Dominique Wilkins was limited to nine points on four-of-21 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 103, Minnesota 89 -- Rookie Wesley Person scored seven of his 25 
points during a 17-1 run in the fourth quarter as the Suns won in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Suns remained perfect against Minnesota, winning all 22 meetings. 
Minnesota also extended its club-record home losing streak to 13 games, dating 
to last season.

HIGH SCHOOL CROSS-COUNTRY; NEW HAMPSHIRE RUNNERS GO 1-2 IN BOYS' RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matt Downin and John Mortimer made it a big day for little New Hampshire at 
the Foot Locker national cross-country championships at Morley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Downin, of Pinkerton Academy in Hampstead, N.H., pulled away from his best 
friend, John Mortimer of Londonderry, in the final 100 meters Saturday to 
become the first New Hampshire runner to win the boys' title in the 16-year 
history of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sixth time this season that Downin had raced Mortimer, and he 
evened the score at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Downin's time was 14 minutes 58.3 seconds over a course that was just short of 
5,000 meters. Mortimer finished in 15:03.1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think that we would both be on again today," said Downin, who 
finished eighth in the nationals last year. "But when it came down to the two 
of us at the end, it felt great." 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' race, Santa Rosa sophomore Julia Stamps blew away the field with 
a time of 16:41.9. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamps, who won the 3,200 meters in the State track championships in June as a 
ninth-grader at Rincon Valley Junior High in Santa Rosa, defeated runner-up 
Sally Glynn (17:12.1) of Johnson High in Rockville, Md., by more than 20 
seconds.

AIRING THE PROS AND CONS OF BOLSA CHICA WETLANDS PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many people have argued the merits of the Bolsa Chica plan -- the revenue and 
jobs it will bring to the community, and having the wetlands restored at no 
cost to the taxpayers. The only argument against it is that homes will be built 
on portions of the wetlands. Obviously the planning commissioners saw that the 
benefits far outweighed the negatives, and voted to approve the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it goes before the Board of Supervisors. I hope they, too, will see that 
the arguments of those opposed are selfish and that the good of the many will 
be served by approving the plans and restoring the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 There's one added benefit -- we'll all be able to enjoy the restored wetlands, 
along with the wildlife that will live there. I'm looking forward to that. 
</P>
<P>
 STEVEN D. ANDERSON 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * According to the Orange County Planning Commission, it now appears that the 
Bolsa Chica wetlands will have to be destroyed in order to save them. The 
commission's vote to approve the construction of 3,300 houses at Bolsa Chica 
would add some 10,000 people and who knows how many cats to prey upon wild 
birds. This is a ludicrous way to save a wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that development is the only way to finance wetlands restoration is 
very narrow-minded. Many biologists say the planned tidal inlet could upset the 
delicate balance of the wetlands, as well as cause destructive impacts on the 
adjacent ocean beaches, which we value so highly. More moderate, unobtrusive 
and economical ways can help Mother Nature repair the damage that was done over 
the last 70 years by the unrepentant oil companies. They ignored a basic tenet 
of civilized living: clean up your own mess. Instead the oil companies took 
their enormous profits and ran right out of Orange County with them. 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than half a century of aggressive oil drilling to almost destroy 
Bolsa Chica. A walk through the present ecological reserve proves that nature 
is more resilient and self-healing than we think. It is ironic that now we face 
more despoliation of the wetlands by another profit-hungry company. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors can show true leadership and courage by 
voting to stop development of one of the last remaining wetlands in California: 
the rare and valuable gem of Bolsa Chica. 
</P>

 * The Orange County governmental machine is ramrodding its development plan 
for the Bolsa Chica through the approval process. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Planning Commission voted to recommend to the Board of 
Supervisors the building of 3,300 homes on the Bolsa Chica mesa and wetlands. 
Why? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolsa Chica area of Huntington Beach does not need more homes. There are 
already more than enough homes approved but not yet built to thoroughly congest 
the area and gridlock traffic in the years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is under no obligation to approve development in this area based on 
property rights because the land is zoned agricultural now as it was when 
purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the county have to prove again that they are a government of the 
developer, by the developer and for the developer? 
</P>
<P>

 * On Nov. 16, I was present at a ceremony at which the county of Orange 
dedicated the Linear Park (at the southern end of the Bolsa Chica). Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder, after whom the park has been named, was the last guest 
speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, during her concluding remarks, told the gathering how wonderfully the 
open space at the new park would complement the Koll project (which calls for 
the construction of somewhere between 2,500 and 4,884 homes on and around the 
Bolsa Chica wetlands). 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the supervisor's comments, it is little wonder that many citizens 
in Huntington Beach are skeptical of the county of Orange's review of the 
ill-advised and unnecessary Koll housing project at Bolsa Chica. The expensive 
and time-consuming county review process seems, at this point, to be little 
more than a rubber stamp approval of what Supervisor Wieder apparently 
perceives will be a personal victory.

JAIL ON BASE PROPERTY IS WORTHY OF STUDY; PROPOSAL WOULD CLOSE MUSICK, BUILD 
FACILITY IN EL TORO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors was wise last week to authorize the 
study of a new jail at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station after the Marines 
strike the colors there. The county's fiscal crisis complicates matters, with 
sheriff's spokesmen saying it is too early to tell if future construction 
projects will be jeopardized. But the county cannot put all planning for its 
future on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton had proposed shutting the James A. Musick Branch 
Jail in Irvine and selling it. Proceeds from the sale of the jail and -- more 
interesting for developers -- the valuable 100 acres on which it stands, could 
be used to build a new jail at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines are scheduled to leave by 1999, after which the federal government 
could give the property to the county, meaning the only cost would be for 
construction. Operating costs at the new jail would probably be much the same 
as at the old one, and the study will examine that. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton acknowledged that his proposal was preliminary. But it gained support 
from County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider's assertion that Musick, 
which is equipped to hold more than 1,200 minimum-security inmates, was "fast 
approaching the end of its useful life." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton's suggestion was encouraging because it indicated that one of the 
supervisors was willing to act on the knowledge that the county must seek 
solutions to its jail overcrowding problem. Supervisor William G. Steiner has 
also been involved in the jail problem, but has been pressed more to put out 
fires than plan for the future. It was Steiner who was forced to negotiate a 
tentative agreement last month with the city of Orange to expand the Theo Lacy 
Branch Jail in Orange by 1,660 beds. It was a good compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Supervisor Thomas F. Riley's initial response to Stanton's 
proposal contained more pique than good sense. Riley complained that Stanton 
should have consulted him first, because the Marine Corps base is in his 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley did change his mind and support Stanton's proposal, so long as the 
possibility of building a new Santa Ana jail was considered. Last month the 
county grand jury recommended building new jails next to Musick and the main 
jail in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Stanton would be better off politically with a new jail in a district 
other than his, but that was no reason to reject cavalierly his promising 
proposal. The federal Bureau of Prisons has indicated its interest in using 
part of El Toro for a minimum-security prison, suggesting it is feasible to use 
the land for that purpose. And with 4,700 acres, there is sufficient room for 
both a jail and a prison. And an airport. And perhaps other facilities. All are 
worth study. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County residents pride themselves on a conservative penal philosophy 
that favors locking people up. But no one wants a jail in his or her back yard. 
Something has to give. Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates has been forced to let 
tens of thousands of inmates out of jail early because he has no space and a 
federal court order has barred overcrowding for more than a decade. County 
officials should put the possibility of building a jail at El Toro at the top 
of their priority list.

BARGAINING SOUGHT ON 'SPACE SAVER' SCHOOL; STATE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THE 11-ACRE 
SANTA ANA SITE IS ACQUIRED AT REASONABLE PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Unified School District deserves credit for battling to win 
authorization to build the first experimental "space saver" school in 
California. But the state now must ensure it does not pay too much for the 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's vote by the State Allocation Board approved the appraisal of an 
11-acre site in Santa Ana's Bristol MarketPlace shopping complex, where the 
school district wants to erect a three-story building, with the upper floors 
for intermediate school students and the bottom level for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of "space saver" schools is good. Rather than a sprawling, 
horizontal building on one level, the school stretches upward. Officials said 
it was designed especially for urban areas where space is tight and would allow 
building without the need to condemn someone's property. Still, the legislation 
passed in the late 1980s but had not been used. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the vote, there had been doubt about the intentions of the Allocation 
Board, which disburses funds for school sites and construction. Board members 
expressed skepticism earlier this year about the estimated $43-million price 
for the property. A report by state real estate experts said the parcel would 
cost $40 a square foot compared to $8 to $15 per square foot at other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials countered that only the Bristol MarketPlace property 
met the state requirements for minimum space and numerous nearby students. They 
argued that the state encouraged the district to apply for the funds and warned 
the city that to pick a different site would risk forfeiting the money. The 
Allocation Board overrode the real estate report, saying it did not want to get 
caught up in a political dispute between the school district and residents near 
the proposed school. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board owed the public a more detailed explanation of why it felt the 
real estate experts were wrong, or why it decided to bypass them. Even the 
author of the "space saver" legislation, state Sen. Leroy L. Greene 
(D-Carmichael), said that while he voted for the project, it did not match the 
picture he had when he wrote the law.

 State officials have approved $23 million for the project but said the final 
price tag for the property has not been decided. There is no doubt that Santa 
Ana schools have been facing a space crunch for years and the new building will 
help greatly, but that would not justify the state paying too much money. Hard 
bargaining is needed.

COMPROMISE TAKES US OUT OF QUAGMIRE; PLANNERS ANSWER BOTH DEVELOPERS AND 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS ON THE BOLSA CHICA ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would have been impossible to devise a plan for the development of the 
Bolsa Chica wetlands that would satisfy everybody.  
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, it was predictable that there would be some strong reaction to 
the county Planning Commission's staff recommendation for a compromise 
proposal. But the plan, which strives to balance the rights of land development 
with sensitivity to the environment, is probably about as good as can be 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would allow construction of as many as 3,300 homes and would require 
the creation of a tidal inlet connecting the sensitive ecological area to the 
ocean. It was not even out of the gate when an official of the Koll Real Estate 
Group, which wants to build as many as 4,286 homes on the land, criticized it. 
The official said the county was being too tough, and that there was a question 
whether it would even be financially feasible. By the time the plan was 
approved, the Koll group official was saying the project appeared to be 
feasible, even though it allowed for about 1,000 fewer homes.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the debate, project opponents were saying that the inlet 
would pollute nearby beaches. Others hoped for Interior Department action on 
possibly acquiring the wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, county planners knew all along the difficulty of their tasks, 
having said previously that they were suggesting two alternatives, one for 
3,200 homes and the other for 2,500. While the final recommendation calls for 
the tidal inlet that was contained in neither original plan, it has come in 
relatively close to what they said. The inlets plan, while criticized by some, 
was warmly received by Chuck Smith, president of the Amigos de Bolsa Chica, an 
environmental group that has taken a more moderate position all along. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, there will be a price to pay for somebody. There was no way the 
county was going to allow a density of 4,286 homes, and there was no way that 
it would satisfy the extreme position on the other side.  
</P>
<P>
 What the county has come up with is a plan that still has a lot of units while 
addressing environmental concerns. And it has done so after a commendable 
period of thorough review.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan now goes on to the Board of Supervisors for consideration and will 
require clearance from the California Coastal Commission and U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers. But in general, the Planning Commission has done important work 
along the road of this contentious development proposal.

PROP. 187 'FLU' WOULD GET ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What impact on the local economy would result if up to 25% of the population 
stayed home from work one day? Or didn't buy anything for a single day? 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly the goal of a nonviolent demonstration being called for on 
Monday, when the Latino communities of Orange County, Montebello and other 
areas are mounting a "187 Flu Brownout." 
</P>
<P>
 This grass-roots effort by native-born and immigrant groups seeks to call 
attention to the contribution of "suspects" under the litigation-shrouded 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The move has gained encouragement far beyond the Latino community, with labor, 
civic and business, black and Asian groups supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, who will wash our cars, prepare our restaurant meals, clean our 
offices and hospitals, maintain the nuts and bolts of Orange County's tourist 
industry? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps such a grass-roots effort by a few working, taxpaying consumers is 
what's needed to show their contribution to the community at-large.

 I am a high school student, and I am very pleased to hear that the students of 
Orange County are doing so well as shown on the standard tests and low dropout 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 It is good to see that many of the students are applying themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 It is gratifying to know that teen-agers noted for irresponsibility may be 
changing some opinions.

LINDSAY DAVENPORT MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE WITH FAME, BUT AMERICA'S TOP-RANKED 
WOMEN'S TENNIS PLAYER CONTINUES TO . . .; SHINE IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This won't do at all. The top-ranked American woman tennis player is not 
behaving in a manner equal to her station. She is on the court hitting, but 
shagging her own balls. 
</P>
<P>
 A photographer is seeking to place the No. 6-ranked player in the world in all 
manner of awkward positions and she's complying with good humor. 
</P>
<P>
 A reporter has been hanging around the Newport Beach tennis club for hours and 
the player doesn't mind . 
</P>
<P>
 It's enough to give tennis a good name. There are no entourage, no smarmy 
agents and no bejeweled small dogs. Just Lindsay Davenport and her 18-year-old 
self, full of an athlete's killer confidence and a teen-ager's self-doubt. This 
is the new wave, America's no-problem champion. BRIGHT LIGHTS, BIG CITY 
</P>
<P>
 The setting: Madison Square Garden, New York City. The finals of the Virginia 
Slims Championships. Television. Across the net is the tour's pouty 
heart-throb, Gabriela Sabatini, who even while sweating -- maybe especially 
while sweating -- exudes a healthy glamour. Gabby, with her perky nickname and 
a smile that blinds, is clearly the crowd favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 And here you are. Your hair does not cascade, it meekly agrees to be 
ponytailed. Your sweat does not make you glow, it only makes you damp. You are 
acutely aware that you are 6 feet 3 and scrunch down. Your white tennis skirt 
feels too short and you absently tug on it. You wish everyone would stop 
looking at you. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Davenport loves the part where you play tennis and get to smack the 
ball but she doesn't care for the time between points. She has adopted a stony 
stoicism on court, giving the impression that she has the nervous system of a 
clam. 
</P>
<P>
 Not true. She's roiling with emotion. But Davenport believes that if she pumps 
her fist after a winner, she'll somehow embarrass her opponent. Her father 
would scold her if she yelled at a linesman. The idea of doing a 
racket-flung-to-the-roof celebratory dance after winning a match is humiliating 
even to think about. 
</P>
<P>
 After she lost to Sabatini in New York, Davenport was happy to meet the press. 
She thinks that players who don't meet their obligations are spoiled. She 
chatted on about her great year, her second as a pro, and how nice it was to 
end the season on a high note. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, who grew up in Palos Verdes, talked about high school and her 
impending vacation to Hawaii and smiled and laughed with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 When the public can see Davenport like this, as an engaging, intelligent young 
woman who is relentlessly normal, it might take to her. But so far in her brief 
career, few can get past Lindsay the Tall or Lindsay the Big. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like that at the U.S. Open in September. With Martina Navratilova 
skipping the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, Davenport suddenly was 
thrust into the spotlight as the highest ranked American woman at her country's 
national championships. She had just graduated from high school, had just 
turned 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Much was expected of Davenport and when she lost in the third round to Mana 
Endo of Japan, it was not because of her inexperience. It became an issue of 
her fitness -- the code word for weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of awful things were written about me," Davenport said, still not 
comprehending. "Like, I'm too fat. I'm too slow. I didn't understand why they 
wrote that. It's not like I'm eating cheeseburgers all the time. I had a hard 
time right after the Open. I had a hard time dealing with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I freaked out. I hated it. I didn't want to play. I kept thinking, 'I'm not 
even one of the top players and I hate this. What must it be like for Steffi 
(Graf)?' I stopped reading anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport lists her weight at 165. There is a fullness in her face but she 
appears trim. For the last few months, she has been working with a fitness 
coach, as much to develop speed as to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynne Rolley, the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s director of women's coaching, began 
working with Davenport when the player was 12. Conditioning has always been a 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got constant work to do on that," Rolley said. "It's something she has 
to address. It's difficult for her with her size. It's important to be mobile 
and strong." 
</P>
<P>
 So much attention has been paid to her weight, however, that it's often 
forgotten that Davenport is still young and her body, whatever it may become, 
is still forming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that she needs to lose 10 pounds, at most," Billie Jean King 
said. "She's 100% slow twitch (muscle fiber), so her weight has nothing to do 
with her speed. That's genetics. Who cares? The good thing is that she doesn't 
have an eating disorder. Be thankful for that. I say, leave her alone. Let her 
be happy." SHE WHO STOOPS TO CONQUER 
</P>
<P>
 If U.S. tennis officials had watched Davenport hit golf balls at a driving 
range for the first time last week, they would have wanted to throw a sheet 
over her and spirit her off the course, lest the club pro see her. The kid can 
hit a golf ball. 
</P>
<P>
 She also can hit a tennis ball. You might say Davenport is a natural hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 On the court, she hits the ball cleanly and hard. Her ground strokes are solid 
and she shows signs of developing the power in her ever-improving serve to go 
along with the rest of her game.  
</P>
<P>
 Davenport got her early tennis training from Robert Lansdorp and when her 
family moved to Murietta while she was in high school, she began to work with 
Robert Van't Hof at the Palisades Tennis Club in Newport Beach, as well as 
Rolley, who often traveled with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning this week, Davenport will work with Craig Kardon, who along with 
King, coached Navratilova. Kardon will be able to spend more time on tour with 
Davenport. 
</P>
<P>
 The American tennis Establishment is watching Davenport with unmasked 
excitement. In Davenport they have a star with her feet on the ground who 
appears to be able to withstand the physical and emotional rigors of the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Davenport, who earned more than $600,000 in prize money this year, does not 
think of herself as being rich and lives a modest lifestyle with few 
extravagances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money doesn't blow me away, I make enough," Davenport said. "It's so 
abnormal. This is the only sport where a 14-year-old is making all the money 
for her parents and grandparents. It's gonna mess them up, if not now, then in 
10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents, Ann and Wink Davenport, say they have made a conscious effort not 
to raise a "tennis brat." When she travels with her daughter, rather than 
delivering a pep speech before the match, Ann Davenport will ask Lindsay what 
movie she wants to see afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay gets her height from her parents. Ann is 5-10 and Wink 6-8. Davenport 
does that shrinkage thing that some woman athletes do -- she fibs about her 
height, listing it as 6-2 in the WTA media guide. And she slouches to make 
herself seem smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Shriver, one of the tallest players on the tour at 6-1, said she sees some 
of herself in Davenport and knows the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see her stooping and I want to tell her to straighten up," Shriver said. "I 
remember when I was 17-18, I wasn't comfortable with my height. I stood out and 
I was miserable. In public life, you need a thick skin. No way anyone should be 
anything but nice to her. She's one of the nicest kids on the tour. She's very 
popular. But you know what? No one's safe. People will pick." 
</P>
<P>
 If she is left alone, Davenport's potential may shine through. Navratilova 
said she thinks Davenport will win a Grand Slam tournament. If Davenport is 
allowed to be herself, a funny and outgoing person among her friends, then she 
might be spared tennis' trash heap reserved for teen phenoms. 
</P>
<P>
 If no one else gets it, at least she does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm uncomfortable with the attention," Davenport said. "I'm not really 
adjusted to the whole scene. I can walk the street and hear people whispering, 
'That's Lindsay Davenport.' It makes me so uncomfortable. I don't handle it 
well. Some people think that's snobby, but it's really because I'm 
uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have someone helping you keep a level head. Otherwise, you'd go 
around thinking, 'Oh yeah, I'm the greatest. I won a tennis match.' The reality 
is that it doesn't mean anything to 99% of the people in the world."

THE ANTI-BEAR; FLORIDA FOOTBALL COACH STEVE SPURRIER IS DISLIKED NORTH OF 
FLORIDA, SOUTH OF OHIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE KINDRED, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Spurrier, the University of Florida football coach, is a Southern boy of 
some swagger whose fire in the belly is revealed when, sleepy-eyed and with a 
drawl, he explains why his'n beat your'un by five touchdowns. Throughout the 
South north of Florida, Spurrier's explanations have caused listeners to press 
their hands against their ears while calling for the coach's arrest on the 
charge of premeditated immodesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Immodesty is a crime against the memory of Bear Bryant. The Alabama god 
invented the mush-mouth way of congratulating losers while deflecting praise 
from himself so it would land on his players and their good mommas and daddies. 
Bear also created in Alabama football the virtue of bedrock fundamentals. His 
football was a simple game, just a matter of "puttin' your nose where it don't 
want to go." 
</P>
<P>
 What we have in Steve Spurrier, near the end of a millennium, is the coming of 
the anti-Bear. He has confessed to charges of letting you know he is darned 
good. He has done what not even the Bear did: won three Southeastern Conference 
championships his first five seasons. And Spurrier's team won this year by 
beating Alabama with football plays so far removed from bedrock fundamentals 
that they looked like . . . well, the plays looked like . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with Steve in east Tennessee when he was scratching those plays in 
the dirt," said Joe Biddle, a Nashville sportswriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida beat Alabama, 24-23, on a touchdown scored with just less than six 
minutes to play. To say that touchdown came on the 10th play of an 80-yard 
drive is to say nothing. Florida's work on that drive was bolder by a multiple 
of three than anything done on a football field anywhere at any time since . . 
. well, any time since . . . well, when did Emory & Henry College touch Steve 
Spurrier's life? 
</P>
<P>
 "The 1950s," said Joe Biddle. 
</P>
<P>
 What Florida did on a Saturday afternoon in 1994 was done on Saturdays when 
Annette Funicello wore Mickey Mouse ears. On that winning drive: 
</P>
<P>
 Florida faked an injury -- as Notre Dame faked an injury in 1953 and so 
preserved an undefeated season. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida went into an unorthodox spread formation with a wide receiver set far 
out on each side directly behind two other receivers -- as a little Virginia 
college did so well it became known as "the Emory & Henry shift." 
</P>
<P>
 Florida threw a long lateral followed by a pass downfield -- a "double pass" 
done by everyone from Pop Warner to the Stanford band and yet a risk seldom 
taken 22 yards from a touchdown on what might be your last possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida ran the ball only twice -- once a scramble by quarterback Danny 
Wuerffel and later on fourth-and-one at Alabama's 33 when a field goal might 
have been prudent. Even at the 2-yard line, Florida threw because the 
quarterback decided he couldn't score on the sneak ordered by Spurrier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing: Every play a gamble, every play built on the one preceding it, and 
every one worked. Put your nose where it don't want to go? Spurrier's guys won 
by puttin' their noses where nobody could find 'em, such as on the faked-injury 
play on first down 67 yards from a touchdown, the third play of the winning 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida practiced the charade all week. Wuerffel would limp off the field. 
Third-stringer Eric Kresser would rush in. The defense would expect a frenzied 
backup to hand off. Instead, because his arm is stronger than Wuerffel's, 
Kresser's role in the shadow show was to throw deep. Which he did, for 25 
yards, moving Florida into Alabama territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Wuerffel promptly sprinted back in and said later, "It was all acting." He 
had, in fact, gone down and might have been hurt. At that sight, Spurrier 
immediately said, "Kresser!" Kresser was rushing onto the field, snapping his 
chin strap, when Wuerffel saw him. That's when he began to limp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hobbled off," Wuerffel said to reporters, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hobble, hobble," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fake hobble," he said. (You can't be too clear with reporters.) Then one 
more smile: "Look good?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing much looks as good as college football when it means something. More 
than 74,000 people saw Florida-Alabama, all but three or four of those happy 
folks with elephant noses and gator jaws attached to their bodies. The bowl 
games are next, full of sound and fury but, alas, and the time is long past to 
change this, signifying no undisputed national champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in dramatic victory, Spurrier offered no tortured logic that would move 
his 10-1-1 team to the top of the voters' polls. He just said, "I can't see why 
college football is the only sport in the world that doesn't have a tournament 
to determine a champion. It's just the fairest way to do things." 
</P>
<P>
 We spoke of Notre Dame faking injury. At South Bend, Ind., on Nov. 21, 1953, a 
Fighting Irish team undefeated in six games was losing to Iowa, 7-0, with time 
running out in the first half. Coach Frank Leahy's team needed 12 yards for a 
touchdown but had no timeouts. So Leahy signaled tackle Frank Varrichione, who 
screamed, clutched his back and fell to the turf in pain clearly excruciating. 
</P>
<P>
 A referee rushed to Varrichione's side and stopped the clock. The poor guy was 
helped off the field. No doubt he hobbled. 
</P>
<P>
 During the timeout, Leahy conferred with quarterback Ralph Guglielmi, who 
returned to throw a touchdown pass. The game ended 14-all. Notre Dame went 
9-0-1 that season, Leahy's last. He would be remembered as a brilliant coach 
who gave college football both the Fighting Irish and the Fainting Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the identity of the Emory & Henry College coach who drew up that odd 
spread formation, the sportswriter Joe Biddle said, "I have no idea." He did 
remember one thing, though. The mention of the school reminded Biddle of his 
boyhood days with Spurrier when, for a while, both dated the same girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then she went off to school," Biddle said. "She brushed us off and she 
married a football player -- at Emory & Henry."

SET ADRIFT; RACER RIQUE FORD SEVERLY INJURED IN BOAT-JACKING INCIDENT AT HIS 
HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Offshore boat racing -- streaking across choppy waves and treacherous swells 
at more than 100 m.p.h. -- is one of the most dangerous sports. Insurance 
adjusters rate offshore racers only slightly below astronauts on the danger 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Rique Ford, who has won world and national championships since coming to 
California from Jamaica in 1979, has been racing ocean-going boats for five 
years and the worst things that have happened to him on the water were getting 
drenched when his boat flipped and getting lost at sea when he missed a buoy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the driveway of his home in Norco, however, one of the most horrifying 
accidents in history involving an offshore boat occurred on the morning of Oct. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 Rique Ford, 33, was run over by his own truck and trailer loaded with 
Ragamuffin, Ford's 32-foot catamaran, when a thief tried to speed off with one 
of the most visible boats in America. Three wheels carrying the 12,000-pound 
load rolled over Ford's lower abdomen, literally cutting him in half. 
</P>
<P>
 His pelvis was crushed, his spleen and colon ruptured, his stomach squeezed 
outside his body. Bones were broken in both hands, and he had cuts, bruises, 
and scratches all over his body after having been dragged along underneath the 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, at home now but still in bed after an 8 1/2-hour operation and more than 
a month in Riverside General Hospital -- and facing many more months of 
rehabilitation while doctors reconstruct his innards -- recalled his 
experience: 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up about 5:45 to take the boat to Newport Beach, where I was going to 
meet Eric Colby (editor of Powerboat magazine) at 10 o'clock to take some 
pictures of the boat and then take it out to test it. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I had the trailer hooked up, I was ready to go when I decided to get 
out of the cab and walk around the trailer and check the wires to make sure 
everything was working. I had to crawl under the boat, between the boat and 
trailer, to check them. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, the boat started moving. I grabbed the trailer to keep from 
getting run over and when I realized the boat was pulling out of the driveway, 
I jumped, or sort of fell, off on the pavement. I was clear of the wheels but 
whoever was in the cab made a turn and the trailer -- three wheels -- ran right 
over me. If he had stayed in the normal lane out of the driveway, I'd have been 
OK, but he turned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing lasted 20, maybe 30 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford never lost consciousness, but in the early morning hours on a Saturday, 
no one was around to see him, or hear him. His wife, Shelly, was still asleep 
in the house.  
</P>
<P>
 "I yelled as loud as I could, which probably wasn't very loud," Ford said. "I 
tried to move my feet to get up, but they wouldn't move. The pain in my back 
was killing me and when I looked down, I saw my stomach on the ground beside 
me. I picked it up and held it to my chest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember I kept yelling. 
</P>
<P>
 "One car pulled up, looked at me and went on down the street. Finally, after 
about 10 minutes, a neighbor (Mark Camarillo) heard me and came out to see what 
was wrong. As soon as he saw me, he ran back in the house and called the 
paramedics. If he hadn't come out, I'd probably never have lived." 
</P>
<P>
 The thief abandoned the truck, trailer and boat a few miles away, among the 
dairy farms south of Chino. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was loading up, about 10 minutes before I checked the wires, a guy 
walked up to the trailer, looked at it for a minute, then turned and walked 
away," Ford said. "He didn't say anything. At the time, I remember thinking it 
was kind of strange for a guy to be out at that time of the day, but I was busy 
and forgot about it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only time the boat had been at Ford's home all year. He had kept it 
docked at the Archer Marine yard in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, I towed it home Thursday night and it sat in the driveway 
all day Friday," Ford said. "Ninety-nine point nine percent of the time it's in 
Costa Mesa or at a race. Just one day and that guy spotted it and was waiting 
for his chance. I still don't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ragamuffin, was built by Douglas Marine in Douglas, Mich., at a cost of about 
$250,000. It has two engines from Teague Custom Marine of Valencia, worth about 
$75,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 It won the world Class C championship last year at Ft. Myers, Fla., with Ford 
the throttle man and Paul Whittier of Seattle the driver. Whittier and Kirk 
Drueteman, whom Rique asked to handle the throttle in his absence, successfully 
defended the championship last month in Key West, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford also won the American Power Boat Assn.'s national championship in a 
series of races across the country, winning at South Padre Island, Tex.; 
Jacksonville, Fla., and Galveston, Tex. He also finished second in Sarasota, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this crazy or what?" he said. "In five years, I've never been hurt in a 
boat, except for maybe my ego, and here I am, lying in a bed flat on my back 
from something that happened 25 miles from the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 After Ford left the hospital, he took out an ad in "The Racer's Edge," an 
offshore boating publication, thanking the hospital, doctors, medical students 
and nursing staff for "putting Rique back together again." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford still is in constant discomfort but sees better days ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me that with the proper therapy, I'll probably be 90% in more than 
six months," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular figures in offshore racing, friends love to recall the 
day Ford got lost in a race off Galveston and was headed across the Gulf of 
Mexico before he got turned around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a new race, all foreign territory to all of us," recalled George Ryon, 
a fellow competitor. "Rique grabbed the lead and we were right behind him, 
heading away from the harbor when Rique missed a buoy. We turned right and he 
went straight on out in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd gone about 20 miles (off course) when he sighted an oil derrick and 
stopped to yell at a worker and asked how to get to Galveston. The guy on the 
derrick said, 'Turn around and go right back where you came from.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we all had a laugh at that, and someone faxed the story all over the 
country. It became one of the sport's great jokes. And no one enjoyed it more 
than Rique. He's the kind of a guy who can laugh at himself. He's gregarious, 
but in a race he's as tough a competitor as you'll find. When it's over, he's 
buddies with everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors, nurses and therapists had to work around the many friends who crowded 
his hospital room, whose walls were covered with pictures of boats, checkered 
flags autographed by racers and friends and cards from well-wishers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rique was still in intensive care when I first went to see him," Ryon said. 
"When I walked past a nurse, she said, 'I suppose you're one of his brothers.' 
I said yes and she said, 'I never saw a man who had so many relatives. We've 
had three or four wives, three or four mothers, a couple of fathers and 25 or 
so brothers come in here. Funny, him being black and most of them white. Must 
be quite a family.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ford also competed in the Pacific Offshore Power Boat Racing Assn., a West 
Coast organization formed by the late Bob Nordskog. He has won the last three 
POPBRA championships in his class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got interested in boats when my dad raced in Jamaica when I was young," 
Ford said. "We moved to West Covina in 1979, but I was busy going to school at 
Cal Poly (Pomona) before I bought a runabout and went racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to watch the big guys, like Bob Nordskog and Vic Edelbrock and Tom 
Gentry, and I dreamed of racing a big boat some day. Nordskog was my idea of a 
real boat racer. He was still racing, and winning, when he was 78. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first big boat was named Empty Pockets, and it proved to be well named. 
Then I got my first Ragamuffin and then last year the one that ran over me." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said his most memorable races this year were against Bruce Penhall and 
Dennis Sigalos, the former world speedway motorcycle champions who got into 
powerboating this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had four races," Ford said. "We won two and they won two. We were going to 
decide our little private championship at Ventura the week after I got hurt. 
Bruce and Dennis beat my boat at Ventura, but I told them it didn't count 
because I wasn't in it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the world championships at Key West, Penhall and Sigalos raced in a 
different class and both teams won -- the Penhall boat in modified and Rique's 
boat in Class C. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Rique Ford go back to racing when he's able? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure," he said. "I really don't know."

 Doug Gottlieb sparked Tustin's 52-point, second-half performance as the 
Tillers beat Trabuco Hills, 89-70, in the championship game of the In-N-Out 
Burger/Converse Classic Saturday at Capistrano Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb, named the tournament most valuable player, scored 14 points in the 
second quarter and finished with 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tustin's defensive pressure was there from the outset," Trabuco Hills Coach 
Rainer Wolf said. "We had too many turnovers, and it disrupted our flow." 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills took an 11-5 lead behind Nick Punto's three-pointer, and 
increased it to 14-7 on Laquent Fobbs' three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some lightning-powered offense, and we can score in bunches," Wolf 
said. "But the turnovers quickly took us out of our rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin center David Lalazarian had 21 points and 12 rebounds. His quick outlet 
passes set up easy baskets by Aaron Krause, who finished with 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills managed to cut Tustin's lead to three at 51-48 with 2 minutes 35 
seconds remaining in the third quarter on Jonathon Paisley's jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-6 run by Tustin quickly widened the lead to 65-48. 
</P>
<P>
 Paisley led Trabuco Hills with 19 points, followed by Rob Warnick's 16. RICK

<P>
 Throughout the day, Irvine Coach John Phillips' confidence seemed to grow with 
each individual victory at the Vaquero Wrestling Classic on Saturday at Irvine 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the event, Irvine, ranked fifth in the county, not only won the 
tournament with 162 1/2 points -- more than 40 points ahead of second-place 
Camarillo -- but had two most valuable wrestlers declared in the lower and 
upper weights. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's Justin Meier, ranked No. 1 in the county at 135 pounds, won top 
honors in the lower weights after he pinned Huck Finn of Villa Park in 3 
minutes 46 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meier, a senior, won last week at the El Toro 10-Way, as did teammate Steve 
Ruiz (189), who was the top wrestler in the upper weights Saturday. Ruiz, a 
senior, pinned Justin Klein of Simi Valley in 1:20. Ruiz was the only wrestler 
to record pins in every match. 
</P>
<P>
 At 112 pounds, Peter Hamilton defeated Paul Soliz of Riverside Norta Vista, 
16-4, in the final. Hamilton, ranked No. 1 in the county, had two pins and two 
technical falls. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Brown, at 125 pounds, was Irvine's other champion. He defeated David 
Prusinkion of Goleta Dos Pueblos, 13-8. Seven Irvine wrestlers placed among the 
top four in their weight class. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo (109.5) finished third, Capistrano Valley (87) was sixth and 
Katella (65) ninth. ERIK HAMILTON

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; DEFENSIVE SWITCH HELPS CAPISTRANO VALLEY BEAT 
TRABUCO HILLS

 Freshmen Sabina Kissell and Elizabeth Fleming each scored 12 points to lead 
Capistrano Valley to a 43-38 victory over Trabuco Hills in the championship 
game of the South Coast girls' basketball tournament Saturday at University 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone told me we would win our first four games I would have been 
shocked," Capistrano Valley Coach Pete Belanto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Garrett, the tournament most valuable player, had nine points and 15 
rebounds and Kim Ford had seven points and eight assists but it was the 
defensive work of Nicole Franklin, especially in the second half, which pleased 
Belanto the most. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley had built up an 18-9 lead midway through the second quarter 
before Trabuco Hills (4-2) bounced back. Thanks in part to two three-point 
baskets by Dyanna Hatch and a three-point play by Sarah Warnick, the Mustangs 
had tied the score by halftime, 20-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Belanto made a defensive adjustment, putting Franklin on Hatch, and Hatch made 
only one of four shots in the second half.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON SCHOOL PRAYER; LAWMAKERS CAN BETTER HELP 
PUPILS; WITH SO MANY FAITHS, A SINGLE PRAYER SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED, NOR 
TOLERATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN F. DEAN, John F. Dean is Orange County superintendent of schools. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If we are to believe the media hype surrounding the first Republican Congress 
in decades, the battle cry will be "Bring Back School Prayer!" And most of the 
members of Congress will be considering bringing back something that never was. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the senators and representatives attended parochial or private 
elementary or secondary schools, the chances are very good that prayer in 
school was, at best, an annual event at baccalaureate or graduation -- unless 
they lived and attended school in New York or Baltimore prior to 1962. The 
issue of prayer in the public schools is not new; the U.S. Supreme Court has 
been addressing this issue for over 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1962, in a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision called Engel vs. Vitale, at 
issue was a New York statute that called for a 22-word regents' prayer in each 
classroom. The court held New York's statute unconstitutional, finding that the 
daily classroom invocation of God's blessings was a religious activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest court in the land did acknowledge that this nation was founded on 
Christian principles and that 64% of the nation's population professed church 
membership. Historically, this ruling on the regents' prayer is often cited as 
the benchmark prayer in the schools decision, but it subsequently became the 
most widely misunderstood of the court's actions on prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 As the most far-reaching decision at the time, it eliminated prayer in the 
public schools. But it did not preclude the right of any individual to pray 
silently nor, for that matter, did it outlaw moments of silence, provided they 
were not thinly veiled attempts to require participation in a schoolwide 
religious event. 
</P>
<P>
 Another landmark decision the following year found the Schempp family suing 
the Abington School District in Pennsylvania, seeking to void the practice of 
requiring that "at least 10 verses from the Holy Bible be read, without 
comment, at the opening of each public school on each school day." The U.S. 
Supreme Court ruled this practice unconstitutional in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Two names often associated with school prayer involve Madalyn Murray O'Hair 
and her son, William J. Murray III, who contested an historic 1905 action of 
the Board of School Commissioners of Baltimore City, Md., which provided for 
the holding of opening exercises in the city's schools that consisted primarily 
of the "reading, without comment, of a chapter of the Holy Bible and/or use of 
the Lord's Prayer." In an attempt to ameliorate the conflict, the board 
authorized students to be excused at the request of the parent. Finding that 
unacceptable, the Murrays pursued their goal, and the exercises were dropped in 
1963.  
</P>
<P>
 There are more -- thousands of pages of U.S. Supreme Court cases striking down 
as unconstitutional prayer or other religious activity in the public schools of 
our nation. Posting the Ten Commandments in Kentucky's public schools drew a 
similar fate in 1980, as did voluntary prayer at school assemblies in 1981. In 
1985, Alabama's "one-minute period of silence" statute for "meditation or 
voluntary prayer" was held to be solely "an effort to return voluntary prayer 
to the public schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent initial comments by a few legislators indicate support for a "generic" 
prayer acceptable to all organized religions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County alone, 78 different denominations are listed in the telephone 
books, ranging from "mainline" to the newest of faiths. It is difficult to 
contemplate a gathering of the 78 church leaders whose goal is a prayer 
acceptable to each congregation. Assuming such agreement is even remotely 
possible, is it not worth considering what truly major societal problems might 
be resolved given the same effort? 
</P>
<P>
 Prayer is primarily a private and personal communication with one's Supreme 
Being, or a corporate experience among a gathering of believers with the same 
convictions. To foist an impersonal prayer on a class of 35 children from 
conceivably 35 different churches is a violation of personal rights and should 
neither be considered nor tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Presbyterian, I would encourage the clarification of the Supreme Court 
decisions on school prayer -- if this issue had not been studied and decided 
time and time again. The issue of school prayer was addressed by the framers in 
the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Personally, I would support a 
moment of silence at the opening of the school day or, for that matter, the 
beginning of each class, primarily to allow the students "to get their act 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Schooling is serious business; education is important, and it just may be that 
children of all ages would be a bit more ready to learn, following a brief 
moment to concentrate on who they are and what they're about. 
</P>
<P>
 My nightly prayers always end with "and help me to do my best tomorrow." Now I 
may include Congress in those prayers, beseeching my Supreme Being to intervene 
in their thoughts and encourage them to put their best effort toward solving 
the real problems faced by our public schools. If they're stuck for an agenda, 
have them call me. 
</P>
<P>
 Amen.

WHERE WAS THE OVERSIGHT? THERE'S AMPLE BLAME FOR O.C. BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a retired banking executive, I find it appalling that one person could have 
had such control over the investments of such a large pool as in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservation of principal should be the conservative investment approach for 
any entity entrusted with public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 While I was aware of (Robert) Citron's repo investments, I presumed they were 
a very small piece of the county's funds. I find it somewhat ironic that the 
various municipality and agency treasurers are now running for cover when they 
knew what type of investments Mr. Citron was making. 
</P>
<P>
 He made no secret of these, as (John) Moorlach touted during his campaign. 
There was an element of greed connected with these investments that these 
various treasurers seem to now want to disavow. 
</P>
<P>
 I really question the oversight process in our county. The grand jury has the 
responsibility of investigating the various county agencies. In reviewing the 
summary of Orange County Grand Jury reports for the past 14 years, I find that 
the treasurer-tax collector entity has not been examined since 1985! How could 
this be given the recession we've experienced and the notoriety Mr. Citron's 
investments drew during his reelection bid?  
</P>
<P>
 Where was our Board of Supervisors? Why wouldn't they have raised the question 
about the prudence of his investments and had this looked at by an independent 
body?

 * As Orange County property owners pay $1 billion for the property tax 
installment this week, it is an especially bitter experience. We are merely 
replacing a portion of what was lost this year by the county government 
gambling with our hard-earned money. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.5-billion loss has implications far beyond Orange County, as it raises 
yet another question about the ability and efficiency of any government 
bureaucracy. Citron unwittingly provided another reason why many voters want 
government to do less whenever possible.

 * Our county treasurer-tax collector has to my knowledge been given no mandate 
to gamble or risk any taxpayer's money for a potential "higher than average

<P>
 Derivatives are guaranteed to make money only for the bank or financial 
institution that puts it together, the broker that brokers it, and the lawyers 
that later on will argue the legality of the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sophisticated and clever way of siphoning money out of the general 
economy where the payee ultimately becomes the taxpayer. 
</P>
<P>
 The pathetic part to the story is that I see no one willing to assume 
responsibility for this mess. 
</P>
<P>
 When a bridge collapsed in Seoul, South Korea, recently, the engineers that 
designed it were sent to jail. What Robert Citron has done is no less criminal 
than what former junk bond king Michael Milken did, and will cost the county 
more than the sum total of all burglaries committed in 1994.

 * Orange County is down $1.5 billion because our county treasurer, Bob Citron, 
made risky investments. The ramifications of this disaster are yet to be 
determined -- but it is safe to say we are in big financial trouble. Citron and 
his staff must accept the blame. But there are others who should be feeling 
uncomfortable -- for instance The L.A. Times. 
</P>
<P>
 This might have been avoided if voters would have taken John Moorlach 
seriously when he ran against Citron in the June elections. Moorlach exposed 
this problem and predicted the disaster. Why didn't the voters take Moorlach 
more seriously? 
</P>
<P>
 We trusted The Times! When The Times endorsed Citron, so did its readers. I 
think you owe the citizens of Orange County an apology. 
</P>
<P>
 B. O'NEIL 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Your editorial, "The Risk of Living in Investment's Fast Lane (Dec. 3)," 
made me wonder if there shouldn't be a law that prevents the state from 
gambling with the public's money -- ever. 
</P>
<P>
 In too many instances the word "investment" is but a euphemism for the word 
gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 If the state wants interest on its money, it should be "investing" in federal 
bonds or putting the money in federally insured banks. So all we may get is 3%. 
So what? At least we can all sleep at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst part is that they invested money they didn't have. They borrowed 
money on credit. Now that's got to be a no-no when dealing with the public's 
money.

EL TORO AIRPORT BATTLE ISN'T OVER YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The battle over the conversion of the El Toro Marine Base is just starting! 
Many newspaper writers and political leaders are acting like the game is over. 
Nothing is further from the truth! 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-airport supporters are ahead in the El Toro battle because of years of 
preparation by the people of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach homeowners are working against the clock. After the restrictions 
are removed from John Wayne Airport in 2005, and with technology improvements, 
the need for a second airport in Orange County will be gone, and Newport Beach 
will be stuck with planes flying overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of an El Toro commercial airport have been in a reactive mode ever 
since Measure A was placed on the ballot. But we have learned a lesson or two 
from the recent election, and now is the time to change our strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 First, El Toro Marine Base is federal land and is a federal issue. Voters 
should call and write their congressman to serve as advocates with the Defense 
Department and other agencies. Second, the cities of Irvine and Lake Forest 
must challenge the legality of all aspects of Measure A. Fellow South County 
cities must solidify with Irvine and Lake Forest to create the biggest impact! 
</P>
<P>
 Third, we must place on the ballot a Measure B that calls for the elimination 
of all restrictions on John Wayne Airport immediately and that it continue as 
the county's primary airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro-airport information indicates that an unrestricted John Wayne Airport 
can handle the county's airport needs at least to 2010 and without the cost to 
remodel El Toro. Wall Street has indicated that it is not interested in El 
Toro's revenue bonds with the John Wayne Airport in operation. 
</P>
<P>

 * Regarding the reuse of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station land, Supervisor 
(Roger R.) Stanton's proposal to build a county jail on a large chunk of the 
land shouldn't come as a surprise now that the county has truncated 
consideration of the adjacent communities under the guise of a Measure A 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the distance to existing residences may mitigate a large amount of 
concern with a jail, the existence of a jail may preclude other uses for the 
balance of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Would a large park or college be compatible with a jail? An adjoining 
transportation center would surely help escapees! How is a jail coincident with 
the intent of Measure A that the remaining 2,700 acres be airport-related uses? 
</P>
<P>
 With Irvine and Lake Forest out of the planning core, the county can now use 
the land as a "dump": i.e., a place to dump everything that no other community 
or supervisorial district in the county desires in its midst.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON COUNTY FINANCES; DON'T BLAME DERIVATIVES -- 
IT'S FUND MANAGERS' FAULT; ALL INVESTMENTS ARE RISKY, BUT PROPER GUIDELINES AND 
SIMPLE PROFESSIONAL COMPETENCE COULD HAVE AVOIDED THIS DEBACLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIPPE JORION, Philippe Jorion, a professor of finance at the Graduate 
School of Management at UC Irvine, teaches a course titled Speculative Markets 
in Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent announcement of a $1.5-billion loss on Orange County's investment 
fund has sent shock waves throughout the financial industry and may lead to 
renewed calls for regulations to control derivative products. This is 
misguided. At fault are the risk management guidelines (or lack thereof) and 
professional incompetence, not derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it is important to note that all financial investments are risky, for 
there would be no reward without risk. The issue is the amount of risk that 
investors are willing to stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.5-billion loss represents a fall of 20% in the $7.8-billion investment 
pool. To put things in perspective, a passive investment in the bond market 
would have lost only about 4% of its value since the beginning of the year. The 
abnormally large loss reflects the fact that the county's portfolio was 
leveraged from two to three times its value. ("Leverage" involves borrowing 
funds to invest in additional risky assets.) The fund also used "structured 
notes," which are complicated financial instruments involving the sale of 
"options." But the main factor in the losses was leverage, not derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The first problem is that the fund managers implemented speculative positions 
with substantial downside risk, which were inconsistent with the 
responsibilities of running a public fund. Also, leverage may have been 
increased as an attempt to make up for losses incurred at the beginning of the 
year. Essentially, the pool operated as a "hedge" fund. Investing in private 
hedge funds should be allowed as long as investors realize that their capital 
is at substantial risk. The resulting exposure, however, was highly unusual for 
a public fund and was clearly unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 The second problem is that investors who have benefited from the superior 
performance of the fund over the previous years should have suspected the 
strategy was risky. How else would the fund have been able to perform much 
better than the industry average? 
</P>
<P>
 Investors share part of the blame because they benefited from the superior 
performance and turned a blind eye to risks. In particular, the Board of 
Supervisors unabashedly supported the strategy, and failed to understand the 
magnitude of potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
 For a private corporation, such as Procter & Gamble, such speculative activity 
may be condoned by shareholders, who ultimately risk their own capital. In the 
case of public funds, it is not clear who bears the residual risk of such 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 To address this control failure, I would suggest establishing a risk 
management system setting limits on leverage and on positions in derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in place, these guidelines should be monitored by an independent party, 
and portfolios should be valued at regular intervals using prevailing market 
prices. Instruments that cannot be priced or fully understood should be 
avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 Provided they are used prudently, derivatives are useful instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, derivatives traded on organized exchanges in Chicago are simple 
to understand, fairly priced and easy to value. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives are now actively used for the management of pension funds, which 
are subject to the strict fiduciary guidelines, established by the Employee 
Retirement Security Act, and have proved to be effective risk-management tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, this loss can be squarely blamed on inadequate controls and 
professional incompetence. In any business, this combination would be deadly. 
Don't blame derivatives again.

SELECTIVE GIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing in response to the recent story about those ignorant people who 
supposedly are good-hearted and want to help others less fortunate than 
themselves. These so-called "good" people will give, but only if their 
donations go to legal residents or English-speaking or those with non-Latino 
surnames.These people are not kind and good, they are bigots. 
</P>
<P>
 I would tell all these people to keep their donations and learn the true 
meaning of giving. True giving comes from the heart, not from politics and 
prejudice, and certainly not from ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 I give because I consider myself very lucky and want to bring some little bit 
of happiness to someone not as lucky as myself. I don't care what color they 
are, if they speak English or if they are here illegally. I feel sorry for you 
(who) do not know or have in your hearts the true spirit of giving or of the 
season.

DROPPING 'F' RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Upon reading the article "Irvine School Board Drops Controversial 'No-Fail' 
Rule" (Nov. 18), I was immediately interested.Being a student athlete myself, I 
know about the great strength, determination, and ability to deal with stress 
it takes to be active in high school sports and make the grades at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a good thing that the "no-fail" rule has come to an end, because I know 
fellow student athletes who have "played the system" by taking easier classes 
just to stay eligible. With the (end) of the "no-fail" rule in Irvine schools, 
student athletes will be able to be active in sports and learn more without 
feeling afraid to take more challenging classes.

THE FAA CAN AND SHOULD CONTROL HELICOPTER NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times editorial on helicopter noise lets the Federal Aviation 
Administration dismiss too easily its own mandate to regulate noise from 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 It is well known that the FAA has a mandate to regulate the aircraft industry 
to ensure the safety of the operators and the passengers. But the FAA has been 
reluctant to acknowledge that it also has an express statutory duty to regulate 
for the control of aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA's enabling legislation (49 U.S.C.1431) specifically provides it full 
authority, if it has the willpower to use it, to address noise along with 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA is indeed now involved, under that very mandate, in pending 
interagency efforts to address noise and other environmental issues concerning 
sightseeing overflights in national parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The time has passed when the FAA (or any other public agency) can ignore its 
charge to attend to pressing environmental needs of the public it serves and 
impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 If the FAA is doing a commendable job of "traffic control in crowded skies," 
as The Times asserts, then let it with equal alacrity perform its corresponding 
role: help curb the environmental impact on noise-sensitive areas below. 
</P>
<P>
 Raising the minimum level of helicopter flights seems an obvious way, since 
they are the most annoying and low-flying aircraft. There may need to be other 
regulations from the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the helicopter overflights a problem only affecting the San Fernando 
Valley. They impact on the residential areas on Cahuenga Pass/Hollywood 
terribly, and cause problems in many areas of the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the FAA, not the local political leadership, which has failed to assert 
the FAA's mandate to start doing something about ensuring reasonable quietude 
for those who must live beneath all those helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no time like right now to start. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I am astounded that the Los Angeles Times would criticize elected officials 
for writing letters in support of their constituents who are tired of 
helicopter noise ("Real Buzz on Helicopter Noise," Nov. 28). Our politicians' 
support of the 1,000-foot minimum altitude requirement is fully justified on 
both legal and factual grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Your editorial incorrectly challenges the legal basis of the politicians' 
support by claiming that the FAA cannot adopt regulations to control and abate 
aircraft noise. Your criticism is unfounded because the FAA does have this 
power and has used it to address noise problems in the northeast and other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the factual basis for supporting the minimum altitude requirement, the 
severity of the noise problem is evidenced by the overwhelming public outcry 
over helicopter noise and support for the 1,000-foot minimum altitude 
requirement. Your safety concerns with the proposed requirement are 
unsubstantiated and, if present, could be addressed in the final regulations. 
Most of the low-flying helicopter traffic creating the noise problem is not 
near airports, but rather over residential areas where no fixed-wing aircraft 
should be traveling at that altitude. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that noise abatement is a reasonable goal, the Los Angeles 
Times criticizes the minimum altitude requirement without suggesting another 
alternative. Does the Los Angeles Times support restricting early morning hours 
of operation at Van Nuys Airport, an alternative clearly within the power of 
the Los Angeles City Council and the owner of the airport? Does the Los Angeles 
Times support the mandatory pooling of traffic and other media helicopters by 
the television and radio stations? 
</P>
<P>
 I only wish the Los Angeles Times could be as constructive as the politicians 
it criticizes.

MAKING THE GRADE; UNLIKE EDUTRAIN, VALLEY'S CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE THRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If last week's collapse of a Downtown "charter" school for dropouts tempts 
critics to mount hysterical attacks on the Los Angeles school district, they 
should remember that charter schools are flourishing in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Edutrain school's charter was yanked after officials found about $1 
million in debts and evidence of scandalous waste.That stands in garish 
contrast to the way in which the Valley's two schools have handled their 
autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenton Avenue Elementary School in Lake View Terrace and Vaughn Next Century 
Learning Center in Pacoima have used their relative independence to accumulate 
healthy surpluses, increase staff and lay groundwork for big plans. Vaughn 
expects a surplus of $534,000 this year; Fenton, $280,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn Director Yvonne Chan has bought property and is banking money for a new 
classroom building to relieve crowding and increase the number of teaching days 
by nearly half. Benefits to pupils so far include daily access to a nurse 
practitioner and the testing services of a bilingual psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenton Principal Joe Lucente has cut class size; hired a counselor, a 
psychologist and a librarian. He has also improved security and started an 
after-school enrichment program. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan, for one, has some sympathy for Edutrain. She notes that it was started 
from scratch and was led by people without experience in routine fiscal 
accountability. And she adds, with some asperity, that non -charter L.A. 
schools are allowed to wallow along in their old inefficient ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Edutrain may be freedom's price. Vaughn and Fenton, by the evidence so far, 
are its reward.

CRIME FIGURES OFFER HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest FBI crime statistics for the San Fernando Valley and for Los 
Angeles as a whole indicate a drop in crime during the first half of 1994. As 
usual, however, these statistics merely compare the current year with the 
previous one, which limits their historical significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Another caveat that must be noted is that the Jan. 17. Northridge earthquake 
caused a major disruption in the pattern. Crime almost seemed to take a holiday 
in the months immediately after the temblor, so at minimum these 1994 
statistics need an asterisk. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if one goes back to 1988 to study a longer trend, there are encouraging 
drops to be seen in the rates of two forms of serious crime in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the number of homicides reported to the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Valley divisions during the first nine months of 1994. They show a rate of 6.3 
per month -- 30% lower than the nine murders per month reported in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Any rape is one too many, and there have been 34.7 of them per month in the 
Valley so far this year. But that compares to 42 per month last year, and 36 
per month six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 One bit of bad news: The rates of robberies and aggravated assaults in the 
Valley in 1994 are still substantially above 1988 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 As if we need reminding, these figures prove that our streets aren't safe yet. 
Citizens are still badly frightened about crime. We know that the city is 
having some difficulty in meeting its goal of hiring more police officers, and 
that morale on the force is low. But the homicide and rape figures do give some 
hope that the battle can be won.

VICA'S OPTIMISM ON VALLEY'S ECONOMY SEEMS WELL-FOUNDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn.'s annual crystal-ball session was 
filled with such gloom about 1994 that it was more like a funeral procession 
than a forecasting conference. VICA includes more than 400 member businesses 
that employ some 250,000 people. So, are there plausible reasons behind its 
members' predictions for a robust San Fernando Valley economy in 1995? Well, 
after picking through the tea leaves a bit ourselves, we cautiously agree for 
several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Valley consumers have turned out in droves for the new Christmas shopping 
season, but there is better anecdotal evidence. Don't forget that a lot of the 
major Valley merchants only recently reopened and some of that surge in 
purchasing may have represented a general exultation over that aspect of quake 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been less seasonal, but steady increases in consumer purchasing 
that have more to do with the recovery in the Valley from the most costly 
natural disaster in U. S. history -- the Northridge earthquake. We're talking 
about the replacement of major home appliances and related items, among other 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, according to an official of the Sherman Oaks-based TransWorld Bancorp, 
there has been a major infusion of funds from Federal Emergency Management 
Agency grants, Small Business Administration loans and earthquake insurance 
settlements. As the work orders for ecstatic building contractors pile up 
(translating into months and months of guaranteed business), a lot of that 
money is sitting in the banks, waiting to be used. For the banks, it all 
creates more funding for loans. 
</P>
<P>
 TransWorld, the Valley's oldest and largest independent bank, says that 
deposits are up 20% this year and that net income has soared by 86%. A year 
ago, Glendale Federal Bank was so bad off that it was on the verge of seizure 
by federal regulators. This year, it posted its first quarterly profit since 
1991. Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial Corp. lost $17.5 million in the 
September quarter last year. It posted a profit of $57.2 million during the 
same period this year. Encino-based CU Bancorp reduced its non-performing 
assets from $30 million to about $113,000 in the past year. Its profits, during 
the first nine months of this year, are up 23% over last year. Sherman 
Oaks-based American Pacific Bank hit an all-time high in terms of assets this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In real estate, it's true that the Valley continues to lag behind the Southern 
California market. Yet there are glimmers of hope here as well, despite the 
uncertainties that may be presented by rising interest rates, prices, and 
stiffer building code requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Some real estate experts, for example, are predicting that prices will 
stabilize and that there will be double-digit increases in home sales in the 
Valley in 1995. But we have more than predictions here. Realtor Fred Sands, who 
has seven offices in the San Fernando Valley, has also said that home sales are 
running 25% ahead of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not through yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Car leasing and new car sales are booming in the Valley. Some General Motors 
dealerships, for example, are showing sales gains of 9% to 16% over last year. 
Many other car brands whose sales had been stagnant or declining since 1990 are 
also finally enjoying brisk sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Selter, chairman of the board of the Van Nuys-based National Staff 
Network, says that the Valley is far exceeding the only incremental increases 
in the hiring of temporary employees that have been recorded around the nation. 
His own business is up 15% over last year, and Selter is projecting a 20% 
increase for 1995, much of it in light manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnings are rising and exceeding expectations at the Walt Disney Co., the 
Burbank-based entertainment giant. And George Vradenburg III, executive vice 
president for Fox Inc., has more to add about the entertainment industry's 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Vradenburg says that folks are flocking to the cinemas at a rate that exceeds 
the 10-year average by some 20%. Moreover, there have been double-digit 
increases in videotape sales as people continue to acquire and build on their 
own movie libraries. And what's good news for the local entertainment industry 
is good news for the Valley. More than half of the employees in the Los Angeles 
film industry live in the Valley, Vradenburg says. One-third of the vendors for 
the film industry are in the Valley, and 15% of the filmmaking activity occurs 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic climate also figures to improve for northernmost Los Angeles 
County, with a forecast of mild, but consistent economic growth from the 
economist who predicted the recession there four years ago. There, home prices 
appear to have bottomed out and folks are anticipating an increase this year in 
sales tax revenue in Palmdale, Lancaster and Santa Clarita. Six Flags Magic 
Mountain sped up the timetable on a major expansion, and a plan for 25,000 new 
homes and 70,000 residents (to be called Newhall Ranch) was also unveiled this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dun and Bradstreet, which gathers business information on such matters as 
credit worthiness to sell to its clients, even chimed in with a major study 
that said that the Northridge quake had failed to derail the slowly recovering 
Southern California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was more surprised than us," admitted David Kresge, the firm's senior 
vice president of analytical services, when the analysis was released in 
October. And a copious analysis it was, involving 20,000 firms within a 40-mile 
radius of the Northridge epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the quake was a disaster for many, but D & B said that the timely 
repair of roads and freeways and the local economy's growing strength before 
the quake prevented much worse, long-term damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, there appears to be good reason for VICA's optimism, and such promising 
news is long overdue.

CITY'S REBUILDING PLAN MAKES DOLLARS AND SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his Valley Commentary article attacking affordable housing ("Slam the Door 
on Low-Income Housing Plan," Nov. 27) Don Schultz of the Van Nuys Homeowners 
Assn. misrepresented the city's Earthquake Emergency Loan Program in several 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Schultz claimed the city is financing the construction of new high-density 
"slum" housing that will replace modest-sized apartment houses with large ones. 
None of these assertions is true. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts are these: 
</P>
<P>
 * The city will receive $325 million from the federal Department of Housing 
and Urban Development to rebuild 15,000 to 20,000 housing units damaged in the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 95% of these funds will go to the rehabilitation of existing buildings; no 
modest apartments will be replaced by high-density buildings. In fact, in many 
cases the number of units in rehabilitated buildings will be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 * The physical quality and financial stability of the housing repaired with 
city funds will be improved over pre-quake conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 20% to 40% of units repaired will be reserved for working families like 
those displaced by the earthquake. For example, rents (ranging from $500 to 
$700) will be affordable to secretaries, medical assistants, grocery checkers 
and any of the thousands of working people that are the backbone of our city. 
</P>
<P>
 The public interest is not well-served by exaggerated and misleading accounts 
of what is in fact a well-designed and effective response to the most damaging 
natural disaster in U.S. history. The point missed by Mr. Schultz is that the 
city of Los Angeles is committed to rebuilding neighborhoods ravaged by the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jan. 17, 1994, the Los Angeles Housing Department was challenged with 
rebuilding homes and restoring confidence in the economic vitality of damaged

RESIDENTS HAVE SPOKEN -- NO CRA DISTRICT HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Nov. 15 dozens of Sherman Oaks and Studio City residents spoke at a Los 
Angeles City Council hearing protesting a proposed Community Redevelopment 
Agency district in their neighborhood. They urged city officials to reject such 
a plan and gave cogent reasons for their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 22 the City Council nonetheless voted to adopt such a plan -- albeit 
in a somewhat modified version, citing the "many concerns raised" about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The only reason to put a CRA district into any area is a proven need for it 
and proof that it will fill that need. Such proof has not been presented. Quite 
the contrary. Much of the opposition to this plan was based on the CRA's track 
record and the lack of trust in its ability and past performance. In fact, 
Councilman Joel Wachs called the criticism of the CRA a "scathing indictment of 
the agency" that "calls into question the viability of the agency in the 
history of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 It must be remembered that when a redevelopment zone is created, the CRA sells 
bonds to raise money. It repays the debt using money generated by the increase 
in the property taxes in the zone. The higher taxes are caused by improved 
buildings in the zone and by inflation. By diverting much of the property tax 
increase to the CRA, you are in effect siphoning off money from other essential 
city services such as police and fire protection -- at a time when these 
services are already seriously underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, however, is the fact that we are a democracy and government 
therefore is supposed to be representative. A basic tenet about representative 
government is that you represent the people who elected you to serve. You don't 
impose your will on them. Once the people have decided an issue, then 
government should implement it, not undermine it. In this case the majority of 
the people decided they did not want the CRA in their neighborhood. Government 
should listen.

WELL-CONSTRUCTED ARTICLE ON HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a pleasure it was reading Jon D. Markman's interesting and informative 
article "A New Push for Hillside Homes Emerges" (Nov. 21). It was the 
best-written article I have read on the subject since I began working with 
attorney Eric F. Edmunds, whom you quoted in your article. 
</P>
<P>
 As Mr. Edmunds' secretary, I see a large volume of news articles and 
communication pertaining to the Santa Monica Mountains land development and 
conservation efforts cross my desk regularly. I usually scan a few sentences to 
keep abreast of how the situation is evolving, then file the material away. But 
when I read the introduction of the article, "From the air, they look like 
archeological digs of lost civilizations" (what imagery!), I felt compelled to 
read further. I'm glad I did. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope to read more of Jon Markman's (articles) soon (on any subject).

AIRPORT AUTHORITY'S ARROGANT ATTITUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a homeowner in the flight path of Burbank Airport, I am continually 
astounded at the arrogant attitude of the Burbank/Glendale/Pasadena Airport 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Do they honestly expect us to believe that limiting the number of aircraft 
gates will not limit the number of flights? How many planes can occupy a gate 
at one time? Furthermore, the city of Burbank is only minimally affected by 
planes' taking off and landing (areas west of Hollywood Way and north of 
Camarillo Street), while Glendale and Pasadena suffer no discomfort at 
all.However, they do receive all the revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the residents of the east San Fernando Valley (part of Los Angeles) 
have their sleep disturbed, their phone calls interrupted, their quality of 
life damaged, as windows rattle and houses shake. The lawsuits brought by Los 
Angeles are intended to protect its residents, not "harass" the businessmen 
running the facility, as critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 This airport was never intended for high volumes of commercial aircraft. It is 
small and very dangerous and placed in an area with a high population density. 
There is virtually no room for error should a plane or pilot malfunction. 
Perhaps it is time to scale back the Burbank Airport and find a better, safer 
location and give us back our peace of mind.

PRIVATE MATTER OF PRAYER JUST DOESN'T FIT IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS; INJECTING RELIGION 
BACK INTO GOVERNMENT-RUN EDUCATION WON'T ENSURE A VALUE-RICH, CRIME-FREE 
SOCIETY. BUT IT IS CERTAIN TO CAST SOME CHILDREN AS OUTSIDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA HECHT, Andrea Hecht of North Hills owns a public relations firm. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1961 I found myself in a new public school after my parents' divorce. I 
quickly learned it wasn't just the building and neighborhood that were new -- 
it was also the daily prayer. Every morning at my desk in third grade, I bowed 
my head and recited the Lord's Prayer, which, being Jewish, I had never heard 
of. 
</P>
<P>
 I always felt conflicted about both bowing my head and being forced to learn a 
prayer that wasn't "mine." My confusion only intensified in my after-school 
religious classes, where the tenets of Judaism, which emphasized no bowing of 
any kind and excluded this prayer, were reinforced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lord's Prayer I recited again and again never helped me perform or behave 
better in school. My family demanded that. It didn't provide me with values 
either; I got those from my Jewish home every Shabbat and every religious 
holiday. The Lord's Prayer served only one purpose: It singled me out every 
morning by reminding me how radically different I was from all the other kids 
in my class. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate on reinstituting school prayer is being fueled by the incoming 
Republican majority in Congress. A constitutional amendment is promised by Rep. 
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on my experience, I fear this amendment. Regardless of details, the 
outcome will be the same -- a new crop of school children taught more each day 
about being shamefully different from Sam or Suzy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a spiritual and religious person, I not only believe in prayer, I have 
found great strength in it. I believe in prayer at home and in a house of 
worship. I believe in private silent prayers in your own mind at any time you 
choose to talk to your God. I also believe religion is a very private matter 
and should be forced on no one. Many years ago, our forefathers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 I reared my teen-age daughter alone for most of her life. I introduced her to 
religion and reinforced its value. As a family today, we sometimes attend 
synagogue service and never miss Friday night Shabbat together at home. My 
daughter began Sunday school well before kindergarten, and she is now working 
toward confirmation. She struggled to learn Hebrew and explored leaving public 
school this year for a religious one. 
</P>
<P>
 She was educated in the public schools without one single day of school 
prayer. She never endured the embarrassment or shame that I did, and I am glad 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to see future students spared from that humiliation, and I want 
religion left where it should be: at home and in personally selected houses of 
worship. 
</P>
<P>
 The amendment would give each school district wide latitude in selecting a 
prayer. Students could "volunteer" not to recite it. Will there be classrooms 
across America with two sections, like smoking and nonsmoking seats, one for 
the godless and the other for believers? How might a Christian student in a 
predominantly Orthodox Jewish school district feel about "voluntary" morning 
prayers in Hebrew? Or a Muslim student "voluntarily" praying to Jesus in a very 
Catholic school district? Not to mention the problem of agnostic and atheistic 
families with children in the schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Many parents may not make religion an integral part of their home lives. Those 
mothers and fathers may instead be trying to keep a roof over their collective 
heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the family situation, it is wrong for the government to dictate that 
something as private as religion be injected into the school, especially when 
parents choose otherwise at home. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing voluntary about a district-selected prayer that teachers 
lead. Children will have only two options if they dissent: shut up or leave the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who object or leave, says Drew Yellen, a Northridge psychologist who has 
more than 25 years' experience dealing with children, will be stigmatized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids get their strokes academically and on the playground," he says. "Once 
peers determine a child doesn't fit in, often kids are excluded across the 
board. Suddenly it's no fun to go to school, especially if you and your lunch 
bag are sitting alone, and then your motivation, concentration and performance 
in class begin to falter." High school kids might choose not praying as a way 
to stand out from the crowd, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 It need not come to this. Anyone can pray any time -- before school, after 
school, during school if they wish. High school students have religious clubs. 
Parents can send children to religious schools. Putting government-sanctioned 
prayer back in the schools won't ensure a value-rich, crime-free society. 
Fixing broken families will, and there's no constitutional amendment that can 
quickly do that.

STUDY URGES PENTAGON TO DROP C-17S, BUY CARGO 747S; MILITARY: RAND CORP. SAYS 
BILLIONS COULD BE SAVED. AIR FORCE, MCDONNELL DOUGLAS DISPUTE SOME OF THE 
REPORT'S FINDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pentagon should scrap plans to buy more C-17 transport planes and instead 
buy cargo versions of the Boeing 747, says a report commissioned by the Air 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by the RAND Corp., a Santa Monica think tank, says the government 
would save billions and deliver more equipment to a battlefront faster with the 
747s than with the fleet of 120 C-17s that the Air Force envisions. A copy of 
the study was obtained this week by the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force and McDonnell Douglas Corp., the builder of the C-17, disputed 
some of the study's assumptions and findings, which were based on research 
conducted in 1992 and updated this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite problems in its development and performance, the C-17 has thus far 
escaped outright cancellation. The Pentagon said Friday it will squeeze $7.7 
billion out of its top weapons programs by canceling a troubled missile effort, 
cutting some money from the Air Force's F-22 fighter jet and building only two 
prototypes of the Army's high-tech Comanche helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions are far less severe than the estimated $20 billion that had 
been feared before President Clinton's decision last week to pump an extra $25 
billion into the Pentagon budget in the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the dry, technical language of the C-17 study looms a battle involving 
three of the nation's largest aerospace companies: McDonnell Douglas, which 
builds the C-17 in Southern California; Seattle-based Boeing Co., manufacturer 
of the 747, and Lockheed Corp., which hopes to revive production of the huge 
C-5 Galaxy transport plane in Marietta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Pentagon officials plan to decide next fall whether to buy more than 40 
C-17s or find an alternative. The Air Force needs a new plane to replace 244 
C-141 transports, planes that date to the early 1960s. Military planners say 
120 of the larger C-17s would be needed to replace that fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that the Air Force could conserve resources and still meet our 
assessment of future intertheater airlift needs by buying fewer C-17s than 
planned and buying a civil-style transport with long-range capability to carry 
bulk cargo and oversize equipment," the RAND report says. 
</P>
<P>
 Buying 64 Boeing 747-400Fs, a cargo version of the jumbo jet, would enable the 
Air Force to increase the tonnage of equipment it could transport and save the 
government $10 billion over 25 years, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a major blow to proponents of the C-17, the report contended that the 
plane's ability to land at remote, unpaved airfields -- a key selling point of 
the aircraft -- is little different than the much larger C-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force officials disputed aspects of the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think their conclusions are relevant," said a senior Air Force 
official. The official said the report uses the Persian Gulf War as a model, 
whereas the U.S. military today has far fewer troops stationed in Europe and 
would need to transport more power a longer distance in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell Douglas spokesman Larry McCracken said RAND was too quick to 
discount crucial advantages of the C-17, including its ability to land on 
shorter runways, airdrop supplies, maneuver in tight spaces on the ground, 
carry large cargo such as tanks and Patriot missile batteries, and refuel in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40 C-17s already in service or on order will cost $21.3 billion or $533 
million per plane. This year's defense budget contains funding for six C-17s 
and advance procurement funding for eight more next year, bringing the total to 
40.

JOHN FOLLIS; HEADED GRAPHIC DESIGN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John V. Follis, graphic designer whose signs and symbols included the logos 
for the Los Angeles Bicentennial and Disney World, has died. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Follis, who had his own design firm for more than 30 years, died Dec. 4 in 
Pasadena, his family announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Chapter of the American Institute of Architects had planned to 
present Follis with an honorary membership at a luncheon Thursday. The honor 
was bestowed posthumously. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the clients for which Follis designed signage and other material are the 
San Diego Wild Animal Park, Atlantic Richfield Plaza and Security Pacific world 
headquarters in Los Angeles, Sea World in Florida, and the J. Paul Getty Museum 
in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 His artistic ability first earned attention when he won a contest to design a 
high school class pin. One impressed classmate was the woman who became his 
wife, the potter and stitchery artist June Follis. 
</P>
<P>
 Follis worked as a laborer at the Wilmington shipyards and became an 
instructor of physical education in the Navy before turning to design as a 
vocation. He studied at the Art Center College of Design and CalArts. When he 
was 32, he became an interior designer at the architectural firm of Welton 
Becket & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1960 he set up his own firm with "no clients -- just a tremendous desire to 
take pencil and paper and express myself in graphics and design." 
</P>
<P>
 Specializing in logotypes, trademarks and signs that identify and provide 
direction in large architectural complexes, his company evolved from John 
Follis & Associates to Usher-Follis Inc. to the current John Follis Design of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Follis taught at UCLA, Cal State L.A. and the Art Center 
College of Design, and served as art director for Arts & Architecture magazine 
and the American Crayon Publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of his work are displayed in the Smithsonian Institution's graphic 
arts hall in Washington. Follis has also had exhibits at the Pasadena Art 
Museum, the La Jolla Museum of Art, New York's Whitney Museum of American Art 
and Los Angeles' Museum of Contemporary Art. Solo retrospective exhibits were 
staged at Cal State L.A. in 1974 and Pasadena City College in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Follis is survived by three sons, Roger, Grant and 
Dean, a daughter, Charlene, a brother, Charles, and four grandchildren.

 CHESS OLYMPIAD 
</P>
<P>
 The 31st Chess Olympiad, the mammoth team tournament conducted every two years 
by the World Chess Federation (FIDE), has begun in Moscow. Chess news, though, 
has been overshadowed by reports of crime.Several chess players, including 
Americans Alexander Shabalov and Alex Yermolinsky, have been robbed. 
</P>
<P>
 As host country, Russia gets to field two teams. Its second team, composed of 
teen-age stars, leads the tournament after seven rounds with 19 1/2-8 1/2. Next 
at 19-9 are Russia-1, Armenia, Bosnia, Estonia and Yugoslavia, followed by 
Bulgaria, Netherlands and the Philippines at 18 1/2-9 1/2. There are seven 
rounds to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. men are far behind at 15-13. After defeating South Africa, 3 1/2- 
1/2, and Finland, 3-1, the United States only drew Norway and Australia, then 
lost three straight matches by scores of 1 1/2-2 1/2 to Hungary, Moldova and 
Kyrgyzstan. Judit Polgar, Hungary's 18-year-old first board, defeated 1994 U.S. 
champion Boris Gulko. LOCAL NEWS

 Mark Curameng scored 4-0 to win the 20-player All-American Scholastic last 
Sunday at All-American Burger in Westwood. August Fairchild finished second 
with 3 1/2- 1/2. Soheil Safii took the under-800 prize, and Jon Vaughn was best 
unrated. This was the fifth in the monthly series of All-American Scholastics. 
The next is scheduled Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth annual S.P.A. Holiday Scholastic takes place Saturday at St. Paul 
the Apostle School, 1536 Selby Ave. in Westwood. The tournament includes a 
four-round Advanced section, open to all students in grades K-9, and a 
five-round Booster section, limited to students in grades K-7 without ratings 
or with ratings below 900. Organizer John Surlow expects record attendance. For 
more information, call him at (310) 479-8377.

 My husband attended Walter Reed Junior High School back in the Valley's salad 
days. He and his brother walked to school every day, passing through the tunnel 
under the brand new 101 Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunnel is at the end of the block we now live on, and Walter Reed is just 
a stone's throw from our house. On warm summer evenings I take my daughters 
roller-blading in the parking lot there. 
</P>

 As I understand it, Walter Reed is a well-regarded public school. It boasts 
both highly gifted and honors programs and is much coveted by parents 
throughout Los Angeles County. So you can see it has a lot going for it as a 
middle school option for my girls: convenience, high academics and sentimental 
value, too. 
</P>
<P>
 There is just one drawback. Every year a few children are expelled from Reed 
for carrying guns or knives. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few each year. In the 1993-1994 school year, two guns and one knife. 
Not much out of a population of 1,900. Still, it only takes one stray bullet to 
kill a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Am I the only Valley mother casting worried glances at the neighborhood 
secondary school and wondering if it's time to abandon public education? 
Hardly. Admissions directors at Valley private schools report an increase in 
parents who inquire about safety as they canvass middle school and high school 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Oakwood Secondary School, the assistant to the director of admissions, 
Rhoda Wasserman, says the question, "How safe is your school?" comes up more 
than ever these days, "particularly now that the public schools plan to place 
children in middle school in sixth grade rather than in seventh grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're definitely afraid of the bullying and the violence that they hear 
about in some public schools," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents see their sixth-graders as babies, private school people say, and are 
worried about 11-year-olds' being thrown in with the kinds of 14-year-olds they 
read about in the papers. 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Michael and All Angels School in Studio City, admissions director 
Maggie Wright Falkenstein says, "It may be more perception than reality, but I 
would say parents now perceive the safety of our campus as a deciding factor 
for switching their children here from the public schools." 
</P>
<P>
 At Carpenter Avenue Elementary School, which my daughters now attend (No guns 
there, thank God. Of course the kids are all under 12), it's the buzz among 
parents: 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you going to do about middle school for Steven?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you saving for private school when Ellie graduates?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you thinking of moving?" 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter parents have a deep commitment to public school education. These are 
parents who show up on weekends in their faded clothes bearing brooms, brushes, 
toilet bowl cleaner, hedge clippers and leaf blowers. 
</P>
<P>
 All of us complain good-naturedly about the need for these efforts. They cut 
into our schedules. But we also relish them. The sense of community they 
generate is hard to come by in this day and age. We warm ourselves around the 
glow of these old-fashioned barn raisings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Carpenter parents who have followed their kids to Walter Reed are shoring 
up the dikes with after-school math tutoring, fund-raisers to buy sports 
equipment and suchlike. The rest of us watch this advance guard closely. Will 
we be the next wave? 
</P>
<P>
 It depends. 
</P>
<P>
 On good days we fantasize about turning Walter Reed into a model public school 
like Carpenter. On bad days, when the weapons reports are published or we read 
about the Walter Reed computer room being trashed during the summer, our 
enthusiasm wanes. Bootstrap idealism works just fine if enough people are 
pulling in the same direction. But it can't survive too much entropy. We fear 
the downward pull that weapons and other mayhem signify. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence of this downward pull is plain enough at the end of my block, 
where the tunnel my husband used to saunter through as a child is boarded up. 
Its eyeless surface is a bulletin board for gangs whose cryptic messages tell 
who controls which drug territory. Every few weeks some blessed soul paints 
over the graffiti. A day or two later it's back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder if we'll be the last group of middle-class whites to use the public 
school system in this part of the Valley," mused a six-year veteran of 
Carpenter School cleanups and fund-raisers. Weapons are starting to appear in 
Valley elementary schools. Ten altogether in the 1993-94 school year. Two of 
them guns. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a small number, given the tens of thousands of elementary school students 
in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Still . . .

CAMARILLO MARCHES INTO THE SEASON; HOLIDAYS: POLITICIANS AND RESIDENTS TURN OUT 
FOR THE ANNUAL PARADE. ONE SANTA GIVES HIS FINAL 'HO, HO, HO.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Hundreds of Camarillo residents transformed Las Posas Road into a holiday 
wonderland on Saturday, complete with marching bands, twirling dancers, 
princesses and elves, all celebrating the city's 33rd annual Christmas parade. 
</P>
<P>
 In a high-spirited procession, participants rode on white and black Arabian 
horses, waved from elaborate floats and sang Christmas carols, while local 
politicians including Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), state Sen. Cathie 
Wright (R-Simi Valley) and Camarillo Mayor Michael Morgan waved to residents 
from antique cars. 
</P>
<P>
 A tradition that began in 1961, the parade was organized by the Camarillo 
Pageant Assn. and the Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District. An 
estimated 5,000 people from all over the county lined the parade route. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think this is the best Christmas parade in the county," said Vina 
Henschel of Oxnard. "Every year I go to several parades, and this one seems to 
always run smoothly, without any delays between participants." 
</P>
<P>
 The parade, which began at the corner of Temple Street and Las Posas Road, was 
led by an Elvis impersonator wearing a glitzy gold outfit and riding in a blue 
1957 Ford Thunderbird. He drew shouts and applause from spectators crowding 
curbs along the route, which wound through a residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Elvis, we love you!" shouted an excited Lori Lory of Santa Paula. "I 
came to the parade just because of him." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the Elvis wanna-be was Raymond Michael Hebel, a Moorpark teacher, 
who said he was accustomed to having his fans follow him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I perform all over Southern California and I have been in this parade for 22 
years," Hebel said. "After awhile, you know all the faces around."  
</P>
<P>
 For some residents, though, the highlight of the 2 1/2-hour parade was the 
marching bands -- all 20 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This parade always has the best marching bands of all parades in the county," 
said native Camarillo resident Philip Villa, 38. "I love them because they add 
so much in creating a Christmas spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 But Villa's brother Aaron, 36, who attended the parade for the first time in 
12 years, said the bands were a lot smaller than they were years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really surprised with the size of the bands -- they are half the size 
they used to be," said Aaron who flew from Sacramento Friday night in time to 
grab a prime seat for viewing the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the bands may have lacked in size they made up for in flamboyance, 
precision and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County's Scripps Ranch High School Rising Star Band embraced "The 
Nutcracker" as its theme, parading as Russian dancers, mice soldiers, princes 
and princesses.  
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks High School Lancer Band and Color Guard drew applause and 
cheers from the crowd, as did the hometown band from Camarillo High. 
</P>
<P>
 For 7-year-old Heather Wisuri, a float entitled "The Magic of a Lion Family 
Christmas" gave meaning to the parade.  
</P>
<P>
 Standing on the curb, Heather stared at the float, where children were 
gathered before a fireplace in a make-believe living room. On the rooftop, a 
mechanical Santa in a sleigh pulled by four reindeer picked gifts from the 
clouds and threw them down the chimney. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like the movies," Heather said. "And it's real pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 During the awards ceremony after the parade, 78-year-old Les J. Buzzelle who 
has portrayed Santa Claus in Camarillo's parade for 33 years, announced that he 
was retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "One last time, " he told the audience after Morgan, Camarillo's mayor, 
awarded him with a plaque. "Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas."

A CLASS ACT; BUT THE CAST KEEPS CHANGING AT LINCOLN SCHOOL AS THE YEAR 
PROGRESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The school year is nearly half over, but in Mary Elsenbaumer's class the cast 
of characters keeps changing. 
</P>
<P>
 A student teacher assigned to the fifth-grade classroom at Ventura's Lincoln 
School one month into the year brought with her a teaching style sharply 
different from Elsenbaumer's. 
</P>
<P>
 Then two students from the class were suspended for breaking into the school 
cafeteria and spraying a fire extinguisher, leaving the room -- which doubles 
as a library -- covered with a sticky white film. 
</P>
<P>
 Two children have moved away. A Ukrainian exchange student will not be 
returning after the Christmas holiday that begins next week. And two new 
students -- Ruben Luna and Mallory Kawecki -- each showed up one day needing 
books and a seat. They seem to be there to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this tumult leaves Elsenbaumer unfazed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old has taught for five years at Lincoln, a small downtown school 
known as much for the transience and troubles of some of its students as for 
the non-traditional teaching style of its staff. 
</P>
<P>
 One-quarter of the children on Lincoln's rolls at the end of last school year 
had not been there at the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 280 students there now, 14 are homeless. A fifth of them are from 
families on welfare. Others come from homes where parents are struggling to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
 And Elsenbaumer, like other teachers, knows children come to her class 
bringing problems from their home lives in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are frequently late. They drag into school five or 10 minutes after the 
first bell, their eyes still bleary from sleep. Others rarely turn in homework. 
And a few have trouble concentrating in class. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about their families, some tell about fathers who are in prison, mothers 
who have suffered physical abuse. Their stories are disturbing and their 
openness disarming. 
</P>
<P>
 But as one teacher's aide at Lincoln said, "You have to have compassion for 
these kids but not allow them to use (their problems) as an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Excuses won't work because the children from troubled homes have to work side 
by side and sometimes face to face with other students whose families appear 
stable, their parents emotionally and financially secure. 
</P>
<P>
 Such diversity among students is one of the chief challenges of teaching at 
Lincoln, Elsenbaumer said. 
</P>
<P>
 So she constantly looks for new ways to reach children. "You have to try a lot 
of different doors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Known by both peers and parents for her innovative methods, Elsenbaumer 
thrives on devising hands-on assignments in math, science, reading and art that 
draw students in. For social studies, Elsenbaumer sends her students to another 
fifth-grade class and she takes that teacher's class for science. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsenbaumer taught multiplication this fall by helping students put the times 
tables to music in "the multiples rap." And to test a hypothesis that lung 
capacity increases as children get bigger, she sent Joey Madrid, Victoria 
Balestrero and other budding scientists around the school to time how long 
younger pupils could hold their breath. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even when lessons are fun, children who have learned to dislike school and 
distrust teachers may be wary of joining in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be safe," Elsenbaumer said. "They have to feel safe to take a 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
 That sense of safety comes, Elsenbaumer said, by dignifying students and 
showing them respect. 
</P>
<P>
 So when on a recent afternoon a boy came in from the playground shaking and 
apparently on the verge of tears, Elsenbaumer walked to his seat and knelt by 
his side to speak with him quietly. Noticing that other students were staring, 
she quickly rose and told everyone to get busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware of the troubles many Lincoln students face, the school staff strives to 
help the youngsters feel comfortable and secure, Principal Paul Jablonowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make it a kind of safe harbor for kids, so no matter what's 
going on out there they know they can come here and feel safe," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even harbor waters can get rough. 
</P>
<P>
 One day in October, Elsenbaumer's students found a new teacher settling in. 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen Sterling, a student at the Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge, 
needed a stint as a student teacher to cap off her 3 1/2 years of course work 
toward a teaching credential. 
</P>
<P>
 And Elsenbaumer, known to her students as Mrs. E, readily agreed to accept a 
student teacher in her class, although she admits she finds it difficult to 
hand over the teaching role to someone else.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard for me," she said. "It's hard for me to give up the 
classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sterling, whose two months at Lincoln ended last week, the experience was 
not what she had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 After years studying educational psychology and philosophy, Sterling came into 
Lincoln with the goal of putting some theories into practice: steering students 
through detailed lesson plans in a structured classroom setting. 
</P>
<P>
 But she walked into a class governed by what Elsenbaumer calls "structured 
freedom" -- where students work mainly in groups and teaching is done without 
textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually, Elsenbaumer surrendered control of the class to Sterling, allowing 
her to try out some of her own lesson plans. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Sterling took charge, she said, she was surprised to find that her 
training in education mattered far less than her personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part of it was the fact that my success was really going to be 
based on who I am," said Sterling, 49. "It would come down to my presence in 
the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so personal," she said. "It's so overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 The children also had trouble adjusting to the change. 
</P>
<P>
 Some differences between Mrs. Sterling and Mrs. E were obvious but minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsenbaumer allows children to perch on top of their desks for group work, 
such as when students huddled together dipping pH sticks in containers of sour 
milk, soda and dishwashing soap to test the liquids' acidity. 
</P>
<P>
 But under Sterling, sitting on desks was not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other differences between the teachers were more subtle, but perhaps more 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sterling adopted a practice Elsenbaumer established of getting the 
class quiet by clapping and having the children join in, she never liked it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate it," she said. "It hurts my hands." 
</P>
<P>
 The students picked up on her discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "She uses different signals," 10-year-old Jordan Harris said. With "Mrs. E, 
we'll clap and just keep on clapping until it gets quiet." But Mrs. Sterling 
"will clap and then start talking." 
</P>
<P>
 When Sterling taught a lesson on prime numbers, she stood mainly at the front 
of the class. Elsenbaumer, on the other hand, constantly moves around. 
</P>
<P>
 And for language arts, Elsenbaumer practices "jump-in reading," where students 
take turns reading aloud without having to raise their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling led the class one afternoon through a reading of the tale of Paul 
Bunyan, asking them to read in unison, out loud. "We'll do jump-in reading 
another day," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But only a handful of children even tried to take part. Some sat reading 
silently to themselves while others stared into space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got two teaching styles going on right now," Elsenbaumer said. "We've 
got two different sets of expectations. . . . The inconsistencies are not only 
in policy. They're in strategy, temperament." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with such differences and difficulties, Sterling said she learned things 
from Elsenbaumer that "I'll remember forever." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the really, really important things is to know what to overlook," she 
said. "I've watched her do it, and it's just beautiful where she will let 
certain things go and it will be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 The child who speaks out of turn, the student who fidgets with a vibrating pen 
that buzzes incessantly -- these are the types of things Elsenbaumer sometimes 
chooses to ignore. "There are some people who learn while they're fidgeting," 
Elsenbaumer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes students take bad behavior out of the classroom and sometimes 
they take it too far. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys who vandalized the school lunchroom were found out only after one 
of them got into other trouble. A few days after the cafeteria incident, the 
boy and a student from another class took from the school office a plastic jug 
containing about $200 in coins and small bills, money the school had been 
collecting toward new playground equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials got most of the money back. But before the two boys involved 
in the theft had returned from their suspensions, officials decided to send 
them to two other district schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides overlooking minor classroom disruptions, there are other areas where 
Elsenbaumer deliberately gives less than her full attention -- like homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Monday, she sends parents a note listing the week's homework. Attached 
is a form asking parents' response to the assignments: What caught their 
interest? What did it tell them about their child's skills? 
</P>
<P>
 "It forces parents to look at how their child is doing," she said. "Homework's 
important to connect the parents to the classroom, to keep them informed and 
just include them." 
</P>
<P>
 But when she collects homework at the end of the week, only about half of the 
students turn anything in. Some do homework consistently, others sporadically, 
a few hardly at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it counts as part of students' grades, Elsenbaumer declines to 
push the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can only control so many things," she said. "You have to pick and choose 
carefully the things you want to put energy into." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, she said, students and parents have to take responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's got to be a three-way thing," she said. "I only have them when they're 
here. If there's not the level of concern at home, it doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Elsenbaumer has her students only about six hours a day. After school, 
they may be busy or bored, active in athletics or glued to the TV, surrounded 
by family and friends or alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the children, like Alicia Coenen, play sports. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer and fall, 10-year-old Alicia competes in local soccer 
leagues, and this year made the all-star team. Her two younger sisters play 
too, and both of her parents are coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 When the games end about 5 p.m., the family heads home to a spacious two-story 
house with a view of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia's father, Michael Coenen, is a technical specialist for a national 
manufacturer of copying machines. Her mother, Kate Sredl, is a computer 
programmer. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent evening, Alicia and her sister and two of their girlfriends were 
upstairs in the Coenen house reading books and leafing through soccer magazines 
as Kate heated up ready-made pizzas downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most nights go like this, Alicia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents limit her television watching to half an hour a day. "I sometimes 
get frustrated with my mother," the girl said matter-of-factly. "There's a lot 
of shows I miss." 
</P>
<P>
 And although she does well in school, her dreams for the future are in sports. 
A poster of runner Jackie Joyner-Kersee is taped to her bedroom closet door. 
Knee pads for soccer lie on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia's classmate Steven Tracy joined a soccer league last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, when Steven's mother, Theresa Tracy, inquired whether he wanted 
to play again, he responded by asking if she would be able to drive him. 
</P>
<P>
 An only child of a single parent, the 10-year-old has a habit of showing 
concern for his mother, said Tracy, who works as an administrative assistant 
for a medical research firm. "He's pretty protective." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Steven, a red-haired boy with a wide grin, chose not to sign up 
for soccer this year. So when school lets out, he walks two blocks from Lincoln 
to the apartment of his sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 And he usually goes from there to a friend's house to play. One afternoon 
Steven met Frank Caro, who is also in Elsenbaumer's class, and another boy for 
a game of dodge ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing in the narrow, grassy courtyard of an apartment building, the three 
boys jumped, ran and rolled on the ground as they took turns throwing a 
basketball-sized beanbag at whoever was in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was time for Steven to head back to the sitter's to meet his mother, 
who leaves work about 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 And as soon as mother and son arrived home at their apartment, the boy 
stretched in front of the television in the living room to play Nintendo. "I 
know every move in this game," he said, settling onto the carpeted floor. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother said the two of them usually don't take time for an evening meal. 
Steven eats breakfast and lunch every day, she said, but "we're not really 
dinner people." 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy also said she rarely checks that Steven has done homework because "the 
sitter knows he cannot do anything or go anywhere until his schoolwork is 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, at the end of one recent week, Steven pulled from his folder an 
assignment that was ready to turn in. But on another Friday he had nothing to 
drop into the wicker basket where Elsenbaumer collects homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lose it sometimes, I guess," Steven said. "I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On that same morning, the school held its monthly awards assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia, Terri Tellez, Cody Griffith and Diego Rivera received certificates for 
outstanding effort in all areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Caro won for social studies. And 10 other students in Mrs. E's class 
were recognized for accomplishments ranging from perfect attendance to good 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Certificates in hand, the children ambled from the assembly back into class, 
and Elsenbaumer moved quickly to the front of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 As she began speaking, the students settled into their chairs and fell silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "When teachers choose students for awards it's one of the hardest things we 
have to do," she said. "I want you to know that everyone in here deserves an 
award for something. Everyone in here is good at at least one thing. If you get 
overlooked, I want to apologize right now because each and every one of us is 
important. I want to make sure you know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Mrs. E leaned forward, motioning to the unfinished math quizzes that sat 
on each child's desk. 
</P>
<P>
 "So show me how important you are."

A LESSON FROM CAMARILLO'S FISCAL CRISIS; INVESTMENTS: LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LEARNED 
TO AVOID MISTAKES THAT LED TO ORANGE COUNTY'S BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Can the same kind of economic disaster that hit Orange County befall Ventura 
County? Maybe, experts say. But it is not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 That is largely because of a generally conservative investment approach and a 
system of safeguards built into the investing process by both county and city 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also because the county witnessed its own financial debacle in the late 
1980s, when the city of Camarillo almost went belly up. 
</P>
<P>
 The city lost its entire investment portfolio of $25 million through the same 
type of speculative investments that got Orange County into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo experience has served as a lesson to local government officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people in our county are very cognizant of financial investments 
because of the experience in Camarillo," said Oxnard treasurer Dale Belcher. "I 
think there's a perception out there now that things can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, several of the county's cities tightened their investment and 
financial policies as a direct result of the problems in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence of their conservative investment policies, the county and each of 
its large cities maintain high credit ratings and keep a majority of their 
unused funds in investment pools or securities managed by the state and federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Ventura County has a $546-million investment portfolio, which is 
expected to shoot up to about $750 million this week because of property tax 
collections, said Treasurer-Tax Collector Hal Pittman. 
</P>
<P>
 Of its current fund, about $427 million is invested in government securities, 
with the balance in the state treasurer's pool, corporate notes, certificates 
of deposit and other investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pittman is given great latitude to make investments, county officials 
said there are a number of safeguards in place to protect against risky 
investment practices. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Pittman is required to write monthly financial reports that are 
reviewed by chief administrator Richard Wittenberg, auditor-controller Thomas 
Mahon and the Board of Supervisors. Also, Mahon does a "cash count" on a 
quarterly basis to verify the reports' information. 
</P>
<P>
 And no one individual, including Pittman, is allowed to sign off on a new 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 issue for us is safety," Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We keep getting criticized because we're too conservative," he said. "But 
it's the taxpayers' money you're working with. We have an extra responsibility 
to protect the principal and not go out and see what extra interest we can get, 
because then you're taking a risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County, however, was willing to take that risk. Managing an investment 
portfolio that included assets of 180 other public agencies, the county for 
years made speculative investments that depended on stable or falling interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county lost its bet when interest rates suddenly began to climb a year 
ago, creating a financial crisis that culminated with the county's bankruptcy 
filing last week. 
</P>
<P>
 For Camarillo officials, Orange County's embarrassing financial debacle was a 
grim reminder of its own troubled past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like deja vu," said Camarillo Councilwoman Charlotte Craven. 
</P>
<P>
 Craven said she had only been on the council one year when officials 
discovered in 1987 that the city had lost $25 million through the same type of 
risky investments that got Orange County into trouble. As a result, the city 
treasurer and finance director were fired, and the city manager was forced to 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Orange County, however, Camarillo never filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing left to preserve," said J. William Little, who was hired as 
the city's manager in 1988. "The money was all gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The city simply tightened its belt by cutting back on operating costs, 
delaying capital improvement projects for two years and imposing what turned 
into a five-year hiring freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to get together every morning to see how much money we had so we 
could release checks," Little said. "It was a tight couple of years. But we 
lived through it." 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that the city doesn't get into a similar fix again, it created an 
oversight committee made up of two council members and two citizens with 
financial expertise who regularly check every investment made. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Camarillo has a $36-million investment portfolio, with $30 million 
invested in the state treasurer's Local Agency Investment Fund and the 
remainder in government securities. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of Orange County's bankruptcy, Craven urged all cities and counties 
to re-examine their investment policies to see if they can be improved and to 
ensure that there is adequate oversight of all financial dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that may sound like obvious advice, Little said cities and counties 
continue to make the same mistakes over again. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it happened to us we made a decision to go out and try to make sure this 
didn't happen to others," she said. "We went to the California League of Cities 
and other agencies and said, 'Look, how stupid we were.' But you can't tell 
people what they don't want to hear. Everybody thinks it's not going to happen 
to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Little agreed, noting that Orange County Treasurer Robert Citron, who has 
since resigned, was blasted by his political opponent for his investment 
practices back in the June primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look what happened to him," Little said of Citron's challenger. "He got 
buried in a landslide." 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Mirabelli, the city of Ventura's treasury manager, echoed the concerns of 
Craven and Little. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your investment policies are only good if you are following them," said 
Mirabelli, who is also president of the California Municipal Treasurer's Assn. 
"Every city and county is required by law to have investment policies. But a 
lot of times they are not being followed." 
</P>
<P>
 With cities strapped for cash and unable to raise taxes, the temptation to 
find new ways to raise revenues can be hard to resist for those entrusted with 
investing taxpayer money, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might get away with it for a while," she said. "But it will come back to 
get you."

LOCAL GROUP WILL TAKE BASE CLOSURE FIGHT TO D. C.; DEFENSE: DELEGATION WILL 
STRESS THE MILITARY VALUE OF POINT MUGU AND PORT HUENEME DURING THREE-DAY 
LOBBYING BLITZ. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a preemptive strike to protect Ventura County's military bases, a 10-member 
delegation of local officials jets off to the nation's capital this week to 
demonstrate widespread community support for high-tech weapons tests and other 
Navy programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day lobbying blitz of White House, Pentagon and congressional 
officials is designed as an early show of force in the upcoming battle over the 
planned closure of 15% of the nation's military bases. 
</P>
<P>
 A countywide task force of public officials, defense contractors and retired 
military leaders has spent months honing its message, which will stress the 
military value of preserving the bases at Point Mugu and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation plans to play down the enormous financial stakes that have 
brought the group together: The Navy pours $1.5 billion a year into the bases 
and employs about 20,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to appeal to them on military value and show them why the 
installations need to stay open," said county Supervisor John K. Flynn, who is 
leading the delegation with Supervisor Maggie Kildee. "They know there will be 
an economic impact anywhere they cut bases." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is still early in the base-closure process, Navy and Pentagon 
officials are scrutinizing which bases will be offered for sacrifice to an 
independent base-closing commission in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Navy officials have scurried about in recent weeks, answering questions 
from naval headquarters on the costs of pursuing various scenarios that could 
either bring more business and employees to the bases or gut them by shipping 
their programs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the questions asked, the Point Mugu Naval Air Warfare Center, 
Weapons Division, appears far more vulnerable to cuts than the nearby base at 
Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation has tailored its presentation to Pentagon and White House 
officials to try to make sure Point Mugu remains open and retains its programs 
to test missiles fired from aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Many military strategists agree that the Army, Air Force and Navy spend too 
much money supporting bases that test and evaluate high-tech weaponry. For that 
reason, these bases have emerged as prime targets for consolidation in the push 
to scale back the military after the end of the cold war. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William Perry has set up a special cross-service task force 
to figure out ways to merge bases from various branches of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy's early questions to Point Mugu indicated a desire to retain and 
slightly expand the base, which the service ranked as second highest in 
military value. But naval leaders more recently began preparing facts and 
figures for inter-service scenarios that could be ordered by Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them includes moving Point Mugu's weapons-testing responsibilities to 
Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, according to Navy sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Another would move testing of jet fighters and other aircraft from the Navy 
base at Patuxent River, Md., to Edwards Air Force Base, 100 miles northeast of 
Los Angeles. Such a move would greatly increase the work load at Point Mugu, 
because Navy aircraft need to be tested over the ocean and would have to make 
extensive use of Point Mugu's 36,000-square-mile sea test range. 
</P>
<P>
 In similar preparations, officials at Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc 
have been figuring out how to run Point Mugu sea test range should Point Mugu 
be forced to shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 "With telecommunications being what they are today, we could move the 
functions of Point Mugu to Vandenberg and operate the range," said Daniel 
Wenker, chief of plans at Vandenberg. "We are not proposing that. We support 
keeping Point Mugu open and independent, and continuing to provide mutual aid 
to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said many of the most dramatic scenarios do not make sense 
because of the exorbitant moving costs. They stress that no decisions have been 
made and that there is no cause for panic because defense leaders have long 
warned they would look at a wide range of bases for closure and expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the county's BRAC '95 Task Force, set up to defend the bases, is preparing 
to do everything it can to bolster the case for retaining Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Point Mugu is still vulnerable. Very vulnerable," said Bob Conroy, a 
former Navy fighter pilot and defense contractor in Camarillo who will join the 
task force's delegation to Washington as a technical expert. "I'm getting the 
sense that Port Hueneme is a little more secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Navy has indicated that it needs to retain all eight Naval Mobile 
Construction Battalions and that it makes sense to continue to split the Seabee 
forces between the Port Hueneme base on the Pacific Coast and the Gulfport, 
Miss., base on the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the Port Hueneme division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center is 
a candidate for expansion, under Navy scenarios. The center, which serves as 
trouble-shooter for computer glitches and other malfunctions of shipboard 
weaponry, is the largest tenant on the Seabee base, with about 2,500 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation bound for Washington has meetings planned for most of Wednesday 
with various Navy admirals and military leaders in the Pentagon to explain the 
value of the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people in the Defense Department who may not know a lot 
about these bases," Conroy said, "and that's why we need to educate them." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Jacquez, a lobbyist hired by the task force, has also scheduled meetings 
with White House officials and members of Congress later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most important meetings will come with former Sen. Alan Dixon 
(D-Ill.), whom President Clinton appointed as chairman of the defense Base 
Closure and Realignment Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will accept the defense secretary's recommendations on which 
bases to close in March and then take the next five months to make up a final 
hit list to submit to the President for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has 45 days to accept or reject the whole list and no opportunity to 
pick off individual bases. Essentially, the system is set up to allow military 
considerations, rather than parochial politics, to determine which bases to 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 But military leaders involved in the decision-making process and base-closing 
commission staff have agreed to meet with the Ventura County delegation this 
week. And delegation members say they would be remiss not to take the 
opportunity to press their case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's special assistant on base closures said the delegation is 
smart to travel to Washington now to make its case before the commission starts 
its deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very, very important for communities to do what they're doing," said 
Judy Ann Miller, director of the governor's office of military base retention. 
She said a number of other community representatives have already traveled to 
Washington to inform commission staff about their bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community needs to make sure the best story is told," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said the timing is good because any community effort would get lost 
once the secretary of defense releases his list of bases recommended for 
closure. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation's pitch this week will concentrate on the special features that 
make Point Mugu and Port Hueneme unique assets to the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy opened its base at Point Mugu in 1946 after a nationwide search found 
it to be the best place in the United States to operate a sea test range where 
the Navy could test missiles fired by aircraft over the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Geography was a big factor. Laguna Peak rises 1,456 feet next to the base. 
It's now loaded with radar equipment and other instruments that can peer over 
the horizon to track aircraft and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Mugu is close to major universities and defense contractors, as well as 
Port of Hueneme's deep-water port, which launches old ships and other floating 
targets for Point Mugu's aircraft to shoot at with missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most important, Point Mugu has its own island, San Nicolas, located 61 
miles off the coast. The island, with its airstrip, offers the security needed 
for secret tests. And it too is loaded with radar and other electronic 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The instruments on San Nicolas, along with those at Point Mugu, Santa Cruz 
Island and Vandenberg, create the largest sea test range in the world for 
closely tracking aircraft and missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Mugu remains the perfect place to operate the range because it is 
perched at its entrance, said former Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), 
who plans to accompany the delegation to Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 And it's more cost-effective to leave the related testing labs at Point Mugu, 
Lagomarsino said, so they can be close to actual flight tests conducted on the 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a vital part of our national defense," he said. "That's why it was put 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Port Hueneme, the delegation will argue it is an ideal place for the 
Seabees and the Seabees' Naval Construction Battalion Center. Port Hueneme has 
a deep-water port, a huge amount of warehouse space and a staging area for the 
Seabees to load their equipment and supplies on ships headed overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seabees -- special battalions trained to build bridges, airstrips, bunkers 
and other structures under enemy fire -- often need to mobilize quickly as they 
did for Desert Shield before the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the battalions take off, they usually drive eight miles down Pacific 
Coast Highway and fly from Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation plans to point out many of the ways the two bases operate 
together and why they should remain next to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The Naval Surface Warfare Center at Port Hueneme works closely with Point Mugu 
to test ship weapons on the sea test range, especially on its Self-Defense Test 
Ship docked in the deep-water port. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship is configured to be operated by remote control deep in the sea test 
range so aircraft from Point Mugu can fire missiles at it and test its defense 
systems that shoot down missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a symbol of how the activities come together," said Capt. Scott Beachy, 
the commanding officer of the Naval Surface Warfare Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Rains, who recently retired as technical director of the Naval Surface 
Warfare Center, will also join the delegation to help with the presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the delegation include: Moorpark Councilman Bernardo Perez; 
Carolyn Leavens, a citrus rancher and head of the Ventura County Economic 
Development Assn.; Richard Wittenberg, the county's chief administrative 
officer; Penny Bohannon, the county's lobbyist in Sacramento, and Bill Simmons, 
the BRAC '95 Task Force coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The county government will pay air fare, hotel and other expenses of county 
officials. Moorpark is paying the way for Perez to go to Washington, and the 
BRAC '95 Task Force, which has raised about $200,000 for its lobbying campaign, 
will pick up the expenses of other members of the delegation.

IT'S ALL IN THE CARDS; ACHIEVEMENT REPORTS SIGNAL SUBTLE BUT SIGNIFICANT SHIFT 
FOR PUPILS

<P>
 Before they reached the sixth grade, many of the students in James Azevedo's 
class never worried about getting failing grades. 
</P>
<P>
 But the years of gentle grading are over for the 11- and 12-year-olds, who 
have received their first report cards of the year at Park Oaks Elementary 
School in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the start of the school year, the days have been crammed with the usual 
kinds of sixth-grade activities: settling into a new classroom, adjusting to a 
new teacher and classmates, tackling advanced levels of reading, writing and 
arithmetic and current events -- an entirely new subject that has galvanized 
classroom discussion. Most are looking forward to Christmas break, which starts 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days ago, amid an atmosphere of tense anticipation, report cards were 
handed out, signaling a subtle but significant shift in direction for Azevedo 
and his 37 charges. 
</P>
<P>
 One student, Nicholas Westhoff, kicked back in his small plastic chair and 
watched with a confident air as Azevedo doled out the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to get all A's," the 11-year-old bragged coolly before tearing into 
a small Manila envelope. Scanning the small black letters on his report card, 
Nick nodded his head in agreement, stuffed the document in his backpack and 
darted outside Classroom 14, swinging the heavy wooden door behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Slam! The door closed on 12-year-old Frank Arambula. 
</P>
<P>
 Staring dumbfounded at the letters on his report card, the boy stood in 
silence as his classmates left the room. "It's the worst report card I've ever 
gotten," he said meekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the students in Azevedo's class walked away with sparkling reports -- 
a testament to more than three months of obedient studying and tremendous 
parent involvement, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even under the best of circumstances, however, a handful of students are still 
faltering. Azevedo has met with parents and devised individual study plans for 
some children. But he still sees room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have three or four kids that, unless something changes, unless they do some 
sort of turnaround, they will be a statistic," the 47-year-old teacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dropout rate in the Conejo Valley Unified School District is 5.2% -- among 
the lowest in Ventura County. But Azevedo fears that some of his students will 
fall through the cracks and fail to graduate on time with the Class of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is when children drop out -- it starts here," Azevedo said. "They quit. 
They go to school every day, but they have already dropped out." 
</P>
<P>
 Park Oaks Principal Rachelle Morga said that even among the brightest class 
there will be some failures. "You're always going to have that," she said. 
"Statistics prove there is no 100% fail-safe situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The distribution of thin yellow report cards was a climactic moment for the 
students in Classroom 14 -- tangible results from the weeks of diligent study 
under Azevedo's tutelage. 
</P>
<P>
 Azevedo has not hesitated in giving some failing scores this fall. His 
justification: Sixth grade is a pivotal year, a time for children to realize 
the academic demands that lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind giving an F here and there as an eye-opener," Azevedo said. 
"Better this year than next year." 
</P>
<P>
 But Azevedo hopes that the youngsters who are doing poorly can pull up their 
grades in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 He is relying on one important factor that so far is working in his favor: 
parent support. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 90% of his students' parents showed up for conferences in early 
November. And Azevedo was able to contact the other 10% by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of involvement is unusual -- even in Thousand Oaks schools, where 
parents typically are well-educated and support classroom programs. 
</P>
<P>
 It is particularly unusual for Park Oaks, a school largely comprised of 
single-parent families or families where both parents work outside the home, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For this type of school, to have 90% of your class show up for parent 
conferences -- you're in fat city," Morga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolwide, parent support is at an all-time high at Park Oaks this year, the 
principal said. The small elementary school has about 560 students enrolled and 
about 210 parent volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine Grubwieser, whose 11-year-old daughter, Stephanie, is one of 
Azevedo's students, said it is extremely important for children to have support 
at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go over everything every day," Grubwieser said. "I know when I was in 
school, I didn't have that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Eric Dillon and his wife both have hectic work schedules, monitoring 
the success of their daughter, Heather, is a priority, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that is where (students) get their support," said Dillon, a 
firefighter. "Nowadays, the classes are so big teachers don't have time for 
one-on-one." 
</P>
<P>
 Morga believes parent involvement is critical in upholding Azevedo's 
educational philosophy that parents, teacher and student comprise a "triangle 
of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents have the responsibility to monitor and be an advocate for the 
teacher," Morga explained. "The teacher has the responsibility to impart 
information and hold the student accountable. The student has the 
responsibility of getting the information. If one of the parts falls away, we 
have a no-win situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Most parents are holding up their end, Azevedo said. "If there is a problem in 
this triangle," he said, "it is the students not holding up their end." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Arambula is one student who wants to improve his grades -- the last 
thing he wants to become is a dropout, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to do better," the 12-year-old said. "I have to." 
</P>
<P>
 While some students are struggling academically, Azevedo has several 
overachievers who are equally demanding of his time. They are bright, eager 
students, some working at the seventh-grade level, who are seeking academic 
challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Pentis and Adrian Apricio, two learning-disabled students who are being 
mainstreamed for the first time this year, are also among the overachievers, 
Azevedo said. They are participants in a pilot project launched this fall at 
two Conejo Valley schools, where special-education students have been assigned 
to regular, mainstream classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Chris and Adrian have made tremendous strides this year and have been 
eager to participate in a mainstream class, Azevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been super-positive," he said of the mainstreaming experiment. "And they 
seem to be real happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Dillon, 11, is another achiever. She knew her report card would be all 
A's: a good thing, she said, because those scores will help dictate her 
academic future.  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our sixth-grade grades decide what classes we get in seventh grade," 
she said. "It's important." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father agreed. "The study habits that you form in sixth grade hopefully 
carry over into seventh grade and from there on out," Eric Dillon said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first three months of the school year, students' academic strengths 
and weaknesses have begun to appear as they confront increasingly in-depth 
studies of literature, basic geometry and algebra, science and current events, 
a topic that has sparked free-ranging classroom debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, a group of students must present an oral report to the class on a 
news event from either television or newspaper reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Although current events are not part of the district's approved curriculum for 
the sixth grade, Azevedo has incorporated them into his class as a way to teach 
civics at an early age. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was a substitute teacher in the district two years ago, Azevedo said, 
it seemed not many teachers taught current events, "and there aren't many 
others at this school who do."  
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is more interesting to kids or anybody than current things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, amid a season marked by sensational headlines, student protests and 
emotional politics, even the peaceful world of Azevedo's sixth-grade classroom 
was rocked by some of 1994's tumultuous events. 
</P>
<P>
 One brisk November morning the current event of the day was the O.J. Simpson 
murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They picked the jury for the Simpson thing," Frank reported to the class. 
"And most of the jurors are black." 
</P>
<P>
 "What does that mean?" Azevedo asked. Frank shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it should be kind of even," one boy said of the jury's racial 
make-up, which triggered a loud debate among the class over why ethnicity 
mattered in a case like Simpson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaping from her chair, Amy Bishop assailed the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very strongly about this!" the 12-year-old yelled above the din. "Just 
because O.J. is black, doesn't mean they are going to find him not guilty," she 
shouted passionately. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Azevedo quieted the room. "Do you think we're going to come to an agreement on 
this?" he asked the class. "No!" they shouted in unison. That is all right, 
Azevedo explained, because people often disagree on such volatile topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that they need to see other perspectives," Azevedo explained later. 
"I want them to be knowledgeable -- that's part of being a citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 One news event that struck a personal chord for some students was Proposition 
187. Some children -- and parents -- expressed fears that their families might 
be deported if the measure passed, Azevedo said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Azevedo talked to his students about the controversial 
proposition to soothe some of those fears -- a move some school officials 
wanted to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came up during the midst of student walkouts across Southern 
California against the measure. But his decision to talk about the proposition 
met with some disfavor from the school administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to fuel a fire here," Morga said. "It was better if we just 
didn't get in the middle of it. It is not part of the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much of the day do you want to talk about something that is going to end 
up in court anyway?" she said. "I'm talking about stirring volatile issues into 
no-win situations." 
</P>
<P>
 But Azevedo disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The philosophy of the school was, maybe students shouldn't spend too much 
time talking about it," he said. "For two months we talked about it, so there 
wouldn't be any confusion . . . I really believe we diffused fears in here by 
discussing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The morning after the November election, Azevedo talked to the class about 
Proposition 187's passage. Some children had expressed concern about what would 
happen in the wake of the measure's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know some of you are worried," he told the class. "There's no reason to be 
worried. (The proposition) will have to spend a lot of time in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students said they were confused at why voters would support a measure 
that would bar children from schools. In response, Azevedo simply said: "The 
adults of California perhaps don't feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
 In another week, the students will take a two-week break for the holidays, 
and, the teacher hopes, return to Classroom 14 recharged for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a class I really enjoy," Azevedo said. "They don't whine; they have a 
nice work ethic. Most of the time they seem to be smiling. We have a 
camaraderie here."

VENTURA PROPOSAL WOULD PUT HOMELESS TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeless people could be hired to clean up Ventura's downtown under a proposal 
the City Council will discuss Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, part of a larger project to put homeless people to work, could kick 
off as early as January with a work project employing 25 people, "screened for 
ability" and assigned to small crews, city officials said.Wearing special 
badges or vests, the crews would sweep, steam-clean sidewalks, clean windows 
and trim bushes and trees. Under the plan, each worker would earn $6 an hour 
and work eight hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would be planned and supervised by Bob McElroy, who has won 
nationwide attention for his success in putting the homeless to work in San 
Diego.  
</P>
<P>
 Downtown merchants have complained for months that the transients loitering on 
their streets look bad, smell bad, and disturb their customers. Many of the 
city's homeless dwell in the Ventura River bottom, a situation that has also 
troubled environmentalists because they say it disturbs the riverbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures invited McElroy to town last week to 
discuss his work in San Diego. Measures, who chairs the council's housing 
committee, has been on a drive to rid downtown of panhandlers and vagrants. 
Together with McElroy, she proposed the plan now before the council for 
consideration.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; COLD WATER SURFERS PLUNGE INTO CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RODNEY BOSCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So what if the U. S. Cold Water Body Surfing Championships didn't garner any 
national attention? Saturday's event in Ventura -- which attracted competitors 
from Santa Cruz to San Diego -- went on without all the pageantry of big-time 
surfboard competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 And so what if nary a corporate brewing sponsor was on hand to inflate 
Goliath-sized beer-can balloons or stuff the event's prize-money coffers. In 
fact, there wasn't any prize money. And beyond the 70 competitors, a few 
friends and family members, there weren't many spectators either. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The spirited bunch of surfers began competing at 6:30 a.m. in the 
goose-bump-raising, 55-degree waters near the South Jetty of Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosted by the Ventura-based South Jetty Swells Body Surfing Assn., the 15th 
annual championship is one of half a dozen similar events held each year in 
California. Though the circuit's legion of competitors is small, they are 
passionate about their sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd is sort of small, but everybody up and down the coast is like a big 
family," said Bill Dohn of Ventura, a member of the South Jetty Swells group, 
who organized this year's championship. "We don't have a professional tour, but 
we see a lot of familiar faces." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those faces belonged to 65-year-old Jerry Cunningham of Manhattan 
Beach, a retired director of the Los Angeles County Department of Beaches. He 
was the oldest surfer in Saturday's competition. Competing in the 55-and-over 
division, Cunningham left the waters after his final round with warmth on his 
mind. "I had fun -- and that's what this is all about -- but now it's time to 
go sit in the car and turn the heater on," Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers were divided into seven divisions: six age groups for the males -- 
starting with 12 to 17 years -- and a single, all-age women's division. Each 
group entered the water separately for two 15-minute heats, compiling points 
for each successfully performed maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing wet suits as protection against the frigid ocean, competitors skimmed 
the water's surface, twisting and turning, at times diving below the water, 
performing moves such as the "Outrigger," the "Dolphin," "Spinners," the "Sub" 
and the little-performed "Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 In the "Nixon," the surfer rides the wave chest first with arms held straight 
out, both hands flashing the peace sign and cheeks puffed out. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one is for showing off," said competitor Tish Denevan, 36, of Santa 
Cruz. David Ford, 18, of Ojai, won in the 18-to-24 age group. Mike Karcis of 
Ventura beat out the competition in the 25-to-34 age category. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shearer, 37, of Manhattan Beach, who won in the 35-to-44 age group, went 
on to claim the title of grand champion in a final showdown against all the 
division winners. RODNEY BOSCH

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; WOMAN, 3 YOUTHS HELD IN DRUG-DEALING CASE

<P>
 A 37-year-old Oxnard woman has been arrested on suspicion of using teen-agers 
to sell heroin and cocaine, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with arresting Cecilia Zaragoza Morales, undercover detectives also took 
three juveniles, ages 14 to 16, into custody on suspicion of selling narcotics. 
All of the arrests were made last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-month investigation that led to the arrests was part of the Oxnard 
Police Department's Operation Revitalization program. The grant-funded program 
targets youths ages 14 to 18 who are involved in drug- or alcohol-related 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, detectives assigned to Operation Revitalization arrested a 
man who was using his 12-year-old brother to sell drugs out of a south Oxnard 
home. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; CHURCH PLANS PARADE FOR 55TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The tiny Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church in Santa Paula celebrates its 
55th anniversary Monday, and most of the 300 parishioners are expected to turn 
out for the festivities, Father Rene Juarez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those festivities include a 15-block procession led by a statue of Our Lady of 
Guadalupe.The statue was donated by the bishop of Mexico City's Basilica.  
</P>
<P>
 The parade will not close the four streets -- Oak, High, 14th and Saticoy -- 
it will traverse for two hours beginning at 4 p.m. But motorists are advised to 
find an alternative route at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's anniversary coincides with the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, 
Juarez said. The feast celebrates the Virgin Mary's apparition before Juan 
Viego in Guadalupe more than 1,200 years ago, Juarez said. PAUL ELIAS

2 INJURED IN SANTA PAULA SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A reported "gunfight" in Santa Paula on Saturday afternoon sent two men to the 
hospital for gunshot wounds, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About eight shots were fired in the exchange that occurred about 1:30 p.m. in 
the 500 block of Acacia Road in Santa Paula, a Santa Paula police spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Cerda, 24, of Santa Paula was shot once in the left arm and once in 
the thigh. He was transported to Santa Paula Memorial Hospital where he was 
listed in fair condition, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Herron, 27, also of Santa Paula, was grazed across the chest by a bullet 
and sought medical treatment on his own at Ventura County Medical Center and 
was then released. Officers later arrested Herron on a parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Saturday, police had no further information on the incident and had 
made no more arrests.

CHANCELLOR SEARCH WIDENED BEYOND DISTRICT; COMMUNITY COLLEGES: TRUSTEES WILL 
ACCEPT OUTSIDE CANDIDATES. BOARD ALSO TOLD OF $920,000 BUDGET SHORTFALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to replace Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin, who died last month after being 
infected with fast-moving bacteria, Ventura Community College District trustees 
decided Saturday to accept candidates from inside and outside the district to 
serve as interim chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a separate announcement, trustees said at the special meeting that the 
district faces a shortfall of $920,000 in its $86.6-million budget as a result 
of the state's overly optimistic projections of revenues from property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members, who were informed of the funding gap in a closed-session 
meeting last week, said they do not know how they will make up the shortfall. 
"We need to start working on it right away," Trustee Timothy D. Hirschberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the search to replace the chancellor, the board voted unanimously to form a 
committee to begin looking for a permanent successor to Lakin. The committee 
will include five community representatives, one appointed by each trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said they hoped to select an interim chancellor in January and a 
permanent replacement in about six months. Moorpark College President James 
Walker was named acting interim chancellor Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakin's replacement will be charged with implementing major improvements in 
the district's book-keeping practices -- improvements suggested in a critical 
audit released last week by the district's accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees, who debated the details of the chancellor search process for two 
hours at Saturday's meeting, said they did not want to rush such an important 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The selection of the chancellor is probably the most critical decision that 
the board can make," Trustee Pete E. Tafoya said. 
</P>
<P>
 In letters and testimony given Saturday, students, faculty and staff almost 
uniformly supported looking within the district for an interim replacement. 
They told trustees to look for a candidate who is "people-oriented" and 
familiar with the district. 
</P>
<P>
 A motion to limit the interim search to inside candidates failed by a 3-2 
vote, however, as the majority of trustees said they preferred to wait and see 
who applies for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequently made argument in favor of an inside candidate was that it 
would keep salary and search costs down for the financially pressed district. 
</P>
<P>
 The union representing classified employees at Moorpark college argued for 
eliminating the chancellor's job entirely. Trustee Noman J. Nagel said the 
board should mull doing away with the job and its $140,000 a year compensation 
package, replacing the chancellor with a council of the presidents of Ventura, 
Oxnard, and Moorpark community colleges. The chairman of the council would 
rotate each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like an interesting and innovative idea, something that we may at 
least want to consider," Nagel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tafoya urged trustees to make gender and racial diversity a priority in the 
selection process, saying he was disappointed that staff, students and faculty 
had not emphasized that issue in their comments.

 NOT RAM ENOUGH: As the Los Angeles Rams count down (maybe) till departing for 
other pastures, have you wondered how they've fared since they became an 
Anaheim team in 1980? Right now for those 15 years they're at 109-120 -- with 
no Super Bowl appearances under the Big A banner. . . . The Rams -- 4-9 so far 
this season -- try to improve their numbers against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
today (C10). You can catch the game on TV at 10 a.m., Channel 11. 
</P>
<P>
 PARTY POOPER? The police become a worry if you party too loudly. But in 
Newport Beach -- if Police Chief Robert J. McDonell gets his way -- you'd 
better worry if one of your renters parties a little too much. McDonell 
presents to the City Council on Monday a report recommending civil fines for 
either renters or owners of homes where the police are called to quiet a party. 
. . . Owners could be fined as much as $300 if the police have to make repeated 
disturbance calls within a year to the same address. 
</P>
<P>
 WALE OF A NIGHT: If you're doing an evening of Welsh Christmas performances, 
you have to start with famous Welsh writer Dylan Thomas. His "Child's Christmas 
in Wales" will be read during "A Welsh Christmas" at the Garden Grove 
Historical Society, 12174 Euclid Ave., tonight and Monday at 7:30. . . . The 
show features many cast members from the old Grove Shakespeare, such as Danny 
Oberbeck, above. That Shakespeare troupe had put on the Dylan Thomas story each 
Christmas for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 HEAD OF HER CLASS: It was grad night for a class of one last week at Brea 
Canyon High School. District board members signed the diploma for Marlo Ortiz, 
who completed her course work through approved independent study. . . . Ortiz 
says it was important that she graduate before Dec. 15, when she turns 19: "I 
had a goal to be out before my birthday. This is my birthday present to 
myself." School officials couldn't remember any other student graduating early 
like that, but praised her for meeting her goal and wished her well.

AN UNLIKELY TEAM PRODUCES 'PRETTY BOY FLOYD'; BOOKS: DIANA OSSANA WAS AN 
UNKNOWN, A WOMAN WHO HAD DONE A LOT OF WRITING BUT NEVER HAD ANYTHING 
PUBLISHED. LARRY MCMURTRY IS ONE OF AMERICA'S MOST SUCCESSFUL WRITERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CASEY COMBS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just who does Diana Ossana think she is, anyway? The 45-year-old former law 
clerk gets second billing on the most recent novel by Larry McMurtry, one of 
America's most popular and prolific authors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana had never been published before she sat down with the Pulitzer 
Prize-winner to write "Pretty Boy Floyd," McMurtry's 17th novel. 
</P>
<P>
 While the book was released in September to mostly positive reviews, critics 
are wondering why the man who wrote "Lonesome Dove" and "Terms of Endearment" 
worked with a collaborator for the first time in his 33-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 But to McMurtry, the decision to write with Ossana was no act of charity -- it 
was she who pulled him out of a slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that I couldn't write it without her," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana might not have taken on the project had she known that some critics 
would accuse her of daring to write with "the icon," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 They filled in the details during a stop in Seattle on a national book tour, a 
first for both Ossana and McMurtry. He decided to do one this time because the 
collaboration has finally given him something to talk about, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale of their alliance reads like McMurtry's fiction -- rich in folksy 
detail and melodrama. 
</P>
<P>
 The two, both divorced, met through mutual friends almost 10 years ago in a 
catfish restaurant in Tucson, Ariz., where Ossana lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana was star-struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had just finished (reading) 'Lonesome Dove,' " she said. "It was 
intimidating; I couldn't imagine what I would have to say that would be 
interesting to this man." 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile, I was in awe of this silent, beautiful woman sitting at the end of 
the table," McMurtry says. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually the two became friends. 
</P>
<P>
 McMurtry described his lifestyle in the 1980s as peripatetic. He would flit 
around the country almost weekly to oversee his rare-book stores in Tucson, 
Texas and Washington, D.C., and he also had a home in Los Angeles. He wrote 
seven novels during the decade, as well as screenplays, essays and book 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the fall of 1991, the now-58-year-old Texas native had quadruple 
bypass heart surgery and was forced to stop moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just so happened that I stopped at Diana's kitchen table." A side-effect 
of the surgery was a debilitating fear of going outside, a reaction McMurtry 
says doctors call common. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent his time sleeping in Ossana's guest room, writing "Streets of 
Laredo," the sequel to "Lonesome Dove," on a manual typewriter in her kitchen 
or just staring out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana, who lived with her teen-age daughter, called his behavior 
"disconcerting." 
</P>
<P>
 "I let him stay at my house because he seemed to be comfortable there, and 
waited, hoping that this would subside," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The collaboration began when McMurtry asked Ossana, who had written for 
pleasure since childhood, to help edit "Streets of Laredo." He had been so out 
of it that the story seemed "faxed from a former self," he recalls, but Ossana 
improved it. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he was rejecting screenplay offers, insisting that he couldn't 
focus on a job that was structured. 
</P>
<P>
 When Warner Bros. wanted a script for "Pretty Boy Floyd," Ossana put her foot 
down. She researched the story and persuaded McMurtry to tackle it. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Arthur Floyd was a small-time, Depression-era bank robber from 
Oklahoma who found himself on J. Edgar Hoover's most wanted list as Public 
Enemy No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of trouble persuading Diana to actually put her name on it, 
although it was her research, and it was a full collaboration," McMurtry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ossana says she would have been content to just be paid for her time without 
taking credit. "I didn't want to deal with Hollywood, I didn't want to deal 
with the press, I didn't want to deal with all the things that go along with 
it. I just wanted to write, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing the script, the two were so fascinated by the story they 
immediately began the novel. They wrote 10 pages a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very worried about our styles merging at first," McMurtry said, "but 
(it) just happened without anyone noticing . . . and sort of got lost in the 
daily activity." 
</P>
<P>
 One day during the project, he sneaked a glance at Ossana's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read two pages of her novel, and I was very, very moved," he said. "I 
realized then that my instinctive choice to try to persuade her to be my 
partner was correct, because there was something in that prose that I don't 
have in my prose." 
</P>
<P>
 While "Pretty Boy Floyd" features McMurtry-esque down-home slang and humor, 
the two authors say the female characters have a sensibility that comes from 
Ossana. 
</P>
<P>
 She is now working on a novel of her own about Italian immigrants. When that 
is published, readers will see clearly how Ossana contributed to "Pretty Boy," 
McMurtry says.

FROM OBSCURITY TO CARETAKER OF 5TH DISTRICT; CITY COUNCIL: A COALITION IS

 Meet Avak Keotahian. 
</P>
<P>
 It's OK if you do not immediately recognize the name. Until last week, 
Keotahian was just another obscure bureaucrat plying his trade at Los Angeles 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, he still is an obscure bureaucrat, but one with a big -- and 
controversial -- responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 A City Hall bit player for 17 years, Keotahian, 46, took over Monday as 
day-to-day caretaker of the council district vacated when Zev Yaroslavsky left 
the post and moved to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Keotahian only gets a skeleton staff. He is not allowed to vote in City 
Council deliberations. He still has to handle all his old responsibilities as a 
city legislative analyst. And he hates publicity. "I just want to remain 
anonymous," Keotahian pleaded. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Keotahian, a Los Feliz resident, has landed squarely in the middle of a 
roiling municipal controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's nothing personal, but critics in the district are fighting to buck the 
caretaker approach and force appointment of an honest-to-goodness, voting 
representative to look after their interests until an election can be held. "We 
have a diminished voice," said Alan Kishbaugh, a Laurel Canyon resident of the 
5th District. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no one to take our phone calls, or make ones for us to get things 
done," said Barbara Fine, a Benedict Canyon resident. "There's no official 
representing us with a vote, no one to bring in a motion." 
</P>
<P>
 Kishbaugh and Fine are leaders of a homeowner-business coalition urging the 
appointment of an interim council member to the 5th District seat until voters 
pick a replacement in elections next spring to fill out the last two years of 
Yaroslavsky's term. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine said the authority of a real councilman is already being missed. A recent 
decision by a state parks agency to drop its funding for the purchase of a 
32-acre park site in the Hollywood Hills provides an example, Fine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A councilperson with clout could help us on this -- making phone calls to get 
this reversed," she said. But an unknown caretaker is unlikely to get past 
first base with the parks agency, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One candidate for the interim job is 31-year-old Michael Jiminez, a former 
Yaroslavsky aide whose private consulting firm, PS Enterprises Inc., has an 
$85,000 city contract to provide housing assistance to the earthquake-ravaged 
portions of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Yaroslavsky reportedly is quietly pushing for Jiminez, his candidacy 
has a potential problem: whether Jiminez qualifies as a legal resident of the 
district. Jiminez last weekend hurriedly moved from Santa Monica to Bel-Air -- 
which is in the 5th District -- in a bid to keep his candidacy alive by trying 
to satisfy the city's requirement that an appointee live 30 days in the 
district prior to his selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Another name has also surfaced. Former county Supervisor Ed Edelman -- the man 
Yaroslavsky succeeded at the county Hall of Administration -- has announced his 
support for Bob Geoghegan, 50, who had been Edelman's chief deputy since 1981. 
He, too, has just moved into the district from his former residence in Culver 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the homeowners' pleas, the City Council has shown no overwhelming 
appetite for appointing a voting substitute to serve. Council opponents of the 
appointment, including Mark Ridley-Thomas and Joel Wachs, say the caretaker 
system has worked well in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it has been used the last nine times that council vacancies arose. The 
last time the council appointed someone to fill a vacancy was 1966, and the 
appointee was John Ferraro, now the council's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Council members ought not (to) be electing council members, the public ought 
to be doing that," Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it inevitable that an appointee favored by a majority of the council 
would be representative of the district, he added. Some resolution could come 
Tuesday, when the council is expected to vote on whether to authorize a special 
election to fill the term. If the council takes that step, city law will 
preclude an appointment from being made. Pro-appointment forces hope to stall 
such a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there is day-to-day business to attend to, as Keotahian found out 
Thursday as he slipped into Yaroslavsky's old office to answer phone calls and 
mail from 5th District constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a call from some attorney who wants to know what the zoning on his 
client's property is," Keotahian said. "He should've called the Planning 
Department but we'll get him a phone number." 
</P>
<P>
 Keotahian -- chosen for the job by his boss, Chief Legislative Analyst Ron 
Deaton -- admits that the situation is far from ideal. The 5th District staff 
he is supervising is only a third the size of Yaroslavsky's former staff (most 
of whom are now working for Yaroslavsky at the county), and he is serving only 
part time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still doing my other work," he said. Yet even the veteran bureaucrat has 
a touch of the politician about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be tough enough," Keotahian said diplomatically, "even for an 
elected official to replicate the excellent track record of service that Zev 
provided his constituents -- let alone a City Hall caretaker with a skeleton 
staff."

32% DIP IN STATE SUICIDES FOUND AS U.S. RATE RISES; RESEARCH: AMID DEBATE ABOUT 
CAUSES, UCI STUDY OF 1970-1990 DATA FINDS O.C. AMONG COUNTIES WITH LOWER RATES 
THAN CALIFORNIA.

<P>
 As experts lament a steep rise in youth suicides nationwide, and as U.S. 
suicide rates outside California edge upward, the numbers for this state -- 
painstakingly charted by a UC Irvine graduate student -- tell a brighter but 
less known story. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1970 to 1990, while the U.S. suicide rate increased almost 19% outside 
California, this state's suicide rate plunged, even among young people, 
according to the recently published research by Mike Males, a doctoral student 
in social ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32% overall drop -- even more dramatic in urban coastal counties such as 
Los Angeles and San Francisco -- is a largely unheralded trend that Males 
believes cries out for attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's decrease slightly exceeded the state's, but Los Angeles County 
saw a drop of almost 45%. Statewide, among Californians ages 15 to 24, the rate 
tumbled almost 37%, Males found. 
</P>
<P>
 Examining extraordinary patterns like these "should be an exciting 
opportunity," Males said. "Part of understanding why people commit suicide is 
understanding why they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet suicide seems to draw interest, and funding for prevention, only when it's 
on the way up, he said. When Males reviewed the literature on suicide for a 
paper published in March, he found a single reference to a decline in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 While they are aware of the drop in California's overall rate in the past 
decade or so, state and national officials acknowledge they have not analyzed 
the trend closely. The downturn since the early 1980s, though significant, 
eludes easy explanation, they say.  
</P>
<P>
 Suicide "is a very poorly understood phenomenon," said Roger Trent, chief of 
injury surveillance at the state Department of Health Services. "We really 
don't know much about it. There is a very strong cultural and social element. 
It varies sometimes and we don't know why." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Suicide was the eighth leading cause of death in the country in 1991, ranking 
above AIDS and homicide. It was the ninth leading cause in California. Yet it 
"is not high on the public agenda as a public health issue," said Lloyd Potter, 
team leader for suicide prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention in Atlanta. "We have fairly limited resources to do investigations." 
But some in the nation's small circle of suicide experts, who for years have 
pursued what they acknowledge is an obscure and often mysterious field, are 
intrigued by Males' findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "On pretty close first scrutiny, (Males') observations seem to hold water," 
said psychologist David Clark, director of the Center for Suicide Research and 
Prevention in Chicago. "I think he has something meaningful here" -- and it's 
already sent some suicide trend-watchers "scurrying now to look at it in 
detail." 
</P>
<P>
 California sits among a cluster of Western states such as Nevada, Montana, New 
Mexico and Idaho -- which consistently post among the highest rates in the 
nation. The question, say Clark and others, is why this state bucks the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the CDC, California had the nation's 12th highest suicide rate in 
1980, but dropped to 34th a decade later -- the only one among the Western 
states to show such a drastic shift. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that the state's suicide rate is comparatively low. Before 1970, 
California's rate was more than double that of the rest of the country; by 1990 
it was equal to the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Males, who has made the issue his academic mission, says he can't fully 
account for what he calls "the weird California effect." 
</P>
<P>
 The bearded 44-year-old doctoral student, who describes himself as an 
"all-purpose skeptic", began thinking about the issue of suicide while working 
as a newspaper reporter in Montana. He was disturbed, he said, by the "hype" 
that followed a teen-age girl's suicide; no one bothered to mention that 
youngsters kill themselves far less often than adults do. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when he took a close look at numbers published in a national 
statistical manual, he noticed the suicide figures among U.S. residents had 
gone up but California's hadn't. It seemed odd, he said, so he called about a 
dozen experts to find out why. All they could tell him was why suicide rates 
were rising. He went back to school, he said, to find out for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of California's pattern remains a mystery, he said -- but he has some 
theories. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, changes in the state's population make-up explains some of the 
downturn, he and other experts say. California has been a mecca for minority 
groups in the past several decades. Males said in his March article in the 
journal Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior that the state's proportion of 
Latinos and nonwhites doubled to almost 44% between 1970 and 1990, twice the 
rate of the national increase. 
</P>
<P>
 For cultural reasons that are not well understood, these minority groups tend 
to commit suicide at a much lower rate than whites. 
</P>
<P>
 But even after Males adjusted state statistics to account for ethnic 
composition, he found the population changes accounted for only about a third 
of California's suicide decline. 
</P>
<P>
 While the drop in suicides was most dramatic among Latinos and nonwhites 
between 1970 and 1988, Males said that rates among white males, who of all 
groups are the most likely to kill themselves, dropped 12% in the same period. 
Among white females the rate dropped more than 58%. 
</P>
<P>
 Males explored another possibility: The trends may be skewed by reporting 
differences between California and other states. 
</P>
<P>
 He notes that California, by the 1970s a center for world suicide research, 
was much better than other states at distinguishing suicides from accidents at 
that time. As early as the 1960s, the state had suicide specialists advising 
coroner's offices on suspicious cases. Only recently have other states begun to 
correct a longstanding reluctance to certify deaths -- particularly youth 
deaths -- as suicides, Males contends. So perhaps California and other states 
were closer in suicides than the numbers showed in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 But misclassification by other states still falls short of explaining the dive 
in California's suicide rate. It seems certain that California saw a 
substantial "real" decrease in suicides, Males said -- particularly among 
women, nonwhites, the young and urban dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the numbers suggest the drop-off had something to do with changes in 
behavior among people ambivalent about killing themselves in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic dip in suicides occurred among people who chose so-called 
"soft methods," such as drug overdose, poisoning and drowning, which leave open 
the possibility of being saved. To Males, that suggests that "people who are 
ambivalent about dying are choosing to live." The question is why. 
</P>
<P>
 Males and others very cautiously suggest that California's pioneering efforts 
at suicide prevention, begun in the 1950s, gradually might have paid off. Those 
efforts, such as hot lines and counseling, perhaps have been most effective 
among people least certain about whether they want to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most dramatic suicide declines are seen in such areas as Los 
Angeles and San Francisco, where suicide prevention efforts were early and 
vigorous. 
</P>
<P>
 Several suicide experts remain unconvinced. "We dont have any body of evidence 
proving that crisis centers and hot lines lower the death by suicide," Chicago 
psychologist Clark said. "It doesn't mean they don't work. It's just very hard 
to measure. We don't know if they're working. Maybe the effects are small and 
subtle and cumulative." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Smith, a New Mexico suicidologist, said prevention centers probably have 
not worked -- with the exception of concentrated community efforts that occur 
immediately after suicide clusters, such as those among teen-agers. But Males, 
he said, has posed a provocative question -- one that merits greater scientific 
inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Others caution that a drop in suicide rates is no reason for California to 
relax its prevention efforts or to dismiss the suicide problems as resolved. 
Certain subgroups, they say, remain at high risk -- especially the state's 
growing elderly population.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Peck, a West Los Angeles psychologist who has written a book on youth 
suicide, said it is important to remember that California's rate, while lower 
than it used to be, still is close to the U.S. average. "We're not talking 
about it being very low." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At least some of California's dip could be due to random variation, one expert 
familiar with Males' data said. With a relatively rare event such as suicide, 
wide swings are not unexpected, said Richard McCleary, a professor of 
environmental analysis at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he (Males) has got a real effect here," McCleary said, but its 
significance should not be "overinterpreted." 
</P>
<P>
 For at least one woman who lost a family member to suicide, news of Males' 
findings evoked mixed feelings. Cathi Jones of Newport Beach, whose 23-year-old 
son hanged himself in 1992, said it would be "marvelous" if the state's rate 
were going down. 
</P>
<P>
 "If suicide prevention actually does something, I think that surely should be 
something that is looked into," she said. But Jones, who runs a peer support 
group for families affected by suicide, said she worries about the issue being 
minimized. "I'm concerned people will say it's not a problem anymore . . . and 
(about) family members being put in the position of thinking that there is 
something wrong with them . . . that it is a shameful thing, that they are 
unusual."

A STAND ON THE WETLANDS; ENVIRONMENT: PROTESTERS RENEW EFFORT AS COUNTY 
DECISION NEARS ON A PROPOSED HOUSING DEVELOPMENT AT BOLSA CHICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For almost a decade, Marge Allen has been leading students throughthe Bolsa 
Chica wetlands, telling them about the Indian tribes that inhabited the area 
and the World War II bunker on the mesa that soldiers manned almost 50 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday morning, the 66-year-old Huntington Beach resident fought back 
tears at the thought that she and others who love the 1,700-acre area might 
lose it to development. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much that is here that matters," Allen said, trying to steady her 
voice. "To wipe it away is utterly wrong. If we develop it now, it's gone 
forever. If it's never restored (by man), nature will do it itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Under cloudy skies, Allen and hundreds of other environmentalists lined both 
sides of Pacific Coast Highway near Warner Avenue to focus attention on an 
Orange County Board of Supervisors meeting this week that could determine the 
area's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members are expected to decide Wednesday whether to grant the property's 
owner, the Koll Real Estate Group, a zoning change that would allow it to build 
3,300 homes on the undeveloped land. As part of the construction project, the 
company has also pledged to dig a tidal inlet that would run under Pacific 
Coast Highway and into the wetlands area. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Dunn, senior vice president of Koll Real Estate Group, said the land is 
degraded and cannot sustain vegetation or wildlife. "Furthermore, it's right 
next to existing homes. We would only use 25% of the land and over 1,200 acres 
would go to a park, trails and an extended ecological reserve." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists argue that new homes will bring more people and pollutants 
that will funnel directly into the ocean and destroy wildlife habitats. In a 
show of solidarity, more than 50 surfers propped their surfboards along a fence 
that separates the highway from the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat O'Brien, a 28-year-old science teacher, waved at passing cars. He lives 
close to the beach and tries to go surfing every morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolsa Chica "is one of the last natural resources in Orange County," he said. 
"We've got migrating birds that come here to nest. Where are they going to go 
when this land is developed?" 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers on Pacific Coast Highway and Warner Avenue slowed to read signs 
bearing such hand-painted slogans as, "Save it, don't pave it" and "Easy to go 
bankrupt, easy to promise restoration," a reference to the county's recent 
troubles. Many honked in support, but not everyone was pleased by the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a bunch of baloney," said Brad White, a 27-year-old Costa 
Mesa subcontractor and member of the Surfrider Foundation, who opposes his 
group's opposition to the development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I disagree with Surfrider completely," White said. "I joined them basically 
because I love the ocean. I think more are getting into fighting homes and 
development rather than just protecting the ocean and wildlife. The area's 
dying and they would rather wait another 20 years and let it erode instead of 
developing it for the community's benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 White's comments drew hostility from other demonstrators who gathered around 
him and his friends in the parking lot, engaging in a heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are going to be 700 homes built on the wetlands and 2,600 on the mesa," 
Gordon Labedz a spokesman for the Surfrider Foundation, said. "Our stand is no 
building of any kind. This is a sacred spot for a surfer. There are very few 
spots where you can look from the water to the land and see no buildings or 
people."

DANA PARSONS: REVOLUTIONARY CRY: OUT WITH COUNTY GOVERNMENT HEADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not to alarm the Board of Supervisors, but the French Revolution started when 
the government ran out of money. The working class, tired of being trampled by 
the ruling nobility, stormed the Bastille and set off the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Is the Hall of Administration sufficiently fortified to ward off 
such an onslaught? 
</P>
<P>
 The board may not fully realize how under siege it is, or is about to become. 
The disintegration of the county's investment pool is still a work in progress, 
and the public mood is only likely to darken toward the supervisors as they 
continue dispensing the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether more heads will be guillotined than just former Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron remains to be seen, but if it could be done quickly, 
the guess here is that much of the public would line up the entire board at the 
base of the scaffold. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't take my word for it. Pick from any of a number of ticked-off local 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County may well be the home of the angry-taxpayer movement. Whether 
it's a group opposing a utility tax in Fullerton or pension-spiking in 
Huntington Beach, there's one on every corner, just like fast-food restaurants. 
Most of them have formed around disenchantment with their city governments, but 
the county's bond-market fiasco feeds nicely into their scorn of how some 
public officials conduct business. 
</P>
<P>
 So much so that about 85 representatives from various groups met last 
Wednesday. Before the meeting ended, one of the leaders, representing a group 
called the 45th Revolutionist Chapter of United We Stand, wanted to seek out 
the supervisors and demand their resignations, according to Bill Mello, who 
represents another group from Huntington Beach called the Citizens Bureau of 
Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the 85 were ready to follow through, Mello said, but the group decided 
to wait until a later date. "These people have passion in their eyes," Mello 
said. "You wouldn't believe how upset they are with government." 
</P>
<P>
 The groups' common thread is what they believe to be the overpaid status of 
city employees, but the bond-market situation has temporarily diverted their 
attention to the supervisors. Mello, for example, favors recalling the entire 
Board of Supervisors. "We elected them to do a job and to watch our money and 
make sure it was spent properly. They didn't do that," Mello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello predicted there will be a formal request by at least some of the citizen 
groups' representatives that the supervisors resign. At the very least, he 
said, the groups want to "just make life miserable" for the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Clark represents the Orange Taxpayers Assn. and says she's a little more 
patient than some of her peers. Yet, she says, the overall level of anger is 
not to be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were angry before, and now they're twice as angry," she said. "I think 
frustration builds on frustration, and you don't know where it's going to 
erupt." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Mello advises patience with regard to the county's bond-market 
situation. But that won't give the supervisors much relief, because he agrees 
with their call for calm while still favoring their ousters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Supervisors were asleep at the switch," he said. "That's where 
the buck stops. You can't blame it all on Citron." 
</P>
<P>
 Mello chuckled at my reference to the French Revolution. Actually, his 
favorite revolution was the American. He and like-minded compatriots in the 
other groups like it so much that they call their networking "Committees of 
Correspondence" after the name given to the colonists' method of spreading the 
word against King George. 
</P>
<P>
 History has a habit of repeating itself, so I asked Mello if he wants another 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we don't want to have a revolution," he said. "We have a good 
Constitution, we just have to get elected officials who follow it, who respect 
and treat citizens fairly, and who don't lie when they make campaign promises. 
We just need to recall a few of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, the local investment-pool disaster has fueled groups like 
Mello's. Convinced that government has too much of their money in the first 
place, they're now in a position to argue that the bureaucrats don't know what 
to do with it when they get it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, the board may be hard-pressed to rebut that argument. 
Until they can explain all this, they may want to keep an eye peeled for crowds 
of angry citizens milling around Civic Center Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be time to man the battlestations. Sometimes these revolutionaries 
aren't happy till they have your head.

LONG LINES, ONE-LINERS AT BOB HOPE EVENT

 More than 1,000 Bob Hope fans, ranging from World War II veterans to children 
born around the time of Operation Desert Storm, lined up at South Coast Plaza 
on Saturday to meet one of America's most well-known entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope and his wife, Dolores, dropped by Bullock's as part of a national tour to 
promote their new Christmas album, "Hopes for the Holidays," and their upcoming 
NBC special. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon hearing that some fans had waited in line for four hours, Hope quipped: 
"I guess they found out Dolores is coming." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked his opinion about Orange County's financial woes, the 91-year-old 
entertainer feigned surprise: "My God, I should have brought money." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the crowd waiting to meet the couple was World War II veteran Thomas 
Rice of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been a fan for 50 some years," said Rice, who recalled seeing the 
entertainer "from a long distance away" when he visited a Navy hospital in 
Norfolk, Va., during the early 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy his shows," Rice said. "Anything was good for morale at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Chudomelka of Mission Viejo was in line wearing a golf cap bearing Hope's 
autograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had three brothers in World War II, and one is buried in the national 
cemetery in Hawaii," Chudomelka said. "I just feel very indebted to this 
wonderful gentleman who has dedicated his life to making people happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hope has been in show business for seven decades and has spent five of them 
entertaining troops at military bases, hospitals and combat zones. His last 
goodwill tour was four years ago during the Persian Gulf War, when he spent 
Christmas with U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 He has received more than 2,000 awards and citations for his professional and 
humanitarian efforts, including 54 honorary doctorate degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope said Saturday he missed not being with the troops this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it for so long, you know," he said. "It's a good feeling because you're 
doing something for people who mean a lot -- that's how I feel about them."

STRONG WILL HELPED CRASHED PILOT ENDURE 12-DAY SIERRA TREK; SURVIVOR: PETER 
DELEO ATE INSECTS AND WADED THROUGH DEEP SNOW, BUT SENSED HIS FAMILY'S PRAYERS 
FOR HIM, HIS SISTER SAYS.

<P>
 A Long Beach pilot who hiked 12 days to get help for two friends who were 
injured in a High Sierra plane crash ate insects and slept in hollow tree 
trunks to survive, his sister said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter DeLeo, 33, struggled through waist-deep snow to make his way from the 
8,000-foot level, where his single-engine plane crashed Nov. 27. On Friday he 
flagged down a motorist on U.S. 395 and led authorities back to the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers Waverly Hatch, 49, and Lloyd Matsumoto, 53, were dead when rescuers 
reached the wreckage of the plane in a ravine near Kern Peak in eastern Tulare 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise DeLeo said her brother's thoughts and prayers were with the two men's 
families and friends as he returned to his home Saturday afternoon after being 
treated for his injuries. They include a broken ankle, four fractured ribs, a 
broken shoulder blade, frostbite and acute malnutrition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm making do," DeLeo said weakly as friends helped him hobble into the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother had a strong will to live," Denise DeLeo said later. "He knew his 
family and friends were pulling for him. He told me he sensed our prayers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DeLeo lost about 20 pounds during the ordeal, she said. He wore a ski bib, 
jacket, long johns and winter boots during the hike. Initial reports Friday 
indicated that DeLeo had stayed with his two companions for a few days before 
starting his hike, but his sister said Saturday that he began his 20-mile trek 
on the first day. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the crash is being investigated by federal aviation officials. 
But DeLeo told rescuers that a sudden wind shear caused the plane to plunge 
into a backcountry ravine as the three men was headed toward Mammoth Lakes to 
take pictures of the winter snowfall. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow pilots at Long Beach Airport where DeLeo kept his 17-year-old plane 
said it was missing a $35 battery for its emergency locater transmitter a few 
months ago. An inoperative transmitter would have kept searchers from finding 
the downed craft. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did an amazing job getting out, no matter what happened," said Jim Herron, 
the instructor who gave DeLeo a test flight after he bought the $30,000 Maule 
M-5 last year.

CATCHING UP; NEGRO LEAGUE PLAYERS REMINISCE AT FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Laura Hendryx and her sister Marie Goree, it's a memory that crystallizes 
the happiest times of their childhood: sitting on the floor pounding their 
father's brand-new baseball mitt, proud to be charged with the task of breaking 
it in for a big game he was to play the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, long after their father stopped playing, the sisters talked 
frequently about rounding up former Negro League ballplayers living in Los 
Angeles for a reunion of sorts, as well as a chance to glean more firsthand 
baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday they finally got their wish at Hendryx's Leimert Park art gallery, 
Gallery Plus on Degnan Boulevard. Seven former players from clubs such as the 
Kansas City Monarchs and the Drummondville (Canada) Cubs gladly told war 
stories and autographed memorabilia for those who came to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been wanting to do this for so long, it started eating at us," said 
Hendryx, whose gallery boasts one of the city's largest collections of 
contemporary African American art. "We're so happy it came together." 
</P>
<P>
 For onetime catcher Sammy Haynes, 74, it was a welcome opportunity to 
stimulate interest in a bit of black history that he and other players forged 
for many seasons. It was also a chance for the players to raise money that many 
retirees, who received no pensions or other benefits, badly need. Players 
autographed posters, photos and trading cards that sold for $3 to $40. 
</P>
<P>
 "This keeps us busy. It's a good feeling to get out," said the lively Haynes, 
decked out in a vintage Negro League jacket and cap. "We all feel honored when 
people ask us, 'What was it like back then?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hendryx set up tables for former players Haynes, Andy Porter, Merle Porter, 
Luther Branham, Fran Matthews, Albert (Buster) Haywood and Ernie Haskins, who 
range in age up to 84. Many fans, with memorabilia in hand, wanted to talk 
about the Negro League and their own recollections of games they had seen and 
players they had known. 
</P>
<P>
 "I changed my plans to be here today," said Sharon Brown, who stood waiting 
for her son and daughter to get their baseballs signed. "We had planned to go 
to the movies, but I told my kids, 'This is history.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her son Lorenzo, 13, came away from a conversation with Merle Porter 
thoughtful and a bit perturbed. "They're cool guys. It's kind of sad that they 
had to be separated from the major leagues," he said. "They should've gotten 
their chance to play like everybody else." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-team Negro League operated from 1920 to 1950 and spawned such greats as 
Satchel Paige, Roy Campanella and Jackie Robinson. Teams hailed chiefly from 
the East, Midwest and South, with names such as the Newark Eagles, Detroit Cubs 
and Atlanta Black Crackers. Robinson broke the major league color barrier by 
signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1948, a triumph for African Americans, but 
a death knell for the Negro League. It was dismantled two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many Negro Leaguers played on, either in the majors, on farm teams or with 
semipro leagues. Hendryx recalled giving her father, Art Demery -- who suffered 
a stroke five years ago that left him unable to speak -- liniment rubdowns 
after games when she and several of her 12 siblings were teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had odd jobs, but he never really left baseball," said Hendryx, who has 
two brothers who also played professionally. "As I got older, I started to 
think about a lot of guys who played a long time and are living now without 
pensions from their career. . . . I wanted to do something for them and also 
for our own family research." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those who came to Hendryx's gallery Saturday conducted some informal 
research of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin Aterberry and Pete Fulton engaged in a spirited exchange, rattling off 
baseball facts and figures as they waited to speak to the players. "There were 
some great players in the league, no question about it," said Aterberry, a 
hard-core Birmingham Black Barons fan whose friend played with Haynes. "I heard 
white fans at games say how much better a lot of our players were than the 
major leaguers." 
</P>
<P>
 Hendryx and Goree say that's part of the reason they want to find out as much 
as possible about their father, who eventually played for the Brooklyn Dodgers' 
farm team in Bakersfield. "We want him, and other black players, to get their 
rightful place in history," said Goree, adding that she is working with Haynes 
to get Demery into baseball's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of the players, who jokingly called themselves "The Brothers Who 
Played but Didn't Get Paid," any recognition now won't change hard financial 
realities. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Haynes said, "we were just so glad to get the chance to play back then. . 
. . It was a labor of love. We didn't make a lot of money, but we sure had a 
lot of fun."

JANITORS URGE UNITY AS CONTRACT TALKS NEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They clean some of Los Angeles' most ritzy commercial addresses, places where 
million-dollar deals, power lunches and chill-out sessions of racquetball and 
tennis are de rigueur.  
</P>
<P>
 Often, though, they earn poverty wages, returning after a grueling night's 
work mopping floors and sanitizing toilets in glass towers to their humble 
abodes in some of Los Angeles' roughest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, more than 1,000 janitors -- mostly Latino immigrants -- -- 
marched with family members and Proposition 187 opponents along part of 
Pasadena's Rose Parade route in a well-orchestrated kickoff to what are 
expected to be difficult contract negotiations with building owners and 
cleaning contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want is a decent, living wages with benefits for our families," said 
Rosa Ayala, a janitor and executive board member of Local 399 of the Service 
Employees International Union, which organized Saturday's union convention, 
march and spirited rally outside Pasadena's City Hall. "The owners of these 
luxury buildings should be ashamed that we are consigned to living in misery." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's events mark a watershed for the union's "Justice for Janitors" 
movement, which has garnered national attention for organizing a largely 
immigrant, low-wage work force at a time of dwindling union ranks nationwide. 
Local 399 represents more than 8,000 janitors, who clean about 70% of the 
county's major commercial office space. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's contract expires March 31. Formal renewal talks with management 
are pending, but on Saturday, organizers enunciated their goal: "One Union. One 
Industry. One Contract." 
</P>
<P>
 Labor leaders are seeking to organize the remaining non-union buildings -- and 
more critically, to equalize wages throughout Los Angeles County. Now, a 
multilevel pay scale prevails, creating a kind of geographical caste system. 
</P>
<P>
 Janitors Downtown and in Century City generally average $6.80 per hour with 
full benefits for themselves and their families. In the San Fernando and San 
Gabriel valleys and elsewhere, hourly wages dip to $4.25, the legal minimum, 
with no benefits.  
</P>
<P>
 Today's scenario is a striking contrast to the panorama a generation ago, when 
a largely African American, unionized work force earned well above poverty 
levels. As recently as the early 1980s, said Jono Shaffer, who directs the Los 
Angeles Justice for Janitors campaign, maintenance workers here averaged $7.32 
an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Zoila Barahona earns $4.25 an hour cleaning the Pasadena Police 
Department. She has trouble paying the rent and providing for her 1-year old 
son, Jocsan. "It's pure exploitation," she said. Management is resistant to 
equalizing wages throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do it all at one time would be too radical," said Armando DeCastro, 
chairman of Diversified Maintenance Service. 
</P>
<P>
 But union strategists say the costs to management of standardizing wages would 
be minimal -- about an additional cent for each dollar paid in rents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a penny that L.A. building owners can easily afford to pay," a union 
study concluded, "and it is a penny that L.A. can't afford to do without."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: THE ONLY THING PREDICTABLE IS THAT WOMEN WILL LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of white people say O.J. Simpson is assured of acquittal or, at the 
least, a hung jury because his jury is predominantly black. 
</P>
<P>
 That view assumes that blacks will automatically support a brother, that 
African Americans share the same opinions, as if they were connected by a black 
Internet that sends out instructions on how to think about the issues of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a simplistic view that ignores the complexity and diversity of the black 
community, where age, income, education, religious beliefs and gender -- as 
well as race -- shape African American opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gender is an especially important consideration with the Simpson jury: six of 
the eight black jurors are women. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who has observed community life in black neighborhoods of Los Angeles 
is aware of the influence of African American women. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of South-Central Los Angeles' most influential black politicians are 
women -- Rep. Maxine Waters, state Sen. Diane Watson, Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke and City Councilwoman Rita Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Los Angeles area, block clubs that are largely run by women 
organize neighborhood watches and work with the Police Department on 
crime-fighting programs, pushing the cops hard when the LAPD is slow to respond 
or is hostile to residents. Women are also powerful forces in South-Central's 
many churches, and head several nonprofit organizations that build housing for 
those with low incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 The block clubs, the nonprofits and the churches form a strong community 
infrastructure, and every political candidate trying to tap into it knows the 
important role of women in keeping it together. 
</P>
<P>
 I discussed this Friday with Karen Bass, an African American woman who is 
executive director of the Community Coalition Against Substance Abuse, which 
led the successful fight to drastically reduce the number of liquor stores in 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that is unique about our community is that African American 
women have never had the luxury of not being in the forefront," she said. 
"African American women have always been out in the work force. Those kind of 
gender issues that might be typical in the white community are not typical in 
the African American community. Being at home and being a full-time mother is 
luxury. As an African American woman who has been in a leadership position all 
my life, it is easier to be accepted in that position because it is more common 
in our community. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not to the exclusion of African American men," she said. "We have 
always been side by side. That goes back to slavery, and that notion has 
persisted through time. I think one of the things that has been bad has been 
the whole denigration of the African American male, where people say we (women) 
are in leadership positions because men have been irresponsible. What is 
ignored is that we have always been in leadership positions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How will this history and personal experience impact the jury deliberations? 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Lomax, former president of the Los Angeles Police Commission, 
speculates that in some respects, the presence of black women on the jury might 
be a plus for Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that tends to be true about black women is that they tend to 
personalize and internalize the struggle of black men in the world," said 
Lomax, who is an attorney. "They are taught from birth -- I know I was -- to be 
protective of black men because they have historically gotten the brunt of 
brutality, of racism." 
</P>
<P>
 This, she said, provides a real opening for co-defense counsel Johnnie L. 
Cochran Jr., an African American who is highly respected in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are factors, she said, that counter this feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the fact that Simpson "has not been a visible committed member of the 
black community. . . . He has gotten away from his roots and has done all he 
can do to distance himself from the black community and his project origins, 
and I don't think this plays well." 
</P>
<P>
 Another is the issue of spousal abuse and Simpson's history of violent conduct 
toward his then- wife, Nicole. "The black women on the jury are on common 
ground with all women, and they will lock into the plight of Nicole Simpson and 
they are very unlikely to be seduced by the idea that Nicole was taunting or 
provoking or engaging in provocative behavior that gave him license." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a final point to which Lomax didn't give much credence, but to which 
other African American women subscribe -- Simpson's divorce of his wife, who is 
black, and marrying the white Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Poll in September found that just 12% of African American women 
thought Simpson was guilty, 35% said he was innocent, and 53% did not know. 
Interestingly, 60% of the women said it would be easy for them to suspend 
preconceived notions if they were on the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 That last finding is important. For as the African American women listen to 
testimony, their notions may be changed, as will those of their colleagues. But 
they won't forget their life experiences, and these will be part of the mix 
they bring to the deliberations.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't expect the black women to vote as a group," attorney Lomax said. "I 
don't expect them to see the case all the same way. It depends on their own 
value structure and sense of morality." 
</P>
<P>
 This makes the outcome unpredictable. All that is certain, she and the other 
women I interviewed said, is that the African American women will be a strong 
influence on the jury. And for them, it won't be a simple matter of voting for 
a brother.

ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Watch the Birdies--Anyone with avian interests is invited to join in the 95th 
National Christmas Bird Count on Saturday from dawn until sundown. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's bird count will concentrate on South County areas, including Doheny 
Beach, the San Juan Creek estuary, Dana Point Harbor and San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Inland areas to be surveyed include Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park, Laguna 
Niguel Regional Park, the Saddleback College area, Aliso/Wood Canyons Regional 
Park and Camp Pendleton.  
</P>
<P>
 Birders will be dispatched to different areas to count different species. It 
is not necessary to be an expert birder; in fact, people of all experience 
levels are encouraged to participate. All birders should bring binoculars and 
bird identification books. 
</P>
<P>
 A section by section report of the count will be included in National 
Audubon's American Birds publication which summarizes all the bird counts 
across the country. 
</P>

EX-NIXON AIDE RECALLS THE DAY THAT ELVIS DROPPED IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Egil (Bud) Krogh was a fan of Elvis Presley and White House aide to Richard 
Nixon. Now he is the only surviving member of the Oval Office summit on Dec. 
21, 1970, when the king of rock 'n' roll met the President of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Krogh, 55, recounted that noon-hour meeting Saturday at the Richard Nixon 
Library & Birthplace, answering questions and signing copies of his book, "The 
Day Elvis Met Nixon." "(The odds are) probably a million to one that anybody 
could drive up, hand a letter in to (request to) see the President and have a 
meeting with him three hours later. It never happens," said Krogh, whose 
administrative responsibilities at the time included drug control policy 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley gave a White House guard a six-page letter written on American 
Airlines stationery, and Krogh -- moved by the missive's sincerity and 
authenticity -- met Presley in a screening interview. Presley indicated he 
wanted to help in the war on drugs, and Krogh decided Nixon and Presley, who 
was wearing a purple, crushed velvet suit with a cape, gold chains and belt, 
should meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other person present throughout the meeting was White House 
photographer Ollie Atkins. 
</P>
<P>
 "My overriding responsibility was with drug abuse, and we had a major heroin 
problem," Krogh said, adding that Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix had recently 
died from drug overdoses. "To have him show up and say he was here to help was 
a godsend." 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation between Nixon and Presley was scattered, Krogh said, straying 
from what had been discussed in the screening. But his intent was clear: He 
wanted to help the Administration "in his own way" in the war on illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 He also requested a badge from the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs -- 
which he had been denied earlier in the day by its deputy director, John 
Finlator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to do that," Nixon said to Krogh. "See that he gets one." 
</P>
<P>
 The half-hour meeting ended with Presley's two bodyguards arriving to meet the 
President. Elvis asked Nixon for keepsakes for the pair and their wives. Krogh 
and the three guests then departed to the basement for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of my days on the White House staff wouldn't fit the description of 
fun," Krogh said. "This was one of the most upbeat, positive, fun workdays I 
had."

COMMUNITY UNITY; LAGUNA NIGUEL NEIGHBORS GET TOGETHER FOR HOLIDAY PARADE AND 
FESTIVAL 
</P>

 The boys of Cub Scout Pack No. 771 didn't get much sleep Friday night as they 
decorated their float for Saturday's fifth annual Laguna Niguel Holiday Parade. 
Neither did Erik Peterson, father of one of the scouts, who helped the 50 young 
boys with their preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 But long before his 8-year-old son, Hunter, came marching down the street 
Saturday morning, Peterson was stationed along the parade route with his wife 
and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, here comes our float," the proud father shouted as the outer-space-themed 
display came into sight. 
</P>
<P>
 After the candy-throwing and waving was over, the Peterson family followed the 
float down the parade route, stopping to chat every few steps with other 
parade-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful event. You get to see a lot of people you know, like your 
neighbors," Erik Peterson said. "I don't think you can compare it to the Rose 
Parade, but as a community event, this parade is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel residents wouldn't have it any other way. They like the 
close-knit atmosphere of the parade, and see it as a chance to get to know 
their community, including their newly elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi Eddie, we voted for ya," one woman along the parade route yelled as 
Councilman Eddie Rose inched by in a convertible. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Mark Goodman and various city officials rode down the parade route and 
mingled with the crowd afterward.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun thing for the family, plus you get to put faces with names, 
instead of just seeing (city officials) on television," said Sylvia Rivera, who 
was lounging street-side with her husband and three children.  
</P>
<P>
 Even first-time viewers noticed the family-like atmosphere of the parade, 
which started when the city was incorporated on Dec. 1, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my first time here, and from what I've seen, I think it's more for 
the community to get out and get to know each other," said Mary Hopkins, a 
Laguna Niguel resident who walked to the parade with her husband and three 
children. "I've noticed a lot of people waving to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The parade, which meandered its way down a two-mile stretch of Crown Valley 
Parkway, between Nueva Vista Drive and Niguel Road, included more than 15 
Southern California high school marching bands, drill teams and giant hot-air 
balloons of Dr. Seuss characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Gymnast and Olympic gold medalist Peter Vidmar led the two-hour parade as 
grand marshal. A related two-day festival continues today from 10 a.m. to 5 
p.m. at Crown Valley Community Park, with food, arts and crafts, holiday music 
and amusements for children.

PROTEST CITES VIETNAM HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS; INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS: SOME

 Wearing red and yellow cloth headbands in mourning for lost freedoms in 
Vietnam, 300 people gathered Saturday in Little Saigon to demonstrate for those 
who have no voice in the Southeast Asian nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with United Nations International Human Rights Day, Vietnamese 
religious and political leaders led the rally along Bolsa Avenue to bring 
attention to what they said were violations of human rights in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we speak, many religious leaders and intellectuals are imprisoned for 
their commitment to freedom of religion and expression," said Quang Phan of 
West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 Shouts of "Human rights for Vietnam!" mixed with the music of Vietnamese 
singer Ai Van and the din of car alarms in parking lots of nearby businesses. 
Parents marched with toddlers along Bolsa Avenue before heading to do their 
weekly shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my sons to remember those who have died while fighting for freedom," 
said Thang Pham, who brought his wife and children to the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster Councilman Tony Lam urged demonstrators to continue the fight for 
democracy in Vietnam. Mayors Charles V. Smith of Westminster and Bruce A. 
Broadwater of Garden Grove proclaimed Saturday Vietnam Human Rights Day in 
their cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what's necessary in bringing much-needed attention to the civil 
rights abuses in Vietnam," Broadwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ky Ngo, a Republican who campaigned for Gov. Pete Wilson and former President 
George Bush, said the United States should do more to protect the rights of 70 
million citizens of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is it that we can send troops into Haiti to protect democracy there, then 
turn around and lift the trade embargo with Vietnam?" Ngo said, "Our foreign 
policy is not consistent. The Communist regime in Vietnam is violating human 
rights just like the Haitians under military dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, dozens of Buddhist monks in Vietnam were arrested while 
trying to distribute $28,000 worth of food and other items to Vietnamese who 
lost their relatives and belongings in heavy floods, according to reports from 
the United Buddhist Religious Assn. in America. The donated items were 
confiscated by the government, said Thich Nguyen Tri, a Buddhist monk 
representing the association. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the people back home suffer," he said, "the people here must hold 
hands and join in the struggle for human rights."

MAN IS SHOT BY POLICE DURING CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two police officers seriously wounded a man in a shootout early Saturday after 
an 18-mile car chase, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, identified as Tayo Valen Bond, 28, whose address was not available, 
was in satisfactory condition later Saturday in the jail ward of Western 
Medical Center Hospital-Anaheim, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers involved in the shooting were not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 A Westminster officer spotted Bond driving erratically near Garden Grove 
Boulevard and the Garden Grove Freeway in Westminster about 1:10 a.m. Saturday, 
police said. When Bond refused to pull over, two officers -- one from 
Westminster and another from the Fullerton Police Department -- pursued him, 
said Fullerton Police Sgt. Danny Becerra. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 minutes later, the man lost control of his black sports car, which 
spun out, then came to a stop in the 3700 block of West Carol Drive in 
Fullerton, police said. Bond then reportedly abandoned his car and fled on 
foot, pursued by the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was about a block later when he turned around and fired at the two 
officers," Becerra said. "Then the officers returned fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Bond suffered gunshot wounds in the lower torso and right hand and collapsed 
on the ground, Becerra said. He was being held Saturday on suspicion of 
attempted murder of a police officer and evading arrest.

MAN DIES WHEN CAR CRASHES INTO WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Placentia man died early Saturday when the car he was driving slammed 
head-on into a retaining wall at Frontera Street near the Riverside Freeway, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was identified by coroner's investigators as Mark Anton Veenhuyzen, 
43. Anaheim paramedics, who reached the scene about 3:45 a.m., said Veenhuyzen 
had died on impact. He was alone in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial investigation showed that he had been speeding north on Rio Vista 
Avenue, ran a stop sign at Frontera Street and crashed into the wall on the 
north side of the road, police said.

CHAMBER BLAST VICTIMS STILL HOSPITALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three people struck by flying debris when a pressurized oxygen chamber 
exploded at a medical clinic remained hospitalized Saturday, one of them in 
critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Jayantilal Patel, 50, of Rancho Santa Margarita was listed in critical 
condition at Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center, a spokeswoman said.Patel 
suffered a depressed skull fracture when he was hit by debris in the explosion 
Friday at the Health Restoration Center, in the 22000 block of Aspan Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladys Casey, 65, of Chino Hills was in serious but stable condition at the 
hospital Saturday, and Moti Govindgie, 63, of San Jose, was in stable 
condition, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other people, who were sitting in the hyperbaric chamber when the 
explosion occurred, were treated and released from the hospital. All three of 
those hospitalized were in a nearby waiting area at the time of the explosion 
and were struck by debris, including chunks of the heavy plastic chamber door. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have not determined the cause of the explosion.

MOVIES; THE WARTS HAVE IT; REMEMBER THE DAYS WHEN HOLLYWOOD GAVE US THOSE 
LOVING PORTRAYALS OF OUR HEROES? GOOD, BECAUSE THOSE DAYS ARE HISTORY. GOT A 
PROBLEM WITH THAT?

<P>
 Time was, if you were seeking some uplift, perhaps a smidgen of real-life 
inspiration, Hollywood could help you out with an ennobling film biography: 
</P>
<P>
 Selfless scientist Louis Pasteur finds the cure for anthrax, makes milk safe 
for the world and still finds the time to rescue his infant during childbirth! 
Swing king Glenn Miller gets the world's feet a-tapping! Courageous Charles 
Lindbergh braves the elements and befriends a housefly while crossing the 
Atlantic! 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, however, bio-pics have portrayed less heroic lives: Pampered 
harridan Joan Crawford traumatizes her kids by revealing her hang-up about wire 
hangers! Psychotic boxer Jake LaMotta beats his wife and winds up a pathetic 
mound of flop sweat! Hopeless case Sid Vicious -- well, Sid's just flat-out 
beyond hope. 
</P>
<P>
 One could argue that they don't make role models the way they used to, but the 
truth is, they don't make bio-pics the way they used to. 
</P>
<P>
 This season could be seen as the Fall of the Legends, as four recent or 
upcoming films explore the darker, more personal aspects of heretofore 
celebrated historical heroes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ron Shelton's "Cobb" takes filmgoers on a dark, disturbing journey through 
the last few months of the life of baseball immortal Ty Cobb, as seen through 
the eyes of his biographer, who witnesses Cobb's propensity for violence, 
racism and misogyny. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alan Rudolph's "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle" bathes writer Dorothy 
Parker in a haze of booze, botched affairs and suicide attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Tom & Viv" examines the tormented relationship between poet T. S. Eliot and 
his wife, Vivienne Haigh-Wood, depicting him as a sop who couldn't cope with 
her mood swings and dealt with her in a most unfeeling manner. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Immortal Beloved" rummages through Beethoven's little black book, offering 
a speculative history of the composer's possible mistresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traditional Hollywood bio was a predetermined entertainment with the 
facts grafted on afterward," says writer-director Rudolph. "Whether it was 
about an opera singer or an astronaut, it was the same old story. Those same 
films today are looking a lot more closely at their subjects, like the media in 
general." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Larry Karaszewski, co-screenwriter of "Ed Wood" and the upcoming "Larry 
Flynt," a portrait of the iconoclastic pornographer that Oliver Stone will 
produce for Columbia: "Any genre goes through an evolution. First there were 
the classical bio-pics, and now we're deconstructing them. People don't buy 
that (naivete) nowadays. You have to show what goes on behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hollywood is largely formula stuff, and the way around that is to find some 
weird true story or person to make a movie about, a story you could never make 
as a fictional work. It helps you to break the rules -- the writer can say, 
'Hey, it really happened.' A guy who was a terrible movie-maker who was also a 
transvestite? A pornographer who ran for president? You'd be thrown out of the 
(studio executive's) office if you just made that up." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Gibson agrees. "Real-life scenarios are so much more inventive than 
anything from the fiction writer's pen," says Gibson, who directed the Tina 
Turner bio "What's Love Got to Do With It" and "The Josephine Baker Story" and 
is producing an upcoming Frida Kahlo film for HBO. "Audiences have become too 
sophisticated. They understand and want to see the shadow sides, the dark 
sides." 
</P>
<P>
 But can sophisticated be a euphemism for nosy ? With the proliferation of 
tabloid-style journalism, morning talk shows designed largely to get former 
lovers and friends screaming at one another and quickie TV movies torn, however 
messily, from current headlines, has our society just become addicted to dirt? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are more nosy nowadays," says Miranda Richardson, who stars in 
"Tom & Viv" and first made her mark as Ruth Ellis, the last woman to be 
executed in Britain, in the 1985 docudrama "Dance With a Stranger." "People 
would like to hear the truth sometimes, or as near as you can get. Looking into 
this privileged territory helps make the story accessible to more people." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Tommy Lee Jones, star of "Cobb": "We have grown up and we have gotten 
nosy, both. It's easier to be nosy these days. That's why public figures are no 
longer required by the leadership and the press to be saints. We now 
acknowledge people can be both heroic and . . ." He searches for the right 
word. Human? 
</P>
<P>
 "Or worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Film historian Leonard Maltin calls "Cobb" a first: "I can't think of another 
bio-pic that covers such a reprehensible character with no redeeming qualities 
whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Maltin, of course, recalls Martin Scorsese's 1980 epic "Raging Bull," the 
damning saga of boxer LaMotta, one of the bellwethers of the current bio-pic 
trend and widely considered the finest film of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an extraordinary film by any standard," Maltin says. "It's a 
warts-and-all portrait that is intriguing in that regard, a turning point in 
the film biography." 
</P>
<P>
 Before "Raging Bull," Bob Fosse's 1974 film "Lenny" examined, darkly, the life 
of controversial comic Lenny Bruce. And Robert Altman's bicentennial satire 
"Buffalo Bill and the Indians" excoriated the Wild West legend of Bill Cody. It 
included a memorable line that could justify many a bio-pic: "Truth is whatever 
gets the most applause." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton had "Raging Bull" in particular looming large in his mind while 
working on "Cobb" but says that his film is intended to ask larger questions 
pertaining to the nature of celebrity in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my version of (biographer Al) Stump's version of Cobb's version of 
himself," says Shelton, who also brought the story of Louisiana Gov. Earl Long 
and his lover, Blaze Starr, to the big screen in "Blaze" (1989). That film, 
like "Cobb," meditated on the role of the media in bringing public figures' 
private lives into public purview. 
</P>
<P>
 "What should we know about celebrities? My concern is not that we know too 
much but that we get confused about what we know, that we pretend that because 
this man is a very good right fielder or point guard that he is therefore a 
role model," Shelton says. "But that man is, whether he wants it or not, a role 
model, by nature of his working in the public eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite the wealth of public knowledge about Cobb's epic 
unpleasantness, Shelton is sensitive to the idea that he has publicly taken 
down a legend and that some will find his film off-putting: 
</P>
<P>
 "Cobb's grandchildren are not gonna like this movie, or his children. I had to 
make peace with the fact that the family probably wouldn't approve of the 
movie. But he's been dead for 34 years, and for most of the previous 20 years 
he had little contact with his family. So I don't think I'm doing damage to the 
family. If anything, we're trying to come to terms with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't like a movie about my grandfather. And so be it. As a storyteller, 
I have to stay true to what is the heart and the essence of these people. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the poetic license is available to you, and yet you have to be rigorous 
(in balanced research) at the same time. It's a tough subject. Obviously we've 
come a long way from 'The Glenn Miller Story.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton poses the question bedeviling every maker of a film biography: "If 
you're going to write about someone in the spotlight, does that mean you are in 
the spotlight too? If you accept that responsibility, are you willing to expose 
yourself the way you're exposing your subject? I suggest the answer is 'no' in 
almost every case." 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of "Cobb" is an issue that filmmakers always face: What do you leave 
in a biography? What do you omit? More to the point, when does artistic license 
become flat-out misrepresentation of a human being? 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger is, when these films are good, you do believe them," Maltin says. 
"You don't get a study guide when you walk into the theater. Moviegoers don't 
have to take an entrance exam to see a movie. For many in the audience, this 
will be their only exposure to a subject, and when something says it's a 
biography, when it says it's based on a true story, that's a certain cross to 
bear. You leave yourself open for attack if you take liberties with the facts. 
It's tricky -- filmmakers should take responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 This autumn saw "Ed Wood," the misadventures of America's most inept 
movie-maker, and "Quiz Show," based on the memoirs of Richard Goodwin, which 
revealed the fast-and-loose attitudes of some executives in television's early 
days. Both came under attack, the former for its depiction of Bela Lugosi as a 
profane lech and the latter for its misrepresentation of major players in the 
game-show scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the theme of your film is that you shouldn't lie for entertainment's 
sake, it leaves you a little susceptible to criticism," "Ed Wood" 
co-screenwriter Karaszewski deadpans about "Quiz Show." 
</P>
<P>
 His film's depiction of Lugosi was referenced, he adds, though he says: "We 
later eventually realized that the source we were using was a little crazy. So 
instead of the story being about Bela going off, it was just the source going 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Shelton: "One has to make distinctions. We're in an age of television and 
tabloids, and newspapers are all kind of going mad. I don't think the rules are 
very clear, and I think they need to be clarified. We're asking people to think 
and make choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton's star disagrees. "Bottom line is, you're making a movie; movies are, 
at their best, works of art," Jones says. "They have no responsibility to 
anything, other than themselves, so it's OK to exaggerate or change history to 
fit your story. And it's even OK to claim that it's history. And that's the 
approach I take." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones recalls his Emmy-winning turn as Gary Gilmore in "The Executioner's 
Song" (1982): "The screenplay was by Norman Mailer, based on his book, which 
was supposed to be based on reality. There was somewhat of a difference between 
the real Gary Gilmore and the one in his book. There was a difference between 
the one in the book and the one in the teleplay. The idea was not to reproduce 
Gary; it was to play a Gary Gilmore. It's impossible to come up with a rule of 
thumb when playing a character from real life." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, describing "Tom & Viv" as "faction" and "an imaginative 
reconstruction of events," acknowledges that the film fudges the truth on a key 
plot element that casts Eliot in a more critical light. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that people like to be challenged, and make up their own minds about 
the characters," she says. "Being sympathetic toward those characters doesn't 
mean glossing over slightly less noble points." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph likewise acknowledges that "Mrs. Parker," starring Jennifer Jason 
Leigh as the writer, is hardly constructed like the ordinary bio-pic and that 
he takes some artistic liberties, but he insists that they are necessary to 
evoke the essence of his characters' lives in a two-hour movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's presumptuous to think you can gather a whole person's life and put it in 
a two-hour movie," says Rudolph, who adds that his film "would hold up to 
factual scrutiny. But we're finding that the most picky audiences are people 
with a smattering of knowledge or (who) have gone with the myths surrounding 
her. They've taken a little information and determined that what they know is 
more important than what we know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the scenes play out uneventfully. I constructed the film that way on 
purpose. I didn't want to do the headlines of Dorothy Parker's life or compile 
a list of her greatest hits or quips. When you do that, you get brief scenes 
that don't go beneath the surface. Truth doesn't come out in the content of a 
life. I'm interested in the context, not just the content." 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, Rudolph created a scene he acknowledges is fictional in which Parker 
and Robert Benchley (Campbell Scott) emotionally discuss their tormented 
platonic relationship. "Yet people say that scene is one of the most realistic 
scenes in the film," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph doesn't think he has done Parker's memory a disservice by revealing 
her inner torment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a loving portrait of survival," he says. "I call her a 
'self-destructive survivor.' You have to respect her enigmatic qualities 
instead of expose or simplify them for audiences." 
</P>
<P>
 Those enigmatic qualities -- the essential information that puts an audience 
in communion with the film's subject matter -- are often what is missing in 
film biographies, Maltin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In doing biographies of creative, artistic people, it's tough to get inside a 
person, to dramatize the creative spirit, the muse that causes them to produce 
great works of art," Maltin says. " 'Bird' (Clint Eastwood's 1988 Charlie 
Parker bio-pic) is a film done by a genuine jazz lover, yet it gives no 
indication of how much music really meant to Charlie. You would never know by 
seeing it how music was a driving force in his life and what an influence he 
had on others. It was very disappointing." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Chaplin' never found what its hook was, what its main question was," 
filmmaker Gibson says. "It's not enough to say he was a fascinating, successful 
man. You have to ask: 'What is it about him that interests me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For Gibson, that muse that Maltin finds elusive in film biographies can lie in 
the dark side of their subjects' personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to look at what it was about him that made him compulsive and 
ambitious and wanting to transcend the ordinary," he says. "You have to 
establish a hole in a person's spirit, some damage from which that talent 
springs. They need that special motor, a fuel that pushes them to greatness, 
that pushes them in doing ordinary, everyday work to the extent that they 
become extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to approach film biographies in a fashion that you're doing more 
than a bio-pic. It's not a National Geographic tour through someone's life, 
like she's the Grand Canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's Love Got to Do With It" is a special case because it painted a 
painfully unflattering portrait of someone still alive who did not cooperate 
with the production: Ike Turner is routinely shown abusing both drugs and Tina. 
Gibson says despite Ike's protestations after the film's release, there was 
never any legal trouble, largely because "there was an infinite number of 
witnesses, from taxi drivers to choreographers -- I'd run into them after the 
movie was out and they'd say, 'Oh, yes, I saw him when he used to knock her 
about.' In Ike's case, if anything, we strayed on the generous side." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that may have been due to an unexpected visit from Ike during location 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was setting up a scene and turned around, and all the crew had 
disappeared," Gibson recalls. "I half-expected fireworks, but he was very mild, 
very sweet. He went over to his car and opened the trunk and pulled out photos 
and signed autographs for the whole cast and crew. We were influenced by that 
encounter with him in some scenes in the film." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of the upcoming "Larry Flynt" movie, one might expect a little 
protestation from the Hustler magazine publisher -- the film's basic gist will 
be, "Sure, he's a pig, but he has every right to say what he thinks," 
screenwriter Karaszewski says -- but, in fact, he has decided to cooperate with 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the major points of the film is the court case with Jerry Falwell, 
which Flynt won when the court decided you could parody a public figure," 
Karaszewski says of the 1988 ruling in which the U.S. Supreme Court said that 
Flynt and his magazine Hustler did not violate libel laws in a vicious cartoon 
of Falwell. "Because Flynt won that case, it gives us free rein to do what we 
want with him."  
</P>
<P>
 With "Ed Wood" and "Larry Flynt," Karaszewski and writing partner Scott 
Alexander may be redefining the bio-pic in another fashion altogether, creating 
playful, postmodern pastiches that exalt the extraordinarily mediocre. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do are anti-bio-pics, what people in a traditionally just society 
would not ordinarily get," Karaszewski says. "They're not the Great Man 
bio-pic, which is two hours of being noble, or the Underbelly of the Great Man, 
which is, 'Here's what he was like in real life.' With our characters, people 
hate them already, and we have to figure out how to present our case for them." 
</P>
<P>
 But until the campy bio-pic becomes the vogue, the muckraking film bio seems 
to be the form of choice. And Shelton, for one, has long pondered what is 
ethical and just when turning the lives of real human beings into slick 
entertainments. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is discretion?" he muses. "If a man is a womanizer, is that an issue? 
It's only an issue if he's Gary Hart and dares you to prove he's not. If a man 
is a wife-beater, is that an issue? Of course: It's criminal, felonious 
behavior. If a man is homosexual -- I don't understand 'outing' people. If a 
man chooses to stay in the closet, that's his responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we could come up with a simple rule that would apply in every case. 
The more we talk, the more difficult it is to come up with a set of rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the same actors who bring the lives of others to the public 
often cling tenaciously to their own private lives. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: Is there a bio-pic in the story of a Texas actor who entered 
manhood as a rough-and-tumble football player, who appeared in four stage plays 
before seeing one, who became much celebrated for his on-screen versatility as 
well as his prickly personality and eventually won an Oscar? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, there isn't," Jones says with a grin. "The subject matter would sue you 
naked." 
</P>
<P>
 For Shelton, his film bios must have intellectual and historical honesty, and 
it certainly doesn't hurt if they're entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why does 'Raging Bull' stick in people's minds?" he asks. "Because it's 
well-made and we feel something of the essence of this man, LaMotta, captured. 
Artistic license (was) taken everywhere, and I don't care, because Scorsese 
captured something about human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one lives their lives in three neat acts. My job is to shape it. That's a 
matter of trust. Either I'm talented and honorable at it, or I'm not. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no rules, I guess, no rules. It's all discretion, and we're not 
living in an age of discretion."

CRA PROJECT MOVES FORWARD; REDEVELOPMENT: THE CITY COUNCIL HAS APPROVED A 
150-ACRE EXPANSION OF THE CRENSHAW REDEVELOPMENT AREA, WHICH PROPONENTS SAY 
WILL GIVE RIOT-TORN AREAS AN ECONOMIC BOOST. CRITICS CALL IT A LAND GRAB.

<P>
 With the Los Angeles City Council's recent blessing, the Community 
Redevelopment Agency will finally move forward with a 150-acre expansion of the 
Crenshaw Redevelopment Area -- a project that supporters say is crucial, but 
critics call a land grab.  
</P>
<P>
 The council's approval of the expansion, which was given Tuesday, means that 
about $75 million will be funneled into the expanded redevelopment area for a 
variety of projects. According to CRA officials, these projects include a loan 
program to improve the facades of businesses, rehabilitation of commercial 
properties and design plans for improving sites such as Santa Barbara Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds, agency officials say, will include $24.5 million in tax revenues, 
with the balance coming from investment revenues, the city of Los Angeles, the 
federal government and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the council's action enables the CRA to increase the boundaries 
of the redevelopment area to include Leimert Park Village, Santa Barbara Plaza 
and areas along Crenshaw Boulevard. The proposal arose after the city's 1992 
riots leveled many neighborhoods, including some properties surrounding the 
nearby Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials praised the expansion as a way to accelerate rebuilding in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means we can move forward with the revitalization of the community," 
said the area's councilman, Mark Ridley-Thomas, a strong supporter of the 
expansion since the riots. "It means economic empowerment. It means the 
business owners will get more help. Ultimately, everyone in the area stands to 
benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of the Crenshaw community said the approved expansion is a long 
overdue move by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been looking for this for 20 years," said Jimmy Dodson, a business 
owner and 18-year resident of Leimert Park. "For too long, all the CRA money 
was going to Bunker Hill, and meanwhile, our district was neglected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need the CRA to provide the funds, the expertise and the political forces 
to make (redevelopment) work. It's too much for individual people in the 
community to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics, including some residents and merchants in the affected areas, 
described the expanded redevelopment project as a land grab by the CRA, which 
will have the power of eminent domain to condemn commercial properties that 
block redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the critics question the CRA's promise not to disrupt residential 
neighborhoods. Ronald Murphy said : "I am thoroughly disappointed. . . . I am 
not against development, but I am against the CRA coming in to take people's 
homes that they have worked for all their lives."  
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, a retired bus driver, also disputed the city's contention that the 
expanded project area was needed to restore areas blighted by the riots. (CRA 
officials have said 19 properties were damaged in the riots, but critics note 
that is only a fraction of the area's lots.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Years ago, I used to drive . . . Crenshaw Boulevard," Murphy said. "You have 
buildings that have been vacant down there for years. . . . So this didn't just 
happen during the civil unrest." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Moore, owner of Moore's Hair Design in Santa Barbara Plaza, was less 
than enthusiastic about the expansion for another reason. Moore, president of 
the plaza's merchant association, has been working with the CRA for several 
years and has yet to agree with the agency about the plaza's fate. The 
expansion turns the plaza, long a study area, into an official part of the 
project area.  
</P>
<P>
 "I say, show me something that's worked first," Moore said. "That mall (the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza) still isn't doing anything. All the merchants 
that were displaced by the development, where are they? I still don't know. 
Some of us have been here 20 years and better and are over 60. . . . It would 
be very hard for us to relocate."

ECHO PARK HAS AN INCLINATION TO BE HAZARDOUS; BAD BREAKS OR CARELESS PARKING

 Just as Armando Sanchez began to prepare dinner for his family one Tuesday 
last month, an uninvited visitor arrived without so much as ringing the 
doorbell. 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-foot moving van crashed through the living room wall, narrowly missing 
Sanchez, his wife and their 5-year-old daughter. The family suffered only a few 
scrapes and bruises, but their home was demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it -- there was a truck in my living room," 
Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hills and valleys of Echo Park, where the Sanchez's Avon Street home 
is nestled at the bottom of a 25-degree incline, such an accident is not 
uncommon. Runaway vehicles careen down the area's steep streets at least once a 
month, destroying thousands of dollars' worth of property, said John Wilson, a 
Central Traffic Division auditor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Wilson recalled, a cement truck bulldozed several homes as it 
barreled through the intersection of Earl Street and Glendale Boulevard before 
landing in a swimming pool. One resident was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little the city can do about such accidents, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many runaway vehicle accidents would be avoided if drivers maintained the 
brakes on their cars, remembered to apply emergency brakes, and were careful to 
cramp their wheels to the curb when they park, or parked in driveways, Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the brakes on the moving van, fully loaded with furniture, may have 
failed. No charges have been filed, but the incident remains under 
investigation. The driver, Daniel Cortez, 31, was not seriously injured, 
according to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, on the other hand, was knocked from its foundation. The right side, 
where the living room was, has collapsed. The attic ceiling rests atop the 
living room couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo and Maria Canepa, Armando Sanchez's in-laws, own the house. Contractors 
have informed them that the building must be demolished and will cost at least 
$120,000 to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Canepas, who live next door to the Sanchez family, said they are 
frustrated that the city does not provide better protection for their houses, 
which face Avon Park Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 At least twice before, cars coming down the hill have just missed their 
houses. Last year, a car rolled into the Canepas' driveway, coming to a halt 
just before plowing through their gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see a retaining wall built in front of the house," said Maria 
Canepa, who rushed up the hill a few days after the latest accident and berated 
a driver she saw parking without turning the wheels into the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Central Traffic Division officers, the city might take some type 
of preventive measure, such as creating a no-parking zone, if enough complaints 
are filed. But one official said it would take "an act of God" to get the city 
to pay for a retaining wall, which could cost up to $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like in an earthquake; the city is not going to pay for the damage 
done to houses built on stilts," said Arvin Turner, an officer in the LAPD'S 
traffic control division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canepas don't know if they can afford to rebuild. Although they have 
insurance, they are unsure whether it will cover the cost of replacing the 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 When she talks about the accident, Maria Canepa begins to get misty-eyed. The 
house was left to the couple in 1983 in the will of the former owner, an 
elderly neighbor whom Canepa used to look after. The neighbor knew they would 
take good care of the house, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't open our shades," Leo Canepa said, "so we don't have to look at it."

CITIZENSHIP CLASSES SWELL AT L.A. UNIFIED ADULT SCHOOLS; IMMIGRATION: CONCERNS 
OVER THE IMPACT OF PROP. 187 PROMPT GROWING NUMBERS TO ENTER THE INSTRUCTIONAL 
PROGRAM TO BECOME LEGAL U.S. RESIDENTS. 
</P>

 Arturo Gomez Mendoza arrived in the United States 21 years ago from Michoacan, 
Mexico, but he never thought about enrolling in citizenship classes until what 
he calls "the repression" began earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the talk about immigrants before these elections was horrible," said 
Mendoza, a butcher at a meat-packing plant in Vernon. "Some people want to 
force us (Latinos) into a corral and control us. The only way we can feel safe 
is by becoming citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 After voters approved Proposition 187 last month, Mendoza, 48, promptly 
enrolled at Huntington Park Adult School. The initiative, which is being 
challenged in the courts, would deny education and basic social services to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza is not alone in his response to the measure's passage. According to 
Los Angeles Unified School District officials, enrollment in citizenship 
classes surged after the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're witnessing a clear reaction to recent political events," said Domingo 
Rodriguez, coordinator of the district's adult citizenship programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 26 adult schools reported increases in citizenship class 
enrollment. Four reported significant increases, six had moderate increases and 
six reported slight increases immediately after the Nov. 8 election. The other 
adult schools in the district have experienced steady class growth throughout 
the year, Rodriguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult schools having the largest increases are Huntington Park, Roosevelt 
in Boyle Heights, Banning in Wilmington, and Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Exact figures for the increases at individual schools were not yet available, 
Dominguez said. But at the largest of the district's adult schools -- 
Huntington Park, with 1,300 students -- school administrator Rudy Marquez said 
enrollment increased by an unprecedented 150 students after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anti-immigrant attitudes are pushing people to feel their community is being 
threatened," said Rick Erhard, a citizenship teacher and adviser at Huntington 
Park. "And they're reacting very rationally by becoming citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the citizenship classes already was high. Following a 
district-sponsored six-month outreach program that began in late 1993, a record 
8,300 resident adults enrolled in the classes from January to June, 1994, the 
end of the academic year. Citizenship class enrollment for the entire district 
averaged only 300 students a year from 1990 to 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor fueling the enrollment increase is that many residents are just 
becoming eligible to seek citizenship. In 1986 and the following two years, 3 
million immigrants applied for legal permanent residency through the 
legalization program of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those who obtained permanent residency started to become eligible for 
citizenship in late 1993 because legal immigrants must have at least five years 
of permanent residency in the U.S. before they are eligible to naturalize.  
</P>
<P>
 According to 1990 U.S. Census figures, about 1.6 million of the nation's 
amnesty applicants -- 54% -- are Californians. The city of Los Angeles alone 
has more than 410,000 amnesty applicants, most of them Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically, (Gov.) Pete Wilson (a major proponent of Proposition 187) helped 
galvanize the Latino community in a way he never dreamed of," said Rudy 
Marquez, who coordinates the citizenship programs at Huntington Park. "With 
187, he made people who are just now becoming eligible to become citizens angry 
enough to go and do it. In two years, when these people start voting, he and 
the backers of this thing are going to regret it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent report by the Los Angeles-based National Assn. of Latino 
Elected Officials, Southern California could gain more than 2 million new 
voters this decade, most of them Latino immigrants. And once Latino immigrants 
naturalize, their voter registration rate is 81%, a higher figure than that of 
the general U.S. voting population, which is 70%, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes good sense to citizenship student Mendoza, a man partial to 
the proverbs of his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 " Donde comes y trabajas de ahi eres ," he said in Spanish following a 
Huntington Park class discussing the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where you eat and work, that's where you're from," Mendoza translated. "The 
Latinos have known that for a long time, only now, we're doing something about 
it."

 Your piece on Jim Wallis ("Faith, Hope and Activism," by Howard Kohn, Nov. 6) 
was uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 All my life I have lived in white suburban neighborhoods while my child 
attended predominantly white schools. Then I became starkly aware of the 
separateness of white America and black America. I recently moved to a 
predominantly African American neighborhood. My child now goes to a school 
where there is a mixture of races. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wallis and the Sojourners light the way for those of us who have heard the 
wake-up call. We need to hear more about people like him, who are helping 
supply the answers to the problems of our times.

 It was wonderful to read a story about a true man of God who not only talks 
the talk of Jesus Christ but walks the walk as well. I am so tired of 
Christians being stereotyped as a bunch of Bible-thumping fanatics. It was 
inspiring to read about a person who practices what he preaches.

 I graduated from an evangelical Christian college where "progressive 
evangelicals" of Jim Wallis' ilk captivated student audiences weekly. I've 
learned that it is very tempting to assume the progressive evangelical's scorn 
for mainstream evangelical culture and conservative politics. 
</P>
<P>
 However, progressive evangelicalism has two fundamental flaws. First, it is a 
subtle type of spiritual pride ("no, we are not tacky and simplistic Christians 
like those conservatives, thank you very much") and, second, it ignores the 
complete message of the Bible. Jesus did not go around preaching a vague type 
of humanitarianism, but insisted on repentance and a radical holiness available 
only through Him. Unfortunately, Wallis and others like him see the systemic 
sins of society clearly enough, but they neglect to communicate Jesus' frequent 
commands for personal repentance from all sins (not just the "Reagan-Bush" 
ones).

 When American Christians employ Wallis' agenda, creating a Christian

will truly see the kingdom of heaven on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Christian Democrat, I now propose a radical solution to the national 
debt. In the Bible, a "jubilee" periodically canceled all debts. Let's declare 
the year 2001 an American Jubilee, and erase the $4-trillion debt.

DANCE; F-O-L-K IS A FOUR-LETTER WORD; CULTURAL BIASES DIE HARD, BUT IF 
CHOREOGRAPHER FRANK GUEVARA CAN HELP IT, THEY MAY SOON PASS. HIS TROUPE DANCE 
THEATRE OF EAST L.A. PERFORMS HYPERATHLETIC AND THOROUGHLY MODERN WORKS.

<P>
 For Frank Guevara, there's more to life than Mexican hat dances. 
</P>
<P>
 The modern dancer-choreographer doesn't believe that all Latinos should have 
to stick to folk forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There're a lot of people who don't accept modern work, who think that ethnic 
dance is what you should be doing," the East Los Angeles native says over lunch 
in a small Little Tokyo eatery. 
</P>
<P>
 "They still see that as being the only dance for Latino people. We're going 
into 1995, and people still believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural prejudices, it seems, die hard -- especially when they come from 
close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my family and people, and if they have money, they'd rather go see a 
folklorico group than modern work," says the outspoken Guevara, who has leveled 
similar charges of anti-modern bias at such key local festivals as Dance 
Kaleidoscope, an annual event that has twice rejected his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Guevara isn't letting that attitude go unchallenged. His company, Dance 
Theatre of East L.A., which performs at Nosotros Theatre in Hollywood from 
Thursday through Sunday, features work that is a far cry from folklorico. The 
bill, which is closed to viewers under 18 years of age, includes several 
premieres, as well as two Guevara works that have been significantly recast. 
</P>
<P>
 A terpsichorean Evel Knievel, Guevara is best known for the kind of overtly 
athletic, task-oriented dances of the increasingly popular Southern California 
style known as hyperdance. And like his fellow Los Angeles-based ninja 
daredevil choreographers Mehmet Sander, Joel Christensen and Jacques Heim, 
among others, Guevara pushes his performers to their limits with works that 
often involve potential physical peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Within that rubric, of course, there's room for interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people say hyperdance is the same old thing in the same old way," 
Guevara says. "That's like saying, 'Oh, it's another ballet' or 'It's another 
modern piece.' People in the audience limit themselves just by saying that. 
It's a style and a foundation, and you do your own thing with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Guevara doesn't only do hyperdance. He also makes more conventional 
modern works that entail persona, if not plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since my work is dance-theater rooted, if you don't have a passion, you can't 
do it," he says. "Obviously technique is there, but my work is rooted in 
emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 "The more athletic or hyperdance dances have more focus, and the more 
theatrical ones are more emotional. Sometimes the (two styles) come together, 
sometimes they don't, but I treat both of them equally." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nosotros program will include two Guevara premieres. "Tres" (Three) is a 
hyperdance piece that pits two women against one man, in a contest involving 
concrete blocks and two-by-fours. "Amarrado" (Tied) is a solo performed by 
Bogar Martinez that Guevara says is "about a person not being able to let go." 
</P>
<P>
 The third premiere is a duet commissioned from L.A.-based tango artists 
Alberto Toledano and Loreen Arbus. "Reto" (Challenge), performed by Guevara and 
Martinez, is "a technically hard piece (featuring a duet between) two Latin men 
without a touch of femininity," Guevara says. Also on the bill will be 
previously seen Guevara works, including one of the choreographer's trademark 
solos, performed by Domino Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a varied, though representative, sampling of the repertory of an artist 
coming into his own. But it was no small feat for Guevara to have made it this 
far. 
</P>
<P>
 The choreographer, 29, was born and raised in East Los Angeles and started 
dancing when he was in elementary school. A few years later, he found his way 
to the multiuse Eastside arts venue Plaza de la Raza, where he began to take 
classes in modern dance, ballet, acting and other disciplines. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at 17, Guevara landed his first TV gig, as a featured dancer on a music 
video showcase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quick money and exciting," he says. "So I did a lot of commercial work 
for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 But the fast buck was no substitute for the creative fulfillment of the dance 
studio, and so, in 1989, Guevara launched the East L.A. Choreographers 
showcase. The mini-festival was housed in a former Eastside church known as 
Casa de las Mexicanas (House of the Mexicans); its purpose was to display 
Guevara's own dance as well as that of other Eastside artists. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a way to help fill the gap in presenting opportunities for emerging 
Latino dance-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to present my work, and the way (to do that) was to do my own 
(producing)," he says. "We sold out, and The Times reviewed it. It was a 
positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 His colleagues were grateful for the chance to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The choreographers were happy that it was available," Guevara says. "There 
weren't venues at all for them. I don't think they lacked talent. I think they 
lacked opportunities to develop. I lacked opportunities too, but I continued 
anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara kept the showcases going for three years, during which time he also 
began to phase out his commercial work -- and he looks back on the venture as 
being key to his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful that I did it because I learned," he says. "If I hadn't done 
that, I wouldn't be sitting here right now. Out of all of us, I think I 
benefited the most, because I continued polishing my craft." 
</P>
<P>
 From the showcase, the next move was for Guevara to found his own company -- 
which he did in 1992. Currently, Dance Theatre of East L.A. consists of 
Martinez, Fernandez, Melissa Arambasich, Ed Rocha and Guevara himself, and it 
is with this troupe that the choreographer has truly begun to make a name for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 His style mixes hyperdance with other, more theatrical techniques and 
typically features Guevara's trademark macho personas. In "Cursum Perficio" 
(the work to be performed by Fernandez on the Nosotros bill), for example, a 
headstrong street person interacts in physically demanding ways with a tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara has been influenced by fellow hyperdancer Mehmet Sander. Both 
choreographers, for instance, make in-your-face dances that seem intent upon 
testing the body's limits. But Guevara -- who transformed his own physique from 
the 145-pound dancer's body he had four years ago into his currently overtly 
beefy 175-pound form -- is less interested in purely formal concerns and more 
enamored of scene and story than most other hyperdance artists. 
</P>
<P>
 The stylistic blend has proved popular, and Dance Theatre of East L.A. is 
beginning to hit its stride in other ways as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm finally comfortable with having good dancers -- and by 'good dancers' I 
mean they are technically good and have artistic drive and a focus in life," 
Guevara says. "In the past, you hired dancers just because it was a body and he 
or she could do the movement. But I'm comfortable with my dancers now because I 
know they're serious and they can handle the work." 
</P>
<P>
 And that comfort is essential, as Guevara begins to transfer works he 
originally created for himself onto other dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the pieces are dear to me, I have to let other people test them," 
he says. "It's harder to step back if it's a piece I did myself, but I've 
managed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in spite of his progress, Guevara is not one to avoid confrontation. He 
has, in fact, clashed with prominent Latino choreographers such as Rudy Perez 
and Francisco Martinez over the issue of racial bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, for one, disputes Guevara's contention that there is any resistance to 
Latinos making modern dance. "If there wasn't a bias against me in 1951, why 
should there be a bias today?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge, he says, is a smoke screen for what he sees as Guevara's failure 
to develop his craft: "Using the Latino handle is deceptive. People don't like 
his work because it's too self-indulgent, not because he's Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's promise there, but you need only look at how (Guevara's) work 
compares to people like Jose Limon," Perez says, citing the influential modern 
dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Such disagreements notwithstanding, Guevara still hopes to bring other members 
of his own community into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would mean a lot to me if I could get key Latino leaders in the arts and 
politics to come see my shows," he says. "Over the years, I've been supported 
on and off by people looking to make a nice gesture, but it would be nice if 
they would actually come see my work and give me feedback." 
</P>
<P>
 It could have a ripple effect, he believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People follow the role models, and if people see that support, a lot will 
follow," Guevara says. "We're working hard to get people like Gloria Molina and 
Carmen Zapata out here." 
</P>
<P>
 And should the Latino honchos turn up as Guevara hopes, they will find a man 
and his troupe who could serve as role models -- particularly for other 
emerging non-traditional artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The company is good where it's at, and I know we'll grow together," Guevara 
says. "Right now, I want to keep it small and tight. The time will come when I 
have the resources to have more people. I'm not in a hurry." Vital Stats

 There is always something in the Los Angeles Times Magazine that interests me, 
but the Nov. 6 issue was a particular joy, beginning with "Duet With a Diva," 
by James McCourt.No singer has given me as much pleasure as Victoria de los 
Angeles in the many recitals I attended here and in New York during the '60s 
and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the article about Jim Wallis was fascinating. To read about a man who 
practices justice and tolerance was especially wonderful after the recent 
dismal political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 And I thoroughly enjoyed the beautiful garden in Venice as described by Susan 
Heeger. It ought to be a good spot in which to read your magazine.

TALK! IN THE NAME OF LOVE; MOTOWN FOUNDER BERRY GORDY BREAKS HIS LONG SILENCE 
WITH A NEW AUTOBIOGRAPHY, HOPING TO DISPEL THOSE STORIES ABOUT THE MOB AND 
DISGRUNTLED ARTISTS. AS THE TITLE SAYS, ALL HE WANTS IS 'TO BE LOVED.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Shortly after sending shock waves through the music industry with his 1988 
decision to sell Motown Records to MCA Inc., company founder Berry Gordy 
finally decided to turn the story of his life into a book. One by one, writers 
came with notebooks, tape recorders and hopes of becoming the "with" -- as in 
"An Autobiography by Berry Gordy with (fill in hopeful writer's name here)." 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite like being Gladys Knight, maybe, but right up there with becoming a 
Pip. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of creating a new writing star, however, Gordy had an assortment of 
would-be biographers tearing out their collective hair for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had professionals come in who were telling me how to write the book," Gordy 
said in a recent interview at his lofty Bel-Air estate, his voice raspy as a 
result of a nine-city book tour ending that day with his return to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is called "To Be Loved: The Music, the Magic, the Memories of Motown" 
(Warner Books). By Berry Gordy -- with nobody. 
</P>
<P>
 The writing took him three more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd give them a tape, and they'd come back with it all nice and written up, 
and I would read it," Gordy said of the first frustrating years. "The facts 
were there, but it wasn't me -- the feeling wasn't there. And I would change 
writers and bring in other people, and I'd say: 'OK, you've got to get inside 
my head. Talk to me. Ask me questions. Write the way I talk. Write the way I 
feel -- and they gave me advice on how to make the book sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said: 'If you are paying us and you are not taking our advice, then you 
are wasting your money.' And I thought about it, and I said: 'You know, you are 
absolutely right!' " Gordy recalled with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of writing a book is to be understood -- if other people 
write about you, they try to guess why you did things, or they hear things from 
other people," he continued. "My own heroes, people that I have admired -- Joe 
Louis or Jackie Robinson or J.F.K. -- I would have loved to have seen what they 
felt about what they did, and why they did it. That's why I feel real fortunate 
to write my own book." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordy, 65, a former featherweight boxer who stands 5-feet-7, with a graying 
beard and a button nose, has an elfin quality that belies his apparent distaste 
for relinquishing control. But a visitor who plunks a tape recorder on a coffee 
table in front of Gordy cannot help but note that Gordy has a tape recorder too 
-- and his is bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Gordy is also videotaping the interview. He is filming the entire 
tour for posterity. One gets the feeling that if there were no journalist 
present, Gordy would be more than prepared to interview himself. 
</P>
<P>
 And if he ever got that opportunity, Gordy might ask himself some tough 
questions. After years of silence, he said, he wrote his book to set the record 
straight with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
 Today he seems buoyed by the warm reception from friends and fans on his 
cross-country tour. Part of the reason he started filming the tour is that, to 
borrow from his book title, he loves to be loved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been thrilled with my success, and I was so excited when I finished the 
book," he said. "But I had to reap the real rewards, which I have just gotten 
in the last three weeks, meeting the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The former recluse has become something of a media darling recently, even 
singing the first song he ever wrote, "You Are You," during a cozy at-home chat 
with Barbara Walters on "20/20" (suffice it to say that Smokey Robinson and 
Stevie Wonder do not have to worry about competition). Gordy also wrote or 
co-wrote many of Motown's better-known hits, such as "Money (That's What I 
Want)" and "Shop Around" with Robinson and "Do You Love Me (Now That I Can 
Dance)" on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 He also talked about his former love affair with Diana Ross and the fact that 
he is the father of Ross' daughter, Rhonda. Currently single, Gordy has eight 
children by five women; he has been married three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, in September, Gordy said he "tried to avoid" (but did attend) a 
ceremony that honored him for making a $500,000 gift to launch the Center for 
the Performing Arts in South-Central Los Angeles, to be part of the African 
American Unity Center, which was founded by Brotherhood Crusade President Danny 
J. Bakewell Sr. Gordy's gift, matched by a grant from the city of Los Angeles, 
will provide funds to restore an old church at 5300 S. Vermont Ave., which will 
become the arts center's headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping inner-city youth, he said, is a lot like grooming a Motown star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got hooked on people, and it turned out they had the same yearnings I did 
-- they wanted to be loved," Gordy said of his years of uncovering new talent. 
"Another thing I found out was that they all wanted to be somebody else. They 
all wanted to be like somebody. And I wanted them to be like themselves. I have 
this ability to find this hidden talent in people that sometimes even they 
didn't know they had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially somebody that nobody else wanted; that was a particular thrill to 
my ego. I felt that I could make anybody a star. Just find out what that talent 
was and make them believe in it. I was pretty confident, a little cocky too -- 
and I thought I could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 T hough he is enjoying the lime light now, Gordy says that years of shunning 
the press left Motown artists, as well as other Motown watchers, free to spread 
rumors and file lawsuits, especially after Motown was sold for $61 million. 
Negative stories about Gordy -- and the company he launched with $800 and a 
dream in Detroit in 1959 -- seemed to spread like a Malibu brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Most infamous of the conflicts surrounded Mary Wells, who died of throat 
cancer in 1992; the singer, who left the label in 1964, claimed that she was 
cheated out of royalties. In her 1986 autobiography, "Dreamgirl: My Life as a 
Supreme," Mary Wilson charged that the other Supremes were unfairly pushed 
aside by Gordy to favor Diana Ross; like Wells, she also later entered into 
litigation with Gordy over royalties. And Gordy recently settled out of court a 
1989 suit filed by Martha Reeves, also charging that Gordy owed her money. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordy counters that some former Motown artists continue to sue him not because 
he owes them anything but simply because he has money and they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "Motown is usually synonymous with Berry Gordy. RCA -- where's the name, who 
can you pin it on? Who is MCA, who is Mercury, who is Decca, who is Capitol? 
Motown is Berry Gordy. . . . Luckily for those artists, because they were with 
Motown, they are still able to perform, still able to make money -- and still 
able to write books," he grumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I settle a case out of court, it's because I love the person," Gordy said 
of his settlement with Reeves. "That sets a precedent, and other people are 
going to sue too. If I don't settle, they don't have money, and then I feel 
bad. But if I (settle), people think: 'There must be something there.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I did give a few artists money -- I gave Mary Wells money after 27 years, 
because I loved her. But people mistake kindness for weakness . . . so I take 
the position that if it's not some artist I have a really, really close 
relationship to, I'd rather just feel bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordy said that his book helped to make peace between himself and former 
Supreme Wilson, since he believes background information on the financial 
dealings of the company explains why Wilson and other Motown artists did not 
reap huge profits the way, in hindsight, one might have expected. Gordy said 
that Wilson even called to congratulate him when his book came out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, when she read my book and saw the truth, she was laughing. But I 
said" -- and now Gordy is laughing too -- " 'Look at all the trouble you 
caused, all these years!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such claims -- as well as an oft-repeated tale that Motown was 
built with Mafia money -- Gordy said he was "loaded for bear" when he first 
started his book tour. 
</P>
<P>
 (Gordy says the Mafia rumor stemmed from the fact that he hired an Italian 
American, Barney Ales, to head his sales department and that no one could 
believe that a black man had become one of the country's most successful 
entrepreneurs all on his own.) 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Gordy goads his interrogator like a boxer in the ring, 
circling the opponent before anyone throws a punch: "You are here to interview 
me. Ask me anything. Is there anything else you want to ask me?" Then, instead 
of a fist, he throws out the disarming grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm out here, and I want to make sure that it's clear, so I say bring up 
whatever you want to ask, because Motown was the cleanest company in the 
business," Gordy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he sold Motown six years ago, Gordy is still plagued by ghosts, 
and the new ones make the old ones seem like Casper. Most recently, in April, 
Gordy filed a $250-million suit against the New York Daily News for printing 
allegations that Gordy seduced former Motown staffer Tony Turner when he was 14 
years old and had pressured some singers to have abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 One cannot help but see similarities in the early press shyness of Gordy and 
that of his most celebrated protege, Michael Jackson, who grew up with Motown 
as one of the Jackson 5 and who also finally went public to deny longstanding 
rumors about hyperbaric chambers and "elephant man" bones in a 1993 TV 
interview with Oprah Winfrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his "ask-me-anything" challenge, Gordy remains reticent about Jackson, 
who has been quoted as saying that his years at Motown robbed him of his 
childhood. Gordy called Jackson "very shy" and "a very hard worker." Of 
Jackson's recent marriage to Lisa Marie Presley, Gordy said: "I would say I was 
pleasantly shocked. Michael is a fantasist, and I think his marriage is in that 
kind of fantasy world." 
</P>
<P>
 Of his own treatment by the press over the years, Gordy said, "Most of it was 
positive. But you can read 25 positive things yourself and feel great, and then 
you hear one negative thing that's a lie, and it bothers the hell out of you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had too many people who loved Motown, loved the music, but didn't 
understand what I was about. They thought I was in the Mafia. Inner-city kids 
would come to me and they were proud -- 'You bad , baby. They got Gotti , man.' 
I would say: 'I hate to disappoint you, but Motown wasn't built that way." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I finished the book, and (Motown artists) all read it, I've gotten even 
closer to them, because they never knew what I went through. And they never 
knew. It was true of almost everybody, including my own family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only artist who really knows what I was going through, my side of what 
was happening, was Smokey, because he was with me before the company started. 
He would always go out and try to fight for me, and put out press releases. And 
I said: 'Smokey, don't defend me, just do your music. I'll take care of myself. 
I'm numb to all that anyway, and someday, I'll set the record straight.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Does Gordy now regret his reticence? "No, because if I had talked to (the 
press) sooner, I would have gotten involved with a lot of stuff that was taking 
me away from my vision and my goal and my focus on the artists and what I was 
doing," Gordy said. "I always tell (artists): 'Less than 1% of the people in 
the world reach their full potential -- and the reason is they take their focus 
off what they were doing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Gordy said he regrets nothing that he has done or said in his life, although 
he jokes that "one thing that plagues me is that night in Paris with Diana," 
referring to his inability to perform sexually during their first intimate 
encounter, which he bluntly and humorously details on Page 214 of his book. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling was that nothing should embarrass me about the truth; people are 
human. I learned that in school -- asking questions that were stupid, and 
people would laugh at me," Gordy said. "I made sure that the creative people 
that we had, in all of our meetings, felt safe -- there were no stupid 
questions, no stupid ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why Gordy ignored experts' advice and included in his book details of 
a long history of bed-wetting, which went on even after he was drafted into the 
Army (unfortunately, Gordy, who was desperate to get out of the service, didn't 
realize that if he had confessed his problem the Army would have discharged him 
immediately). 
</P>
<P>
 "(Writers) said: You don't have to talk about that, nobody cares about that," 
Gordy said. "But somewhere down the line, it had a lot to do with the way I 
came out." 
</P>
<P>
 Although not in the same category as rumors of Mafia ties and unfair dealings, 
Gordy also wants to lay to rest a perception that his decision to move Motown 
Records from a house in Detroit called Hitsville U.S.A. to Los Angeles in 1970 
caused the downfall of the company. Gordy said he moved to expand his base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to grow," he said. "And I wanted movies, and TV movies and 
specials bad -- it was the logical place to come. And of course the weather 
didn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Motown, everybody was happy; we had fun," he continued. "Of course, we had 
fierce competition -- it was just like the Gordy family. When I was growing up, 
we had fierce love, fierce competition. . . . We'd shoot pool and play golf and 
gamble, play poker. We were all great at that, except for maybe Smokey. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, people were all the same -- they wanted the same thing. I knew there 
were racists, I knew there were bigots. I know they were shooting at the 
(Motown) artists who went down South. But in those walls of Motown, it was 
never heard of. We had our own world. And it was sort of like the world that I 
saw; it was sort of like the world that Dr. King saw. Motown was a world unto 
itself -- and the sound was a benefit of that kind of world." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordy, the son of a plastering contractor in Detroit's inner city, has 
described the Motown sound as "rats and roaches, guts and love." 
</P>
<P>
 And "out on the West Coast," he said, "we still had that same feeling, but 
people were becoming more independent because there were so many companies out 
here that were competing with us for the talent." (Ross, for example, left 
Motown to sign with RCA in 1981.) 
</P>
<P>
 "But still, our basic fundamentals were there, and we had a lot of successes 
out here. The Jackson 5's success was out here, we had Lionel Richie out here, 
the Commodores became very, very big, there was Rick James. So it's not as 
though we came out here and everything stopped working. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the music industry was changing. Six companies began to control 90% of 
all the music distribution in the world. It was getting to be a whole different 
ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 "So I started to think of ways to preserve Motown without killing myself. I 
decided to give it to one of those six corporations that would give it life, 
because I wanted that legacy to continue. . . . There was no other choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordy still feels the sting of criticism from the black community for selling 
the company, a decision he says was financial, not political: 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesse Jackson was running for President . .and the biggest concern he had 
was: 'My constituents say that you are selling Motown, you are selling them 
down the drain.' I gave him a Jesse-ism. I said: 'I have three choices -- 
either sell out, bail out, or fall out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gordy's first film production, "Lady Sings the Blues" (1972), was 
nominated for five Academy Awards, the movie end of Motown never really took 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just too much; I was one man," he said of that disappointment. "If I 
had not had the record company -- (but) the music industry was going through 
such a growth -- it was exploding!" 
</P>
<P>
 Gordy, who retains chairman ship of a Motown offshoot, Jobete Music, and 
continues to write songs, said that he maintains the same philosophies on which 
Motown was built. That was his reason for donating the money to L.A.'s African 
American Unity Center. He He wants South-Central's kids to be among that 1% who 
achieve their full potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came from the inner city; there was a place called the Brewster Center, 
where I learned to box," Gordy said. "They (the Unity Center) have the same 
approach I do, to communicate with people on a basic level, and make the youth 
understand that they have talent. And they can use it in one of two ways: They 
can kill people and go to jail, or they can use it in a positive way. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Ex-gang members -- sometimes it is hard for them to understand why they 
should work for $250 a week when they can make $2,000 a day selling drugs. But 
I say look at the costs. One, you have younger brothers and sisters that look 
up to you -- that's a cost, because they're going to do the same thing. You 
worry about your mother and father getting killed, your brothers and your 
sisters and your kids getting killed -- that's a cost. And you've got to look 
behind your back all the time. Start putting all those costs together. 
</P>
<P>
 "And these kids got intelligence today. In my neighborhood, if you had 
intelligence and education, you had it all. But if you had to have just one, it 
had better be intelligence. Whenever I came up against presidents of other 
companies, I was always smarter, because I was from the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 And, Gordy said, "(In the book) I talk about the cycle of success, how vicious 
it is, and how you go through riches and all that stuff -- but if after all 
that you are not the same person you were when you started, then you have 
failed. You have to know who you are, and who are the people who love you -- 
because when you are famous, you got all the 'friends' in the world."*

PHOTOGRAPHY; A GUY WHO'S SHARPLY FOCUSED; IN 10 YEARS, GETTY MUSEUM CURATOR 
WESTON J. NAEF HAS BUILT A VAST AND MUCH-ENVIED COLLECTION OF HISTORIC 
PHOTOGRAPHS, WITH SOME RECENT ONES, TOO. AND TO THINK IT ALL STARTED IN THE 
WINK OF AN EYE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At dawn one July morning in 1984, Weston J. Naef disembarked from a cargo 
plane in a remote area of LAX. His 10-year-old son, Edward, was at his side, 
and thousands of the best photographs in the world were still in crates on 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Their arrival marked the final chapter in an art world thriller that began 
just the year before, when J. Paul Getty Museum Director John Walsh learned 
that at least three major private photography collections might soon be for 
sale. He saw the potential for a world-class museum collection, and he urged 
the Getty board to act. 
</P>
<P>
 The board did. New York art dealer Daniel Wolf circled the globe for the 
Getty, methodically acquiring the most important photographs money could buy. 
He purchased all or substantial portions of the fabled collections of Americans 
Samuel Wagstaff and Arnold Crane and of Andre and Marie-Therese Jammes in 
France. Photographs poured in from other top collections in France, Germany, 
Switzerland and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "By being able to move very quickly and quietly, we were able to make an 
extraordinarily favorable deal," Walsh says. "We were able to get the whole 
works for less than the price of a moderately good Cezanne still life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty instantly became one of the world's great repositories for 
photography. And Naef, the man who had been offstage advising Wolf and the 
Getty on what to buy, was hired to oversee and expand the Getty's riches. 
</P>
<P>
 Naef was also a widely known figure in the world of photography. While still 
serving as a curator of prints and photographs at the Metropolitan Museum of 
Art, where he had worked for nearly 15 years, he helped the Getty evaluate 
possible photography purchases and suggested additional ones. Then, 
anticipating that the Getty would prove successful in its quest, he left one of 
the world's most important museums and headed west to an institution whose 
reputation was then based primarily on its enormous endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That challenge was one that I could not resist," says Naef, today the Getty's 
curator of photographs. "It offered the promise of building one of the greatest 
collections of photographs that may ever be created." 
</P>
<P>
 Energetic, intense and very, very determined, the 52-year-old Naef has 
continued amassing treasures in the only Getty department that regularly 
collects 20th-Century art. Starting with the initial acquisition of 18,000 
photographs, he has built the collection to more than 25,500, with thousands 
more mounted in albums and on cards and other media. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it has been a matter of adding to strong areas of the collection 
such as 19th-Century French photographs, Walsh says; sometimes Naef has focused 
on weaker areas, such as classic American modernists. As he puts it: "We 
started with a great base and persisted -- searching, hunting and gathering the 
very best that complements the existing collection or fills gaps." 
</P>
<P>
 One such gap was work by Frederick Sommer, an 89-year-old Prescott, Ariz., 
photographer whose evocative images are currently on view at the Malibu museum. 
Although art experts have long appreciated Sommer's work, he has not been as 
widely known as less reclusive, more prolific contemporaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Just one Sommer photograph was among the Getty's original purchases, so last 
summer, after three years of effort, the museum made a major purchase of 
Sommer's work. Naef had first met with the artist's New York dealer, then 
repeatedly visited the artist's Arizona studio, talking with the artist and his 
assistants. By last spring, Naef had selected 107 photographs for the Getty to 
buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sommer's work is just extremely rare and it trickles onto the market," Walsh 
says. "I was just floored when it was possible for Weston to come up with an 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Naef may look like a scholar in the tweedy clothes and bow ties that belie his 
Palm Springs upbringing, but he clearly knows how to forage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Weston is a dauntless unearther of treasures," says Robert A. Sobieszek, 
curator of photography at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. "He's got the 
dough and knows how to negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty photography collection today is obviously worth considerably more 
than the $20 million estimated as its initial value. (The Getty won't disclose 
such information.) Its annual acquisitions budget is reportedly $1 million to 
$2 million. By comparison, LACMA curator Sobieszek says that after the current 
fund-raising drive, he expects his annual photo acquisitions budget to be 
$150,000 to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But dealers here and elsewhere say that, despite its resources, the Getty 
hasn't tipped the marketplace out of balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been amazingly responsible when you consider the amount of money they 
have," says Los Angeles photography dealer G. Ray Hawkins. "While they will pay 
top price for something they desperately want, they won't overpay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll wait until the price fits in with their idea of value. Even though (a 
photo) may go to a collector or another institution, the sense of certainty 
that they will get it offered to them again in the next millennium gives them 
the freedom to say no." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider, for instance, Naef's acquisition of almost 100 Alfred Stieglitz 
photographs purchased from artist Georgia O'Keeffe's estate between the time of 
her death in 1986 and September, 1992, the close of a Getty show of Stieglitz's 
photos of O'Keeffe. 
</P>
<P>
 Most curators buy art before they show it, and dealer Hawkins says that Naef's 
willingness to wait displays an underlying conservatism. "He didn't commit to 
purchasing until he gave himself time to curate his ideal show, frame it, 
install it and live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, Naef went to Walsh teary-eyed, describing a Stieglitz photograph 
he would buy if the money were available. (Naef recalls that the photograph, 
"Hands Sewing," went at auction for $400,000 in 1993.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Even we don't have the money for everything," Walsh says. "Weston is 
constantly moving the pots from the front to the back burner, turning down the 
gas, and hoping to keep a patient collector on simmer (without) the flame going 
out. He's like a cook, and the kitchen's hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Naef enjoys the heat, Walsh says. When they both worked at the Metropolitan 
Museum, "I'd get into an elevator, and there would be Weston with a short old 
man with a beret, and he'd say, 'Oh, John, I'd like you to meet Andre Kertesz.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The Sommer exhibition, which opened Tuesday, is just the Getty's third of a 
living artist. (The others presented the work of Manuel Alvarez Bravo and 
Edmund Teske.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We put more money into work of people who aren't making any more," Walsh 
says. "It's a question of where we're best off putting the money. And across 
the board at the Getty, we're still looking for the endangered species. We 
figure the others will still be around." 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty's initial foray into photography actually began with such concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Starting as late in the day as we were starting," Walsh says, "we were 
looking for areas in which the Getty could do something really distinctive 
without preempting the place of some other Los Angeles institution." 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh next turned to Naef, someone he had known since Naef first went to work 
for Walsh at the Met as a college intern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admired (Naef's) collecting and exhibitions," Walsh says. "I got his advice 
on formation of this new collection, and then I got him to make a career 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 photographers are represented in the Getty collection, but Naef 
has focused on the work of about 24 masters. He calls such artists as Stieglitz 
and Walker Evans "creative geniuses" and seeks with each "a panorama" of work. 
The Getty buys individual photographs, of course, but it often makes larger 
purchases of photo groups that place those masterworks in context. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a superb collection," says Peter Galassi, chief curator of the 
photography department at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. "It is notable 
for its range and diversity and for great depth of such holdings as August 
Sander, Man Ray and Walker Evans, where they have pictures in very significant 
quantity as well as quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those photographs have been shown in the 35 exhibitions Naef and his 
staff have organized since 1986. The department's small gallery located near 
the Impressionist paintings has also presented shows of such individual artists 
as Edward Weston and Alexander Rodchenko, early French and Egyptian photos and 
several shows on experimental photography. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the collections have long been available to scholars and curators, 
the general public will soon be able to get to know them better. Late next 
month, the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum of Art will open a major exhibition of 
Getty photography holdings, and due out in early spring is a handbook of the 
collection, the first to document its scope and size. 
</P>
<P>
 Naef, who will curate the Hammer exhibition, also wrote the handbook, and his 
office reflects the many demands on his time. A testimonial to his motto that 
"More is more," no desk or shelf space is visible in the modest office. Every 
surface, from the floor to his Stickley chairs and table, is covered with 
papers, photographic materials, books or other possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Naef's shows, like the collection itself, have spanned photographic history, 
styles, attitudes and artists. He even refers to the exhibitions as his 
metaphoric children, calling them the "fulfillment of personal dreams" realized 
by both himself and his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The dreamers aren't always the dozen or so staff people Naef supervises 
either. Producer-screenwriter and collector Michael G. Wilson (best known for 
his James Bond films) guest-curated a recent Getty show on Northern California 
pictorialism, for instance. Jackie Napolean Wilson, a Detroit attorney whose 
grandfather was a slave and who collects photography about the life of African 
Americans in the 1850s and 1860s, will curate a show called "Hidden Witness" at 
the Getty in February. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hidden Witness" provides the Getty an opportunity to show 25 rare pieces in 
the collection, Naef says, and the museum occasionally also collaborates on 
exhibitions with local museums to maximize impact. The pictorialism show, for 
instance, was done in collaboration with a companion show in the Virginia 
Steele Scott Gallery at the Huntington Library in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 Naef says that each year the Getty lends to a dozen or more institutions from 
New York to Paris and Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be hard to think of major historical photography exhibitions to 
which the Getty has not lent," the Museum of Modern Art's Galassi says. 
"They've done wonderful small exhibitions in the space they have, but one way 
the richness of the collection is known is through their loans." 
</P>
<P>
 Access will also increase with the Getty's newly ambitious publications 
program. Naef says he has studiously avoided coffee table-size books, believing 
that there are already too many available, and he has recently begun an "In 
Focus" series of small "serviceable books." Reception has been good, he says, 
to their first "In Focus" book, on Kertesz, and the Getty plans books tied to 
coming exhibitions of Stieglitz, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Doris Ulmann and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty hopes to publish 10 "In Focus" books by the time it moves in 1997 to 
the Getty facility currently under construction in Brentwood, and the museum 
also plans a major book on Walker Evans for late next year. It was written by 
Getty associate curator Judy Keller and documents the museum's 1,200 Evans 
photographs, the largest public collection of the artist's work. 
</P>
<P>
 The photography department's final show at the Malibu museum site will be work 
by Englishwoman Julia Margaret Cameron, also the subject of the department's 
first show, and Naef expects to inaugurate its space at the new Getty facility 
with a Walker Evans show. Besides two galleries for changing exhibitions, Naef 
will have a small gallery for selections from the permanent collection and an 
occasional turn at a general exhibition gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 But he warns against expecting many blockbuster photography shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found between 50 and 100 pictures seems to be a very satisfying number 
to bring together," Naef says. "We will stay deliberately small. We want 
(exhibitions) to be contained and focused in order to have our visitors leave 
with a taste for more."

<P>
 First it was the innuendo, the chiding, the degrading remarks. Then came the 
threats, and finally, physical violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He grabbed me by the arms and threw me through a sliding glass door," said 
Maria St. John, recalling the March incident that led to her husband's sixth 
misdemeanor conviction for spousal abuse -- six weeks after getting out of jail 
for one of the convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to do or where to go. . . . He hurt me many times before I 
called the police," said St. John, whose husband was charged with felony 
spousal abuse for an incident in October. He has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 With a new toll-free telephone number (800-978-3600) that provides advice in 
several languages, as well as the opening of two shelters in South-Central Los 
Angeles, the county is attempting to help women like St. John. But their 
numbers overwhelm the Los Angeles region's capacity to help victims of domestic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a need far beyond what we are able to offer," said Karen Freeman, 
assistant director of the 22-year-old, South Bay-based 1736 Family Crisis 
Center, which operates the two new 20-bed shelters. They join the only other 
such shelter in South-Central, Jenesse Center Inc., a 22-bed facility that has 
operated for 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The centers offer comprehensive counseling, job training and assistance with 
acquiring housing outside the abusers' reach, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new shelters are at capacity, staff members help victims find 
alternative safe houses such as churches and other social service agencies, she 
added.  
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Allred, an attorney specializing in women's legal rights, said violence 
begins its cycle with the feelings of shame and isolation women experience 
after they have been battered. Such feelings, often referred to as "battered 
women's syndrome," make them vulnerable and often lead to harsher attacks, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Victims need information to dispel some of the myths," said Allred, citing a 
common belief that batterers will not continue the violence. "That is false. 
Usually, it becomes worse, despite promises by batterers that they will stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Often women are unaware they can use the criminal justice system to fend off 
their abuser. They can obtain restraining orders through local law enforcement 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most women don't know that they could also sue for damages to compensate for 
emotional, physical and economic distress," Allred said.  
</P>
<P>
 A victims' advocate for the county's Domestic Violence Task Force, an advisory 
committee for the Board of Supervisors, St. John is spokeswoman for the 
800-number and helps to raise funds for more shelters in the region. She 
publicly tells her story so women can see that there are ways out of their 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband will face a Superior Court judge Dec. 20 on felony spousal abuse 
charges. "I want every woman to know they do have a choice, they are important 
and it's their life," St. John said. ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; ROYAL VISITORS FROM AFRICA MEET RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Linking the past to the future was what Dolores Sheen Blunt had in mind when 
she brought two village chiefs and a queen from the West Africa nation of Ghana 
to visit African Americans in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want children to understand that America is their country and (Africa) is 
their homeland," said Blunt, principal of Sheenway School and Cultural Center, 
a private facility in Watts. "We need to get their wisdom. We need to record 
it. It's not in our history books. They are living history." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Togbui Nukpe II of the Ewe tribe and Ga tribe leaders Chief Kii Okuley 
II and Queen Mother Naa Ashami offered insight Dec. 2 into their way of life in 
their respective coastal tribes. At the same time, they were given a window 
into the lives of area residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw life in Los Angeles, which is very similar to that of Ghana," said the 
village chiefs and queen through interpreter Alexander Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've not seen sad things since we've been here," he said, referring to the 
crime and violence the area has been linked with in some circles. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural exchange, funded by the African-American Business Assn., also 
celebrated Blunt's ambitious plan to open a Sheenway school in Ghana by early 
next year in Nukpe's farming village of 3,000 residents. The royal entourage, 
as well as a team of Sheenway officials led by Blunt, left for Ghana last week 
to inspect the locale of the new school. 
</P>
<P>
 "This link will boost the self-esteem of kids here," said Blunt, who traces 
her heritage to Ghana. "In return, we will be giving back to Africa what was 
taken away." 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in South-Central Los Angeles, Dondre Bausley, 27, said having access to 
people that are a direct connection to his past opened his eyes to his cultural 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave me hope that they care and they want us to care," Bausley said while 
sampling Ghanaian red beans and rice at a cultural celebration honoring the 
royal entourage at the Christian Community Center in South-Central. "It's 
refreshing to know that they want unity just as much as us."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; MOTELS TARGETED OVER PROSTITUTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tired of sweeping used condoms from his front yard every morning, Figueroa 
Street resident Nathan Freeman took his frustrations about the neighboring 
motel to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa and a handful of other neighbors complained to zoning officials that 
the motels on Figueroa are magnets for prostitution and drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time I had to clean one (condom) up from my back porch," Freeman 
testified at the Dec. 1 zoning hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not used by late night travelers," he said of the Ash Motel, near 45th 
Street. "The people that use it are those who want a quick fix on drugs and a 
quick fix on sex." 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning officials are trying to determine whether to impose restrictions on the 
Trojan, Ding Dong, Ash and Furst motels. Another hearing will be held Thursday 
on the Naseeb and New Raymond motels. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the motels said the businesses are not the cause of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more commercial sex in the three major hotels of Los Angeles than in 
all of the Figueroa area," said Arthur K. Snyder, representing Maoson Young, 
owner of the Ash and Furst motels. "Unfortunately (this hearing) is an attempt 
to close down a commercial section that is only part of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 About three residents attended the hearing to show support for the motel 
owners. 
</P>

 Councilwoman Rita Walters' office passed out flyers to Freeman and other 
residents urging them to attend the hearing and voice their concerns about the 
motels. About 10 attended, including parents of Manual Arts High School 
students and 58th Street block club members brought to the hearing by the 
Community Coalition for Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment, a community 
group that led a campaign to reduce the number of liquor stores in South Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Residents are looking for immediate relief from the criminal activity that 
has been terrorizing their children," said Silvia Castillo, assistant director 
of the coalition. "They want women to stop showing their body parts to the 
children that are walking to and from nearby schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts High School, John Muir Middle School and a handful of elementary 
schools are in or near the Figueroa corridor, which stretches between 45th and 
120th streets. There have been at least 300 prostitution and drug arrests in 
the corridor this year, Vice Detective Rick McElroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Zoning Administrator John J. Parker, who presided over the Dec. 1 
hearing, said he would not rule on the cases for at least a month. If Parker 
finds the motels to be public nuisances, he can impose strict requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city crackdown on motels and hotels along Sepulveda Boulevard in Van 
Nuys, for instance, motel managers were required to check the driver's licenses 
of tenants, refuse to rent rooms on an hourly basis, improve lighting around 
the motels and discourage loitering. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar restrictions were recommended to Parker by Walters, the Community 
Coalition and the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 If motel owners fail to comply, they could lose their business licenses and be 
forced to shut down.  
</P>
<P>
 Motel owners said they are being wrongly blamed for something society is 
responsible for. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Trojan Motel did not create prostitution and it did not create drugs," 
owner Tien Te Wang said. "How can a business like the Trojan Motel stop these 
problems? We as a small motel can't violate these personal freedoms. We can't 
go into their rooms and tell them what to do." ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; POLICE GIVE TOYS TO NEEDY CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Latino Peace Officers Assn. of East Los Angeles gave out 2,000 toys to 
needy children Saturday for the second year in a row at the American Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few weeks, the 120 members of the association, made up of police 
officers from Los Angeles and neighboring cities, sheriff's deputies, probation 
and parole officers, California Highway Patrol officers and Justice Department 
officials, have collected toys from the community to be distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross, the Los Angeles County Bomberos Assn. and the East Los Angeles 
Rotary Club helped with the toy drive. Vouchers for the toys were handed out to 
churches and organizations who were in touch with needy families and were 
redeemed Saturday morning at the giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our association has been involved in a lot of humanitarian efforts over the 
year," Sheriff's Deputy Ed Rubalcaba said. "We're trying to change the image 
people have of people in law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the year, association members have helped families they meet on 
patrol, including the family of a young cancer patient. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers took Joshua Anthony Moreno, 9, to a professional basketball game 
where he met Phoenix Suns star Charles Barkley and Lakers giants James Worthy 
and Vlade Divac. They also arranged for the boy's father, an inmate at Chino 
State Prison, to visit Joshua before he died.  
</P>
<P>
 They hope to increase their community involvement in the coming year with help 
at homeless shelters and battered women's shelters, Rubalcaba said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; ROOSEVELT HIGH GETS A NEEDED MAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The changes have come slowly and not without problems, but Roosevelt High 
School teacher Aldo Parral hopes to continue his work to improve and brighten 
the 71-year-old school while boosting student pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Parral, who teaches English as a second language, became the school's 
beautification coordinator with a little money from the school's alumni 
association and help from Principal Henry Ronquillo, Los Angeles City 
Councilman Richard Alatorre and community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 He recruited students to paint out graffiti, design and paint murals and pick 
up trash. Parral, whose efforts were interrupted this fall by his duties as 
football coach, will restart the beautification project when students return 
from winter break in January. 
</P>
<P>
 But already, students at the South Mathews Street school have taken notice of 
the 23 murals his program was responsible for painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look like a prison any more," one student told the school's 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District have suffered from 
budget cutbacks that have reduced the number of janitors available for basic 
maintenance and caused long delays in making simple repairs. Schools often must 
go without, or find other sources for building maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt, with 4,600 students, benefited from a celebrity basketball game 
last May that raised $5,000 for the beautification efforts. Alatorre field 
deputy Rosa Morales, who coordinated the basketball game, has also helped 
secure donations from the community to improve the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements have included painting the gazebo in the center of the 
school, planting grass and flowers and fixing the bleachers in the gym. The 
entire school was painted, inside and out -- something that had not been done 
in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements were especially necessary because the school, one of the 
largest in the district, also is a meeting site for community groups, has an 
adult school and migrant education and after-school programs, Ronquillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of wear and tear on an old facility," he said. "The school 
never gets to rest. That and the low budgets in the district that have brought 
the cutbacks in maintenance make it an uphill battle just to keep a school 
maintained." 
</P>
<P>
 So Parral, 24, a Roosevelt alumnus, took on the task of getting students 
involved in the school's upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 Several students who have since graduated helped paint murals throughout the 
grounds depicting the school mascot, a Roughrider, and other school symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those have been vandalized. Parral pointed out a large painting near 
the football field that students over the Thanksgiving weekend poured paint on 
and tried to set on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, though, the students have respected the murals because they know other 
students have painted them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort has not gone without criticism, mostly from teachers and staff who 
wanted more students involved in deciding what murals and improvements to make, 
Parral said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a plan to this and that was to make the school as best as you can 
make it," Parral said. "But there was a lot of criticism because of the 
spontaneity of it." 
</P>
<P>
 As he reflects on the work he and others have done, Parral points to a mural 
on the south end of the school in which an airbrushed scene depicts two 
snarling bears and a Roughrider against a background of the city's skyline. The 
piece took six students 120 hours to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the one I'm most proud of. Just looking at it reminds me of the 
kids," Parral said. "It's still not what I want, though. The work's not done."

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: TELACU DROPS PLAN FOR LAWRY'S SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The East Los Angeles Community Union has abandoned plans to develop housing on 
the former site of Lawry's California Center, bowing to strong community 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, known as TELACU, had proposed buying the 17-acre, $12.5-million 
property, which has been unoccupied for two years, and building 208 
condominiums as well as movie theaters, shops, offices and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to community concerns that the housing would be too dense and 
would cause traffic problems, TELACU sought financing for the West Avenue 26 
project with fewer housing units and also with none at all, said the agency's 
spokeswoman, J.C. Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 But the banks would not agree to those plans because revenue from the retail 
part of the project would not have supported the development, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 years, the center, which included restaurants and shops, attracted 
tourists with its gardens and architecture. It closed in 1992 after Thomas J. 
Lipton Inc., the owner, experienced financial problems.. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activist Art Pulido remains adamant about not allowing any housing 
to be built on the property, even if it means the center could be closed to the 
public for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido suggested that the owners form a committee of residents to help guide 
any plans to develop the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up to them to inform the residents so we don't run into another 
situation like (with) TELACU," Pulido said. "If they have a developer that's 
interested in coming in, we'd be more than glad to sit down with them and 
discuss the possibilities." MARY ANNE PEREZ

ON THE TOWN: THE BLAND CANYONS; THE FLIGHT FROM FEAR CREATES RELATIVELY SAFE 
COMMUNITIES THAT LACK THE SPICES OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Gold

<TEXT>
<P>
 I think I found what passes for the California dream a couple of weeks ago: a 
swath of green Brady Bunch suburbia stitched into a remote corner of the 
red-rock desert, eight interstate hours east of the four-level, 10 mountain 
ranges and two states away. Everywhere you look there are clean shopping 
centers, nationally advertised theme restaurants, blond children playing in 
front of gleaming cul-de-sac ranch houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The air is clean, the water pure, the crime rate just this side of nonexistent 
-- people you've only just met make a point of telling you that they never lock 
their front door, just before they invite your family to spend the night. (If a 
stranger in Culver City confided that he left his front door unlocked, even you 
might be tempted to rob the place.) The surrounding mountains invite you to 
car-camp and hunt for venison. If it weren't for the pink, corrugated mesas and 
the Orrin Hatch bumper stickers on the station wagons, you could imagine 
yourself in the nice part of Fullerton instead of somewhere south of Provo -- 
this place is a boring L.A. suburb a two-hour drive from the nearest big city. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so long ago, the town was a speck of a settlement, a place off the highway 
to stop for groceries and a diner meal, a cluster of motels on the way to 
national parks and points north. Now the area is booming, thanks to the 
family-values crowd and those who would hire them. There are plenty of jobs, 
not the groovy kind held down by telecommuting software designers in Taos but 
decent, no-future, lifestyle-maintenance stuff: $8-an-hour back-office gigs, 
$300-a-week warehouse things; burger-flipping jobs at every imaginable kind of 
fast-food franchise. Wages aren't high in this sparsely unionized state, but 
houses go for about a third of what they would in the L.A. area, and it seems 
like a friendly place to raise kids. I'm not sure whether it's a capital of 
white flight, but you won't see a whole lot of minorities around. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the town's natives drifted out to California after World War II to 
take jobs in the aircraft plants and steel mills and drifted home again when 
those factories began to close in the '70s. It was part of the great reverse 
migration that drained places the white guys from places like Rosemead and 
Fontana back into pickup-truck exurbia. Many of the newer residents are former 
Californians bent on recapturing their Ozzie-and-Harriet youth. Sometimes the 
place can seem like the Far West equivalent of those small towns in Michoacan 
where every resident has lived in Los Angeles, has relatives in Los Angeles and 
knows precisely how many hours it takes to get to Los Angeles by car. If the 
town has a soul, it is that of Downey, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular culture, for example, seems very far away. The closest stop for 
Lollapalooza is three hours away -- if your mom will let you go (she probably 
won't), and the only radio stations you can tune in play Mantovani and Garth 
Brooks. Soundgarden CDs are passed around from teen-ager to teen-ager like 
samizdat Joseph Brodsky poems in pre-Gorbachev Moscow. Rap music is treated by 
grown-ups as a bad smell from a world far away. Espresso and subtitled movies 
don't make it within 100 miles of here. The closest decent restaurant is 
probably in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 And somehow, it is hard to spend any time in this town without sensing that 
opportunity has been swapped for safety, the beauty of diversity for pretty 
scenery and the security of not feeling out of place. This is where the growth 
seems to be now in America: bland industrial-park centers in Florida, North 
Carolina, Arizona and Utah, defined as much by their distance from major urban 
centers as they are by proximity to capital -- cities where a flight from fear 
can be interpreted as a journey toward community.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; MORE STUDY SET ON RECYCLING 
OPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After six hours of emotional testimony, the City Council last week tabled a 
decision on whether to allow a recycling plant to continue operating in light 
of residents' complaints that it contaminates the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The council won't rule on Aggregate Recycling Systems' permit for at least 
another month pending further study. 
</P>
<P>
 A citizens group had appealed the Planning Commission's decision to grant the 
permit to Aggregate, which recycles concrete into road base at its South 
Alameda Boulevard plant. The permit would allow the company to operate for 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will order an air quality analysis in an effort to determine the 
source and extent of any air contamination in the area surrounding the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to delay the matter came over the objections of about 150 
residents wearing surgical masks and holding small placards reading in Spanish 
and English, "Let us breath." 
</P>
<P>
 "The council can clearly see that people are upset about this issue, but the 
fact remains that we need a lot more information before we can make an educated 
decision," Mayor Ric Loya said. He added that the cost of the study, to be paid 
by the city, would not exceed $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggregate owner Sam Chew said he was pleased by the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can say for sure if there is any air contamination or whether it comes 
from Aggregate," Chew said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chew said that if air contamination violates state standards, the source could 
be other nearby industrial facilities, or possibly even passing trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Other industries near Aggregate along South Alameda Street are the Saroyan 
Lumber Co. and Commercial Enameling Inc., a company specializing in the 
enameling of bathroom fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies have complained to the City Council that Aggregate disrupts 
their operations. At a Planning Commission meeting last month, attorneys for 
Commercial Enameling asked that Aggregate's permit not be renewed on the basis 
that dust from the recycling facility is potentially damaging to its 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Los Angeles Comunidades Asambleadas Unidas para un Sostenable 
Ambiente (Los Angeles Communities Assembled for a Sustainable Environment), 
known as LA CAUSA, have complained that Aggregate, which opened one year ago, 
emits dust and noise into the neighborhood bordering the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council is just waiting for someone to get real sick and die," said 
Hector Lopez, who lives across the street from Aggregate with his wife and 
three children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what they say; the dust in the air has been getting worse and 
worse, and there isn't an end in sight," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents emerged from the meeting both dissatisfied and encouraged, said 
Carlos Porras, who has helped organize residents on behalf of the Los 
Angeles-based Citizens for a Better Environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council's decision to study the whole thing further can only benefit us," 
Porras said. He cited an October study of the air surrounding Aggregate 
conducted by Air Quality Dynamics on behalf of LA CAUSA. The study found that 
dust emissions around Aggregate, for both the 24-hour average and annual 
average, exceeded state standards approximately 79% of the time, or 289 days of 
the year. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; EMMA GUTIERREZ IS PARENT OF THE 
YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever a parent volunteer has been needed in recent years in Huntington 
Park, city officials and activists have known they could rely on Emma 
Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 For anti-graffiti efforts, parent outreach seminars and simple, yet 
time-consuming projects such as bake sales and food drives, the married mother 
of three not only has volunteered her services, she has organized these efforts 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of her work, Gutierrez was honored last week as a "Parent of 
the Year" by Parents Today, an education program run in conjunction with the 
United Way and sponsored by MoneyGram, a subsidiary of American Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez was among three Southland parents honored at a Dec. 3 ceremony at 
All People's Christian Center in South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 nominees were judged on the following: solid parenting skills, actions 
that serve as a role model to others and efforts that help show any goal is 
achievable. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in a community made up largely of recent immigrants from Latin America, 
Gutierrez -- who came from Guadalajara, Mexico, 17 years ago -- has served as 
an example of the kind of parent who has made sure the system benefits her 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our schools in this area are so crowded with students that parents don't know 
what to do," said Gutierrez, whose children are 8, 10 and 16. "On top of the 
crowding, many can't speak English and have trouble communicating with teachers 
and administrators. Many parents have trouble being straightforward about their 
children's needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Not Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Emma has the ability to show a group of parents what they need to know when 
facing big problems like illiteracy or graffiti," said Marcos Vega, who as 
chairman of the Juvenile Assistance Diversion Effort (Project JADE), nominated 
Gutierrez for the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Project JADE is a delinquency prevention program providing family counseling 
and parent education services to residents of the Southeast area. For three 
years, Gutierrez has volunteered with Project JADE, most recently heading its 
anti-graffiti task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez is also president of the Parent Advisory Council and Shared 
Decision-Making Leadership group at Miles Elementary School. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; FORMER CANDIDATE SUES OVER CITATIONS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While campaigning at the Tweedy Mile Street Fair for a congressional seat in 
June, Charles Green and three of his supporters were rounded up by a city 
employee and ticketed for violating South Gate's Municipal Code. 
</P>
<P>
 The offense? Distributing pamphlets without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much for the First Amendment," said Green. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Green, a member of the Democratic National Committee, has filed a lawsuit 
against the city, claiming the code violates free speech provisions in the 
state and federal constitutions. The suit, filed two weeks ago in Norwalk 
Superior Court, seeks $1 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after the June 4 incident, Green received a letter from South Gate 
City Manager Todd Argow apologizing for the citations, which were issued by a 
temporary employee in the code enforcement bureau. In the letter, Argow told 
Green the citations were canceled and expunged from city records. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as if Green and his supporters -- who were cited under sections of the 
South Gate Municipal Code that require city-approved licenses for handbill 
distributors and door-to-door peddlers -- were never ticketed in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not how it appeared to Green, a veteran of civil rights marches in 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "They treated me without dignity," Green said. "They treated me like a quack." 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate City Atty. Arnold Alvarez-Glasman, who maintained that the city's 
code complies with the Constitution, said the city had hoped that Argow's 
letter would bring a quick resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez-Glasman said that Argow's letter was an "apology, not an admission of 
guilt." 
</P>
<P>
 Green, who lost the 33rd Congressional District Democratic primary to 
incumbent Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los Angeles), has contacted the 
American Civil Liberties Union to discuss his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might just be a bad ordinance the city has," said Carol Sobel, senior 
staff attorney of the Southern California ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a question of a bad law, then it's a good thing Green has filed his 
suit, so it can be changed." SIMON ROMERO

 But many of these former refugees, along with other recent Latino immigrants 
who make ends meet working at one or more relatively low-paying jobs, have so 
far been unable to establish financial assets in their adopted country. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of them have enough of a credit history or a big enough nest egg to open a 
bank account. To cash their checks, they must often resort to small 
check-cashing establishments, many of which charge high commission fees and 
offer little security. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the El Rescate legal and social services center in Pico-Union -- in an 
attempt to meet the changing needs of the population it originally set out to 
provide emergency aid for 13 years ago -- is setting up its own federally 
insured community credit union. Officials say will be more user-friendly for 
recent immigrants than are traditional banking establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit union, set to open next fall pending federal approval, will provide 
its members with basic savings accounts and loans. Organizers hope to expand 
services to include money orders and checking as membership and assets grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, we saw that a lot of people we thought would go back (to their 
home countries) had put down roots, and they needed more than handouts," said 
Celia Grail, El Rescate's executive director. "The people in this community 
don't use all the banks around here, so we looked into developing a credit 
union." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent Latino immigrants fail to establish bank accounts for various reasons, 
Grail said. Low wages prevent many from saving enough money to meet the minimum 
deposits required by most banks. Some are paid in cash by their employers and 
are thus unable to present proof of earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they do not earn high enough wages, others do not have access to 
credit cards and other credit-building mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, coupled with language barriers and a general mistrust of foreign 
institutions, serves to keep many recent Latino immigrants from even trying to 
establish a savings or checking account, or attempting to obtain a loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banks are not flexible enough," said Lilian Autler, El Rescate's community 
development coordinator. "Most of these people need small loans, such as for 
funerals, weddings or for when they get sick and have no medical insurance. But 
most banks are not interested in small loans, because they are not profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Although El Rescate has not yet determined savings or lending criteria, Autler 
said, the credit union will consider the number of incomes in an applicant's 
household, as well as the applicant's ability to pay bills, in lieu of credit 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll have to demonstrate ability to pay, but we will be more flexible than 
banks," Autler said. "We want to encourage people to build up assets." 
</P>
<P>
 El Rescate is soliciting pledges from associations that wish to become credit 
union members. So far, Comunidades -- a network of immigrants from El Salvador 
who pool funds to aid reconstruction in their hometowns -- has joined, as well 
as the Latino Merchants' Assn. and Justice for Janitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who wishes to become a credit union member will be able to do so by 
joining one of the associations affiliated with the credit union, Autler said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Rescate expects to submit its application for a federal credit union 
charter at the beginning of 1995. LESLIE BERESTEIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; EXPLICIT VIDEOTAPES ARE SEIZED BY POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police recently raided a business in Little Tokyo and the Mid-City home of its 
owner to seize videotapes imported from Japan that allegedly depict sexual acts 
that may violate obscenity laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators confiscated eight rental videos from the Tokyo Market at 339 E. 
1st St. and then conducted a search of owner Young Chu's home, said Los Angles 
Police Detective Steve Takeshita. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests were made, but a report will be filed with the city attorney's 
office, which will determine if criminal charges should be brought against Chu. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu, who was out of the country when his video store and home were served with 
the search warrants, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The store manager, who requested anonymity, said that Chu responded to the 
raids by ordering his employees to search the store's shelves and remove any 
videos that might be deemed obscene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish (authorities) would have just given us notice that the material was 
illegal instead of rushing in with 10 to 15 officers and handcuffing our 
employees," said the manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids were the culmination of a three-month investigation involving the 
Los Angeles Police Department, the Postal Service and U.S. Customs. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with a tip to police that the Tokyo Market might be renting obscene 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 When U.S. Customs officers in Los Angeles intercepted a mail shipment of 84 
allegedly obscene videos en route from Japan to the Tokyo Market, their agents 
and the Postal Service joined in the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators went to the market and rented videos, which they believe were 
filmed in Japan, to determine the subject matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeshita said the tapes included depictions of sexual torture and bondage, 
which may violate obscenity laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is some of the most disturbing material I have seen," said Deputy City 
Atty. Deborah Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers also collected the rental records for the videos to show they had 
been disseminated to the public, Takeshita said. Renting or possessing the 
videos, however, is not illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Chu could be charged with misdemeanor distribution of obscene materials, which 
carries a penalty of up to one year imprisonment, Takeshita said. The videos 
will be destroyed when the case is concluded. BRETT MAHONEY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CENTRAL; SCIENCE PROGRAM FOR MINORITY STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Community College is searching for qualified black, Latino, 
Pacific Islander or Native American students interested in careers in science, 
to participate in a training program next semester. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Los Angeles Bridge to Minorities to Biomedical Research Careers" offers 
eight community college students majoring in chemistry, biology, physics or 
computer science specialized tutoring, counseling and a $100 weekly stipend 
each semester. 
</P>
<P>
 The jewel of the program, however, is an eight-week summer research project at 
Cal State Los Angeles, in which students do research with professors in their 
field of interest and receive a $2,000 grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to listen to theory and another thing to actually use those 
things you're learning," said Milton Zambrana, who participates in the program 
and plans to pursue either medicine or molecular biology. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates are admitted based on their grade point averages as well as their 
commitment to their studies and scientific careers. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the program is to increase minority representation in the 
sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon completion of their studies at the community college, students are 
encouraged to transfer to Cal State L.A., where they receive expedited 
admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, eight students in the program, now in its third year, have made such 
a transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested community college students should contact Elain Carter at (213) 
953-4224 or Dennis Mitchell at (213) 953-4023. 
</P>
<P>
 High school students may inquire about the program, but they must enroll in 
the community college to participate.

BARDZ 'N THE STREET; FOUNDED FIVE YEARS AGO BY A MOTLEY COLLECTION OF POETS, 
THE HOMELESS WRITERS COALITION HAS SERVED AS AN ARTISTIC OUTLET FOR THOSE 
LIVING ON SKID ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 ON THE STREETS OF SKID ROW WHERE most people see despair, members of the 
Homeless Writers Coalition see poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 The world that unfurls each day amid the cardboard shelters, soup kitchens and 
crack corners stirs their muses. It is a world that inspires verses as gritty 
and hard-edged as the streets or as soft and dreamy as the people writing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded five years ago by a motley group of homeless poets who often gathered 
at an old Skid Row coffeehouse, the Homeless Writers Coalition has served as an 
outlet for artists living on "the Row" to flee their situation through words.  
</P>
<P>
 Some members moved on from the streets because of their work with the 
coalition, although the group was never intended to be a steppingstone. The 
prose was what mattered -- grass-roots, in-your-face, humanizing a social 
crisis that has dehumanized for too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just poetry, it's individuals becoming open, honest and human enough 
to expose the darkest moments," said poet and coalition member Eben Eldridge. 
"What they write about is not some ideology, it's reality, it's from direct 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Who are they  
</P>
<P>
 These Martyrs inside a box, awaiting the Designer?  
</P>
<P>
 Ribs showing through soiled T-shirt  
</P>
<P>
 Teeth rotting in their heads  
</P>
<P>
 Children's sticky faces aswarm with flies  
</P>
<P>
 White lips swollen and blistered from the sizzling crack pipes  
</P>
<P>
 The chaffed crinkled hides of overexposed faces.  
</P>
<P>
 It's painful for Robert Chambers to write such poems about what he sees on the 
streets near the Skid Row hotel where he lives. He remembers the situations and 
people about which he scribbles -- sometimes in the middle of the night -- all 
too vividly: The woman killed in her motel room in front of her children. 
Friends who got sucked into the maelstrom of the streets and died from drugs or 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers, 39, says he's a painter, not a writer. But it is writing that saved 
him from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the coalition three years ago, he bounced between flophouses 
and the streets, sliding into years of drinking and heavy drug use. The idea of 
resurrecting the creative writing he had abandoned years earlier pushed him 
into a drug rehabilitation program. He wrote three plays in his 11 months in 
rehab, a couple of which were produced for the coalition. He has since written 
numerous poems about his past and the bittersweet lives he sees on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Being part of the coalition put Chambers on the right track; he now lives in 
an SRO hotel, his rent money coming from monthly general relief checks and odd 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition itself has had ups and downs in its five years of existence: 
Membership has fluctuated as members died on the streets or went in and out of 
jail or simply disappeared. It's nearly impossible to keep tabs on its 
transient members. To top it off, the group's meager funds were stolen last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition was founded in May, 1989, at Another Planet coffee shop, a gas 
station-turned-coffeehouse that was a drug-free oasis for homeless poets and 
painters. Alexander (the Poet) Andersen, Willy (Dino) Lewis and Charles 
(Southern Comfort) Walker -- who often hung out there, scribbling their musings 
and sharing their inspirations -- decided on a whim to pool their talents. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted a vehicle to force themselves to write consistently and to open 
the door for broader audiences to see Skid Row's talents. At the start, the men 
often read their work aloud to passersby from napkins and tattered pieces of 
paper under a flood of fluorescent street lights. The poetry and collective 
readings unleashed a drive in coalition members and a passion for art and 
writing that they had either lost sight of or didn't know they had. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfort walked the streets looking for other men to add their prose to the 
group, while Dino and Andersen scouted for financial support to take their work 
beyond Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two months the coalition had 25 homeless men writing regularly. Within 
a year, it gained nonprofit status and recognition from local artists, city 
officials and university professors. Members were reading around the city, had 
received attention from literary organizations such as PEN Center West and were 
mentioned on the "Today" television show. But life on the streets of Los 
Angeles' Skid Row was never eclipsed by fleeting fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfort recruited Chambers to the coalition after the two had spoken a few 
times about poetry. At first, Chambers didn't think much of the conversations. 
He was living on the streets and still into drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 One day something changed. During one of their talks Comfort mentioned that 
the coalition needed some plays produced. A month later, Chambers checked 
himself into a rehab center. Eventually, writing for the coalition became a 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all had problems and the Homeless Writers Coalition was what helped us 
wake up every day and to keep sober," Comfort said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers has been sober for three years and has focused even more on his 
writing since becoming president of the coalition a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 His cluttered dorm-size room doubles as the organization's headquarters, boxes 
and drawers brimming with poetry and coalition flyers. A typewriter and 
answering machine fight for space on a small table near Chambers' single bed, 
while his paintings and drawings sit freely against a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers is one of the luckier ones who made it off the streets: Some of the 
homeless writers are sucked back into that life. Three coalition members have 
died -- two in a robbery and fight, another of leukemia. A few went in and out 
of jail or sobriety houses. Others, like Paul Johnson and Alvin Wright, always 
stayed on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be real wild and radical -- you know, fighting and stuff -- and I 
started writing and it stopped me from doing things I used to do," said 
Johnson, 36, who has been living in cardboard shelters along Towne and 5th 
streets off and on for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first members of the coalition, Johnson found his inspiration in 
his surroundings, basing characters on himself and his friends. He thought 
writing would help get him off the streets, make him famous. It did neither. 
None of his plays was ever produced, although plays by a couple of other 
coalition members were. So Johnson stopped writing. Now he just reads magazines 
or spiritual books. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, 42, had been writing poetry before joining the coalition, churning out 
100-page booklets of collections. He won the Los Angeles County Cultural 
Affairs Department's Self-Esteem Award in 1992 for his poems, which read more 
like rhyming inspirational speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 In living in the moment, you do it everyday.  
</P>
<P>
 If you want to live correctly, that's the only way.  
</P>
<P>
 When living in the moment you have to take it step by step.  
</P>
<P>
 So you don't have to spend your next moment asking for help.  
</P>
<P>
 Wright had been an active coalition member until he left without notice last 
month, moving South for work, Chambers learned after trying to track him down. 
</P>
<P>
 Catching up with coalition members is hard, Chambers complains, because hardly 
anyone has a phone or a beeper. He has to rely on word of mouth to pass on 
information about meetings or readings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Johnson, no relation to Paul, is one member who has always stayed 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 A slight, soft-spoken man, Johnson, 38, lives in a ramshackle room in a 
quake-damaged office building on 1st Street in Little Tokyo. Johnson works as 
the building's caretaker in exchange for the shelter. He writes novels and 
rarely reads his work with the coalition or shows the stories -- kept in large 
black notebooks -- to strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is the coalition's hustler, hawking cheap gold-plated jewelry for 
money that he splits 50-50 with the group. The coalition has been working from 
scratch to raise money since last year, when a former president allegedly 
absconded with the coalition's entire savings of about $9,000. No charges were 
ever filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was going to be used to open a cultural drop-in center for homeless 
artists and to regularly publish the group's newsletter. Instead, the coalition 
operates on the pittance that members are able to hustle on the street or from 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial constraints caused Chambers and coalition officials to open up 
the group in the past year. The membership, once dominated by African American 
homeless men, now includes women and artists of all ethnicities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some members were homeless in the past, such as Eben Eldridge; others had 
never been homeless. There are also members like Roland Porter Jr., who reads 
and sells much of his poetry on his own but collaborates with coalition members 
for special events, such as last month's Downtown arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not your typical homeless. I'm just this hippie that don't like to work a 
J-O-B," said Porter, who goes by Roland X. 
</P>
<P>
 X, 42, prides himself on never having stayed in Skid Row missions, although he 
slept in front of them when he came to Los Angeles in 1981. Instead, he sleeps 
in an old car on a quiet, industrial street in Marina del Rey, somewhere on 
Venice Beach, or he crashes at friends' homes in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the coalition in 1993 after meeting Chambers at a poetry reading. He 
is often one of the coalition's main readers at events and has received several 
poetry prizes since he began writing two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 X is a fast-talking, self-proclaimed Black Panther who is never without his 
trademark black beret and tosses his opinions about society and world affairs 
around like loose change. 
</P>
<P>
 His poems are sinewy creations about gang life or civil rights or world 
affairs, but never homelessness. Regardless, there is a kinship between X and 
the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about words that make people think," he said. "They're saying, 
'Anything you see before you could be you sometime.' You never know." 
</P>
<P>
 He mentions Chambers' poem about living in a cardboard shelter: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who are they, Inside a Box?  
</P>
<P>
 For it is you  
</P>
<P>
 But listen, what is that sound?  
</P>
<P>
 Listen, it is the sound of Revolution  
</P>
<P>
 From Inside a Box.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chambers is the driving force for getting the coalition back on its feet. His 
passion to see it succeed is tempered by discouragement at the lack of 
recognition and support the organization receives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The writing and plays are really good," he said in the soft, slow drawl that 
harks back to his Midwestern upbringing. "But it seems like you just utter that 
you're a homeless organization and it's like you're untouchable or something. 
People still don't like to deal with the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have experienced the homeless writers' work, the talents are 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys were good poets and had a God-given talent that you could hear in 
their work; they just happened to be homeless," said Al Nadel, general manager 
of the Los Angeles' Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadel has worked with the coalition since it started in 1989. He helped get 
the group a $2,500 grant during its infancy to develop a publication and to 
have members read their works at colleges, coffeehouses and other venues. He 
credits the coalition with getting several members back on their feet, like 
Southern Comfort.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Chambers is the coalition's driving force, Comfort is the group's 
creative soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfort's interest and his responsibility in the original coalition was solely 
creative -- writing, reading and performing. His poetry always tried to put a 
human face on the homeless people who lived on the street for those who didn't: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a distance they point, they stay away,  
</P>
<P>
 they stand back and stare, as if they possess  
</P>
<P>
 incomparable perfection  
</P>
<P>
 I feel as though I am surrounded by waiting enemies  
</P>
<P>
 Waiting to see me cringe, to see me cry out,  
</P>
<P>
 And because I am humane retaliation becomes no option  
</P>
<P>
 . . . My ruin is predicted, but my future is certain.  
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the broken bones will emerge  
</P>
<P>
 an eternal home as a reward:  
</P>
<P>
 A place for my peace to have Peace.  
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 Comfort, 38, found a place and a few odd jobs for himself in Palmdale, where 
he and his wife moved last year with their two children, ages 2 and 3. From 
January, 1990, until then, he and his wife lived in an SRO hotel Downtown after 
being homeless for three years. He is still active with the coalition, talking 
constantly on the phone with Chambers and coming into the city whenever 
possible.  
</P>
<P>
 Every day for three months in 1989 before forming the coalition, Comfort 
transformed a barren wall on 5th Street near San Pedro Street into a 
brilliantly colored display of poetic verses. Some were his, a few were by 
friends, and some were poignant phrases from books that captured the essence of 
the lives that revolved around the wall: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Some say it is a hellhole with no real love  
</P>
<P>
 They see us from the outside, not from within  
</P>
<P>
 We know they're not for us, they're not our friends  
</P>
<P>
 So we stay to ourselves and try to get along  
</P>
<P>
 And build a wall around  
</P>
<P>
 This funny little place called home.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The wall is the Homeless Writers Coalition's signature, Comfort said. Smack in 
the middle is the coalition name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time you look at the wall," Comfort said, "you're reminded of the 
coalition. So people can never forget it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were things in my way 
</P>
<P>
 I couldn't perceive 
</P>
<P>
 people I tried to deceive 
</P>
<P>
 bridges I burned but 
</P>
<P>
 should of left stand 
</P>
<P>
 others I crossed but I 
</P>
<P>
 should have blown up 
</P>
<P>
 nights when I could feel 
</P>
<P>
 the angels remorse 
</P>
<P>
 I clung to my unkempt dream 
</P>
<P>
 in the cellar of my brain 
</P>
<P>
 I believed that I had choices 
</P>
<P>
 and a way to the shore 
</P>
<P>
 I'm so glad I never dropped anchor when 
</P>
<P>
 I was falling apart

1994 PREP FOOTBALL ALL-STARS; CRENSHAW'S 4 FIRST-TEAM SELECTIONS LEAD THE WAY 
IN 3RD ANNUAL SQUAD

 Although several coaches opposed this season's new football playoff system in 
the City Section's 4-A and 3-A divisions, it did provide for some interesting 
matchups between City Times All-Stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, which last won the 3-A title in 1991, made an impressive postseason 
run on the strength of 1,000-yard rushers Farrel Payton and Brandon Seals, both 
all-star selections. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matchup featuring the Central City's most heated rivalry, Crenshaw 
defeated Dorsey, 26-19, in the 4-A semifinals to reach the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 That game featured six all-stars, including Payton, Seals, Todd Moore and 
Kabeer Smith of Crenshaw and Dorsey's Darius Wesber and Jemell Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Crenshaw faced top-seed Sylmar, which at 13-0 climbed as high as 
No. 5 in the Los Angeles Times' Top 20 Football Poll, yesterday at El Camino 
College in the 4-A title game.

 In the 3-A, first-year coach Henry Santiago guided Bell to its first football 
championship game in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell (11-3) hadn't been that good since 1992, when two key players were 
suspended for team-rules violations that dashed the Eagles' playoff hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles were led by first-team linebacker Dicky Purcell and second-team 
quarterback Gus Valenzuela, who passed for 1,613 yards and 20 touchdowns during 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell beat Birmingham, 25-3, Friday night at Gardena High for the City 3-A 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont, last season's 3-A runner-up, was bounced out of the 4-A playoffs by 
Banning in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 However, offensive lineman Steve Barragan had an outstanding year for the 
Pathfinders, reflected by his selection to the first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin, which is new to the Central City circulation area, had the leading 
passer in first-team quarterback Jeff Deno Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield's first-team all-star, Edgar Soto, led the area in rushing while 
playing in only eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' first-team wideout Anthony White, a junior, was the area's leader 
in pass receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 And Locke first-team running back Sirr Parker, who had another stellar season 
on a team that struggled, showed why he is being recruited by Division I 
programs such as Notre Dame, Nebraska, Florida State and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the top Central City players that starred for their 
respective teams in the regular season and the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections were based on ballots cast by area coaches, all of whom were asked 
to participate, and a poll of Times sportswriters: 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Deno Jr. (Franklin) -- Deno, a first-team All-Northern Conference 
selection at quarterback, led the Central City in passing. The southpaw was 190 
of 302 for 2,667 yards and 33 touchdowns. The Deno-to-Johnnie Sanders 
combination was the most productive in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Gonzales (Wilson) -- Gonzales finished the season as the area's 
second-leading passer with 2,303 yards and 25 touchdowns. With the All-Northern 
Conference selection at the helm, Wilson featured the Central City's most 
balanced offensive attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirr Parker (Locke) -- Parker is the area's most coveted recruit. The running 
back/kick returner -- who also played a little defensive back -- is a scoring 
specialist. Parker finished second in rushing during the regular season with 
1,129 yards and 16 touchdowns. The All-Southeastern Conference performer also 
scored twice on kickoff returns and ran back an interception for a 67-yard 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar Soto (Garfield) -- Soto amazingly led the area in rushing while playing 
in only eight games. He finished the season with 1,180 yards and 15 touchdowns 
in 205 carries. Soto averaged an area-best 144 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrel Payton (Crenshaw) -- Payton combined with Brandon Seals to give 
Crenshaw the area's top one-two rushing attack. Both rushed for over 1,000 
yards. The Pacific League's most valuable player had 108 carries for 1,075 
yards and 14 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie Sanders (Franklin) -- Along with Parker, Sanders is one of the Central 
City's top athletes. Sanders, Franklin's top weapon, led the area in receiving 
yardage (952) and was second in receptions (46) and touchdowns (17). 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony White (Los Angeles) -- White led the area in receptions with 53 and 
was second in yardage with 747. White also started at cornerback, leading the 
Romans with six interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Barragan (Fremont) -- Barragan was Fremont's most versatile player. A 
Southeastern Conference first-teamer, he lined up at tight end and defensive 
end. He has good speed at 6-2, 260 pounds and soft hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Moore (Crenshaw) -- Crenshaw's team captain, Moore plays both offensive 
and defensive line. Moore has made first-team All-Pacific League for the past 
two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Redoval (South Gate) -- Redoval is the best blocking tight end in the 
Central City. Redoval's blocking skills are so extraordinary that coach Gary 
Cordray platooned him at fullback to block for Hoffman Cortes. Redoval had 11 
receptions for 175 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Pentecost (Loyola) -- Pentecost is one of the best offensive linemen to 
come along in the Central City in years. He made first-team All-Del Rey League 
at tackle and is a major-college prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark McDonald (Loyola) -- McDonald made the All-Del Rey League team for the 
second consecutive season. In what coach Steve Grady called an "off-year," 
McDonald made two field goals and 25 of 28 extra-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Issac Hatley (Jefferson) -- Hatley was the best back in the area to never rush 
for 1,000 yards. He finished '94 with 845 yards and seven touchdowns in 161 
carries. Hatley also had seven receptions for 77 yards and two touchdowns. He 
returned 15 kickoffs for 400 yards and had 39 tackles and two sacks as a 
cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 Buster Bradley (Wilson) -- Bradley is the most versatile athlete in the area. 
He was selected Northern Conference Defensive Player of the Year at cornerback, 
where he had four interceptions-returning two for touchdowns -- and 39 solo 
tackles. At wide receiver, Bradley had 40 receptions for 750 yards and 11 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Jemell Gordon (Dorsey) -- Gordon was Dorsey's top defensive back. He was also 
selected first-team All-Pacific League as a running back. Gordon led the Dons 
in rushing with 73 carries for 723 yards and 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Whitehurst (Manual Arts) -- At 6-0, 175 pounds, Whitehurst used his size 
and strength to lead the Toiler cornerbacks in interceptions with seven -- four 
in the playoffs. Whitehurst was named to the Southeastern Conference's first 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Seals (Crenshaw) -- Seals, who played defensive back for the Cougars, 
is best known as the other half of Crenshaw's vaunted running game. The 
All-Pacific League selection rushed for 1,003 yards and six touchdowns during 
the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dicky Purcell (Bell) -- Purcell was selected first-team All-Southeastern 
Conference at inside linebacker. He was Bell's second-leading receiver with 37 
receptions for 555 yards and five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Darius Wesber (Dorsey) -- A first-team All-Pacific League linebacker, Wesber 
was Dorsey's best defensive player. He led the Dons in tackles and sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamar Lightburn (Manual Arts) -- Lightburn led Manual Arts in tackles with 85. 
The first-team All-Southeastern Conference linebacker also had five sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Eboni Wilson (Jefferson) -- An imposing figure on the defensive line, Wilson 
made his teammates look like midgets. Wilson, who was named Southeastern 
Conference Defensive Player of the Year, had 61 tackles and eight sacks. 
Wilson, who made Cal-Hi magazine's All-Strength Team, bench presses 410 pounds 
and squats 620 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kabeer Smith (Crenshaw) -- Nicknamed the "48-Minute Man" by Coach Robert 
Garrett, Smith plays at one speed -- overdrive. One of the top defensive 
players in the Southern Pacific Conference, Smith led the team in tackles (84), 
sacks (15) and fumble recoveries (3). 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Steen (Verbum Dei) -- A two-year varsity starter, Steen is the heart of 
the Verbum Dei defense. The lineman had 80 solo tackles, four sacks, two fumble 
recoveries and an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 These 23 players, along with their parents and coaches, will be guests of The 
Times at an awards brunch at 9 a.m. today at the University Holiday Inn in 
Downtown Los Angeles. The winners of the Central City back, lineman and coach 
of the year awards will be announced at the brunch.

FILM COMMENT; HOLLYWOOD JUST DOESN'T GET IT; TWO NEW FILMS DARE TO TACKLE THE 
SENSITIVE SUBJECT OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE . . . SHOWING US MEN 
HASSLED BY WOMEN. IS THIS EVOLUTION OR WHAT? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Earlier this year, many months before the appearance of "Oleanna" and 
"Disclosure," a network news show asked me to come up with a list of movie 
clips for a segment on sexual harassment. What seemed like an easy request 
turned into a real head-scratcher. Almost without exception, the examples were 
of the giggly-smirky variety. 
</P>
<P>
 There are tons of movies where bosses pinch or ogle their secretaries, but 
it's always played as a joke. Even when it's not endorsed as a joke, it's a 
joke -- like the "A Secretary Is Not a Toy" number from "How to Succeed in 
Business Without Really Trying." 
</P>
<P>
 Did I hear you mention "The Apartment"? But, in that movie, Shirley MacLaine 
is genuinely in love with the boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Where are the movies that show the unwelcome lunge; the power play; the fear? 
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of "Oleanna" and "Disclosure" isn't exactly a case of the famine 
turning into a feast. It's still a famine out there. As far as I can tell, 
Hollywood has never made a serious mainstream movie specifically about the 
effects of sexual harassment against women in the workplace. (Hollywood movies, 
as opposed to TV, try to stay out of the workplace altogether -- too "real.")  
</P>
<P>
 But now we've got two films that show us how men are harassed -- by women. As 
evolutionary leaps go, it's a great sick joke. What can we expect next? A 
searing drama starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a destitute welfare mother? 
</P>
<P>
 Right now it's OK for Meryl Streep to be harassed on a river raft but not at 
the office. Given how few serious films are funded in Hollywood about women's 
lives, and given the honchos at most studios, it would be surprising if there 
were any films out now that didn't posit sexual harassment as male 
victimization. 
</P>
<P>
 What both "Oleanna" and "Disclosure" are about is not so much sexual 
harassment as the abuse of the charge of sexual harassment. In David Mamet's 
movie version of his two-character play, a somewhat supercilious professor up 
for tenure is dragooned by one of his flunking female students into a morass of 
false harassment and rape charges that scotch his tenure and ruin his career. 
He ends up physically assaulting her -- he becomes the person he was falsely 
accused of being. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Disclosure," starring Demi Moore and Michael Douglas and directed by Barry 
Levinson from the Michael Crichton bestseller, Tom Sanders, a 
married-with-children executive at a Seattle high-tech computer company, is 
preyed upon by Meredith Johnson, an old girlfriend from another division who 
has been promoted over him. She is now his boss. Meredith initiates a sexual 
encounter in her office; he breaks it off; she charges harassment, he 
countercharges. It's he-said-she-said time at the corporate OK Corral. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mamet and Crichton -- whose book was dubbed "Harassic Park" when it came 
out -- have made a lot of noises in the press about how balanced their material 
is; how the hurts of men and women are given equal time. But what comes across 
in the play and the book and, now, in the movie adaptations, is essentially a 
rant against the destruction of male privilege. The destroyers are a frigid 
scold and a hothouse Circe. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we accept in "Oleanna" that both the professor (William Macy) and his 
student (Debra Eisenstadt) are equally culpable? Mamet may like the way that 
sounds but his movie sure doesn't play that way. The student's charges are 
patently false -- we can see that. And yet she somehow manages (offscreen) to 
persuade a tenure committee that she was harassed and raped; she blossoms from 
a frightened, insecure wallflower to a full-throated feminist squadron leader 
backed by the muscle of her "group." It is only on a phony-mythic level that 
"Oleanna" evens the playing field. The professor may be innocent of his 
student's specific charges but he is guilty of the larger charge of male 
power-mongering: He's a patriarch. Collective guilt turns him into a bogyman. 
</P>
<P>
 No sexual tension whatsoever exists between student and teacher; their faceoff 
is all ideology and sloganeering. If there is any consummation at all, it's in 
the final provoked assault against the woman (which the audience is made to 
crave). Mamet turns the dissonance between men and women into a screech. Some 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his afterword to "Disclosure," Crichton admits that the "great majority of 
harassment claims are brought by women against men" and defends the use of a 
role-reversal story for its power "to examine aspects concealed by traditional 
responses and conventional rhetoric." Fair enough. Even if one pauses at the 
way Crichton in the book self-servingly overstates the statistics on 
female-to-male harassment in order to give us the heebie-jeebies, the subject 
is still fair game. But in place of our "traditional responses" Crichton has 
inserted his own traditional agenda. Once again, as in "Oleanna," what is 
billed as a level (scorched-earth) playing field turns out to be a mirage. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath all its reverse-field politically correct rhetoric, "Disclosure" 
basically is a puritan cautionary fable about a power-thwarted man who turns 
the tables on a predatory vamp. Meredith is a veritable T. Rex of sex. Our 
first shot of her in the movie is a low-angle hubba-hubba glimpse of her gams. 
(Crichton was one of the film's producers.) It's odd: None of the Good women in 
the movie -- Tom's wife, his lawyer, co-workers -- are characterized as fully 
sexual beings. It's as if sex appeal was a malignancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Meredith really isn't sexual either: Her lunges are power plays. In 
the novel, Crichton served up a full women's chorus of feminist ranters, 
including a vitriolic newspaper columnist who refuses to believe that women can 
oppress men, and Tom's very own wife, a lawyer who mouths the party line and 
can't take more time out for her children. Tom's lawyer, a Latino woman, is 
lethally effective and yet her strength is as chilling and steely as 
Meredith's. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, scripted by Paul Attanasio, eliminates the columnist and ups the 
sympathy factor on the others but the only truly sympathetic woman is a 
starchy, fifty-something co-worker and mother who recognizes Tom's valuable 
contributions and lacks the asp of carnality. Her ambitiousness, unlike 
Meredith's, is acceptably prim. She gets her reward. Meredith, following in a 
long line of ruthless boss women in the movies, gets her comeuppance. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie initially shows us Tom in a few offhanded moments ogling a woman's 
rump or swatting his secretary's. But all this is innocent stuff. Basically Tom 
is no Oppressor. He's not even terribly ambitious -- he expected to be promoted 
to Meredith's position but apparently didn't think he had to angle for it. He's 
naive enough to believe the corporate world is a meritocracy and yet his 
naivete is his saving grace. It sentimentalizes him. 
</P>
<P>
 'D isclosure" comes out at a time when man-bashing has become part of the tone 
of the culture: It has even achieved Time cover-story status (a sure sign that 
the tone is fading). By transforming the fears of men who see their power being 
eroded by ambitious women in an increasingly competitive job market into a 
species of victimization, Crichton has pulled off a real switcheroo: He's given 
Pale Males official minority status, with all the rights and privileges 
thereof. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom even gets to have sex (sort of) with Meredith -- a woman much more 
exciting than his wife. And -- here's the best part -- he doesn't have to take 
any real responsibility for the sex. (First "Fatal Attraction," then "Basic 
Instinct," and now this. Michael Douglas must be royally pooped.) Tom's 
enforced submission is eroticized -- this could be the first heterosexual male 
rape fantasy ever depicted in a mainstream Hollywood movie. But because Tom 
doesn't go all the way with the sex he feels secretly emasculated, feminized. 
He even has a bizarre dream where his boss -- Meredith's mentor, played by 
Donald Sutherland -- tries to soul-kiss him. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom is only righted when he does to Meredith figuratively what she does to him 
literally. He's been to the dungeons of the vamp goddess -- the childless, 
familyless, castrating vamp -- and returns victorious to the meadows of 
domesticity where his adoring wife and daughter await. 
</P>
<P>
 Who says you can't have it all? 
</P>
<P>
 The impasse between men and women has become big business. It sells magazines 
and books and movies like "Disclosure" and "Oleanna." The hot field in science 
right now is evolutionary biology, which basically says that what keeps us 
apart is all in the genes. Maybe it is. Maybe men are wired from pre-birth to 
like "The Three Stooges" and women are wired to like "Fried Green Tomatoes." 
But there's a defeatism about these findings that fits into the way we feel -- 
if men and women are bio-genetically incapable of changing what keeps them at 
odds, then what's the use? Vive la difference went by the boards some time ago. 
Now it's more like Vive la guerre.  
</P>
<P>
 But are "Oleanna" and "Disclosure" the best bulletins from the battlefront 
that we can come up with? Both would be better if at least they acknowledged 
the author's real impulse, if they exploited all that messy male rage at what 
women hath wrought. What's bad about a movie like "Disclosure" isn't its glib, 
crass nastiness. That's what's fun about it. It's fun in the way that films 
noirs like "Double Indemnity" or the current "The Last Seduction" are. Hate is 
a turn-on in those films; the gun smoke from the war between the sexes is their 
oxygen. No, what is bad about "Disclosure" are the constant irruptions of 
sanctimony, as if we were watching a civics lesson and not a ripping revenge 
fantasy. Why not just lay out all the demons and can the cant? 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe when this latest backlash fades we can actually have a movie about a 
woman who is sexually harassed by a man. 
</P>
<P>
 What a concept!*

FILM CLIPS / GRRRLS WILL BE GRRRLS: RETURN OF THE ULTRAPUSSYCATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Chris Willman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the first and last word in "riot grrrl" movies, albeit about three 
decades ahead of its time. And now "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!," the classic 
black-and-white low-budgeter from that avatar of big-breasted feminism, Russ 
Meyer, is back in theatrical release, to claim the honor it was denied the 
first time out. 
</P>
<P>
 The prescient "Pussycat" was launched in 1966 to the brickbats of hostile 
reviewers and dumbfounded drive-in owners, whose operative thinking at the time 
seemed to be: Faster, distributor! Pull! Pull! Commercially, "it was a loser, 
absolute loser," recalls Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet its legend has loomed quite larger over time, and the video-fed cultists 
purring its praises are legion. No less a cineaste than John Waters -- writing 
in his book "Shock Value" -- turned ultimate blurb-meister in lauding Meyer's 
magnum opus as "not only the best movie ever made, but the best movie that ever 
will be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters, who counts "Pussycat" as a seminal youthful influence, expresses 
delight about its re-release to art theaters -- "It's great revisionist 
distribution" -- and still holds to his original superlatives: "I think it ages 
like fine wine. It didn't used to be politically correct, and now it is. I 
guess it's politically correct for three gay women to kill men that get on 
their nerves these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, of the film's three not-so-kittenish female leads, only one appears 
definably lesbian, while another has an insatiable appetite for hunky male 
flesh, and the leader of the pack probably operates on either current. What 
these three deadly, vacationing go-go dancers all do have in common is a taste 
for cheap thrills, a lack of any remotely redeeming qualities, a certain 
voluptuousness and the individual ownership of a fine sports car, meaning that 
murder easily complements drag-racing on their desert sojourn. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the picture, one of the women, a martial arts expert, kills an 
innocent man with her bare hands. But you really know just how bad the girls 
are when, just a few minutes later, flush with depravity, they gas up at a 
filling station and pull away without waiting for their Blue Chip stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out with a picture for drive-ins called 'Motor Psycho,' with three bad 
boys; it did a hell of a lot of business in passion pits," says Meyer, 72. "So 
I told my wife, Eve, 'I've got a great idea, we'll do it with three bad girls 
.' She said, 'Are you sure it's gonna work?' I said, 'Absolutely.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't work. Distributors didn't know what it meant -- they didn't 
understand these women, one of whom appeared to be (pining) for the tough one 
-- and they took it off. Then it was discovered in colleges. And feminist 
groups found it of interest. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything -- more than Waters' salesmanship, even -- Meyer credits 
the tough sex appeal of Tura Satana (the chief grrrl) for its endurance over 
the years. (Satana is now married and living in Nevada; Haji appeared in two 
more Meyer pictures and has continued to act, but Meyer has lost track of 
blonde Lori Williams.) 
</P>
<P>
 Director Keir McFarlane recently paid tribute to the film with a Janet Jackson 
video, "You Want This," featuring the singer and her female posse in Porsches, 
tauntingly driving circles around two guys in the desert -- an acknowledged 
homage to "Pussycat." 
</P>
<P>
 "Homage? Whatever they want to call it is fine," Meyer says. "Look at Ridley 
Scott. What is that film he did with the two girls ("Thelma & Louise")? 
</P>
<P>
 "He copied the whole scam. It's fine, I appreciate it, it's great. . . . Just 
don't pilfer the film itself." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no nudity -- just deep cleavage -- and nothing that couldn't be shown 
on TV, even, in "Pussycat." And Meyer went on to do two studio pictures, "The 
Seven Minutes" and the Roger Ebert-scripted "Beyond the Valley of the Dolls." 
But most of his subsequent films traded more obviously on his famous 
predilection for the topless and top-heavy female form. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer hasn't directed a feature since 1979's "Beneath the Valley of the 
Ultravixens." In the meantime, he's kept busy as prestigious film festivals 
both here and abroad -- such as next month's tribute at the National Film 
Theatre in London -- have presented serious retrospectives of his work. 
Curators as well as critics have elevated Meyer to an auteur pantheon shared by 
no other directors known primarily for their "soft-core" canon. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's been at work for years on an extensive autobiography, "A Clean 
Breast: The Life and Loves of Russ Meyer" (title and foreword by Ebert), due 
out next year in an expensive, limited-edition, slip-covered three-volume set. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer does have plans to embark on another feature soon, based on a treatment 
he and Ebert came up with. "The Bra of God" is planned as the story of a 
misogynist who dies and accidentally goes to heaven, where he meets up with 
God's wife, "who's like Margaret Dumont, only she's younger and her breasts are 
larger." He's sent to Earth for 30 days to reconcile himself to womanhood -- 
only to meet his match in 10 of the deadliest femmes fatale imaginable. 
</P>
<P>
 And, per usual, there will be explosive action as well as sex therein? 
</P>
<P>
 "Women beating the (expletive) out of men," Meyer says. "And the sex will be 
my kind of sex: boisterous, voluptuous -- no hard-core, of course -- and 
extremely heroic." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!" is in limited release at the Sunset 5, 8000

FILM CLIPS / AROUND 'CITY HALL': HOW'S AL PACINO DOING, ED KOCH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't be surprised to see Hiz zoner Al Pacino catnapping on the job in "City 
Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of the real-life idiosyncrasies the actor, who plays the mayor of New 
York in director Harold Becker's drama due next fall, picked up recently while 
hanging around with some of the Big Apple's present and past political 
luminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacino has met with ex-mayors Ed Koch and David Dinkins, as well as the 
incumbent, Rudolph Giuliani. While Pacino declined to talk about the meetings, 
the irrepressible Koch had plenty to say about the meeting and two dinners he 
had with the actor the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted me to talk about my life as mayor, about my routine, about how I 
spent my time in the car," Koch says. "I spent a lot of time dictating to my 
press secretary because you have to use every moment. Because I'd get up every 
morning at 5:30, I'd maybe get five hours of sleep. There was a lot of 
catnapping in the car, 10 minutes at a time. Occasionally, I would sleep 
standing up in the subway." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the press caught him slumbering on the public's dime, Koch would snip: 
"I couldn't care less." 
</P>
<P>
 He gave Pacino plenty of tips on how to deal with the press: "You've got to 
feed that piranha or they'll eat you. The print press is the least helpful -- 
go for the radio; it's the best." 
</P>
<P>
 While Koch's input may add to Pacino's role, director Becker says the role is 
primarily based on two other role models: Fiorello LaGuardia, one of New York's 
most beloved mayors who reigned over the city in the '30s and '40s, and 
recently ousted New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cuomo is a great orator and LaGuardia was truly a man of the people," says 
Becker. "You may even see a little of Mark Antonio, the congressman from New 
York, in Pacino's character. All of these men were strong populist, charismatic 
leaders. This film is a political drama, but more than that it's about 
struggling with character and moral dilemmas. It's about the relationships of 
the people who govern, and light that's shed into the very darkest of places." 
</P>
<P>
 The plot involves three murders, those of a boy, a police officer and a drug 
dealer, which eventually lead to the unraveling of major political corruption. 
The story was written by Ken Lipper ("Wall Street"), a former deputy mayor of 
New York under Koch from 1983 to 1985. The script was rewritten by Bo Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The tale turns on the relationship between the young, idealistic chief deputy 
mayor, played by John Cusack, and his somewhat jaded boss, Mayor John Pappas 
(Pacino), a veteran of the greased-palm school of political dealmaking.  
</P>
<P>
 "In many ways this is a thriller," says Lipper. "It's about the dilemma of the 
person wielding power and how much of a price he pays to do that."*

 GRAND PRIX ; THIS VENICE RESTAURANT IS SMALL, BUT SO ARE ITS PRICES: A 
FOUR-COURSE MEAL FOR $30 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The location must have what can only be called good karma. After all, Hans and 
Mary Rockenwagner cooked up a storm in this tiny Venice space before moving on 
to larger quarters in Santa Monica. Then fledgling chef Joe Miller moved in, 
and he has been turning out his hugely appealing, all-American cooking for 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Come to dinner at Joe's any night, and he is in the kitchen cooking. That's 
more unusual than it seems at first. This is one chef who is not jetting around 
the country or consulting for a number of restaurants. (Miller does have a 
second restaurant, Reed's, in Manhattan Beach, where partner Brandon Reed mans 
the stoves.) Joe's is the equivalent of a small French or Italian restaurant 
where you find the same waiter, the same cook, the same patron year after year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice storefront, with just four tables inside the door, a handful of 
seats at the bar and a slot at the back where you can get a glimpse of the 
kitchen, also includes a long, newly remodeled corridor with lined-up tables, 
halogen lighting and whimsical gilt-framed, food-themed drawings depicting the 
beloved Babar and friends. Miller added double doors to an adjoining patio 
where, come warm weather, he'll be seating outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's cooking is highly personal, homey and uncontrived. He changes the 
menu seasonally, adding special appetizers or entrees. Every night he offers 
two four-course prix fixe menus at $30 and $38. Each has two choices for 
everything except dessert, but who's going to argue with a deep-dish blueberry 
cobbler or cranberry-apple crisp or feel shorted by warm chocolate souffle cake 
served with vanilla ice cream? Ever flexible, Miller lets you order a la carte 
off the prix fixe menu and vice versa.  
</P>
<P>
 However you order, he's offering a lot for the money. Let me recount one 
recent $30 prix fixe meal. I begin with an emerald green arugula salad topped 
with two fat bacon-wrapped scallops, followed by a sweetly spiced butternut 
squash soup, a juicy pork loin served with earthy mashed potatoes, a scattering 
of wild mushrooms and the roast's garlic-spiked natural juices. And for 
dessert, that classic berry cobbler.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller doesn't excel only in the set choices. A special, braised lamb shank, 
is absolutely seductive: tender and succulent, tastiest close to the bone. The 
pairing of the lamb with soft pillows of eggplant gnocchi tossed with nuggets 
of braised eggplant, homemade sun-dried tomatoes and basil makes this dish 
outstanding. Next to it, another special of monkfish rolled with tomato and 
basil, presented as a row of medallions atop saffron risotto, seems merely 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller will sometimes take one idea and rework it to suit the seasons. Some 
weeks ago, he made a wonderful Southern quail salad with roasted pecans and 
homemade ranch dressing. He recently offered an appetizer of roast quail 
stuffed with pear and bacon with a terrific salad of greens and cornbread 
doused with a puckery, delicious vinaigrette. These first courses take a long 
time -- the quail's fault, explains the waiter. Fortunately, there's a basket 
of home-baked breads to occupy the time, including thick slices of warm ivory 
brioche. Each of the meals I've eaten at Joe's has been almost agonizingly 
slow, but once the food arrives, it is worth the wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller does have a tendency to oversauce, however, setting a beautiful piece 
of salmon and fragrant basil mashed potatoes on a plate awash in thin, tart 
citrus sauce. Grilled rib eye one night is drowned in a balsamic vinegar-butter 
sauce. But his ravioli stuffed with delicate chanterelles is all the more 
satisfying served in a richly flavored wild mushroom broth. There are 
occasional technical glitches, too. The warm onion tart's pastry is tough, the 
tarte tatin 's like layered cardboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The wait staff is unfailingly good-natured and enthusiastic about the food. 
They are thoughtful in recommending dishes, will answer questions patiently and 
don't pretend to have tasted a dish when they haven't. Joe's is also one of the 
few restaurants open late, even on weekdays.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller keeps to a simple, one-page, mostly California wine list. The '93 
Sauvignon Blanc from Ojai Vineyards is good for the price ($21), or try the '92 
Sancerre from Paul Cotat ($36). The '92 Merlot from Silverado Vineyards ($35) 
also suits this food beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the night, when Miller makes the rounds of the tables, it seems 
less like a star turn than a genuine concern for his customers. This shy, 
clean-cut chef clearly loves what he does, and maybe that's why Joe's feels 
like such a warmhearted place. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe's Restaurant, 1023 Abbot Kinney Blvd., Venice; (310) 399-5811. Beer and 
wine. Valet and lot parking in rear. No smoking allowed. Closed Mondays. Dinner 
for two, food only, $50-$70. Corkage $8.

COMMENTARY; THERE'S NO DROUGHT OFF BROADWAY; NEW PLAYS BY JON ROBIN BAITZ AND 
TONY KUSHNER PROVE THAT THERE'S STILL JUICE ON THE NEW YORK STAGE -- YOU'VE 
JUST GOT TO LOOK FOR IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Laurie Winer, Laurie Winer is The Times' theater critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neil Simon and his producer, Manny Azenberg, decide to open "London Suite" Off 
Broadway and confirm what everyone knows about the state of theater inside the 
most beautiful theaters in the world, the ones on Broadway where neither 
producers nor ticket-buyers can afford to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring Broadway, however, the new season in New York is fairly rich in 
plays, even without Neil Simon. As always, New Yorkers love to bitch about how 
the theater is virtually dead, even as they hail a cab for the Manhattan 
Theatre Club or the Public or Lincoln Center and fill up the tables at Joe 
Allen and Orso. 
</P>
<P>
 This season boasts a variety of terrific voices on display, in plays with 
settings as diverse as Upstate New York, Cucamonga (a.k.a. Sam Shepardville), 
Moscow and heaven. Jon Robin Baitz has set his new play in South Africa, where 
he spent a part of his childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called "A Fair Country," and the night I attended a workshop production 
at Naked Angels -- a kind of East Coast Actors Gang -- celebrities were 
everywhere. There was Eric Bogosian speaking intensely with a woman, and Paul 
Rudnick joking with producer Scott Rudin while a semi-bearded man I believe to 
be Ethan Hawke waited to bend Rudin's ear. 
</P>
<P>
 So, OK, is the playwright merely well-connected or hot? (A recent front-page 
story in the New York Times' Arts & Leisure section dubbed Baitz and his 
partner, writer-director Joe Mantello, "Couple of the Moment in New York 
Theater.") 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is no, he is not merely hot. That Jon Robin Baitz -- a gifted and 
not particularly commercial playwright obsessed with the thorniest moral 
problems of our time -- is a darling of the people who produce, write and star 
in mass-release movies is, to me, a very heartening thing. If anyone needs one, 
it's a reminder that theater is essential and filters down to all levels of 
mass cultural consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Fair Country" is titled not so much with irony as with subversion: The play 
centers on a white American family struggling to stay sane in South Africa in 
the 1970s. (An earlier version called "Dutch Landscape" was considered the 
nadir of the Mark Taper Forum's 1988 season; it garnered reviews so terrible 
that they sent the playwright reeling into seclusion -- and into a major 
re-evaluation of his art. The current, thoroughly overhauled version is slated 
for a Lincoln Center production next year.) Baitz offers a landscape where no 
one can be saved from the moral stench that defines it. As one character puts 
it, "There is no harbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Alec (Patrick Breen), the oldest son, reaches outside the ivory tower of his 
parents' Durban home by cultivating friendships with young black students who 
are suspected members of the African National Congress. Later, Alec further 
distances himself both physically and psychically from the professional 
deception his father regularly practices in his post with the U.S. Information 
Agency -- he goes to Columbia University in New York to study journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry (Ron Rifkin), the father, is a poetry-and-dance-loving diplomat who 
packages American culture for the South Africans and sells it on his Voice of 
America radio show; beyond that, Harry's employer implicitly requests he 
pretend that everything in South Africa is how it should be. Occasionally, more 
nefarious requests are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry has been posted in South Africa for too long; his manic-depressive wife, 
Patrice (Maria Tucci), is becoming hysterical and is clinging inappropriately 
to her younger son, Gil (Matt McGrath). She calls the police when a black maid, 
whom she has slapped, fights back. When the police arrive, it is a black 
policeman who strikes the maid, sending her flying against a brick wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy," Gil says of the incident. "I thought, 'Just shut her up.' " Yet 
Gil's cross is that he fully feels the horror of what he is becoming. In his 
schoolboy clothes he is already a member of the white elite, "going rotten, 
hating people, and lying about it, like they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Each member of the family is so isolated in his particular anguish that their 
attempts to help each other are doomed to misfire. Harry is desperate to get 
his family out of South Africa, but no promotion is forthcoming. In the hope of 
securing a European posting, he trades some information, but his good 
intentions are meaningless in a place where good can only be perverted into 
hideousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Harry gets his European posting, in The Hague. It's New Year's Eve, 
1980. Carter is a lame-duck President; Reagan calls the Iranians barbarians 
while perhaps secretly negotiating the release of the hostages on the eve of 
his inauguration. Baitz's gift for placing personal cost in a larger historical 
moment rivals Arthur Miller's. The moral abyss that Harry inhabits seems 
reflected onto the world at large, making it all the more inescapable. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, President Carter's thwarted attempts to do good seem inextricably 
linked to Harry, who feels himself sinking beyond hope just as he finally frees 
his family from South Africa. But what's done can't be undone, and the family 
is torn asunder, even as its members acknowledge that their love for each other 
is as unerasable as their deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackling another historical moment in an even tinier and more downtown 
theater, the New York Theatre Workshop, Tony Kushner examines the 
near-religious fervor that gave birth to socialism and all of the destruction 
that fervor eventually caused. 
</P>
<P>
 I saw an early preview of "Slavs! (Thinking About the Longstanding Problems of 
Virtue and Happiness)," which is directed by Lisa Peterson, who did such a 
superb job at the La Jolla Playhouse last season with Kushner's adaptation of 
Brecht's "The Good Person of Setzuan" and Pierre Marivaux's "The Triumph of 
Love." This production will probably be seen in the near future either at the 
La Jolla Playhouse or the Mark Taper Forum (or both). 
</P>
<P>
 While there is virtually no drama in the play, there are mysterious and 
beautiful images, and the writing is gorgeous. Kushner's play is only 
marginally about the people affected by the failure of politics; it centers 
more on those people's feelings about the ideas that fostered the practical 
reality in which they now find themselves. Aleksii Antedilluvianovich 
Prelapsarianov (Joseph Wiseman), the world's oldest Bolshevik, who delivered 
the prologue to the second part of "Angels in America," returns, only to die 
from too much speechifying. 
</P>
<P>
 As in "Perestroika," Prelapsarianov decries the "sour little age" in which we 
live without a "beautiful theory," a "system of thought," and he cries when he 
recalls the euphoria of first reading the "classic text": "You cannot imagine 
it. I weep for you." When he dies, a comrade sagely suggests, "His heart had 
good reason to murder his mind!" 
</P>
<P>
 One of his comrades, Upgobkin (Gerald Hiken), is ready for more than reform -- 
he urges a leap into the future. "You can only crawl so far and then leap, or 
life will toss you in the air!" he exclaims while joyously leaping, like a 
deranged ballerina, around the stage, over the body of Prelapsarianov. 
</P>
<P>
 Kushner depicts the Russia wrought by all of this "beautiful theory," which, 
it turns out, had as much to do with people's lives and was as wise about human 
nature as a lunatic cult. Prelapsarianov's beautiful dream turns out to be 
nothing but wishful thinking, repression and greed, and its legacy to the 
people is overt misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those living with the mistakes of the motherland on their backs are a 
beautiful lesbian alcoholic (not exactly typecasting for Marisa Tomei, who is 
very good), and her lover, a doctor (Mary Shultz, also excellent), who tries to 
help the people living above nuclear waste, whose children do not have long to 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 One child, Vodya (Mischa Barton), is mute and looks at the world through sad, 
accusing eyes. She gets to speak her piece when she arrives in heaven (or some 
place that is not Earth) and meets her "grandfathers," the architects of the 
hell below. She, apparently, is one of the "Pygmy children of a gigantic race" 
that Prelapsarianov moaned about, one of those without theory. But when these 
two meet, it is touchingly without blame and with a shared regret for 
everything that cannot be changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kushner sets the play in a cold climate where people love debate as much as he 
does -- in Moscow circa 1985, where two old women sweeping the Kremlin steps 
debate the value of violence when it is used to create an improved version of 
society. This is not a place where teen-agers don't know their state capital. 
You can feel Kushner's wish for a country in which people argued with the 
intensity of Louis Ironson, the guilt-plagued protagonist of "Angels in 
America," for a place where ideas are important. 
</P>
<P>
 That role (Louis) was played by none other than Joe Mantello, who directed 
Donald Margulies Broadway debut of "What's Wrong With This Picture" and 
Terrence McNally's Off Broadway production of "Love! Valour! Compassion!" (In 
this latter play, McNally establishes the reflective atmosphere in a country 
house on a succession of holiday weekends. Again, the playwright employs a 
setting that allows for poetry, a place suitable for characters with a 
predisposition to mull over love, life, eternity.) 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa, Moscow, Upstate New York. This season, all three settings are 
perfect places for words to unroll their vast magic in the only art in which 
language and image are equally important and inextricably bound. Perhaps these 
plays are an answer to the bitter heart of Prelapsarianov, who asks no one in 
particular, "Show me the words that will change the world, or else keep 
silent."*

COMMENTARY; SERRANO'S CRITICS MISSED THE POINT; A SURVEY OF ANDRES SERRANO 
PHOTOGRAPHS IN PHILADELPHIA SHOWS THAT ALL HIS WORK, INCLUDING 'PISS CHRIST,' 
FOCUSES ON CAMERA'S ABILITY TO LIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Christopher Knight, Christopher Knight is a Times art critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first time I saw Andres Serrano's big 1987 Cibachrome photograph "Piss 
Christ," it hadn't yet acquired the national notoriety that subsequently 
engulfed it. At the time -- just about a year after it had been made -- I 
didn't pay much attention to the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Piss Christ" was one of several flashy images by the artist installed in a 
traveling group exhibition at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. All of the 
young artist's work (he was 38) had an aggressive graphic punch, and the 
pictures reminded me of slick advertisements -- especially of those 
lit-from-behind ads you find on bus shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 The works' clout was propelled not by content but by technique and style: 
bright, saturated, sometimes lurid colors; big, attention-grabbing size; 
simple, uncomplicated imagery; a kind of cool laminated look that played 
against the hot colors, a look that was achieved by attaching the photograph 
with silicone to a sheet of plexiglass. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographs seemed rather desperate in their calculated effort to seduce. 
(This was the late 1980s, remember, when the art clamor was reaching fever 
pitch.) Their sense of calculation also extended to the showy photographic 
subject matter -- a hanged dog, a plastic crucifix, a pool of blood -- which 
recorded a litany of topical subjects of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Pervasive violence, born-again Christianity, innocently tainted blood -- it 
wasn't the look-at-me calculation of his art that was bothersome but the 
illustrational obviousness of its rhetoric. I didn't give Serrano's photographs 
a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not, that is, until about 10 months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the spring of 1989, I watched wide-eyed as the Rev. Donald E. 
Wildmon, a conservative minister in Tupelo, Miss., and founder of the old 
National Federation for Decency, together with his redoubtable agents in the 
U.S. Senate, Alphonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) and Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), lit out 
after Serrano as if he were the devil incarnate and "Piss Christ" the gaping 
maw of hell. What could they possibly have found in Serrano's flashy but 
fatuous photograph to incite such evil-minded wrath? 
</P>
<P>
 Not much, as it turns out -- although, what I perceived to be the picture's 
obviousness was evidently lost on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge they lodged against Serrano's photograph was blasphemy against the 
Christian religion. While "Piss Christ" does speak ill of several things, the 
Christian God is not among them. 
</P>
<P>
 A mid-career survey of 52 Serrano photographs from the last 10 years, recently 
opened at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia, shows that, like 
all of his work, what "Piss Christ" speaks ill of first and foremost is 
photography's pernicious capacity to dissemble. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera's ability to lie, falsify, fabricate and mislead -- all in the most 
glamorously convincing ways -- is the artistic pivot around which Serrano's 
work always turns. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that photographs lie is, of course, neither an original nor an 
earth-shattering observation. It is, in fact, part of the camera's wily charm, 
not to mention the bottom-line reason photographs can be compelling art. 
</P>
<P>
 The moldy 19th-Century debate over whether or not photography could be art 
hinged on accepting the misperception that a camera is a neutral, transparent 
observer of whatever scene passes before its viewfinder. If it is, art wouldn't 
stand a chance, except as a way to isolate and, therefore, valorize its 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 But the camera isn't neutral or transparent. Knowing that camera images 
conceal at least as much as they reveal is a ground zero for Postmodern art. 
Serrano, like countless photographers before or since, makes pictures whose 
dissembling nature is essential to his enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 As for spiritual blasphemy, "Piss Christ" specifically speaks ill of the 
camera's capacity to lie even in the face of sacred subjects. As a picture, the 
photograph is all slick, Technicolor splendor, achieved in Serrano's studio as 
it is at Paramount or MGM: with the aid of props, carefully orchestrated 
lighting and colored gels. 
</P>
<P>
 The background field of the radiant altar-size photograph is a deep, rich 
crimson; the crucifix rising before it is irradiated with a golden glow. Tiny 
bubbles proliferate across the picture's surface, as if the tortured body of 
Christ is being seen submerged in the translucent blood of his spectacular 
Passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you already know the title of the photograph and the artist's method, 
you have no way of knowing how the picture was actually produced: by 
photographing a carefully lit dime-store crucifix propped inside a small glass 
container filled with the artist's urine. 
</P>
<P>
 This extra-visual revelation of the subject's actual tawdriness and debasement 
is critical to Serrano's enterprise. He wants you to be tempted, seduced and 
taken in by the sacred image -- hence, the calculated advertising style -- then 
smacked across the face with the sorry news of what went on behind the camera's 
duplicitous lens. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, "Piss Christ" was made in 1987. That was the banner year for 
exposure of shocking humiliations in a new form of religious enterprise, which 
was based on the deceptive power of the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, evangelical television ministries that had blossomed into potent 
empires during the previous decade were threatening to topple in the wake of 
trashy sex-and-money scandals. As vulgar stories of hypocrisy and criminality 
unfolded in the press, the nation was held in thrall. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the center ring of the modern media circus was held by Tammy Faye 
and Jim Bakker. The pair were dragged blubbering from their lofty thrones atop 
the PTL Club -- Praise the Lord! -- by their pious rival in the televised 
fire-and-brimstone trade, Jimmy Swaggart (who soon had prostitute problems of 
his own). Jim was sent up the river, Tammy Faye to a rehab clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Falwell scolded from the sidelines and briefly took the reigns of PTL 
but soon resigned, wary of the taint. Finally, he stepped down as head of the 
Moral Majority as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Oral Roberts, the father of the lucrative television-ministry idea, gave 1987 
a fitting send-off. He claimed that God had whispered in his ear that he was 
going to die -- unless, of course, dedicated viewers stuffed $8 million into 
envelopes and mailed them to Tulsa by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano's "Piss Christ" is a reflection on these brazen goings-on. It shows a 
gorgeous and seductive image of faith and redemption fabricated from filth. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture blasphemes neither God nor the Christian Savior. It does speak ill 
of media-manipulated ministries like the Bakkers', which were using the 
incomparable reach and authority of their dissembling cameras to lie and extort 
in the name of spiritual salvation, and on a scale that would make Elmer Gantry 
blush. 
</P>
<P>
 Like I say, that commentary seemed pretty obvious when I first saw Serrano's 
work at the L.A. County Museum. Today, after all the nonsense that has 
transpired, it still does. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, if a picture of a wood-and-plastic crucifix submerged in urine is 
supposedly intended to blaspheme Christianity, what is a urine-filtered picture 
of a plaster reproduction of Myron's famous antique sculpture of a discus 
thrower -- which Serrano also made -- intended to blaspheme? Ancient Greek 
sports? 
</P>
<P>
 "Piss Discus," which followed "Piss Christ" but predates the enchanting 
Wildmon-D'Amato-Helms display of good old-fashioned American Philistinism, is 
an ordinary artistic extrapolation on its extravagant predecessor. This equally 
glamorous picture likewise uses human waste as a critical filter, through which 
to examine the peculiarly modern debasement of art. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano had been using fluids associated with the human body -- milk, blood, 
urine -- since 1985. In 1989 these were joined by semen. As materials, these 
fluids were loaded dice, given contemporaneous political fistfights around such 
subjects as HIV and drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
 The current ICA exhibition pre sents Serrano's photographs in groups, which 
approximates the way he works. In addition to the large group of body-fluid 
pictures, there are portraits of homeless men and women, hooded Ku Klux 
Klansmen, Catholic nuns and clergy and, most recently, dead people laid out on 
slabs at the morgue. 
</P>
<P>
 Each body of work is stylistically consistent with his earliest pictures: An 
aura of seductive advertising prevails, regardless of whether the subject 
matter is horrific or benign. Similarly, whether it's the elaborate robes of a 
Klanswoman or a nun, or the severe shroud of a homeless person's rags or a dead 
man's clinical mortuary sheet, the familiar Postmodern conundrum of concealment 
stands front and center. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a narrow sameness to Serrano's art, but the resultant potential for 
highly concentrated, laser-like insight is undermined by the general 
shallowness of the enterprise. As simple illustration, "Piss Christ" finally 
tells us nothing we hadn't already read in the papers, nor does it create a 
useful replacement for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if I don't have much use for Serrano's photographs, I am nonetheless 
grateful to ICA for having assembled the exhibition and its often informative 
catalogue. (The show will travel to New York, Miami, Houston and Chicago.) It 
answers many questions left hanging in the wake of the vicious hurricane of 
publicity whipped up around the artist. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, it's clear that the show's curator, ICA Director Patrick T. 
Murphy, does have faith in the significance of Serrano's work. The museum is 
doing its job. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is doing its job with grace and courage, which is more than can be said 
for many art institutions these days. This is the museum, after all, that 
organized the Robert Mapplethorpe retrospective, which, along with Serrano's 
lone photograph, incited 1989's congressional riot over funding for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 The ICA, after facing hysterical threats and intimidation, and despite the 
not-uncommon institutional practice today of basing artistic decisions on fear 
of reprisals from the federal government, is standing behind the art in which 
it believes. Praise the Lord.

COLUMN ONE; FAA'S SAFETY RESPONSE RECORD HITS TURBULENCE; OVER THE PAST DECADE, 
THE AGENCY HAS BEEN SLOW TO HEED SAFETY WARNINGS -- SOMETIMES ACTING ONLY AFTER 
FATAL CRASHES, ACCORDING TO A TIMES STUDY. 
</P>

<P>
 As USAir Flight 1493 prepared to touch down at Los Angeles International 
Airport on Feb. 1, 1991, passenger David Richman, a Harvard-educated college 
professor and proud new father, knew nothing about the potential danger of 
runway collisions. Nor did any of the other 33 people who were about to die 
that Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Federal Aviation Administration did know. 
</P>
<P>
 As far back as 1983, records show, air safety experts had urged FAA action to 
do more to prevent runway accidents. Even within the agency, officials had 
prodded their superiors to expedite ground-based radar systems and relatively 
inexpensive traffic lighting systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA did take those actions and more -- but only after Flight 1493 suddenly 
landed atop a Skywest commuter plane, killing 34 people. This was the third 
fatal runway collision in the United States in 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many crashes do you need?" asked Barry M. Sweedler, director of safety 
recommendations for the National Transportation Safety Board. "If you have one, 
there should never be another one with the same problem. Why do we need two, 
three, four or five?" 
</P>
<P>
 In dozens of instances over the past decade, the FAA has taken two years or 
more to respond to repeated warnings of air safety problems, and the agency 
often has acted only after loss of life, according to a four-month study by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA, the federal agency responsible by law for ensuring air safety, has 
been named by the NTSB as a cause or factor in 103 airplane accidents and 
incidents between 1983 and last July that together killed 574 and injured 421. 
</P>
<P>
 And records also show that hundreds more people have died in crashes caused by 
problems to which the FAA had been alerted but failed to act. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to runway collisions, these problems included turbulence caused by 
the wings of Boeing 757 jetliners, procedures for de-icing wings before 
takeoff, the refurbishment of aging aircraft, passenger access to emergency 
exits and the installation of devices that warn if a plane is flying too low. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said safety is the agency's "No. 1 job," David Hinson, the 
administrator of the FAA, said of the list of lapses: "I think you've put your 
finger on something that we're really trying to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 While Hinson was unfamiliar with the specific areas The Times was focusing on 
-- most of which preceded his arrival in 1993 -- he said: "Hopefully, we'll be 
more responsible in quicker fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 FAA officials say the agency's day-to-day operation addresses most issues 
"rather effectively," often detecting and remedying safety problems before 
accidents occur. Each morning, they say, the agency deploys about 3,000 
inspectors and runs the busiest airspace in the world -- without major incident 
on most days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a formidable task," Hinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA "acknowledges that it can be reactive in some cases, but that can be a 
proper response in many cases," according to a statement by the agency in 
response to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 " Reaction often means we insist on learning from past accidents. At other 
times, reaction may mean that we are properly responding to public demand or 
concern, which is proper in our democratic form of government." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hinson: "If you look at the way the FAA deals with safety, about 95% of 
what we do . . . of what you or I would call preemptive safety efforts, those 
are efforts you probably never read about or write about. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 5% of what we do is after there is an incident or an accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Airplane manufacturers and airlines said safety comes first with both the FAA 
and them, and that they would never compromise the lives of the flying public. 
"We always want to try to make a good system better," said Joe Hopkins, 
spokesman for United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 A scheduled commercial airplane trip in the United States is regarded as among 
the safest forms of travel in the world. The odds of an air traveler dying in a 
crash are roughly the same as the odds of being killed by lightning, according 
to the National Safety Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S airline industry had gone more than two years without a major accident 
before the string of fatal accidents this year. As of October, an estimated 843 
people have died in plane crashes in 1994 -- one of the worst records since 
1988, according to preliminary statistics by the NTSB, the agency that 
investigates accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, NTSB sources say, investigators are exploring whether deficiencies in FAA 
oversight and operations may have been contributing factors in at least two of 
the three major accidents this year in Charlotte, N.C., Pittsburgh, Pa., and 
near Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 After the FAA admitted in July that it may have mishandled reports on 
turbulence problems associated with Boeing 757 jetliners, The Times reviewed 
hundreds of airline crashes and thousands of government documents obtained 
under the Freedom of Information Act. Scores of past and present FAA officials, 
members of Congress, airline industry sources and safety experts were 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 What emerged was a portrait of an agency that many times has been slow to 
address safety problems, particularly when they were controversial or costly to 
correct. Among the findings: 
</P>
<P>
 * The FAA's performance sometimes has been compromised by poor communication 
between those charged with identifying potential safety problems and those with 
the power to act on them, and pressure from an influential industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you want to change the rules, the manufacturers scream," said one 
FAA aircraft-certification official who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
"Anything that cost money to the manufacturers, we have to fight them on. They 
say: 'Well, there hasn't been an accident.' We say: 'Well, there could be.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Deadly delays have occurred in part because a law requires the FAA to 
justify the cost of implementing proposed safety measures by showing that 
enough lives will be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strangulation of safety by regulatory process," observed Rep. James L. 
Oberstar (D-Minn.), chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation 
Committee's panel on aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The FAA failed to heed repeated admonitions from oversight agencies and from 
within its own ranks to make safety a higher priority. And there exists, both 
inside and outside the FAA, a tacit acceptance that sometimes only accidents 
can spur the agency to take meaningful action. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles O. Miller, former head of the NTSB's Bureau of Air Safety, said he has 
kept a file called "known precedents." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been keeping it for awhile because I was getting disturbed about 
seeing accidents happen from causes I had seen before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of runway safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, two researchers, using statistics compiled by the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Aviation Safety Reporting System, issued 
a report that said "incursions by aircraft on the runways of controlled 
airports represent a significant safety hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1978 and 1983, at least three near-collisions involving major 
jetliners occurred on U.S. runways. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, after two Northwest Airlines DC-10s were involved in what the NTSB 
termed a "potentially disastrous" incident in Minneapolis, the safety board 
urged the FAA to expedite projects designed to prevent collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 For years the FAA had such projects in the works, including the development of 
ground-based radar systems to help air traffic controllers track airplanes on 
the tarmac and simple lighting systems to ensure that departing planes do not 
stray onto active runways, especially during inclement weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Even within the FAA, officials recognized that progress had been too slow. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal FAA memorandum sent to air traffic managers in 1986 acknowledged 
that the runway incursion threat required further action. It noted that many 
FAA projects designed to deal with the problem were incomplete and, even if 
finished, would have questionable efficacy. 
</P>
<P>
 That year the NTSB released the results of a special investigation on runway 
incursions, proffering to the FAA 33 recommendations designed to prevent them. 
One recommendation originally had been issued 13 years earlier, but was never 
acted upon. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next four years, according to internal FAA documents, the agency 
received dispatches from many corners of the industry, urging it to take 
preventive measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 27, 1987: John O'Brien, director of engineering and air safety for the 
Air Line Pilots Assn., said in a letter to FAA Associate Administrator Anthony 
Broderick: "Several accidents and incidents over the last few years have 
documented the seriousness of runway incursions." 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 11, 1989: An internal FAA memorandum declared: "The Air Traffic 
Operations Service has stated an immediate need for a runway incursion alert 
system. . . . We agree that the potential for a runway accident is a national 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
 But that concern turned to catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of three fatal runway incursions occurred in Atlanta on Jan. 18, 
1990, followed by one in Detroit on Dec. 3, 1990, and then the Los Angeles 
crash in February, 1991. The death toll for the three crashes: 47 people, 
including David Richman, the college professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world changed at that moment," said Richman's father, Alex, a 
psychiatrist and professor in Nova Scotia. "On that . . . morning, we were 
ignorant. We thought we could trust the airlines and the government. We thought 
safety came first." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Atlanta crash, which killed one man, the FAA mustered action teams 
to survey airports and identify potential problem areas. It also released a 
report in April, 1990, emphasizing that pilots could help cut runway incursions 
by being more aware of surrounding aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, the agency also acknowledged: "FAA has not always coordinated its 
efforts to reduce incursions." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was not until after the Los Angeles crash that the agency placed 
more emphasis and money into its long-extant runway-incursion project. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, according to the FAA's own estimate, 11 runway accidents had occurred 
in the United States since 1970, resulting in 644 deaths and injuries, not 
including the casualties from the Atlanta, Los Angeles and Detroit crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a great fan of how fast we get things done in this organization," 
said the FAA's Michael J. Harrison, who spearheaded the runway collision 
prevention program after the crash of USAir Flight 1493. "Should the 
runway-incursion stuff have been done sooner? The answer to that is: of 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 Since that time, the agency's plan to develop a sophisticated ground-based 
radar system and place it at the nation's busiest airports has fallen behind 
schedule and may not be completed until the turn of the century, according to 
the General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something simmers on the back burner, and it doesn't get done," said Hugh E. 
Waterman, a former FAA manager who worked for the agency for 27 years before 
retiring in 1986. "But then, one governor or 60 regular human beings dies, then 
it goes onto the front burner." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Created in 1958, the FAA has a double-barreled task that critics believe is a 
conflicting one: to promote the aviation industry and to ensure safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB is charged with investigating the causes of transportation accidents 
and making safety recommendations. Created in 1974, it has no regulatory powers 
and cannot force the FAA to act. Historically, the NTSB has wielded its 
influence most successfully by publicly drawing attention to the FAA's lapses 
and leveraging legislative outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA points out that through the years it has identified numerous safety 
hazards and acted before accidents ever occurred. In a 20-page statement to The 
Times, FAA officials said the agency routinely detects safety problems but 
receives no credit because there is no way to tell how many accidents have been 
prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 "Airline safety is among the least recognized success stories in public or 
corporate policy in the United States," the FAA statement said. "Improvements 
in engine reliability, aircraft design, avionics, cockpit technology, 
navigational aids and air traffic control have made serious accidents rare 
events." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the FAA has adopted eight of every 10 safety recommendations made by 
the NTSB, the average amount of time it takes to implement the recommendations 
is slightly more than two years. In some cases, it's been much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 While he believes that the NTSB functions as a "great auditor" for the FAA, 
Hinson said the FAA sometimes respectfully disagrees with the safety board, and 
with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's probably OK to have disagreement on the 15% or so," Hinson said, 
referring to the number of safety recommendations the agency doesn't accept. 
"It's not just . . . 'We don't like them' and put them away. We have to defend 
our position. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are often cases in aviation where knowledgeable people can disagree." 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB's Sweedler said the safety board was pleased with the "82.5% 
acceptance rate," but, he said, "there are quite a few important issues in the 
other 18%." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Records show a pattern of delay in correcting a number of problems: 
</P>
<P>
 * It took the FAA eight years to act on a problem with Cessna carburetors 
after John R. James, manager of the FAA's aircraft certification office in 
Atlanta, had written a memo warning: "CAUTION: there have been reports of power 
loss, severe in some cases." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was causing planes to stall and crash. During that eight-year 
period, at least 10 accidents had occurred and half a dozen people had died. 
</P>
<P>
 * A year before the top half of a Boeing 737 ripped off over Hawaii in 1988 
because of metal fatigue, FAA researcher Thomas Swift wrote a 77-page report 
saying fatigue in America's aging air fleet was a safety risk: "It is possible 
for a number of cracks, each not easily inspected, to suddenly join together 
and form a long critical crack. . . . A number of fleets are currently 
operating at double their initially anticipated design life goals." 
</P>
<P>
 * It took a decade of admonitions and at least four major crashes before the 
FAA acknowledged that certain planes, such as early model DC-9s and Fokker 
F-28s, were especially susceptible to control problems with minute amounts of 
ice on their wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years after the NTSB had made safety recommendations following the deaths 
of 78 people in a 1982 Air Florida accident in Washington, a similar tragedy 
happened at La Guardia Airport in New York. That accident, involving USAir 
Flight 405, killed 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Line Pilots Assn. said in a letter to the FAA at the time: "The lack 
of an adequate response to (the NTSB's earlier) recommendation (on de-icing 
wings), which was made approximately 9 years ago, contributed to the accident 
involving USAir Flight 405." 
</P>
<P>
 "The FAA," said veteran air safety investigator Rudolf Kapustin, "makes it 
sound like: 'Hey, we've got a brand-new problem here.' Well, a lot of times 
it's not a new problem. It's an old problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Kapustin, who has worked for the FAA and the NTSB, was the lead investigator 
in the 1982 Air Florida crash, which was caused, in part, by ice on the wings. 
"After the Fokker accident (at La Guardia Airport in 1992), the FAA convened 
this worldwide conference on de-icing. They said: 'Now you've got to put a 
ladder up and touch (the wing to see if it has ice on it).' Well, Jesus, we 
knew that years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA itself concluded last July that its ability to act upon safety 
concerns in a timely manner was lacking. The agency had launched an internal 
investigation after The Times reported that it had mishandled the Boeing 757 
turbulence issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But the acknowledgment came as no surprise to air safety experts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, then-FAA Administrator Allan McArtor, in an internal memorandum, 
acknowledged that the agency lacked an internal clearinghouse for safety data, 
and that management of safety data within the agency was disorganized. 
</P>
<P>
 A July, 1988, Office of Technology Assessment report concluded: "More 
stringent safety standards usually follow a widely publicized airline accident 
and vocal public and congressional concern than from FAA initiatives." 
</P>
<P>
 And last year, Robert E. Machol, the FAA's chief scientist before retiring 
last summer, pointed out the agency's shortcomings. In a March, 1993, memo, he 
detailed how the Boeing 757 wake-turbulence problem was handled. Before two 
crashes that claimed 13 lives, Machol had predicted that turbulence created by 
the jetliners would cause a "major crash" if the FAA failed to take preventive 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is symptomatic of a bigger problem, which is that we react very slowly 
to things where maybe we ought to act more rapidly," Machol wrote. "We need to 
be more alert to safety questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Next: Why delays in response occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher Sheila A. Kern and correspondent Shelby Grad contributed to 
this report. The FAA Factor in Crashes 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration is listed as a cause or factor in 93 plane 
crashes from1983 to July, 1994. Injury and fatality records for the 93 crashes 
show: 
</P>
<P>
 * 576 dead 
</P>
<P>
 * 151 seriously injured 
</P>
<P>
 * 270 moderately injured 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 10 crashes were attributed to errors by specific FAA employees, 
resulting in: 
</P>
<P>
 * Seven dead 
</P>
<P>
 * Eight moderately injured

government oversight agencies, and interviewed scores of present and past FAA 
officials, airline industry sources, aviation safety experts, members of 
Congress, crash survivors and the families of crash victims.

HOME-FINDING FIRMS FACE SUITS, WRATH OF RENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scores of angry renters have filed lawsuits and complaints with law 
enforcement agencies against home-finding businesses in Van Nuys, Burbank and 
Glendale, accusing them of lying about their services and refund policies. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the firms, Valley Management in Van Nuys, operated more than a year 
without a required state license, then disappeared in mid-October after 
promising refunds, customers told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just a dirty little business," complained Diane J. Lind, who has 
filed a lawsuit against the firm. She said she was "disgusted with people who 
rip you off like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The other companies are Properties Unlimited in Glendale and Quality Rentals 
in Burbank, both of which are licensed by the state. Valley Management is under 
investigation by the Los Angeles city attorney's office for possible violation 
of state laws governing rental listing services. All three firms are being 
investigated by the California Department of Real Estate -- the agency that 
regulates rental listing services, of which nearly 50 are licensed by the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickie Cardoza, operator of Quality Rentals and Properties Unlimited, defended 
her businesses. The service "works for a lot of people," but "I can't make them 
all happy," Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do place many, many of my clients, and I (give) a lot of refunds, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard S. Toohey and Michael Jackson, who operated Valley Management, could 
not be reached for comment. They rented a Studio City office where a new rental 
service, Sunwest Properties, opened for business within days of Valley 
Management shutting down, according to a leasing agent. Sunwest, which also is 
unlicensed, is a "legitimate" firm and is not connected with Valley Management, 
a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite different names and locations, the companies' pitches have been 
virtually identical, according to a review of about 40 cases in small-claims 
court and interviews with two dozen customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Each presents itself as "a personalized rental service" that helps tenants 
find a home with the desired amenities, location and price. Each charges a fee, 
typically $150, to provide and update lists of available rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the firms also promise refunds to customers who don't find what they 
are looking for. Indeed, all of the companies are required by state law to 
refund all but a $25 service charge when customers do not find a suitable 
rental. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of customers who requested their money back said the companies failed 
to pay refunds after agreeing to do so, or simply refused, citing technical 
fine print in their service contracts, according to interviews and court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Most said they sought refunds because the listings proved inaccurate or 
worthless. They said many properties were already rented, and others were the 
dregs -- "the most flea-bitten, roach-infested properties I've ever seen in my 
life," as one put it. 
</P>
<P>
 State law prohibits the companies from listing rentals without "written or 
oral permission . . . from the property owner." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers said some landlords drew a blank when they mentioned their rental 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first phone call (to a landlord) I made, the lady said, 'I never heard of 
these people. I hope you haven't gotten scammed,' " recalled Marnie Jamieson, a 
Valley Management customer. "I feel like a total dope, but I guess everybody 
else who got taken does, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The companies attracted business by running classified ads for rentals that, 
customers said, seemed so palatial and inexpensive they were almost too good to 
be true. When home-seekers call, expecting to reach the landlord, they instead 
get a salesman for the rental service, who invites them to come in and sign up 
for a list of fine rentals. Many customers also said they were told the $150 
fee would be applied to the security deposit or first month's rent. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Cardoza explained her approach to advertising. "I do not make 
up ads," Cardoza said. "I make them sound good." 
</P>
<P>
 Both of Cardoza's firms and Valley Management and Sunwest also have used a 
confusing service contract that state officials say appears to be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers said they are orally informed of their refund rights. They are then 
presented with a contract that says in one section the home listings are being 
furnished for either $25 or $50. This part of the contract includes a written 
promise to refund payment in excess of the $25 service charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The other part of the contract describes the rest of the fee -- either $100 or 
$125 -- as a non-refundable charge for a credit profile to be furnished to 
landlords. Cardoza acknowledged that these credit checks are not always done by 
her company and cost her only $10. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the state Department of Real Estate said the agreement is a 
subterfuge, meant to create the appearance of two transactions and to ensure 
that little or no money will ever be refunded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to be an attempt to circumvent the law," said Steve Ellis, chief 
of the real estate department's Los Angeles office, which is conducting the 
investigations. Ellis said some rental services in the past have packaged the 
deal the same way, but that the department has ruled the practice illegal. 
Ellis said this provision of the companies' contracts would not have been 
approved by the agency, had it been submitted for review, as he said, by law, 
it should have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza called the credit profile a separate service that should be none of 
the department's business. "What do they have to do with my credit company?" 
she asked. "I have a right to own two businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza formed Properties Unlimited early in 1993, and the company soon became 
the target of numerous complaints. Its first office on Sonora Avenue in 
Glendale was damaged by a fire that broke out after midnight on Oct. 23, 1993. 
According to the police report, Cardoza told investigators that "within the 
past week, two separate individuals had complained about her service and 
demanded their money back. She refused and both individuals were upset." 
</P>
<P>
 After less than a year and a half in business and 21 small-claims suits, 
Cardoza closed Properties Unlimited in June and reopened in Burbank as Quality 
Rentals. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardoza blamed her problems in Glendale on some of her sales staff. "They were 
promising (customers) that the money was going to be used to go to their 
security deposits, but they weren't telling me this," Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was giving back refunds left and right to people," Cardoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although in business just five months, Cardoza's new firm, Quality Rentals, 
has also been the target of eight lawsuits. Cardoza again cited problems with 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must be a bad judge of character," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toohey and Jackson worked for Properties Unlimited before opening Valley 
Management in mid-1993 in an office building in the 7200 block of Sepulveda 
Boulevard. This company, too, had many unhappy customers, among whom Seth 
Solomon stands out. 
</P>
<P>
 When he signed up with Valley Management in October, 1993, Solomon said the 
salesman told him that properties customarily were left open for customer 
inspection, including a house in Toluca Lake that seemed particularly 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon said he drove to the house, found a door unlocked, and was looking 
around inside when a man leaped from hiding and began to beat him. In an 
interview and a lawsuit, Solomon said he was punched and pushed outside and 
slammed against his car with such force it left a dent -- as he struggled all 
the while to explain why he was there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (the assailant) thought I was trying to rob the house or something," 
Solomon said. "The only reason I went in was the door was opened like (Valley 
Management) told me." 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon's attacker finally allowed him to call the company to straighten out 
the mess. Solomon said he asked for his money back, saying that, "if this 
happens on the first house I went to . . . I'm not going to use your service." 
</P>
<P>
 To his amazement, Solomon said, the company refused to return his fee. "I 
didn't want a lawsuit," but also "didn't want it to happen to somebody else," 
Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Solomon last January sued Valley Management for $25,000. In response to the 
suit, which is pending, Toohey and Valley Management said the attack -- if it 
did occur -- was due to Solomon's failure "to exercise ordinary care." 
</P>
<P>
 Another dissatisfied customer, Bill Schiffman, signed up with Valley 
Management in September. "They were just doing a booming business," Schiffman 
recalled. "I saw a lot of people that looked like they didn't have a lot of 
money going in there. . . . I saw families with children going in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiffman said he found the service to be considerably less than advertised. A 
house that sounded great from the listings turned out to be a dump. Another, he 
said, still had blood on the floor from a recent robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 So Schiffman found a house on his own and requested a refund. Like a number of 
others who spoke to The Times, Schiffman said he was told his money would be 
mailed to him in October. In October, the firm shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling to check on their refunds and discovering the company's phones were 
disconnected, enraged customers descended on the office in droves, only to find 
Valley Management was gone. Some called the office building's management firm 
-- which itself has sued Valley Management for unpaid rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have gotten 300 calls -- honest," an executive with the management 
firm said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time Valley Management closed, Sunwest Properties opened in Studio 
City. Some customers, suspecting Sunwest and Valley Management were one and the 
same, went to the Sunwest office in the 13200 block of Ventura Boulevard, but 
were told there was no link. 
</P>
<P>
 A Sunwest official said the same thing to The Times. A man who introduced 
himself as Sunwest owner Ron Pass said the firm had "nothing to do with Valley 
Management." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want happy customers. I try to run a legitimate business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass said he knew nothing of Jackson and Toohey, except that "these are the 
people who owned the other company, from what I've been informed." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynn LaRocque, a leasing agent for the office building in the 13200 block 
of Ventura Boulevard, said she had rented the office occupied by Sunwest to 
Jackson and Toohey, not Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the only two gentlemen I ever worked with," LaRocque said. "The 
name Ron Pass means nothing to me." 
</P>
<P>
 A comparison of the Sunwest and Valley Management contracts shows their 
wording is identical -- including the same grammatical and typographical 
errors. Tips for Prospective Renters 
</P>
<P>
 Rental listing services charge fees for lists of available houses and 
apartments. Due to consumer complaints about some of these firms, home-hunters 
considering the use of rental listing services should take a couple of 
precautions first. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, rental listing services must be licensed with the California 
Department of Real Estate. Operators are required either to obtain a license to 
run a prepaid rental listing service, or to operate under the supervision of a 
licensed real estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Before signing up, consumers should ask to see the license, and should be wary 
of any firm that can't produce one. Information on the license status of rental 
listing agencies can also be obtained by calling the Department of Real Estate 
at (213) 897-3399. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers should not rely solely on oral promises by rental service staff, but 
also should read carefully service contracts before signing. Those contracts 
should clearly spell out refund policies, including a state requirement that 
the agency refund all fees in excess of $25 if the customer is unable to find a 
suitable rental or finds one on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, officials say, consumers should beware of two- or three-part 
contracts assigning a portion of the fee to a credit check. They say such 
contracts have been used to trick consumers and circumvent refund requirements.

<P>
 One is a child-care expert who last owned a bond in World War II. It was a 
savings bond. Another is far more familiar with writing an arrest report than a 
collateral call. 
</P>
<P>
 A third is a former aide to Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty, a career politician 
and women's activist. Another is a college instructor. The last is a retired 
Marine Corps brigadier general in declining health. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the members of the Orange County Board of Supervisors. None of them 
knows much, if anything, about reverse repurchase agreements or interest rate 
swaps -- the types of exotic financial instruments that have plunged the county 
into the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever there was a time when the county needed strong leadership, it is now. 
But some members of the community wonder whether the board, with its lack of 
expertise in the securities market, can adequately guide Orange County out of 
the fiscal debacle that now threatens more than 185 school districts and 
governmental agencies in the county and across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so damn incompetent in responding to some of this," said Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley, 82, admitting that much of the county's economic problems are 
beyond his comprehension. "I'm used to saying, 'Damn it. This is the way we're 
going to do it.' I can't do that with this challenge. I'm not qualified." 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a lack of leadership," said Tom Rogers, an activist in south 
Orange County who has battled developers for years and opposed tax measures for 
transportation projects. "The reason behind this can be boiled down to two 
words -- arrogance and accountability . They have plenty of arrogance and no 
accountability." 
</P>
<P>
 Some community and political leaders believe that the board has at least 
embarked on the right track by hiring bankruptcy attorney Bruce Bennett and 
former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes as its main adviser. Hayes also worked 
as Gov. Pete Wilson's finance director for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 They also praised the county's decision to sue the Wall Street firms that have 
sold $11.4 billion in bonds they held as collateral on loans to the county's 
investment portfolio managed by former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. 
Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hiring Hayes is a good step. So is suing the investment banks," said 
developer William Buck Johns, a member of the Lincoln Club, perhaps the 
wealthiest, most influential Republican organization in Orange County. "They 
are doing the right things. They needed to get someone in there who understands 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Johns said of the collapse, "You wonder what government is doing." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a week, the board, county officials and their consultants have 
been grappling with the wreckage of Citron's bond investment strategy, which 
was undermined by a rapid rise in interest rates this year. On Tuesday, county 
supervisors decided to seek protection under Chapter 9, a rarely used section 
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code designed for governmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 They have spent days on end, some without sleep, trying to keep county 
government afloat while dealing with Wall Street and nervous investors who fear 
that they have lost tremendous amounts of money needed to run their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 How the board performs could affect county government in the long run and 
determine the political futures of the supervisors, including two who will take 
office Jan. 5 -- former Huntington Beach City Councilman Jim Silva and former 
state Sen. Marian Bergeson. Riley, the retired Marine, and Harriett M. Wieder, 
who used to work for Yorty, are retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Some doubt whether any of them, including the newcomers, are up to the task, 
given that the supervisors were responsible for overseeing the treasurer's 
office in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just don't care," Rogers said. "They won't be critical of their own 
kind. There has been no dissenting voice on that board for years. All they do 
is put the blinders on and raise a protective umbrella." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the county's worst financial crisis, the board has been criticized for 
failing to take action sooner against Citron even though watchdog agencies have 
repeatedly pointed out problems with the treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County grand jury reports in the mid- to late 1980s were critical of 
some aspects of Citron's operation and called for more oversight, but county 
supervisors either ignored those reports, inadvertently overlooked them, or 
viewed them as being unimportant. But Citron's investments were doing well at 
the time, Orange County bonds had high ratings, and there were no clear signs 
of pending disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Stronger warnings came in 1993, when county Auditor-Controller Steven E. Lewis 
issued a highly critical report of the operation of Citron's office in 1991. 
Lewis concluded that the treasurer was making risky transactions, avoided 
oversight of his dealings and had violated government codes to maximize return. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was sent to the Board of Supervisors and the Orange County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be incredible malfeasance if the board didn't make themselves aware 
of the investments Citron was making," said Irvine attorney Christopher Mears, 
a local political activist. "They have a central role to make sure the money 
was invested properly. What did they do to assure themselves of that? Not much 
apparently." 
</P>
<P>
 If the public perceives a failure of the supervisors to rigorously oversee 
Citron's operations, it could reflect on the board at election time. Incumbents 
Gaddi H. Vasquez, Roger R. Stanton and William G. Steiner might be vulnerable, 
as well as Supervisor-elect Bergeson, whose legislative record in the state 
Capitol includes bills that helped Citron indulge in the kind of risky 
investments that led to his undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Political organizations from low budget grass-roots groups to the gilded 
Lincoln Club have been trying to address the crisis. Most are trying to assess 
their options and what they can do to influence the situation. There has been 
some talk of a recall among some of the grass-roots organizations. So far no 
petition has surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in the face of the county auditor's report that revealed critical 
problems with the treasurer's office, the supervisors contend that they should 
not be held responsible for the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone that did assessments, audits or provided information on the 
investment funds plus 180-odd investors indicated that things were fine and 
that investments were going well," said Vasquez, a former police officer. 
"There were no indicators that a problem of this magnitude was occurring." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members say the public cannot expect elected officials who are not 
knowledgeable or sophisticated about the bond market to know when something is 
going to be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "This finance field, just like a brain surgeon's field . . . just like 
anything that the average person can't easily understand, really relegates the 
responsibility to somebody who knows," Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 What is important now, board members say, is how county leadership reacts to 
the crisis. Wieder expects that her colleagues will push hard for reforms that 
will grant the board more power and oversight of the treasurer's office. Other 
measures will be supported to prevent some of the risky investments Citron 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 "What lessons do we learn from this?" Wieder asked. "I think that in this 
case, under state law, the treasurer had too much freedom to manipulate county 
funds the way he was allowed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 If there is blame to be assigned, Steiner said, it should be spread among the 
investors in the county's bond portfolio. More than 185 governmental 
jurisdictions put money in the fund and all have elected officials, chief 
financial officers and auditors responsible for their financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the debacle, Steiner said, there will not only be reforms on 
the county level but "from Congress and nearly every governmental agency in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 To Riley, a 20-year member of the board, the bankruptcy filing has been his 
worst and most frustrating experience in government. Culpability? "That's 
something we certainly have to look at," he said. "But I believe that we 
followed the guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that there will be reforms in the county's investment system seems 
certain. Whether the Board of Supervisors will lead the charge remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so much bigger than the board," said Scott Hart, an Orange County 
political consultant. "They're going to have wait and see if the SEC is going 
to step in. They may not have any choices here." Spotlight on the Supervisors 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to plunge Orange County into bankruptcy so its investment fund 
might be saved was made by the Board of Supervisors. The five officials preside 
over 18,000 public employees and a $3.7-billion annual budget. Each earns 
$82,000 in salary and is elected to a four-year term. All are Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Thomas F. Riley 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 82 
</P>
<P>
 Home: Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Known in the Hall of Administration as "the general," the former Marine is 
retiring in January as the longest-serving member of the board after two 
decades in office. He was appointed in 1974 by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan and -- 
to the dismay of many south Orange County environmental critics -- was a 
longtime supporter of pro-development efforts in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 57 
</P>
<P>
 Home: Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 A former college professor, Stanton upset an incumbent supervisor to gain 
election in 1980 and has since sought to build his record around management and 
budget issues. He recently forced an end to the county's schedule of closing 
some offices every other Friday, arguing that it denied public access and 
didn't end up saving any money. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 57 
</P>
<P>
 Home: Orange 
</P>
<P>
 The former director of Orangewood, a home for abused children, Steiner became 
the newest member of the board in 1993 when he was appointed by Gov. Pete 
Wilson to fill the seat left vacant by Supervisor Don R. Roth's resignation. He 
recently negotiated a settlement with his former colleagues in the city of 
Orange over the expansion of the Theo Lacy Branch Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 39 
</P>
<P>
 Home: Orange 
</P>
<P>
 A former police officer, Vasquez rose to national prominence as a speaker at 
the 1988 GOP convention and was frequently mentioned as a rising Latino star in 
the party. Some politicos believe he may have missed his chance, passing up too 
many opportunities at higher office since then and publicly avoiding positions 
on such issues as Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 74 
</P>
<P>
 Home: Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, a former aide to Los Angeles Mayor Sam Yorty, became the first woman 
elected to the board, in 1978. She retires from office next month, second only 
to Riley in length of tenure. She riled many in the local GOP by backing 
President Clinton in the 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Supervisors 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor-elect Marian Bergeson 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 69 
</P>
<P>
 Home: Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 After 16 years in the Legislature, she was elected unopposed to succeed Riley. 
The bond disaster has already forced her to do some political backpedaling: 
Last summer, she backed John M. W. Moorlach's bid to unseat Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron, but then switched sides. She says she feared 
criticism of Citron would taint the county's reputation on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor-elect Jim Silva 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 50 
</P>
<P>
 Home: Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, who left his Huntington Beach City Council seat and won a bitter race 
to replace the retiring Wieder, has been a high school economics and civics 
teacher for 28 years. He has had a long dislike for Citron, regarded him as 
arrogant, and wants to see the treasurer's job change from an elected to 
appointed post.

CLINTON SHARPLY ATTACKS GOP'S ORPHANAGE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton attempted to regain control of the welfare reform debate 
Saturday with a sharp attack on Republican proposals to eliminate benefits for 
teen-age welfare recipients and possibly send their children to orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 Such proposals are "dead wrong," Clinton said. "We need less governmental 
interference in family life, not more." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no substitute, none, for the loving devotion and equally loving 
discipline of caring parents," Clinton declared. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, two Republican legislators offered only qualified support for the 
orphanage proposal in the House GOP welfare plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't envision under this bill a single child being put in a children's 
home for the simple reason that his or her parent is poor," said Rep. James M. 
Talent (R-Mo.), whose welfare reform legislation provided the model for the 
bill in the "contract with America," the House GOP's legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks in his weekly radio address constituted his second effort in 
the last week to regain the high ground in the emotional debate over reforming 
the welfare system. On Thursday, he announced plans for a national summit with 
governors, local officials and members of Congress, aimed at hammering out 
agreement on broad principles for welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's pointed attack on the GOP discussion of orphanages -- which aides 
say he personally toughened from the draft language prepared for the address -- 
also underscored the extent to which the welfare debate is increasingly 
revolving around the issue of how far government can go to discourage 
out-of-wedlock births. 
</P>
<P>
 In their contract, Republicans in the House proposed that all states be 
required to deny cash benefits to women younger than 18 who bear children out 
of wedlock. (States would also be permitted to extend the ban to women younger 
than 21.) Instead, states could use the money for a variety of alternative 
services, including encouraging adoption, establishing group homes for unwed 
mothers and their children, and subsidizing orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
 In their discussion of the legislation during the past few weeks, however, 
incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and other Republican leaders have 
emphasized the orphanage option. That has generated an intense debate about the 
fairness of pressuring poor women to give up their children by denying them any 
cash assistance in raising them. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new Time magazine/CNN poll released Saturday, 54% of Americans said they 
oppose denying all benefits to women younger than 18 who have children out of 
wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 The House Republican plan also would allow states to eliminate benefits for 
all recipients after two years on the welfare rolls and require all states to 
eliminate benefits after five years. In either case, the states would not be 
required to provide the public service employment that a plan envisioned by the 
Clinton Administration would have offered recipients hitting the time limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if they would support requiring women to find a job in two years or risk 
losing their children to orphanages if they cannot support them, 72% of 
Americans said no, according to the Time/CNN survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on orphanages has also been questioned on fiscal grounds, with 
experts pointing out that orphanage care has an average annual cost of $35,000 
per child. By contrast, a combination of welfare, food stamps, housing and 
health care benefits for the poor costs the government an average of $4,000 to 
$6,000 per person annually for a family of three, one Administration official 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 On NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" last weekend, Gingrich staunchly defended the 
orphanage proposal as preferable to existing conditions in many inner-city 
neighborhoods. "You know," he said at one point, "the little 4-year-old who was 
thrown off the balcony in Chicago would have been a hell of a lot better off in 
Boys Town." 
</P>
<P>
 But Republican sources said many GOP legislators have been shaken by the 
intense and emotional backlash to the discussion of orphanages. That was 
apparent Saturday. In the GOP response to Clinton's address, Rep. Susan 
Molinari (R-N.Y.) offered a much more tepid endorsement of orphanages than 
Gingrich had last Sunday -- and a much more circumscribed vision of their 
purpose than suggested in the House GOP bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Molinari said welfare reform requires "bold decisions and courageous ideas" 
with "perhaps . . . the creation of small orphanages and group homes (that) 
offer safety and security to abused babies and lonely and isolated children." 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks on CNN's "Newsmaker Saturday," Talent emphasized the bill's 
option for placing mothers together with their children in group homes where 
they would be taught "life skills and work skills and parenting skills." 
</P>
<P>
 But while group homes might meet the principal objection to orphanages -- the 
coerced separation of mothers from children -- the cost of housing and 
supervising both mothers and children would logically be even more prohibitive 
than the cost of caring just for children, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're cutting off 2 million children from welfare, you're going to need 
an awful lot of small group homes," said one Administration official. "It's 
$100 a day for a kid, and I assume the cost for the mother would be the same. 
I've never heard of any institutional costs that were lower than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than eliminating benefits for young unwed mothers, Clinton argued in 
his radio remarks for "a national campaign against teen pregnancy and the 
toughest possible enforcement of our child-support laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's flurry of activity on welfare reform partly reflects the fear of 
White House officials that Republicans have regained control of the politically 
charged issue. As a candidate, Clinton's promise to end "welfare as we know it" 
constituted one of his most popular campaign plans. Last summer, the 
Administration produced a detailed plan to require welfare recipients -- 
beginning with those younger than 25 -- to accept public employment after two 
years on the rolls or face the loss of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration subordinated welfare reform to the ill-fated drive to 
remake the nation's health care system, and the proposal languished. With 
control of both houses of Congress, Republicans are now in position to drive 
the debate.

FUND'S LOSS PUT AT $2 BILLION; DELAYS IN PROJECTS LOOM; ORANGE COUNTY: PLANNED

<P>
 As a top official revealed that Orange County's investment loss had reached at 
least $2 billion, county leaders said for the first time Saturday that the 
financial debacle could mean layoffs, shortened workweeks and salary reductions 
for county employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the County Board of Supervisors said they expect to delay dozens of 
major projects, including the widening of the Santa Ana Freeway through Anaheim 
and a massive overhaul of the county's police communications system, as they 
concentrate on paying bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is not as usual, that's the heartbreak," said Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder. "We're not going to be the same for a long while. It's scary. It's 
tragic. Absolutely tragic." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials were working through the weekend to further analyze the 
damage and help reassure a nervous financial world that the county, the largest 
U.S. municipality to declare bankruptcy, would pull itself out of its monetary 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * County Supervisor William G. Steiner said he has been told that the losses 
have reached at least $2 billion in value -- providing the first county 
confirmation that the losses have worsened. That amounts to 25% of what 
investors put in the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the losses were estimated at $1.5 billion, or 20% of investors' 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials continued to push bankers and state and federal authorities 
for immediate help, seeking lines of credit from Bank of America and other 
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson said the state may be able to advance the county its normal 
allowance of next year's tax money, but probably will not get more involved. "I 
am deliberately not raising anybody's expectations because I think there is a 
very limited role that the state can play," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider removed 22 spending items from 
this Tuesday's meeting agenda, from youth programs and public works projects to 
such minor matters as repairing a barbed wire fence at a wilderness park. And 
the situation could get worse. Another top county official said there was talk 
Saturday of salary cuts and reduced work hours for the county. "The worst-case 
scenario would be layoffs," Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 * State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) proposed "serious reforms" to 
regulate the relationships between financial brokers and those who invest 
taxpayer money. He called for strong prohibitions on gifts and campaign 
contributions from financial firms to public officials who invest public money. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, former state Treasurer Tom Hayes -- the county's new financial 
adviser -- made the rounds of state leaders seeking financial help. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, county officials worked with Salomon Bros., the county's 
financial strategist, to consider various budget-slashing scenarios. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has had partial success in getting money from outside sources. Bank 
Picks Up Debt for Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Industrial Bank of Japan picked up the debt last week for $78 million 
worth of notes issued by the Orange County Transportation Authority and has 
agreed to pick up $100 million more of the agency's notes that come due in 
January, Steiner said. Bank of America officials also are considering a line of 
credit to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said any money that comes from state and federal officials in the form 
of sales tax revenue and federal highway funds would not be a handout. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would not be a loan," he said. "This would help us get some funds early 
to help with our liquidity." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Saturday, trustees of the Anaheim Union High School District held a 
special meeting and directed Orange County officials to keep their property tax 
funds separate from the county investment pool. Previously, a portion of those 
funds had automatically gone into the pool. The trustees followed the lead of 
several other school boards that have petitioned the county to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Within just a few days last week, Orange County, one of the richest areas of 
the world, saw its treasurer-tax collector of 24 years resign and the next day 
filed for bankruptcy protection after it defaulted on a $1.2 billion loan. That 
action triggered a Wall Street investment brokerage to sell off $2 billion in 
securities that it had held as collateral for the county's loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after the bankruptcy filing, nervous brokerages dumped $11.4 
billion in securities onto the market. What the investment firms were paid for 
those securities will determine how much is left of the $7.8 billion county 
investment fund, which had been leveraged to nearly three times its value. 
Steiner said Saturday that he believes the portfolio, which includes the 
investments of more than 185 school districts, cities and other agencies, has 
lost $2 billion in value so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pool participants need to know what's left in the fund and what can be 
released," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said that eventually he will seek to have the county's investments 
removed from the county treasurer's responsibility and managed by a private 
financial manager accountable to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder said she felt some relief at hiring Hayes and Salomon Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to the county counsel, 'I feel as though I can see the light at the 
end of this tunnel,' " Wieder recalled. "And he said, 'No, it's just like 
coming down on an elevator from the 100th floor -- we've just passed the 95th.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder said it is impossible to approve any new expenditures in today's 
financial light. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can we talk about spending money when we don't know what we have?" she 
asked. "Once we find that out, we're going to have to set the priorities on who 
gets paid." Local Businesses Show Support 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Wieder said, she has seen a huge outpouring of support by the 
local business community. Before Salomon Bros. joined the effort, she said, 
Pacific Investments offered free financial advice. Local accountants also have 
offered to give her briefings on securities trading so she can better 
understand the investment portfolio, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors said it is almost certain that some spending, such as land 
purchases for widening Interstate 5, a bond sale for the $94 million emergency 
communications system and the hiring of new deputies to staff the Theo Lacy 
Branch Jail in Orange, will be postponed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Oftelie, head of the Orange County Transportation Authority, said its 
board of directors will vote Monday on a 100-day operating plan to keep the 
agency going. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a plan to stabilize all of our activities, and this involves contracts, 
vendors, professional services, cash flow, payroll and everything else," 
Oftelie said. There are no plans to curtail bus service, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 One expected casualty is a private toll road that was to be built down the 
middle of the Santa Ana River and is still being designed. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the construction was to be funded through the sale of bonds to private 
investors, but the transportation authority has agreed to contribute $12 
million for an environmental study, said Mel Placilla, the project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Placilla said transportation officials informed him Friday that the 
$650-million project would be put on hold. The transportation group has $1 
billion tied up in the county's investment pool, which was frozen as a result 
of the bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to say we won't be able to do the road," Placilla said. "But I 
can tell you that this is going to make it much more difficult for us to 
continue. We'll just have to wait and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron and his assistant, 
Matthew Raabe, have each hired private attorneys, a pair of former federal 
prosecutors with experience in criminal defense and fraud. Raabe is now the 
acting treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kolbenschlag, who is acting as a spokesman for the county during the 
crisis, said the county would pay Citron's and Raabe's legal bills unless they 
are convicted of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Raabe's lawyer, Terry W. Bird of Century City, said it is too soon to tell 
what types of legal work he will be handling. Bird said he has not yet been 
notified of the class-action lawsuits by bondholders naming Raabe as a 
defendant, and has not been contacted by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, one of half a dozen agencies investigating the county's financial 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm representing him for all purposes right now," Bird said. "This is 
changing so quickly, it's hard for me to tell what's happening next. It's been 
rather hectic, and I'm working with Raabe on a daily basis." 
</P>
<P>
 "Matt's going to do his job, he's going to do it right," Bird said of his 
client. "It'll take a while before this thing gets sorted out, but I think 
everybody will see that Matt did what he could." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Washington, D.C., to Sacramento are scrutinizing Citron's risky 
investments. Hayden said state lawmakers need to get more involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with the governor that we should not bail out Orange County," Hayden 
said in a letter to Senate President Pro Tempore Bill Lockyer. "But I disagree 
with the notion that we've had no hand in this," he added, pointing to laws 
approved by the Legislature that allowed county treasurers to participate in 
risky investments with taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter Hayden asked that the state ban governments from engaging in 
reverse repurchase agreements, "the practice which was the death knell of the 
Orange County fund," and limit the percentage of public funds that can be put 
into derivatives, complex investment instruments tied to interest rates or 
other variable mechanisms. 
</P>
<P>
 He also suggested that the state repeal the law allowing local governments to 
buy lower-rated securities, prohibit governments from purchasing long-term 
securities, and institute "strong prohibitions" against contributions by 
brokerages to campaigns of officials who invest money. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden also said he had assigned an attorney from his staff to investigate the 
Orange County crisis and work on the legislation full-time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can turn your back on something as though it's kind of a 
localized cancer," Hayden said Saturday. "On the one hand, the state is not 
responsible for a failed set of policies on the Orange County level. On the 
other hand, the state has fostered a climate of deregulation without oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state is broke," he added. "The state can't bail out Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Orange County is not an isolated case. It's the tip of a melting iceberg 
of irresponsible fiscal decisions abetted by special interest campaign 
contributions. If this could happen in a county that has a reputation for 
believing in fiscal conservatism, it certainly could happen, and is happening, 
in other places."

CRISIS MAY BE USED AS BAIT BY OTHER STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As details of Orange County's multibillion-dollar bond fiasco surfaced last 
week, Shelia Langdon of Des Moines and a dozen Iowa officials fanned out 
through Orange County and other parts of Southern California, trying to lure 
corporate executives to relocate companies to the Midwest or expand there. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the trip had been planned earlier, it could not have come at a better 
time for Langdon and her "Sell Iowa" team. Orange County's financial crisis -- 
leading to the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history -- has 
tarnished the image of one of the richest counties in the nation. It also has 
raised the specter of tax increases to cover the losses, giving corporate 
recruiters such as Langdon yet another weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just an opportune time to be there," Langdon said. The county's 
financial mess "was an issue that did come up at meetings. . . . Of course, 
when they're considering places to move, they're looking at the financial 
stability of the areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, like vultures perched above a fallen victim, officials in other states 
are waiting for the bankruptcy's fallout to settle and watching to see whether 
California companies are more willing to flee the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to use this as just another hook," said Jack Kyser of the 
Economic Development Corp. in Los Angeles. He worries that corporate 
departures, which had slowed this year after three years of increases, could be 
propelled by the latest disaster to hit Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County last week filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection after 
disclosures that the county's investment fund -- once valued at more than $20 
billion -- had lost more than $1.5 billion in value between Jan. 1 and Dec. 1 
because of risky investments. The filing shook financial markets nationwide and 
made news around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County and the more than 180 cities, school districts and other 
agencies that invested in the county pool say it is premature to talk about 
higher taxes or fees, but many believe they may have no choice because of the 
staggering losses. "You either eliminate service or increase fees," said Don 
Bankhead, a Fullerton city councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Johnson, chairman of Tapmatic Corp., can see the writing on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have more fees and inspections that they'll charge for," 
said Johnson, whose metalworking firm left for Idaho in March after 30 years in 
Orange County because he was fed up with the onerous business environment. 
Other businesses, Johnson said, are sure to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time something happens, there is a new exodus of companies that say 
they are sick of the place," said Bob Cooper, president of the Spokane (Wash.) 
Area Economic Development Council. "This Orange County bankruptcy just shows 
that California's problems are real. It is sad, but it is reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Several recruiters say they would never think of using another state's woes to 
attract a major corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly companies thinking of moving or expanding would be concerned" about 
a local government's solvency, said Charles Gatlin, marketing and research 
director for Atlanta's Industry, Trade and Tourism Department. "But people like 
us are using the positive things we have to attract companies, telling them 
what they would discover in Georgia." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is little doubt that Orange County's bankruptcy filing will play 
into the hands of those whose job is to persuade companies to leave California. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little too early to say, but I expect that any moves being 
contemplated will be accelerated by this," said Jon Roberts, director of 
business development for the Texas Department of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Some business executives agree. Furniture maker Studio K Inc. in Orange had 
planned to move its 15-employee operation to Idaho. But owner Eric Kearn said 
Friday that the prospect of more taxes or fees for businesses "will add to the 
momentum" of departures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Chamber of Commerce says the county and state have worked 
diligently over the last two years to shed the image many corporate executives 
have of the area -- a high-cost, congested metropolis that is unfriendly to 
business. And they point to such changes as the state's workers' compensation 
reform and the establishment of a 12-acre enterprise zone in Santa Ana that 
provides tax credits and other incentives to companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The enterprise zone was one reason Derlan Industries of Toronto set up 
operations last summer in Santa Ana. But had the county's recent financial 
problems arisen earlier, Derlan might not have come, said Michael Forsayeth, 
the company's chief financial officer. "I would be concerned about business tax 
increases," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Fred Mickelson, chairman of the Orange County chamber, said that in the 
last 18 months, local and state efforts have kept 31 companies and more than 
10,000 jobs from leaving the county. The financial crisis is a major issue, he 
said, "but it hasn't stopped us in our tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is still bullish on Orange County," he said. "The things that caused 
us to be successful haven't changed: good schools, a diverse work force, an 
entrepreneurial work ethic, business leadership and an improved business 
climate." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, he acknowledged, the business community is worried about higher utility 
taxes or property assessments because of the bankruptcy filing, and companies 
with plans to build or expand in the county will likely wait three to six 
months to see how the situation is handled. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson also said he sent reports last week to five foreign companies to 
reassure them that the bond fiasco should not alter possible plans to move 
major portions of their operations to Orange County. He refused to identify the 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the county of Orange's current financial situation," the chamber said 
in a statement last week, "the businesses within Orange County remain 
economically strong and the county itself remains a great place to live, visit 
and work." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, recruiters such as Bill Scott, director of the Oregon Economic 
Development Department, say they are still hearing complaints about 
California's historically higher taxes, higher real estate prices, higher 
development costs and slower approvals for a host of permits needed to do 
business. Plus there are increasing concerns about crime in Orange County, 
out-of-state recruiters say. 
</P>
<P>
 "California likes to say it has an image problem," Scott said. "Our response 
is that if it is an image problem, it is a real problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Potter said he has persuaded 30 California companies to move to Idaho and 
is talking with 10 more just in Orange County. Potter, who lives in La Canada 
Flintridge, said that if Orange County is forced to raise taxes and other fees, 
his work will be all that much easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you continue to price yourself out of the market, people like me will 
continue to hit home runs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorie Black, marketing director for Arizona's Commerce Department, said her 
office assisted 19 of the 315 California companies that moved to Arizona last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "A reduction in services and increased taxes (in California) may make some 
companies who are considering moving actually do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, recruitment officials are offering companies more incentives and tax 
breaks than possibly any other state. Texas also provides stable taxes and a 
financially sound government, said Jon Roberts, the state's business 
development director. But in the wake of Orange County's problems, Texas' 
investment pool has come under scrutiny. On Friday, municipalities pulled $326 
million out of the state-run fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's a package deal now," Roberts said about offers made to recruit 
companies. "So when you have one leg getting shaky, the package could fall 
apart."

 It was the first day of summer, 1991, when Secretary of State James A. Baker 
III flew to Belgrade for a look at Yugoslavia on the brink. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated European Community diplomats had already failed to find a formula 
for keeping the country together. But here was a superpower's emissary, the man 
who had just helped manage the end of the Cold War, shape German unification 
and assemble the international army that had crushed Saddam Hussein's finest in 
the Iraqi desert. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, Baker kept his distance. He met with the presidents of each of 
the Yugoslav federation's six constituent republics for an hour. He warned them 
that "history could repeat itself" -- a reference to the animosities that 
triggered World War I. To his critics' dismay, he did little else. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he left. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, the Yugoslav federation began to disintegrate. 
</P>
<P>
 First Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence. Nine months later came 
the secession of Bosnia-Herzegovina, a move that triggered a dirty, stubborn 
war in the heart of the Balkans and gave the world a new synonym for barbarity: 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The messy confusion of the war itself -- a conflict that pits the country's 
majority Muslims and minority Croats against an ill-disciplined but brazen 
rogue army of Bosnian Serbs -- has been matched only by the equally messy 
attempts by the international community to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong can be summed up in just two words -- almost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 How these efforts failed is not a tale of evil people and evil deeds but of 
bright, well-intentioned men and women, some of them overly idealistic, some of 
them arrogant, running afoul of the hard realities at critical moments in a 
part of the world that does not forgive those who err. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of their failure at these turning points has been high. In Bosnia 
itself, more than 200,000 people have died and 10 times that number have been 
displaced. The war has scorned the world's mightiest military alliance, 
discredited the United Nations, frustrated the United States, complicated U.S. 
ties with Russia and strained its links with Europe, and ended the illusion 
among Europeans that they had somehow managed to progress beyond such 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also thrown America's leadership and that of its President into 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his inauguration, Bill Clinton defined the war in Bosnia as a 
modern-day Holocaust, a moral challenge that the United States could not duck. 
"The legitimacy of 'ethnic cleansing' cannot stand," he declared, referring to 
the Bosnian Serbs' systematic murder and expulsion of Bosnian Muslims from 
nearly three-quarters of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two years later, Clinton has spent more time on Bosnia than on any 
other foreign crisis but has painfully little to show for his efforts beyond a 
steady erosion of U.S. credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, after a dizzying series of policy zigzags, the President endorses a 
peace plan that would allow the Bosnian Serbs to keep most of their conquests, 
and he seems to be ready to give in to other demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a disaster," one Clinton adviser acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Another U.S. official added, "We took a bad situation and arguably made it 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The President and his team were not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The late NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner, a German who in his youth 
bitterly accused his parents of doing too little to oppose Nazi atrocities, 
took on the challenge of bringing Western military might to bear in Bosnia as a 
personal mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Dying of cancer, he twice left his hospital bed earlier this year to chair 
crucial North Atlantic Treaty Organization meetings that delivered 
tough-sounding "retreat-or-else" ultimatums to Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 His efforts delivered the alliance into the swamp of Bosnia's political 
contradictions. The Bosnian Serbs retreated only partially, and the "or else" 
never happened. Soon enough, the Bosnian Serbs, with help from the United 
Nations, were effectively ordering around an impotent NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was convinced NATO could make the difference," said a colleague who knew 
Woerner well. "In the end, he was bitterly disillusioned." 
</P>
<P>
 He had reason to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Even within the confines of the alliance headquarters here, it is hard to 
argue against the hard assessment made recently by Senate Republican leader Bob 
Dole of Kansas: "If you want a classic failure, this is a classic failure, 
where NATO has been tied in knots -- they've almost become irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading figures within the European Union who saw the disintegration of 
Yugoslavia and the resulting war in Bosnia as their first great military 
challenge of the post-Cold War era have worked tirelessly on diplomatic 
solutions, backed a U.N. peacekeeping force and then provided many of its 
troops. But Europe's diplomacy has run into the sand, and the 24,000-strong 
U.N. force in Bosnia is a thinly veiled fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of their deployment, the peacekeepers have been reduced to 
objects of scorn and pity who have become de facto hostages of the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,200 Bangladeshi U.N. peacekeepers meant to deter a blood bath as Bosnian 
Serb forces began pressing into the northwestern enclave of Bihac last month 
were deployed to the area with no heating, no winter clothing, insufficient 
fuel and food, and one weapon for every four soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, they suffered the ultimate indignity when their attempt to withdraw 
from Bihac was blocked -- by the Serbs. "What is happening there is a disgrace 
for civilized Europe," German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said of the Bosnian war in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Moscow's attempts to nudge its Orthodox Christian Serb cousins ran 
aground, as Russia's special emissary in Bosnia, Vitaly I. Churkin, found to 
his dismay earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually composed and cool, Churkin seemed visibly shaken in the spring after 
discovering that Bosnian Serb leaders had consistently lied to him on crucial 
details regarding their agreed pullback from the town of Gorazde. "They are 
dealing with a great power and not a banana republic," Churkin raged. "One 
cannot play with Russia, and one cannot play with the world community." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bosnian Serbs did just that. They continue to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 As international efforts to resolve the Bosnian conflict collapse into a 
series of accusations, recriminations and laments, one of the key factors 
keeping the U.N. force in the country at all is the complexity of getting them 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a major rescue operation with thousands of lightly armed 
troops maybe having to fight their way out," said John Chipman, director of the 
London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. "The prospect of 
withdrawal is almost as chilling as the prospect of staying." 
</P>
<P>
 While there is little argument that the disintegration of the Yugoslav 
federation and the resulting Bosnian war represent a major European crisis, it 
has been the relentless pictures and other accounts of the atrocities there 
that have kept the conflict a major public issue throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
 But while those accounts generate enormous moral pressure "to do something" to 
end the carnage, other, more powerful, factors have worked to preclude action 
that might be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, three key factors neutralized the West: 
</P>
<P>
 * Public opinion. The schizophrenic nature of public opinion has demanded 
action but at minimal cost. At no time during the war has public sympathy in 
America or in Western Europe been strong enough to support the view that Bosnia 
is a cause worth sacrificing its own sons and daughters for. 
</P>
<P>
 The very nature of the conflict, a confusing affair with few ideological 
principles, no clearly defined "good guys" and the absence of compelling 
strategic interests, undercut the position of those pressing to do more. 
</P>
<P>
 In crucial discussions during the Clinton Administration's first months, 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher privately passed around polls 
demonstrating the depth of public resistance to involvement in Bosnia, to 
discourage those counseling action. 
</P>
<P>
 * Military advice. There has been a near-universal rejection of the option of 
armed intervention among military leaders on both sides of the Atlantic. The 
idea of trying to separate and pacify three different but intertwined warring 
communities in forbidding, mountainous terrain far from any well-established 
bases was a recipe for disaster, the generals concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 * Political caution. Clinton and other Western leaders concluded that, however 
compelling the suffering in Bosnia and however disturbing the challenge to 
human values there, sending troops in a final attempt to end the war was not 
worth the risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody had the stomach to put in troops, so there was no sense in saying we 
were going to fix the problem. All we could do was manage it and reduce the 
suffering," a Clinton adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing these realities, many turned to the United Nations as a convenient out. 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, 1991, the U.N. Security Council has adopted more than 100 
resolutions and statements dealing with the crisis in the former Yugoslav 
federation, almost all focusing on Bosnia. There is little doubt that most were 
passed in order to quiet public opinion rather than out of any realistic hope 
that they would change the situation on the ground in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Maria Mendiluce, the Basque who headed the U.N. relief program in Bosnia 
until about a year ago, once called the U.N. Bosnian mission an "alibi." 
Governments could always point to the U.N. peacekeepers and humanitarian 
workers as proof they were doing something. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the word peacekeeper is an unfortunate misnomer, the official name -- 
the U.N. Protection Force -- is equally misleading. Its job is not to protect 
civilians from murder, rape or other violence. In fact, it is not allowed to 
protect people -- as became dramatically clear on Jan. 8, 1993, when French 
peacekeepers stood by and watched Serbian gunmen assassinate Bosnian Vice 
Premier Hakija Turajlic in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the force's job is to escort humanitarian aid when and where the 
warring parties agree, patrol six U.N.-designated "safe areas" and monitor 
heavy-weapons exclusion zones around Sarajevo and Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting these realities seemed to come more easily to Europeans than to 
Americans. Britain, France and Russia all had sympathies for the Serbs, who had 
fought with them in both world wars. 
</P>
<P>
 A strong moral streak in Clinton's foreign policy also made it far more 
difficult for America to reject the idea of punishing the Bosnian Serbs with 
air strikes and lifting the arms embargo that hampered the outgunned Bosnian 
government's ability to fight back. 
</P>
<P>
 These transatlantic differences bedeviled the search for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 While Europe doggedly pressed for a negotiated settlement, even if it meant 
rewarding Serbian aggression, the new Administration came to office troubled 
and deeply split on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and some of his senior advisers, including Vice President Al Gore and 
U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, felt they had taken a moral position on 
"ethnic cleansing" -- one that they did not want to abandon. After all, in the 
election campaign, Clinton had denounced then-President George Bush for doing 
too little in Bosnia and had called for possible air strikes against the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher and then-Defense Secretary Les Aspin pressed home the 
realities of public opinion and the dead end of the military option. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bosnian and U.S. officials, the divisions within the 
Administration ran so deep that in the spring of 1993, when State Department 
special envoy Reginald Bartholomew was urging Bosnian President Alija 
Izetbegovic to sign a peace plan giving considerable territory to the Bosnian 
Serbs, White House aides were urging him to hold out for better terms. 
</P>
<P>
 These differences -- within the Administration and across the Atlantic -- 
proved disastrous in the search for peace. They sent conflicting signals at 
crucial moments. They gave the Bosnian government false hopes of a possible 
better deal and prepared the ground for damaging rifts between the Western 
allies that would extend deep into NATO and the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1993, the European Community, as the EU then was known, threw its 
weight behind a plan drawn up by former Secretary of State Cyrus R. Vance and 
Lord Owen, a former British foreign secretary, that proposed giving the Serbs 
43% of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Vance and Owen had a strategy for winning acceptance of their plan: They would 
swiftly sign up the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims and then generate enough 
international pressure to force the Bosnian Serbs to sign. The Bosnian Croats 
signed, but the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government hesitated. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials are sure the Bosnian Muslims balked because they expected the 
Clinton Administration to denounce the plan and offer them something better. 
Certainly Clinton's election had boosted Bosnian government spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a little hope in the Clinton Administration," Haris Silajdzic, then 
Bosnia's foreign minister and now its prime minister, said after the 
inauguration. "He strikes me as a humanist, while the Europeans are hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton's more cautious advisers, including Aspin and Christopher, were 
already warning him that his goals were going to be difficult to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the President listened to these advisers; Bartholomew, his special 
emissary, persuaded the Muslims to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 But three crucial months were lost. "Those three months let the Serbs off the 
hook," said one official close to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are convinced that Clinton's idealistic rhetoric and his initial refusal 
to back the Vance-Owen plan scuttled the last, best chance for a just 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, even with the Muslim delay, Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic 
nearly buckled under Western pressure. Bartholomew managed to persuade Russia 
for the first time to press the Bosnian Serbs; sanctions against Serbia itself 
were tightened, and the threat of air strikes to enforce recently established 
U.N.-designated safe areas seemed real. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing no way out, Karadzic signed the Vance-Owen plan. But sensing divisions 
and doubt within the West on its willingness to follow through on its threats, 
the Bosnian Serb leader quickly subjected the accord to ratification by a 
self-styled Serbian parliament and the Bosnian Serb electorate, both of which 
rejected it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vance-Owen plan was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Western credibility would soon share a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-led hard talk and threat of air power against the Bosnian Serbs if 
they rejected Vance-Owen suddenly melted in the warmth of the war's second 
spring. Christopher, dispatched by Clinton to Europe to drum up support for a 
U.S. plan to lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian government and punish 
the Bosnian Serbs with air strikes, was universally snubbed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a humiliating rejection for the new President, who quickly changed 
course. He joined with Russia, Spain, France and Britain to present a new peace 
plan, revised to the dominant rebel Serbs' liking. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan too would eventually be rejected. But the exposure of the West's 
divisions and the U.S. failure to gain European support for its tough stance 
against the Bosnian Serbs in the spring of 1993 proved to be a turning point. 
For Karadzic, the message was suddenly clear: The Western allies were unwilling 
to confront his undisciplined army militarily. They would not follow through 
with other threats. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to sway the Bosnian Serbs had diminished sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton about-face also left the Bosnian government devastated. Instead of 
the President bending Europeans to his will, the opposite had occurred. "He 
promised things and he promised in such a way that he had no excuse for not 
fulfilling those promises," Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic noted bitterly in 
a June, 1993, interview. "It is American foreign policy and the American ideal 
of democracy that is losing here." 
</P>
<P>
 About this time, the United Nations turned to NATO for help in protecting its 
peacekeepers from increasing Bosnian Serb attacks. The United Nations also 
wanted alliance help to protect the six U.N.-designated safe areas established 
as havens for Muslim refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiastically supported by the United States, NATO agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 But at an important Aug. 9, 1993, meeting of NATO ambassadors in Brussels, 
those nations with peacekeepers on the ground -- led by Britain, France, Norway 
and Canada -- argued that any NATO attack must also be approved by the U.N. 
commander on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision would turn the use of Western air power into a tragicomic farce, 
chill ties between the United Nations and NATO and drive a wedge into alliance 
unity. "It seemed logical at the time," said one of those present at the 
meeting. "We all thought we were on the same side." 
</P>
<P>
 They weren't. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside and outside NATO, the United States again found itself at odds with its 
European allies. The U.S. desire to punish Bosnian Serb violations was 
countered by European concern that NATO air strikes could lead to reprisals 
against peacekeepers on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious soon became clear: The United Nations and NATO had conflicting 
agendas. The immediate concern of U.N. commanders and senior civilian officials 
was not punishing aggression but keeping the peacekeepers safe. 
</P>
<P>
 When NATO last February wanted to strike at Bosnian Serb artillery pieces 
still inside a weapons exclusion zone around Sarajevo after an alliance 
ultimatum to remove them expired, the U.N. commander in Bosnia, British Lt. 
Gen. Michael Rose, refused, declaring the Serbs "in effective compliance." 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic again understood that the world's mightiest air force posed little 
threat to his forces. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months since, NATO requests for air strikes have frequently been 
denied. When the United Nations has agreed, its conditions have made the job of 
alliance pilots difficult and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 One final transatlantic clash occurred within the alliance on Thanksgiving 
Day, when France vetoed a U.S. plan for greater use of NATO air power. The 
intensity of that confrontation left diplomats so shaken that they agreed to 
back away from the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, NATO's primary task is no longer pressing for air strikes against Bosnian 
Serbs but planning how to rescue the United Nations' peacekeepers from a 
country they never saw at peace. 
</P>
<P>
 As NATO's drama with the United Nations played out, the major powers launched 
one final diplomatic initiative. The so-called Contact Group -- made up of 
Russia, Britain, Germany, France and the United States -- presented the warring 
parties with a map that, this time, gave the Bosnian Serbs 49% of 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 They attached a July 20 deadline for acceptance, again threatening dire 
consequences unless all signed. The Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats, who had 
since reconciled, reluctantly said yes. The Bosnian Serbs, as expected, said 
no. Increasingly confident and having taken 70% of Bosnian territory, they had 
little reason to do otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the five Contact Group foreign ministers met again in 
Brussels amid reports they were ready to sweeten the settlement for the Bosnian 
Serbs, even allowing them to annex their territory to Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the five could agree only to press the Bosnian Serbs to accept the 
existing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see any other road to take," Christopher said at a late-night news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the world's most powerful nations had run out of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration had also apparently come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 From Clinton's initial soaring statements, Defense Secretary William J. Perry 
now drew a more modest assessment of U.S. involvement in the crisis, saying the 
Administration had defended the nation's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our national interests are to stop the spread of war and to limit the 
violence," he said.

GOP FACES RUGGED JOURNEY IN QUEST FOR WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ballots had scarcely been tallied in last month's midterm elections before 
Republican Sens. Bob Dole of Kansas, Phil Gramm of Texas and Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania were off to make new friends in Iowa, where the competition to 
become the next GOP standard-bearer doesn't officially begin for 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The early burst of activity is easy to understand. The Republicans' stunning 
sweep of Congress has boosted optimism about the party's chances of recapturing 
the White House, making a GOP presidential nomination that much more desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the glow from November's triumph fades, party professionals soberly 
acknowledge that the path back to the Oval Office will not be an easy one. On 
the contrary, it is fraught with perils -- many of a sort that Republicans have 
not had to face for half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they took control of Congress, Republicans could concentrate simply on 
denouncing President Clinton's government. Now they are responsible for half 
the government themselves. Said Charles Black, who will probably manage the 
presidential campaign of either Gramm or former Housing and Urban Development 
Secretary Jack Kemp: "Voters expect performance from us." 
</P>
<P>
 GOP strategists acknowledge that those expectations may be difficult to meet 
for a host of reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the 1996 presidential contenders face the biggest early crush of 
primaries and caucuses ever -- a situation that is largely a result of states' 
efforts to position themselves as powerbrokers. The shortened schedule creates 
a fund-raising burden that could obliterate the hopes of all but a few 
well-heeled candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, Republicans like to dwell on the positive side of their 
election victory. By scoring a net gain of 10 governorships, the Republicans 
took command of 30 states, including eight of the nine largest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more depth at the state level than we have had since '64," said 
Republican political consultant Eddie Mahe, a veteran of the last five 
presidential campaigns. "And that gives us more power to drive turnout on 
Election Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Some also rejoice at the chance to shape the national political debate. "The 
Republicans in Congress now have the chance to adopt a positive agenda," said 
Bill Phillips, a former GOP Senate staffer who is thinking about helping the 
efforts of either of two 1996 prospects -- California Gov. Pete Wilson or 
former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, finding the magic formula for the 1996 presidential campaign 
could turn out to be particularly hard for the Republicans because so much of 
the early action is going to take place on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The merging of our congressional agenda, which is going to be aggressive, 
with our presidential campaign message could create some opportunities for real 
pain," Mahe worried aloud in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 While presidential candidates like to deal in sweeping generalizations, 
stressing themes rather than specifics, legislators make deals and cut corners 
-- just the sort of maneuvers that can turn off potential constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, in addition to the general tension between campaigning and 
legislation, the GOP must worry about a host of potential conflicts over 
specific issues that could spill over on the campaign trail from Congress -- 
and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Senate Republican leader and prospective candidate Dole, who 
still harbors the traditional conservative concerns about holding down the 
federal budget deficit, has made it clear he is less enthusiastic than incoming 
House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) about enacting the House GOP's "contract 
with America," with its package of tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The same issue also presents the potential for a clash in the Senate -- and on 
the hustings -- between Dole and Gramm, an influential Senate force and a 
formidable rival for GOP nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 A fight is already under way on immigration policy. It was touched off before 
last month's elections by Kemp, who denounced Proposition 187, the successful 
California ballot measure, backed by Wilson, that cuts off public services to 
illegal immigrants. GOP pollster Frank Luntz predicts that the battle will be 
renewed in states troubled by illegal immigration, notably California, Texas 
and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally touchy and divisive are social issues, particularly school prayer and 
abortion. No sooner had Gingrich announced his intentions to push for adoption 
of a school prayer amendment to the Constitution than a number of Republican 
governors urged their colleagues in Congress to concentrate instead on the 
economic issues that produced the Republican landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Michigan Gov. John Engler, a conservative on social issues, said: "If we 
don't deal with economic issues, we'll need more than prayer to solve our 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, supporters of abortion rights are planning another effort at the 
1996 Republican convention to modify or repeal the party's platform plank 
favoring a constitutional ban on abortion. They are hoping to get help from 
such sympathetic governors as Wilson, Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and 
William F. Weld of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those expected to lead the charge on the other side is conservative 
commentator and former Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan White House aide Patrick 
J. Buchanan, who is weighing a 1996 follow-up to his 1992 challenge to 
President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that the platform should not be changed," said his sister and 
likely campaign manager, Angela (Bay) Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever else they disagree on, most Republicans accept the notion that money 
will be the key to success in the nominating contest more than at any time in 
history. The reason: A number of big states have moved up their primary dates 
to the early part of the calendar. The move was begun by California and others 
-- notably New York and Ohio -- quickly followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that by the end of March, 1996, voters in at least 25 states 
will have cast ballots for an estimated 1,150 delegates -- well over half the 
2,000 or so delegates who will choose the 1996 GOP nominee. By comparison, in 
1992 only 17 states had selected 823 of 2,210 delegates by that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican strategists theorize that to compete effectively, a candidate must 
be able to raise $20 million by the end of January, 1995. That's more money 
than the combined total raised by all the Democratic candidates by that date in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the judgments of party professionals, which are weighted heavily by 
their view of a candidate's ability to raise funds, here's a brief, early look 
at the strengths and weaknesses of the GOP's prospects for the White House: The 
Front-Runners 
</P>
<P>
 BOB DOLE: As the GOP's senior national elected official, the 71-year-old 
Kansan can make news and get attention almost at will. He already has two 
presidential campaigns under his belt and has proved he can raise the funds 
that he would need in 1996 if, as is widely expected, he decides to run. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dole's role in the Senate could turn out to be as much of a burden as a 
boost by draining time and energy he would need for the campaign trail. 
Moreover, Dole has yet to demonstrate that he can extend his vision beyond the 
limits of the Senate chamber to build a presidential base of support. "The 
better a senator you are, the worse you are at projecting the national 
leadership you need as President," said one adviser, David Keene. 
</P>
<P>
 PHIL GRAMM: No one, except possibly Dole, will be better fixed financially 
than Gramm for a presidential campaign. He has clearly telegraphed his 
intention to enter the race, perhaps in a month or two. No one is considered 
better organized intellectually and politically for meeting the challenges of 
the campaign trail than the 52-year-old ex-Democrat, who has dedicated his 
career to cutting taxes and spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm jokes that he may be too homely to be President. But his critics, and 
even some of his admirers, say his real problem is his bloodless style. "It is 
unclear that he can inspire any kind of emotional response from voters," said 
one sometime adviser. The Second Tier 
</P>
<P>
 LAMAR ALEXANDER: By hustling for grass-roots support and appealing to the 
public's anti-Washington mood with the slogan: "Cut their pay and send them 
home," the former Tennessee governor has probably taken better advantage of the 
past two years than any of his rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 51-year-old Alexander remains a relative unknown, and, although no one 
doubts that he will run, many Republicans doubt he will be able to raise enough 
money. Some also wonder whether, beyond his catchy slogan, Alexander has much 
to say. 
</P>
<P>
 DICK CHENEY: As former defense secretary, former House whip and former Gerald 
R. Ford White House chief of staff, the 51-year-old Cheney has impressive 
credentials. No one in the field is more respected for his intellect, integrity 
and political savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cheney has never run for office outside his home state of Wyoming and 
would probably have trouble raising money in a large field. Some say his 
cerebral style is too dull for the presidential campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
 JACK KEMP: The 59-year-old Kemp can claim a national base of support, and his 
inclusive view of conservatism offers the broadest potential appeal of any 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 But even his admirers complain that he has spent the last two years seemingly 
adrift and that he lacks focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is that he either won't run, or if he does, will make up his mind 
too late," said one supporter of Kemp's 1988 bid for the GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 DAN QUAYLE: Unless his recovery from his recent pulmonary embolism turns out 
to be more complicated than his doctors predict, Quayle is expected to run. 
"Nothing else interests him, including making money," one former aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old former vice president's assets are high name recognition and 
the theme of family values that he helped introduce to national politics. But 
most professionals say that it will take him more than one presidential 
campaign to overcome the lightweight image he acquired as Bush's understudy. 
</P>
<P>
 PETE WILSON: By winning reelection to the governorship of the nation's most 
populous state, the 61-year-old made himself a potential factor in 1996. Apart 
from his presumed ability to deliver his state's 54 electoral votes, Wilson 
also has a reputation for pragmatic governance that his admirers claim would 
match the public mood. 
</P>
<P>
 But others contend that given his problems at home, including having to deal 
with Democratic Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, Wilson would be well-advised to stick to 
his stated intention not to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Even this list is not complete. Others who are considering the run range from 
such long shots as Buchanan on the right to Specter. Although Buchanan, 55, 
still has a base of support from his 1992 campaign against Bush, his critics 
say his views on trade, foreign policy and social issues are too extreme and 
his style too abrasive. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the 64-year-old Specter, who is considering making a run as an economic 
conservative and a moderate on social issues, most analysts say he would have a 
hard time surmounting his liberal image. They believe Weld, 49, another long 
shot with moderate views on social issues, would have a better chance, should 
he decide to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Still another possibility is former Secretary of State James A. Baker III. But 
critics note that Baker, 64, has never won elective office and that his recent 
experience has been limited to foreign affairs. Whichever candidate ultimately 
captures the nomination, he will hope to have learned a lesson from history. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress in advance of 
a presidential election was in 1946. But they were unable to capitalize on what 
should have been a golden opportunity to seize the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did President Harry S. Truman retain the presidency by upsetting GOP 
standard-bearer Thomas E. Dewey, but Democrats took back the Senate and House. 
</P>
<P>
 Dewey biographer Richard Norton Smith wrote that one reason Truman won was 
because he "skillfully exploited the chronic split within GOP ranks" between 
hard-line conservative congressional leaders who wanted to undo government 
activism and the party's moderates, led by Dewey. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, now director of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, and other 
analysts say they believe that the Republicans could fall into a similar 
pitfall in the 1996 campaign if they misread the mandate that gave them their 
new power in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is a universal condemnation of government" in the 
election returns, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the lesson to be drawn from the vote, he said, "is that the race is on 
to formulate a new approach to government -- one that is sympathetic to people 
and reflects the values of taxpayers."

SUMMIT NATIONS AGREE TO CREATE FREE-TRADE ZONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Embarking on what President Clinton called a "historic step," the United 
States and 33 other nations of the Western Hemisphere agreed Saturday to 
complete complex negotiations within a decade to eliminate all tariffs and 
other barriers to free trade from the Arctic to Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the agreement we have made today to launch the Free Trade Area of 
the Americas will produce more jobs, higher incomes and greater opportunities 
for all of our people," Clinton said, setting the goal of establishing a 
free-trade zone of unprecedented economic and geographic reach. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is the centerpiece of the weekend Summit of the Americas. It is 
seen as an ambitious and concrete measure that will spur liberalization of 
trade and boost commerce, not only in the hemisphere but around the world. It 
would not actually be implemented until some time beyond the target date of 
2005, when the negotiations should be finished. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit, which ends today, is the first such gathering in 27 years. It has 
brought to Miami the presidents or prime ministers of every nation from Canada 
to Argentina. Only Cuba's Fidel Castro is missing, but in the aftermath of the 
Cold War and the collapse of his Soviet allies, his absence no longer casts a 
shadow over such proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a massive demonstration by his many opponents in the Cuban expatriate 
community here was barely recognized during a day in which the overriding theme 
was Latin America's turn toward market economies and away from the often 
heavy-handed state interference of the post-World War II era. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the U.S. embargo against Cuba was not officially a subject of 
discussion, presidents of three of the largest countries of Latin America -- 
Brazil, Mexico and Colombia -- suggested that dialogue rather than isolation is 
the best way to push for democracy in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 But Argentine President Carlos Menem said Cuba's government "must begin an 
opening toward representative and pluralistic democracy" if it wishes to rejoin 
the hemispherical community, according to the text of his speech to the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo emphasized his country's traditional 
insistence on a policy of nonintervention, an indirect slap at the United 
States' Cuba policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the only other sour note that cast a pall over the summit, several 
Latin presidents expressed their dismay to Clinton over Proposition 187, the 
measure passed by California voters that denies education and other public 
benefits to undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian President Ernesto Samper said he told Clinton that the measure "sets 
an abysmal precedent" in relations between Latin America and the United States 
that "violates a long good-neighbor tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton assured the summit participants that his Administration does not 
support the measure, and he added that immigration policy as a whole should be 
reviewed, according to Panamanian officials who attended the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In other steps, the participants committed themselves to banning the sale of 
leaded gasoline, a common cause of health-damaging lead in the bloodstream; to 
tackling the difficult issue of pesticide use, and to studying the 
"empowerment" of women and indigenous people, said Carol Browner, administrator 
of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders also said their aides will address as a group such common scourges 
as drug trafficking, corruption and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Clinton, the summit principally provided one more opportunity to nail 
down his goal of using trade as an engine to power U.S. economic growth, based 
on the theory that it creates markets for U.S. manufacturers, farmers and, 
increasingly, financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade agreement that will be negotiated as a result of Saturday's action, 
Clinton said, "will cover a comprehensive list of areas, from tariffs on goods, 
to services, to agricultural and intellectual property." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the key building block in our creation of a partnership for 
prosperity," he said during a break in the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a shift from Cold War policy, the U.S. government is trying to meld foreign 
and economic policy, to build relationships with other nations and regions 
based on expanded commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Clinton split with many Democratic allies last year to gain approval of 
the North American Free Trade Agreement. He also completed negotiations on the 
expansion of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and agreed with the 
leaders of 17 other Pacific Rim nations to set a goal of eliminating tariffs 
among them by the year 2020. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton argues that this course will open foreign markets to the products of 
U.S. workers, creating jobs in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say such an approach risks opening the United States to competition 
from lower-priced products, bringing pressure to hold down wages and lowering 
the standard of living in the United States while also leading the United 
States to do business with nations that allow labor and environmental practices 
that do not meet U.S. standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Clinton Administration officials involved in the negotiations leading 
up to the agreement said Saturday that they had won reluctant support from 
Latin American nations for including language in the Declaration of Principles 
that singles out the goals of protecting the environment and protecting 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said they accomplished 
this by holding out support for setting a specific date for negotiating the 
free-trade accord. While the summit endorsed that goal Saturday, there was 
dissension in preliminary talks, with some advocating speedier action and 
others initially wanting to slow down. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the U.S. team said it would be willing to go along with the goal 
of completing negotiations by 2005 -- which it had silently supported but did 
not want to push for fear of producing an anti-U.S. reaction -- if the others 
would sign on to a somewhat greater emphasis on the need to protect labor and 
the environment from exploitation in the rush toward economic development, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sensitive political issue in the United States and among U.S. trading 
partners in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is under increasing pressure from some organized labor and 
environmental groups, important members of his political base, to hold firmly 
to strict provisions in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans, about to move into the majority in the House and Senate, are 
pushing Clinton to advance the goal of reduced tariffs, the taxes charged on 
imports, and lowered import quotas with only minimum encumbrances. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting these crosscurrents, Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) sent Clinton 
a nine-page letter Wednesday telling him that "we must not allow the 
Republicans to treat worker rights and environmental issues as back-seat 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is likely to come up early next year when the President seeks 
renewed authority to negotiate trade agreements on what is known as a 
"fast-track" basis, in which Congress can only vote to approve or disapprove 
the accords without amending them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration will seek such authority before beginning talks with Chile 
to bring the Andean nation into NAFTA, which now embraces the United States, 
Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is expected to announce today that negotiations with Chile will begin 
next year. U.S. and Chilean officials completed preliminary talks Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chile can be looked at as the first step forward in an effort that will 
eventually integrate almost all of the Americas, if not all," Chilean Finance 
Minister Eduardo Aninat said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 By moving to include Chile in the pact, the United States is signaling to 
other Latin American nations that they can gain tariff-free access to the U.S. 
market one by one, without waiting for the hemisphere-wide agreement, if they 
emulate Chile's creation of a strong free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Mark Rosenberg, a Latin America specialist at Miami's Florida 
International University, said the speedy acceptance of Chile as a new partner 
in the pact "would send a message to other countries as to what exactly they 
are going to have to do if they want to be like Chile." 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia's Samper, for example, said he is confident that Colombia would be 
"No. 2 or No. 3" to join the pact.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BRAIN TRUST; LEAD ATTORNEY IN COUNTY BANKRUPTCY 
EARNED A WHIZ KID REPUTATION BY RESOLVING BIG CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He skipped a year of college, finished law school at the age of 23 and zipped 
along the fast track to make partner at his prestigious law firm a year ahead 
of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been an attorney only half as long as Robert L. Citron served as Orange 
County's treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bruce Bennett, a 36-year-old, Brooklyn-born whiz kid who spent his 
collegiate summers designing computer software for a top New York investment 
bank, is the lead attorney in the largest municipal bankruptcy case in U.S. 
history. He is charting new legal territory as he maneuvers to save the county 
from the mess Citron left. 
</P>
<P>
 Even his wife, who is a corporate litigator, said that when she met Bennett 
four years ago while collaborating on a case, she wondered what a man so young 
was doing with a job so big. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here he was at the center of this huge, $6-billion bankruptcy and he looked 
like a kid," Paula Bennett recalled of what was then her husband's biggest 
case, the restructuring of a large Canadian retail outfit. "I'm not intimidated 
by very many people, and I was intimidated by Bruce." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleagues in the clubby, complex field of bankruptcy law say Bennett's 
intimate understanding of the world of finance combines with his fast mind -- 
and fast mouth -- to make him a star. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is just, simply, the best there is" in his field, said Philip Slayton, a 
Canadian corporate lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 But friends also call him with questions about everything from architecture to 
quantum mechanics because of his uncanny ability to remember virtually all he 
reads. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Bennett says her high-powered husband, who commands $375 an hour (the 
price tag will jump $10 in January) is uncommonly considerate. He insisted that 
the couple paint her mother's house themselves when he was unhappy with the 
contractors, and asks her brother, a reporter, for daily faxes of his articles. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in the New York suburb of New City, Bennett and his younger brother, 
Perry, both learned to program computers to please their engineer father. Perry 
followed his father's lead and became an engineer, too, while Bruce's wizardry 
with numbers seemed to propel him toward Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 At Brown University in Providence, R.I., Bennett took a rigorous double major 
in applied mathematics and economics, graduating magna cum laude in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Working summers and some weekends at Salomon Bros., the Wall Street firm now 
helping Orange County untangle its failed investment portfolio, Bennett worried 
that he would burn out early from a career in investment banking and instead 
headed to Harvard Law School. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bennett was among the youngest in his class, "this guy was just way 
ahead of the rest of us," said classmate Steve Lunghino. "Nobody failed to 
notice how bright Bruce was," Lunghino said. "It did not escape anybody's 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said he sought a specialty that combined law and finance. "If you 
interview the entering class at Harvard Law School, or any class, no one is 
going to say they want to be a bankruptcy lawyer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a professor at Harvard, impressed with Bennett's understanding of finance, 
steered him toward Stutman, Treister & Glatt, a small operation of 30 lawyers 
in Los Angeles that handles nothing but bankruptcies, an area of the law they 
prefer to call "restructuring." 
</P>
<P>
 "The first summer he was there, we had a particularly challenging case," Isaac 
Pachulski said. "He was a summer clerk. He was working under supervision. But 
later we laughed about the way he had taken charge of the case." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not long before Bennett was in charge of big cases. 
</P>
<P>
 He restructured Storage Technologies' subsidiaries in Europe, Japan, Saudi 
Arabia and Australia. He reorganized Amoco Corp. as it acquired Dome Petroleum 
Ltd., which had $5.3 billion in debt. He designed the deal to divide the assets 
of U.S. subsidiaries of Campeau Corp. when the company went bankrupt. And he 
represented equity holders when Olympia and York Developments Ltd. failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I'm most proud of is just that I've got them done. I haven't yet 
had a major case fall apart on me," Bennett said over a cellular phone as he 
drove from Santa Ana to his Brentwood home late one night last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers from Los Angeles to New York to Toronto brag about Bennett's 
remarkable success in the Campeau case, where he designed a deal that somehow 
pleased competing creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the rest of the world was trying to figure out what the best litigation 
strategy was and how many lawyers were going to be in on it, what Bruce did is 
take the claims, pencil in the amounts, and sitting -- probably in a quiet room 
by himself -- and figuring out the financial strategy between dozens of 
parties," said Michael Morris, a Stutman, Treister partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett has his faults, friends and colleagues say. 
</P>
<P>
 At a party celebrating the end of the Campeau case, a Canadian lawyer played 
Bennett in a skit as a whiny, arrogant, control freak whose insecurity exploded 
when he thought things were happening behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who have worked with him said Bennett, like many super-brains, gets 
frustrated when those around him cannot keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He finds it difficult sometimes to tolerate people who aren't very smart," 
said Michael Parks, president of Aurora National Life Insurance Co. and a close 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the office, friends praise Bennett's sly, subtle sense of humor and 
keen interest in a range of topics. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid cyclist, he postponed proposing to Paula until their bicycling 
vacation in the south of France, finally popping the question on a bridge in 
Paris. When his son, Adam, was born eight months ago, he took a three-month 
sabbatical from work to stay at home. Joel, Bennett's 9-year-old son from his 
first marriage, lives on the East Coast but visits during school vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, Bennett's avocation has been architecture. He plans to tear down the 
$895,000 Spanish-style house he has lived in since 1985 and start over. He 
spends hours poring over blueprints, hoping to understand every detail. He 
reads Architectural Digest as religiously as the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times is delivered daily to his home, but because the paper's 
West Coast edition often omits local news articles by his brother-in-law, 
Richard Perez-Pena, Bennett gets a second daily dispatch of New York news by 
fax. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a lawyer 24 hours a day, which I appreciate," Perez-Pena said. "For 
a non-journalist, he is extremely knowledgeable about journalism. He'll sit 
there and pick my brain about it for a long time. He's very perceptive." Bruce 
Scott Bennett

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; 2 CITIES SEE NO IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS WITH CASH FLOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EAMES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Montebello and Claremont have large chunks of money tied up in Orange 
County's frozen investment fund, officials for the cities say they have enough 
cash to handle day-to-day expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by a high rate of return, Montebello and Claremont have been investing 
in the Orange County pool since 1991. Montebello has $47 million -- 60% of the 
city's investment portfolio -- in the fund, while Claremont placed nearly half 
of its $12 million investment funds in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund's troubles have left Montebello in a particularly difficult position, 
because the city has $25 million in loan payments due at the end of the month. 
City Administrator Richard Torres was quoted in a wire service report Friday as 
saying his city "may be the next one" to declare bankruptcy after Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize I created a stir by saying it, but it was just a statement I made 
out of frustration," Torres said later, insisting that officials have no plans 
to take that action. 
</P>
<P>
 A bankruptcy filing "is definitely not imminent," he said after a series of 
meetings Friday with Orange County officials and his city attorney. "It's not 
something we're planning to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello officials say they are weighing several alternatives for repaying 
the $25 million, borrowed in anticipation of tax and other revenues. Options 
include rolling over the debt to later due dates or seeking financing from a 
bank, said Torres, who has called a special City Council meeting today to 
discuss hiring a lawyer to advise the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Torres said Montebello, a city of 60,000, would be able to 
meet day-to-day operating expenses. "We worked out our cash flows through the 
end of the fiscal year and there is no problem in that regard." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Claremont City Manager Glenn Southard said Saturday that his staff 
does not expect cash flow difficulties while they try to figure out what the 
Orange County crisis means to their community of 33,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're in an automobile accident and a person comes up to you and asks you 
how much is it going to cost to fix the car," Southard said. "You have to do 
some analysis to come up with that figure. In this case, it was a multi-car 
crash so we're trying to sort through that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously," Southard added, "any loss of money will have an impact, but we 
are not using this money for day-to-day operations so there is no immediate 
effect." 
</P>
<P>
 Southard said cities that have contributed to the fund are forming a committee 
to cope with the problem and that he has formed a task force of Claremont 
officials to deal with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst case is that you lose it all," he said, "and the best case is that 
you keep it all. The reality is probably going to be somewhere in between." 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello and Claremont are two of a handful of cities outside of Orange 
County that invested in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did very well and we felt all along it was a safe investment," Torres 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Montebello City Council minutes show that the council asked for a 
briefing on the city's investment policy earlier this year, Torres said the 
questions were routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're talking about this kind of money, people should be asking 
questions and they did. And we were given assurances that there were not the 
type of risks that there turned out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened, happened," Torres said Saturday. "And now we're looking at 
what our options may be to recover in the best way we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Montebello has been floating tax and revenue anticipation notes and investing 
the proceeds in the Orange County pool for three years. By borrowing money at 
low interest rates and investing it in the county's high-paying fund, the city 
has made $5 million in that period, Finance Director Ted Nix said.

ON CALIFORNIA: ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; HE TRIED TO TELL THEM SO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine months ago, on the first Monday in February, a young Orange County 
accountant with political ambitions summoned the press to his storefront 
office. John Moorlach had decided to run for county treasurer. He wanted to 
open his candidacy outdoors, awash in the morning sunshine. Unfortunately, a 
hard rain forced the festivities inside. It didn't matter much. Only one 
reporter bothered to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, Moorlach waded into his script. The tall, bearded 38-year-old told 
a bit about himself, about his Orange County upbringing, his family, his 
credentials as a Republican volunteer, his career as a CPA. Then he turned to 
what would become his central campaign issue -- the investment practices of his 
opponent, longtime incumbent Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach quoted from a newspaper article that had reported that Orange County 
earned bigger returns on its investments than anywhere else in the land. While 
this was, on its face, swell news, it also raised -- in Moorlach's view anyway 
-- some serious questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can this be?" he asked. "You can only achieve the highest interest rates 
in the nation by taking the highest risks in the nation. Should our reserve 
funds be in high risk investments? . . . It's dangerous to rely on the old 
cliche that 'if it isn't broken, don't fix it.' How do we know it isn't broken? 
Who is keeping the incumbent accountable? What if he is running his investments 
beyond the motor's red line month after month? Who is to say we are not headed 
for problems?" 
</P>
<P>
 Excellent questions, it turned out. Excellent questions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the campaign progressed, Moorlach tightened his focus on Citron's 
investment policies. The more he learned, the less he liked. Citron had bet the 
county pot on low interest rates, and instead interest rates were upward bound. 
Moorlach obtained a copy of the portfolio and passed it around to half a dozen 
outside experts. They reported back that the county was headed for a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me," Moorlach would recall, " 'Don't win. You don't want this job.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'I don't?' 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'No, not unless you want to be the one who rides this thing down 
to the bottom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he persisted. It was a complicated case to make. He introduced Rotary 
and Kiwanis clubs to such investment esoterica as derivatives and inverse 
floaters and reverse repurchase agreements. He wrote the Board of Supervisors, 
warning it to rein in Citron or "expect the worse." He delivered bundles of 
documents to newspaper editors, scribbled on chalkboards, and searched without 
success for a way to break through, for a slogan, a sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best I did was at a big Republican dinner in Dana Point. They gave me 10 
seconds to speak. I got up and said, "We have got to take down Citron, before 
Citron takes down Orange County.' Afterward, I was told that I needed to change 
my message, to tone it down. But I said, 'It's true. It is going to happen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The prophet of doom was treated as prophets of doom have been treated across 
history. They crushed him. Throughout the campaign, Moorlach was ridiculed as a 
punk, a know-nothing, a Chicken Little. "The sky is not falling," Citron would 
coo at every opportunity -- and who wouldn't want to believe it? In the end, 
Citron waltzed to reelection. Moorlach slouched back to his CPA practice -- and 
waited for the sky to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 It fell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach had promised, if elected, to unwind the portfolio on Day 1, absorbing 
a billion-dollar loss, but avoiding the meltdown that is now in full fury. He 
believes Orange County is headed for 10, 20 years of misery. "I'm not 
gloating," he said, "I've got kids to put through school, too." 
</P>
<P>
 All last week he stayed at his office late into the night, restudying the 
portfolio, preparing a salvation strategy should the county ever solicit his 
help. Journalists called constantly from around the world, wanting to know why 
his warnings had not been heeded. He did not seem to have a good answer. Here 
is one he might consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach's political passage drives straight to the heart of what's wrong with 
modern campaigning. Symbolism and sound bites beat substance every time. A 
campaign built on themes of competence, or policy, or anything at all 
complicated is a campaign born dead. Better to give 'em school prayer or 
abortion or tough talk about hoodlums. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at it this way. If Moorlach had revealed that Citron employed illegal 
immigrants, or chased skirts in the '60s, he might have won. Instead, all he 
brought to the dance was a bleak, complicated -- and absolutely accurate -- 
forecast of a coming fiscal crisis, and who has time for that kind of garbage?

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; TOUGH TEST AWAITS SUPERVISOR-ELECT; TRANSITION: 
AFTER 28 YEARS AS A TEACHER, JIM SILVA WILL HELP CHART COUNTY'S RECOVERY PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day after Orange County officials announced the dramatic news that a 
high-risk investment strategy lost the county $1.5 billion, Jim Silva's 
economics class at Los Amigos High School in Fountain Valley wanted to know 
why. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, a fiscal conservative who for 28 years has taught high school economics 
and civics, illustrated the danger of leveraging by explaining how people can 
mortgage their homes to the hilt only to have real estate values decline, 
leaving them with a huge debt and no equity. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva will soon be helping to chart the county's financial recovery, after he 
resigns his teaching job this month to become one of two new members sworn in 
Jan 2. as Orange County supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at his Huntington Harbour home Saturday, Silva said he is 
bitter and angry that the system allowed one person -- former county Treasurer 
-- Tax Collector Robert L. Citron -- to make risky investments with taxpayers' 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at how California laws have allowed this to take place, you 
have to question the system," said Silva, 50. "I was surprised there was not 
someone watching over the man." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said that until the revelation of Orange County's financial woes, 
followed by Citron's resignation and the county's bankruptcy filing, he had 
been looking for staff members with expertise in public health issues, which 
seemed to be one of the biggest challenges the county faces. 
</P>
<P>
 But his plans changed abruptly, he said, when he received a call from County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider "explaining there would be a press 
release . . . that would indicate that there would be a financial crisis. I 
could tell from the tone of his voice he was very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Silva said, he has been waiting for more information that will 
tell him exactly how deep the financial predicament will be when he takes 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Silva is not yet sworn in, he said, he has not been allowed into the 
mostly closed sessions where supervisors have been huddling with the county's 
financial officers and consultants. He said he was pleased that his soon-to-be 
colleagues had sought help by hiring financial adviser Thomas Hayes, a former 
state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said that although he is as confused as anyone about the state of the 
county's financial affairs, he has strong opinions about Citron, whom Silva 
said he has long disliked and distrusted. 
</P>
<P>
 The other incoming supervisor, state Sen. Marian Bergeson, had withdrawn her 
endorsement of Republican accountant John M.W. Moorlach, who unsuccessfully ran 
against Citron and attacked the incumbent's investment policies. At the time, 
Bergeson said, she was worried that Moorlach's attacks would hurt the county's 
standing on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, a Republican and a six-year Huntington Beach city councilman, said he 
cast his ballot for Moorlach in part because he did not like what he knew about 
Citron's investment strategies, which for years had brought in high yields. 
</P>
<P>
 "People had made comments to me over the past few years that Bob Citron was an 
expert at leveraging money and I, being fiscally conservative, don't follow 
that philosophy at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he also found Citron offensive. "Mr. Citron had a very arrogant 
attitude," Silva said. "I never really had a lot of confidence in that man." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva traced his feelings about the former treasurer to an experience he had 
with Citron's office regarding his family's 1992 property tax bill. Silva, then 
mayor of Huntington Beach, said he paid the bill that December but kept 
receiving billing notices from the treasurer, even though he sent back letters 
with copies of the canceled check. He said he also made at least 15 calls to 
Citron, none of which were returned. 
</P>
<P>
 When Silva confronted Citron at a social gathering, he said Citron blamed the 
faulty billings "on a computer problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, Silva said, he believes the state Legislature over the years 
passed laws granting Citron too much autonomy in making decisions about the 
massive pool of investment funds belonging to the county, as well as to cities, 
school districts, water districts and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financial decisions on large amounts of money should be made by a committee 
of experts and not by one person in elective office," Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would go further to say the office of treasurer should not be elected, but 
should be appointed by the chief administrative officer of the county and 
approved by the Board of Supervisors." He said that after the dust settles, he 
intends to seek assistance from the county counsel in deciding how to make the 
treasurer an appointed official accountable to the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoons after his classes end, Silva said, he is interviewing 
candidates to serve on his staff. The first position, he said, will be filled 
by someone well versed in strategic budget planning, in the realization that 
when all the data is in, Orange County will have to learn -- at least for the 
near future -- to make do with less. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't print more money and we can't borrow," he said, "and I don't think 
it is fair to go to the taxpayers and ask them to bail us out of a problem that 
was created by state government and government bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
 In the belt-tightening, he said, some government programs are bound to suffer. 
"I think the No. 1 obligation of local government is public safety and 
education," he said. "Beyond that there will be some hard decisions."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; STATE OFFICIALS TAKE WAIT-AND-SEE STANCE; CAPITOL: 
RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS HAS LACKED ANY SENSE OF URGENCY SO FAR. BUT SOME 
LEGISLATORS ARE CALLING FOR TIGHTER RESTRICTIONS ON INVESTMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While Orange County officials are trying to extricate themselves from the 
worst local government financial mess in U.S. history, the response up to now 
from the state Capitol has been extremely subdued, almost silent. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being used to dealing with earthquakes, fires, floods and riots, 
lawmakers and state public officials were not prepared to cope with a different 
sort of crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a few Democrats have compared Sacramento's initial response to Orange 
County to President Gerald Ford's refusal in the 1970s to bail out a nearly 
bankrupt New York City. Ford's reaction was immortalized in the now famous 
headline: "Ford to New York: Drop Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 These critics cite Gov. Pete Wilson's reluctance to intervene, the absence of 
leadership by most other statewide elected officials and caution among many 
lawmakers preoccupied by a pitched battle over the Assembly speakership. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little outward sense of urgency. In their own defense, many elected 
officials say that this is a complicated crisis with national implications that 
cannot easily be solved by dispatching firetrucks or National Guard troops. 
</P>
<P>
 But as lawmakers sought to understand the multibillion-dollar disaster, there 
were stirrings of activity under the Capitol dome. Assembly Democrats were 
calling for a special legislative session, a few lawmakers were introducing 
legislation to prohibit the risky investment practices that led to the crisis, 
and a bipartisan committee was being formed by Senate President Pro Tem Bill 
Lockyer to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hayward Democrat said: "Unlike Gov. Wilson, we're not ready to say drop 
dead to Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, newly elected state Treasurer Matt Fong issued a brief statement 
of concern after he took off on a scheduled vacation. Lt. Gov.-elect Gray 
Davis, usually ready to comment on state fiscal issues in his current role as 
state controller, was in New Orleans attending a conference of lieutenant 
governors. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Capitol observers say the sluggishness in grappling with Orange 
County's problems is a product of post-election weariness. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a lot of exhausted candidates," said one Senate staffer, who had 
been meeting on the issue behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many politicians -- including the governor -- talked about the need to 
scrutinize Orange County's fiscal difficulties before moving ahead with 
corrective legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected officials also called for an examination of the investment practices 
of other local governments in the state. "Nobody knows yet how widespread this 
is," said state Controller-elect Kathleen Connell. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Orange County filed for bankruptcy protection after it failed to 
meet the obligations of its $20-billion government investment pool. The failure 
was the result of complicated financial transactions designed to increase the 
return on idle funds held on behalf of the county, school districts and other 
local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of financial experts -- including state Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- 
blame the crisis on the county's elected treasurer-tax collector, Robert L. 
Citron, who resigned his post amid the financial chaos. In a piece written for 
The Times, Brown said she first sensed the problem two years ago when she 
learned that Citron was taking high risks with his investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Brown offered advice on how to prevent other counties from sliding 
down the same path, she was not serving up any solutions for Orange County's 
immediate need to produce cash for schools and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is absolutely no statutory ability for the treasurer of the state of 
California to step in, in any way, shape or form," said Brown spokesman Michael 
Reese. "That has left her feeling very frustrated, but with the ability to 
simply monitor the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Wilson, who defeated Brown last month, offered little comfort to 
beleaguered county officials. "The state is eager to be helpful," he said. "But 
we are not in a position where we can bail out bad judgments." 
</P>
<P>
 Criticized for his seeming callousness to the problems of a county that 
provided him with strong support in his bid for reelection, Wilson questioned 
whether the state even had the legal ability to intervene or the financial 
resources to do so because of its own serious budget woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I said was . . . a statement of fact in terms of existing legal 
authority. And I think it is not sensitive to hold out false expectations," 
Wilson said late last week. "And if we can help in a way that does not expose 
the state as a whole, we are obviously here to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 His most visible act was to dispatch former state Treasurer Thomas Hayes, now 
managing director of a Los Angeles brokerage firm, to help unravel the county's 
difficulties and formulate a plan to restore the county to fiscal health. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he (Hayes) works out his plan, we'll determine what the state can do 
within our own constraints," said Wilson spokesman Sean Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of elected officials, Democrat and Republican, support Wilson's 
restrained approach to the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fiscal hemorrhaging has a potentially major impact on public 
education, which relies heavily on state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming state schools chief Delaine Eastin, who takes office Jan. 2, said she 
wants to make sure that state education money is channeled to potentially 
hard-hit districts for education and not siphoned off to pay the county's debt. 
She points out that if the schools run short, the state could be forced to come 
to their rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a big believer in the free market, but the free market is never free when 
the rest of the state is on the hook for someone's screw-up," said Eastin, a 
former Democratic assemblywoman from Fremont. "Short term, the state has to 
help make sure that kids get an education." 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin is one of many public officials who say that in the future the state 
needs to prevent risky investments made with the public's cash. 
</P>
<P>
 However, since 1987 the Legislature has approved at least five bills that 
broadened the authority to put local tax money into ever more exotic financial 
instruments to increase earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect the failure in Orange County ought to require a complete 
review of practices and the level of oversight for public funds," said Sen. 
Patrick Johnston of Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 By week's end, Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said he plans to introduce a 
package of bills that would establish a strict investment policy for local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden would ban gifts and contributions from brokerage and bond firms to 
local officials who make investment decisions, set up local oversight boards to 
review investment decisions and require disclosure of investments on a prompt 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Also under consideration by Hayden is a ban on the leveraging of investments 
to purchase other investments, a practice he called "the death knell of the 
Orange County investment fund." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer sketched the outline of a plan for what the state might do to cope 
with the biggest municipal bankruptcy in U.S. history. He said he is forming a 
special committee to assess the extent of the problem, consider new laws to 
safeguard future investments and determine whether there are any hardships, 
especially affecting pensioners, that need to be handled. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockyer might be upstaged by Assembly Democratic Leader Willie Brown of 
San Francisco. Brown, battling to retain the speakership he has held for a 
record 14 years, said he is seriously considering calling a special session of 
the Assembly for Dec. 20. As the senior member of the lower house, Brown is the 
presiding officer and, he says, has the authority to bring his members back to 
the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Nov. 8 election, Democrats captured 39 seats while Republicans won 41. 
However, last Monday one Republican bolted to Brown's side, deadlocking the 
Assembly 40-40. When the chief clerk fell ill, Brown took the gavel to preside. 
Republicans refused to gather in the chamber, fearing that Brown would 
disqualify one of their members who was simultaneously elected to the Assembly 
and Senate in a special election. Without a quorum, the Assembly on Friday 
adjourned until Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown contended that a special session on the Orange County default is 
needed. "Believe me, whether we get a quorum or not we can discuss this matter 
and show interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Capitol, other politicians say that Brown is seeking to use the 
financial quagmire to mask his real intent in calling a special session. His 
underlying objective, they say, is to pressure lawmakers to resolve the 
speakership impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 Said one veteran senator: "We think that they are hoping a special session 
will force them to organize." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Brown denied having a hidden agenda in considering a special session. 
"My focus is not the speakership," Brown said. "The speakership will take care 
of itself on Jan. 4."

'INSULT TO ISLAM' TRIAL DELAYED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bangladesh on Saturday began the trial of self-exiled feminist writer Taslima 
Nasrin, but court proceedings were postponed after her attorneys signaled an 
appeal against trying her in absentia. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Sara Hossain said the defense will file its appeal next week 
challenging a ruling to try Nasrin in her absence on charges of insulting Islam 
and hurting the religious sentiments of Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 The court was surrounded by police on guard against possible trouble from 
fanatical Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasrin has been living in Sweden since she fled Bangladesh on Aug. 10, a week 
after Bangladesh's High Court granted her bail on charges lodged by police that 
she had insulted Muslim religious feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges stem from an interview with India's Statesman newspaper in which 
she was quoted as saying Islam's holy book, the Koran, should be "revised 
thoroughly."

NOTEBOOK; PACT MAY BE INITIALED, BUT ITS ACRONYM NEEDS WORK

 Say it loud or say it soft, it's never going to roll off anyone's tongue: 
FTAA, pronounced "ftaah." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the acronym for the name U.S. and other negotiators came up with for 
the trading zone they plan to build among the nations of the Western 
Hemisphere: the Free Trade Area of the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, officials had expected the new pact to be dubbed the Americas Free 
Trade Area, which produces a more mellifluous AFTA. That would even rhyme -- or 
harmonize, as trade negotiators would put it -- with NAFTA, the existing North 
American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But it turns out Asia got there first, with a proposal for an Asia Free Trade 
Area. And South American officials warned that afta is Spanish for a nasty cold 
sore suffered by livestock -- an inauspicious connotation for an agreement that 
covers agriculture. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Several foreign leaders took advantage of their visit to Miami to meet with 
constituents in the city's burgeoning Latino and Caribbean communities. Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide addressed a large, happy rally in the Little 
Haiti neighborhood. Argentina's Carlos Menem tried to attend an Argentine 
American reception but was talked out of it by U.S. Secret Service agents who 
had not had a chance to check the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Prize for the most energetic visitor, however, went to Costa Rican President 
Jose Maria Figueres, 39, who took a morning off to go scuba diving off Key 
Biscayne. Figueres solemnly assured reporters that his expedition counted as 
work, because Costa Rica is trying to attract underwater tourists. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Big meetings always snarl traffic. This mammoth meeting should have brought 
Miami to a standstill. But most residents appeared to have taken their mayor's 
advice and stayed home: The only real traffic jams have occurred among the 
summit participants themselves, when all 34 presidents and prime ministers 
tried to leave a meeting at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 White House planners neatly solved that problem Saturday afternoon by 
chartering two tour boats that carried 14 leaders and their delegations up 
Biscayne Bay to their hotels -- thus reducing the number of speeding limousines 
on Interstate 95 by about one-third.

BOMBING RAID RATCHETS UP CHECHEN FIGHT; RUSSIA: MOSCOW SEALS OFF REBELLIOUS 
REGION, GROZNY BRACES FOR WAR, BUT TALKS ARE SCHEDULED. 
</P>

<P>
 Russia sealed off the rebellious Muslim region of Chechnya on Saturday and 
staged a bombing raid near its capital, Grozny, in a new escalation of the 
festering conflict that many warn could turn into another Afghanistan for the 
Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin, who was laid-up in the hospital after a minor 
operation on his nose, had effectively instructed his government Friday to 
proceed without him in "using all means at the state's disposal" to subdue the 
defiant Chechens. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever means Moscow uses, whether further negotiations or a full-out attack 
by the Russian troops massed at Chechnya's borders, that will not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chechens who populate the mountainous region of southern Russia are known 
as a tough, warlike people with a penchant for organized crime, and they have 
reportedly been reinforced by Moslem brethren from Afghanistan and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid to confess that the situation has already gotten beyond my 
control," Dzhokar Dudayev, the moustachioed Chechen president, told Saturday's 
Izvestia newspaper. "In every village, in every district, Islamic batallions 
have been formed. . . When our general staff gives them orders, they reply, 'We 
are God's fighters, not yours.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Grozny were said to be bracing for war, beefing up their civil 
defenses and gathering volunteers for grassroots militias. Reuters news agency 
reporters saw Russian warplanes bomb military targets near Grozny, and more 
raids were expected. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russian analysts predicted that Yeltsin, aware that anti-war sentiment 
dominates both in Parliament and among the public at large, would not launch an 
all-out invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the Izvestia newspaper said, he is likely to perform a "balancing act 
on the edge of war" by asserting Russian control without undertaking operations 
that would lead to mass casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between Moscow, Grozny and the Kremlin-backed opposition to Dudayev were 
scheduled to resume Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not clear whether Dudayev would consent to talk with his Chechen 
enemies. But the Russian deputy head of the peace talks commission, Vyacheslav 
Mikhailov, said Grozny officials had "reiterated in phone conversations their 
intention to use this last chance to achieve a peaceful solution of the 
crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 The sealing of the Chechen borders aimed to block the continuing flow of arms 
and Afghan mujaheddin fighters into the mainly Muslim republic of about 1 
million people. The Russian government also ordered the Defense Ministry to 
close off Chechnya's airspace. 
</P>
<P>
 But along with waving sticks, the Kremlin was offering carrots to Chechnya. 
The government issued a decree mandating radical -- though unspecified -- 
measures to restore parts of the North Caucasus economy damaged in the 
conflict.

EU PLANS TO ADMIT EX-SOVIET BLOC NATIONS; DIPLOMACY: ENVOYS FROM SIX LIKELY NEW 
MEMBERS ATTEND SUMMIT. BUT ACCORD IS FAULTED FOR LACKING A TIMETABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Leaders of the 12-nation European Union formalized plans Saturday that would 
open membership to countries of the former Communist East Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 Although EU members were criticized for the absence of any precise timetable, 
adopting the plan constitutes an important step in extending the push for an 
economically and politically unified Europe beyond the Continent's old Cold War 
divide for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was a historic occasion for the European Union and for Europe as a 
whole," declared German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who hosted the summit. "Who 
could have conceived of such a meeting five years ago? This will help us build 
a Europe that is peaceful and prosperous. We have departed from the past." 
</P>
<P>
 As a gesture to symbolize the EU's commitment, Kohl invited the leaders of six 
Central and East European nations being considered for membership to 
participate in the meeting's final session. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the image of the leaders of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, 
Slovakia, Bulgaria and Romania sitting at an EU summit, Executive Commission 
President Jacques Delors said: "There is no longer a distinction between East 
and West. We share traditions, culture." 
</P>
<P>
 However, even for the most advanced of the six, membership may be several 
years away, according to EU officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the plan, the EU will set out a package of laws and 
regulations that candidate countries must enact to achieve compatibility with 
the group's internal market. At the same time, the EU has pledged to support 
this restructuring with a $6.6-billion aid fund and to liberalize access to its 
markets for the candidate countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Saturday's step, the most economically advanced of the Eastern 
countries -- Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- have complained about 
the EU's vague references to membership "around the end of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Czech Republic will reach the point of compatibility soon, several years 
before the end of the century," Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 The EU leaders also agreed Saturday to negotiate so-called association 
agreements covering economic, trade and political ties with the three Baltic 
states and Slovenia within the next six months. Such accords, considered a 
prerequisite for nations seeking eventual membership, have already been 
concluded by the six non-EU nations invited to the Essen summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Now considered irreversible, the expansion eastward is certain to transform 
the nature of the EU. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected to add to the dominance of Germany, which in the years since 
the fall of the Berlin Wall has become the largest trading partner of most 
candidate countries. France is likely to be further marginalized politically 
and economically by the move. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to balance the eastward focus, French President Francois 
Mitterrand, with Italian and Spanish backing, won a commitment for a 
$3.3-billion aid fund for the Mediterranean region. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Essen meeting was billed as the Eastern Europe summit, the leaders 
spent much of their time on the crisis in Bosnia, finally agreeing on a 
declaration that underscored Europe's commitment to a negotiated settlement and 
expressed support for the U.N. Protection Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "UNPROFOR should continue its crucial mission. . .," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders seemed to be placing their hopes on peaceful ways of pressuring 
the Bosnian Serbs, calling for tighter control of Serbia's embargo against its 
Bosnian cousins. The declaration made no references to the possible use of 
allied air power to push the Bosnian Serbs toward peace.

THE FOILED PEACE EFFORTS

<P>
 Diplomats from around the world have tried in different ways to bring peace to 
the war-torn Balkans, and especially Bosnia-Herzegovina. Here's a look at some 
of these attempts: 
</P>
<P>
 Vance Plan 
</P>
<P>
 * Drafted in late 1991 while the Serb-Croat war was raging, the proposal of 
then-U.N. mediator Cyrus R. Vance called for the deployment of 14,000 
peacekeepers to areas of Croatia occupied by the Yugoslav army. Federal troops 
were to withdraw to rump Yugoslavia, local gunmen were to be disarmed, and an 
international peace conference was to be convened to negotiate a political 
settlement. U.N. deployment occurred in spring, 1992; some Yugoslav army troops 
moved on to Bosnia-Herzegovina. Others, native to occupied territory, now 
referred to as the four U.N. Protected Areas, switched uniforms and deemed 
themselves the army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina, their rogue state. No 
international peace conference was ever convened because of the war's flare-up 
in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Vance-Owen Plan 
</P>
<P>
 * Late in 1992, after Bosnian Serbs had rebelled against the country's 
proclaimed independence for eight months, Vance and Lord Owen, the European 
Community mediator, crafted a plan for settling the war in Bosnia by dividing 
the territory into 10 ethnically defined provinces; three each were to be ruled 
by Serbian, Croatian and Muslim governments, Sarajevo to be jointly 
administered. The plan sacrificed Bosnia's multiculturalism and integration but 
preserved the fiction of a single federal entity within prewar Bosnian borders. 
The Muslim-led government accepted the plan reluctantly, but Bosnian Serbs 
rejected it each of four times it was presented as the international 
community's last offer for a peaceful settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Lift and Strike 
</P>
<P>
 * Discussed during 1992 U.S. presidential campaign, lifting of the arms 
embargo hampering Bosnian government defenses and launching North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization air strikes to neutralize the Serbs' heavy weapons were 
threatened as an alternative to the Vance-Owen plan if Serbian rebels refused a 
negotiated settlement. But European allies resisted this, fearing it would put 
Bosnian-based peacekeepers at risk of retaliation or hostage-taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington Action Plan 
</P>
<P>
 * On May 22, 1993, a week after the Bosnian Serbs had given final rejection of 
Vance-Owen in a referendum, Secretary of State Warren Christopher met with 
counterparts from Britain, France, Russia and Spain to urge another round of 
negotiations to settle conflict without resorting to use of force. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen-Stoltenberg Plan 
</P>
<P>
 * With Vance retired from mediation after failure of his original plan to win 
combatants' backing or enforcement by the international community, former 
Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg took over the U.N. mediator 
role. He worked with Owen in revising the Vance-Owen plan to address Serbs' 
demands for contiguous territory. A final map emerged in the autumn, proposing 
to divide the republic into three autonomous regions, each with right to 
eventually annex to a neighboring country. This clearly applied only to Bosnian 
Serb and Bosnian Croat segments. Sarajevo was to be under U.N. administration, 
Mostar governed by the European Community. The government refused for months to 
endorse what it considered ethnic partitioning. U.S. diplomats privately 
assured Sarajevo they were not forcing them to sign. The government capitulated 
only after mediators promised massive NATO troop deployment to enforce the deal 
envisioning the return of refugees to many areas from which they had been 
expelled in "ethnic cleansing." Serbs, who had tentatively endorsed the plan, 
began demanding "quality" as well as "quantity" in territory, insisting on 
better shares of utilities, industrial centers and access to the Adriatic Sea. 
Their final rejection came at an EC foreign ministers meeting Dec. 23, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Contact Group 
</P>
<P>
 * After a diplomatic impasse following failure of Owen-Stoltenberg and 
ultimatums by NATO prohibiting heavy weapons around Sarajevo and Gorazde, the 
international community formed another mediation team. Mediators from the 
United States, Britain, France, Russia and Germany used the Owen-Stoltenberg 
map as a starting point, but reconciliation of Muslims and Croats eased 
partitioning by reducing the factions from three to two. Contact Group ended up 
proposing a roughly even split of Bosnia between Serbian rebels and new 
federation of Muslims, Croats and non-nationalist Serbs. Federation was to 
control 51% of Bosnian territory and rebels 49%. But only the federation had 
"confederation rights" to join in economic and political alliances with 
neighboring countries. Federation also was to retain Bosnia's U.N. seat and 
other international memberships. The government reluctantly agreed to the split 
in a parliamentary vote in July. Serbs again rejected it in their parliament 
and in a late August referendum.

SERBS PREVENT BIHAC VISIT BY U.N. OFFICIAL; BALKANS: MISSION COMMANDER HOPED TO 
BOOST MORALE OF TRAPPED PEACEKEEPERS. HE TERMS INCIDENT 'A HUMILIATION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bosnian Serb rebels were joined by their Croatian Serb allies Saturday in 
provoking the U.N. Protection Force by blocking the U.N. commander for 
Bosnia-Herzegovina from making a morale-boosting visit to trapped peacekeepers 
in the Bihac enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose sat fuming for five hours at the front-line 
barricade near Sisak, 20 miles southeast of here, waiting for the Serbian 
rebels to let his five-vehicle entourage through. 
</P>
<P>
 Well after night fell at the makeshift "border" between Croatian-held 
territory and the rogue Republic of Serbian Krajina, Rose and his party turned 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid it has been a snub for the people of this country and for the 
people on whose behalf we are working for peace," an angry Rose told reporters 
upon his return to U.N. headquarters in Zagreb. "It's been a humiliation for 
the civilian authorities, who gave us clearances to go through and were clearly 
overrun by their military structure." 
</P>
<P>
 The embarrassing standoff with the Serbian rebels who occupy the Krajina 
region of Croatia was just the latest in a monthlong series of harassments 
heaped on the U.N. mission as its leaders struggle to decide whether or how 
they should retreat from Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this incident shows that both the Croatian Serbs and the Bosnian 
Serbs will give all (U.N. Protection Force) personnel, even a general, a very 
rough time whenever they want to cross their territory," said U.N. mission 
spokesman Paul Risley. 
</P>
<P>
 Risley also cast doubt on claims by Bosnian Serbs that they had released the 
last 187 U.N. soldiers taken hostage by the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leaders in their mountain stronghold of Pale, just east of 
Sarajevo, announced that they had freed all U.N. captives held at weapons 
collection sites around the Bosnian capital. But Risley pointed out that the 
Serbs had demanded that other U.N. troops be sent in place of those released, 
making the situation more of a hostage exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels continue to deny fuel deliveries to U.N. compounds throughout 
Bosnia. That has forced the mission to cease patrolling U.N.-designated "safe 
areas" and the weapons exclusion zones around Sarajevo and Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuel is so scarce in Gorazde that the 400 troops in that enclave now must turn 
off their sole emergency generator between midnight and noon, the local U.N. 
commander informed headquarters Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials in Sarajevo have no fuel for their cars and are expected to run 
out of diesel power for their generators within a few days, Sarajevo spokesman 
Lt. Col. Jan-Dirk von Merveldt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch troops in the isolated Srebrenica enclave were informed by the Bosnian 
Serb gunmen surrounding them that they are unlikely to get more fuel unless 
they prove they used their last delivery for patrolling the safe area. The 
local Serbian liaison intimated that his commanders "up the chain" do not want 
the troops storing any for emergencies, according to the daily mission field 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a day earlier, U.N. officials had sought to portray a turnaround in the 
Serbs' attitude toward their mission, suggesting that the threat of a pullout 
and massive infusion of U.S. and other NATO troops had cowed the rebels into 
submission. 
</P>
<P>
 The first humanitarian aid convoy in more than two months was allowed to reach 
the Bihac region's 200,000 starving residents Friday, and Bosnian Serbs had 
hinted that they might be willing to resume negotiations on an international 
peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But a vow by Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. special envoy for the Balkans, to carry 
on despite the harassment -- and similar statements issued by European Union 
leaders meeting in Essen, Germany -- appeared to postpone any immediate moves 
toward a U.N. withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably feeling less pressure for compliance, the nationalist rebels in both 
Bosnia and Croatia resumed their practice of thwarting the peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose has repeatedly sought to tour the Bihac safe area, where Croatian Serb 
rebels have backed an artillery assault by Bosnian Serbs that has trapped 1,200 
poorly equipped Bangladeshi peacekeepers. The Bihac pocket is surrounded by 
Serbian-held territory, making it impossible for outsiders to visit without 
rebel approval.

BOSNIAN WIDOWS MEET THE POPE

 War widows from Bosnia-Herzegovina, rosary beads twisted around their fingers, 
wept Saturday at an emotional meeting with Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 ethnic Croat Roman Catholics -- widows and mothers mourning children 
killed in the Bosnian conflict -- crowded into the choir seats of the basilica 
in this town on the Adriatic coast to hear the Pope and to tell him about their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many of us have lost our brothers and fathers, we have the need to be with 
our one, common father," said Luca Marjanovic. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjanovic, 63, said her husband and only son were rounded up and killed by 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Croats and Muslims in Bosnia began the war as allies against the Serbs in 
April, 1992, before turning their guns on each other. They are now united 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in Croatian, the pontiff told the women: "I will continue to pray for 
you, for your suffering, your families and your country."

 Two Cubans were found dead in the Panama Canal following riots in Cuban 
refugee camps this week, a U.S. military official said. The official could not 
say how the two died, but Panamanian police said on television that they had 
drowned. About 1,000 Cubans escaped after rioting Wednesday and Thursday in two 
camps; all but 31 returned voluntarily or were apprehended.

 A magnitude 6.3 earthquake rocked Mexico City, causing people to flee their 
homes in fear. There were no immediate reports of injuries or severe damage. 
The U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, 
Colo., said the quake's epicenter was in Petatlan in the southwestern state of 
Guerrero.

2 CREWMEN FROM SUNKEN SHIP, 7 BODIES RECOVERED

<P>
 A second crewman was rescued and at least seven bodies were recovered Saturday 
as a desperate race against the elements continued for survivors of a sunken 
Ukrainian cargo ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 31 crew members aboard the Salvador Allende, which sank Friday, 
had been spotted in lifeboats, life rafts or survival suits, but rough seas 
hampered rescues. 
</P>
<P>
 Six merchant vessels were at or near the scene of the sinking, about 150 miles 
northeast of Bermuda and 1,200 miles east of New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 At least seven bodies were recovered by Saturday night, according to the U.S. 
Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the survivors, Alexander Paranov, had spent more than 24 hours in the 
water wearing only a light jacket and a life vest. 
</P>
<P>
 A New York Air National Guard helicopter rescued him after spotting the 
Ukrainian sailor some 70 miles from where rescuers thought he would be. He 
arrived in Halifax Saturday night and was reported to be in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely amazed. I'm flabbergasted," said the helicopter's pilot, Lt. 
Col. Ed Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was waving the whole time, he was getting thrown around by the sea," said 
Sgt. Jim Dougerty, who jumped into the water to save Paranov. "He said he was 
never cold. His biggest complaint was the saltwater was burning his eyes and he 
couldn't see." 
</P>
<P>
 Another crewman was picked up by the tanker Torungen late Friday and was in 
good health. His name wasn't immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 The 450-foot ship was heading to Helsinki, Finland, from Texas with a cargo of 
rice when it sank early Friday in heavy seas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Coast Guard said the seas had subsided to about 12 feet by Saturday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The warm Gulf Stream also aided the survivors. When the ship went down, 
surrounding waters were about 67 degrees.

RUNWAY DISASTERS: SEARING REMINDERS THAT INACTION KILLS

 David Richman had much to look forward to that Friday afternoon in February, 
1991. He was 34. He and his wife had a 16-month-old daughter. They had another 
child on the way. And after graduating from Harvard University, he had recently 
landed a job as a math professor at the University of South Carolina, where he 
had distinguished himself as the "conscience" of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 But then USAir Flight 1493 slammed into a commuter plane as the jetliner 
attempted to land at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In a horrifying blur of screeching metal and burning jet fuel, Richman and 
many of the other 33 passengers who would die that day were still alive when 
the jetliner crashed into a building before coming to rest on the tarmac. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation later showed that many of the passengers had died from 
inhaling smoke while trying to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years earlier, the National Transportation Safety Board had asked the 
Federal Aviation Administration to consider drafting regulations to improve 
access to aircraft emergency exits. The FAA issued the regulations -- but two 
months after the Los Angeles accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Government documents also show that the FAA had been warned as far back as the 
early 1980s that the possibility of runway collisions was a growing hazard. The 
Los Angeles crash was the third such fatal accident in the United States in 13 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the crash, Richman's father, Alex, saw television clips of the 
crash coverage but didn't know his son was on board. The family got the call 
that Sunday at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrible shock," Alex Richman said. 
</P>
<P>
 David's wife "was hoping that there was a mistake. She was holding out hope 
until the bodies were identified," said David's mother, Shifra Richman. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Alex Richman: "We knew in our heads that he was dead, but we were hoping 
in our hearts that like in television and the movies that he had just wandered 
away from the crash." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is tombstone technology," said Alex Richman, a college professor and 
psychiatrist in Nova Scotia. "It requires a tombstone for the required 
technology to be used. . . . The world airlines and the FAA are not using the 
technology we now have." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Eastern Airlines flight from New York to Atlanta was about to land Jan. 
18, 1990, when Fred Land looked out the window to the darkened landing strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the plane made a sharp turn to the left, startling passengers. Then, 
Land felt a bump and watched as the right wing of the jet clipped a smaller 
plane on the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The jet's right wing sheared off the top of the small plane, killing the pilot 
and injuring a passenger. No one aboard Land's flight was seriously injured.

<P>
 Land's business partner turned to him and said: "What do you think happened?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I said: 'I think we ran over a plane,' " Land recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he struggled with his emotions in the weeks following the crash. "This 
had a sobering impact on me. It was like cheating death. For some reason you 
are spared." 
</P>
<P>
 Land said the fact that the collision could have occurred in the first place 
made him angry. "I find it remarkable that this could have happened. There are 
just way too many lives at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 When he heard about the Los Angeles crash 13 months later, he remembered 
thinking: "It happened again. Why, Lord, didn't someone fix the problem?" 
</P>

 It was foggy in Detroit on the afternoon of Dec. 3, 1990, when Milio Rinna 
climbed aboard a Northwest Airlines flight to Pittsburgh, Pa., where he was to 
attend a United Steelworkers union meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was half full, and Rinna's seat was next to the noisy DC-9 engine. 
He considered moving to a better seat across the aisle but decided to stay put 
and read the afternoon newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinna said he was "surprised" when the plane started moving. "It was foggy out 
there, but I figured they knew what they were doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, a huge explosion rocked the other side of the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were screaming and there was smoke and flames everywhere," he said. 
"You are just shocked because you are just reading the newspaper and all of a 
sudden there is an explosion. Your heart starts pumping. You wonder what in the 
hell is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before escaping from the plane, Rinna noticed the lifeless bodies of two 
men slumped between their seats and the aisle. "There was nothing I could do 
for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see someone die, it's something you never forget," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve people died in the runway collision -- the second in a series of three 
such crashes in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I heard" about the crash, he said, "the worse it got. How could we 
have had a collision? 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the heck were the safety coordinators and supervisors that are supposed 
to be looking out for this kind of thing? 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to develop safety programs before accidents occur."

AUTO WORKER HELD AFTER BOSS IS KILLED, COLLEAGUE WOUNDED

<P>
 An auto worker accused of killing his supervisor and wounding a co-worker at a 
Chrysler Corp. plant was ordered held without bail Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Woods, 48, of Sterling Heights will be arraigned Monday on charges of 
murder, attempted murder and using a firearm in a felony, Police Chief Thomas 
Derocha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods has refused to make any statements, Derocha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Following an argument Friday over a work assignment at Chrysler's Sterling 
Stamping Plant, Woods took a .38-caliber revolver out of a duffel bag, shot the 
two men and walked away, Derocha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Woods at the plant shortly after the shooting, Derocha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a 20-year employee at the plant just north of Detroit, was arrested 
last year on an assault charge. The charge was dropped after the man he 
allegedly attacked with a knife didn't show up for a preliminary hearing, 
Derocha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Ruffin, 54, died at a hospital soon after the shooting. Eddie Williams, 
65, was in stable condition Saturday.

PASSENGERS FROZEN OUT WITH ATRS GROUNDED; AIRLINES: TURBOPROPS ARE IDLED BY FAA 
ORDER, SNARLING FLIGHT SCHEDULES AS CHRISTMAS TRAVEL SEASON STARTS. AMERICAN 
EAGLE COMMUTERS ARE HARDEST HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Until last week they were the workhorses of Midwestern commuter commerce, but 
now they are lined two abreast against the piercing winter wind on the O'Hare 
International Airport tarmac, as useless and immobilized as dinosaur skeletons. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing idle amid runway ice patches caused by a weekend cold snap are nearly 
all of the American Eagle commuter fleet of 53 European-built ATR turboprop 
planes, grounded by Friday's government order banning their use when icy 
weather is present or forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration order, which came in the wake of an 
October ATR-72 crash in Indiana that killed all 68 people aboard, has snarled 
the nation's air travel system at the most inconvenient possible time -- the 
start of the Christmas travel season. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, thousands of passengers heading through airports in the Midwest 
and East scrambled to find alternative flights or other forms of transportation 
to take the place of flights by ATR-72 and ATR-42 aircraft. Despite swiftly 
hatched plans to shift many of the airline industry's 156 ATR planes to 
airports in the South, up to 15% of the seats on regional air carriers may be 
jeopardized for another month, airline officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's turning the apple cart upside down," said Mary Frances Fagan, a 
spokeswoman for American Eagle, American Airlines' commuter subsidiary, which 
runs a third of the nation's ATR aircraft and was hardest hit by the 
groundings. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle announced Saturday that all its ATR aircraft at O'Hare would 
remain idle at least until Thursday while smaller, Swedish-built turboprops are 
transferred north to take their place. Similar plans were made by Continental 
Express airline to send its 30 ATR planes based in Newark, N.J., to airports in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle officials also said Saturday that jet routes would start today 
between O'Hare and larger airports in Milwaukee, Indianapolis and Grand Rapids, 
Mich., but that those hubs will now have fewer daily flights than they had 
before the FAA order. 
</P>
<P>
 The rows of ATR aircraft on the Chicago tarmac and continuing cancellations 
(on Saturday, all of American Eagle's 298 ATR flights to and from O'Hare were 
canceled) testified to the chaos that the FAA order is bringing to holiday 
travelers and to business commuters who once used the ATR planes as casually as 
commuter trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Staring at the motionless planes from a window at O'Hare's deserted American 
Eagle terminal, stranded passenger Jay Bick, 24, decided that even a long night 
alone in the airport was worth his safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I lose a few hours of sleep," he said as he slumped into a seat, gazed up 
at a Chicago Bulls basketball game on television and hiked the volume on the 
Vince Gill tape in his Walkman. "If this saves people's lives, I'm all for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lines were long at American Eagle gates after the order was issued Friday, but 
by Saturday the shutdown had left the long terminal almost deserted. Most 
passengers were sorting out their travel plans by telephone, Fagan said. A 
computer line to assist them during the coming week would be operational by 
this afternoon, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Many American Eagle passengers were being routed on other carriers. The 
airline is also renting cars for passengers and, for a few, buying bus tickets, 
Fagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those caught between cities at night were forced to make quick decisions -- 
whether to rush off on a dizzying round of connecting flights on tiny commuter 
planes, grab a rental car or bus ticket, or simply hole up in a hotel until 
more flights were available. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning from a business trip in Thunder Bay, Canada, Dan Rowley, 23, and 
John Perry, 40, stood dazed at an American Eagle gate, trying to make up their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw all the ATRs sitting there as our plane was taxiing in, but I didn't 
realize one of them was mine," Rowley said. "I knew about the crash and all, 
but I wasn't worried about flying in (the ATR planes). I figured lightning 
doesn't strike twice, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 The two Indianapolis printers returning from a sales trip decided to stay in a 
hotel overnight at the airline's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess (the FAA decision) was the right thing to do," Perry said. "I just 
wish they'd pick another time. I mean, Christmas is coming up." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA ordered that the ATR aircraft must remain grounded when temperatures 
are below 40 and moisture is visible in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came in response to federal tests conducted on the planes in the wake 
of the Oct. 31 crash of an ATR-72 turboprop into a farm field near Roselawn, 
Ind. Tests found that ice on the wings has the potential to cause severe 
rolling similar to the midair catastrophe that sent Flight 4184 plunging to the 
ground as it approached a landing at O'Hare six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle on Saturday began acting on plans to fly its O'Hare fleet of 
ATR planes to Dallas and other Southern hubs and replace them with 
weather-ready Saab 340 turboprops. At some larger airfields, such as 
Milwaukee's General Mitchell International Airport, the ATR aircraft will be 
replaced by Boeing 727 jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the new planes arriving, some routes are likely to be scratched. At 
Milwaukee, only four outbound 727 flights will replace the 11 daily ATR routes 
that funneled flights into O'Hare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely cuts down on people's choices," said Mike Piontek, a 
control-center staffer at Milwaukee's airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The northward moves of the Saab 340 aircraft will have an opposite -- but 
equally confusing -- impact. The Saabs seat only 36 passengers and will have to 
fly two routes to ferry nearly the same number of passengers as an ATR-72. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly the route system is going to take a lot of reworking," said American 
Eagle spokesman Bill Elliot. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots also expect to feel the brunt of the shifts. Some trained to fly on ATR 
aircraft expect to have to relocate to the South. Several pilots have refused 
to fly ATR planes in cold weather since the Indiana crash. 
</P>
<P>
 One American Eagle pilot trudging into the Chicago terminal said he "agreed 
with the ATR decision" but added that after flying the planes for nine years, 
"I've never had a problem with them -- icy weather or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Bick, settling in for the night, said that if there had been no FAA 
grounding order he would have taken the plane without a second thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I told my friends at work I was taking an ATR they said: 'We'll see you 
next week -- we hope.' Looks like they were right, but not the way they 
thought."

MOUNTAIN LION SUSPECTED OF KILLING WOMAN IN PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities suspect that a mountain lion killed a woman whose body was found 
Saturday by two hikers at Cuyamaca Rancho State Park in eastern San Diego 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman's body was badly mauled and scratched and showed no gunshot or other 
wounds, according to Greg Picard, superintendent of the 26,000-acre park in the 
Cleveland National Forest, about 50 miles east of downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 If medical authorities determine that the woman was killed by a mountain lion, 
it would be only the second confirmed case in California of a person being 
killed by one of the big cats. The first was a 40-year-old woman killed in 
April in El Dorado County in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been several cases recently where mountain lions have chased or 
menaced visitors at Cuyamaca Rancho State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Trackers have killed five mountain lions in or near the park in the past 15 
months after declaring them a threat. In the most serious incident, two rangers 
chased a mountain lion deep into the woods in September, 1993, and shot it to 
death just moments after it had bitten a 10-year-old girl and attacked her dog. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 11 a.m. Saturday, two hikers saw blood on a trail in the Paso Picacho 
portion of the park and then discovered the body about 50 feet off the trail. A 
backpack was also found. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, popular year-round with campers, hikers and picnickers, was 
immediately evacuated and will remain closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The county medical examiner was called to determine the cause of the death of 
the woman, described only as middle-aged.

IT'S RUSH NIGHT FOR GOP'S LAWMAKERS-IN-WAITING; REPUBLICANS: CONGRESS' INCOMING 
CONSERVATIVES ENJOY RED MEAT, APPLE PIE AT ORIENTATION DINNER. BUT MAIN COURSE 
AT LOVE FEAST IS TALK SHOW HOST LIMBAUGH. 
</P>

<P>
 The orientation for incoming freshman Republican members of the 104th Congress 
culminated Saturday night with an oratorical dance by the man they said helped 
get them to Washington: conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 In a remarkable display of appreciation and loyalty, they first made him an 
honorary member of the House of Representatives and declared themselves part of 
the "Limbaugh Congress," saying he had given the Republicans "the courage to 
take back our country." He responded by suggesting that after they change the 
country, they might want to "leave some liberals alive." 
</P>
<P>
 "So you will never forget what these people were like . . . keep one Marxist 
and two liberals on the staff of every university so you can show your children 
. . . living fossils. Living fossils." 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh also had a message for the press: "This country is conservative and 
it always has been. Get used to it. You tried to change it and you failed, and 
tonight proves it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dining on red meat and apple pie in the luxury box section of Camden Yards, 
the freshmen came as much to honor Limbaugh as to listen to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Chrysler, elected from Michigan, presented him with a congressional 
freshman pin and declared him on behalf of the class an honorary member of the 
House. He called Limbaugh "the majority maker, for surely he helped make us the 
majority." 
</P>
<P>
 In his introduction of Limbaugh, Vin Weber, co-chairman of the conservative 
think tank Empower America, said: "Rush Limbaugh is really as responsible for 
what has happened as any individual in America. Talk radio, with you in the 
lead, is what turned the tide" in last month's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh appears on 659 radio and 225 television stations, and "in any 15 
minutes, more women listen to him in California alone than the entire 
membership of the National Organization for Women," Weber added. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh in turn downplayed his role, saying: "What happens in talk radio is 
we validate what is in people's heads already. . . . You are the ones who 
engaged the opposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh said he had been asked by the press before dinner whether he thought 
combative Georgian Newt Gingrich would moderate his stance as the next Speaker 
of the House. "Better not," Limbaugh said to cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh's speech concluded three days of sessions that were called an 
orientation but amounted more to a grounding in conservative ideology. Among 
the seminars was one on "conservative governance." A session on "Real Welfare 
Reform" featured Charles Murray, co-author of the "The Bell Curve," a 
controversial book which argues that African Americans are genetically less 
intelligent than members of other races. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the 12 new Democrats in the next Congress had registered for 
orientation, which traditionally had been at Harvard's Kennedy School of 
Government. But they did not to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Limbaugh advised the congressional newcomers to resist the temptation to 
moderate their views to please the Establishment, including the media, in 
Washington. "We all want to be liked, we all want to be loved, and we want to 
avoid hostile environments. Inside the Beltway for people like us, that is not 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The incoming lawmakers and roughly 150 staff members and spouses delighted in 
his passion, which, as Weber put it, had given them "all the courage to take 
back our country."

 Quentin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction," the controversial and violent 
action-thriller set in the Los Angeles underworld, was voted best picture of 
1994 on Saturday by the Los Angeles Film Critics Assn.

Roger Avery. John Travolta won as best actor for his role as a dimwitted, 
heroin-addicted henchman. 
</P>
<P>

Broadway." The award for best supporting actor went to Martin Landau for his 
portrayal of "Dracula" actor Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's "Ed Wood." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's box office hit "The Lion King" was crowned best in animation, and 
best foreign film honors went to Krzysztof Kieslowski's "Red." The award for 
best documentary went to "Hoop Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 John Dahl, who has directed the acclaimed film noir thrillers "Red Rock West" 
and "The Last Seduction," was the recipient of the new generation award. 
</P>
<P>
 The Douglas Edwards Independent/Experimental Award went to British director 
John Maybury ) for "Remembrance of Things Fast," his experimental film about 
sex, disease and the media.

Wilder ("Sunset Boulevard," "The Apartment"), and Pauline Kael received a 
special award for her film criticism.

DEPUTY SHOT IN HEAD DURING TRAFFIC STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 29-year-old Walnut station sheriff's deputy was shot in the head Saturday 
while making a traffic stop in Rowland Heights, a sheriff's spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy, whose name was not released, was shot just before 6 p.m. in the 
18400 block of La Guardia Street, said Deputy Angie McLaughlin. She declined to 
release other details of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neighbors in the area say they heard three gunshots and saw a vehicle 
speeding away from the scene," McLaughlin said, "They called Walnut station 
when they saw a deputy was wounded." 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy was taken to Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina, where as 
of late Saturday night he was in extremely critical condition, McLaughlin said.

DANA PARSONS: ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; THE KIND OF ANGER THAT COULD SPARK A 
REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS, Dana Parsons is a columnist for The Times in Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not to alarm the Board of Supervisors, but the French Revolution started when 
the government ran out of money. The working class, tired of being trampled by 
the ruling nobility, stormed the Bastille and set off the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Is the Hall of Administration sufficiently fortified to ward off 
such an onslaught? 
</P>
<P>
 The board may not fully realize how under siege it is, or is about to become. 
The disintegration of the county's investment pool is still a work in progress, 
and the public mood is only likely to darken toward the supervisors as they 
continue dispensing the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether more heads will be guillotined than just former Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron's remains to be seen, but if it could be done 
quickly, the guess here is that much of the public would line up the entire 
board at the base of the scaffold. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't take my word for it. Pick from any of a number of ticked-off 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County may well be the home of the angry taxpayer movement. Whether 
it's a group opposing a utility tax in Fullerton or pension-spiking in 
Huntington Beach, there's one on every corner, just like fast-food restaurants. 
Most of them have formed around disenchantment with their city governments, but 
the county's bond market fiasco feeds nicely into their scorn of how some 
public officials conduct business. 
</P>
<P>
 So much so that about 85 representatives from various groups met Wednesday. 
Before the meeting ended, one of the leaders, representing a group called the 
45th Revolutionist Chapter of United We Stand, wanted to seek out the 
supervisors and demand their resignations, according to Bill Mello, who 
represents another group from Huntington Beach called the Citizens Bureau of 
Investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the 85 were ready to follow through, Mello said, but the group decided 
to wait until a later date. "These people have passion in their eyes," Mello 
said. "You wouldn't believe how upset they are with government." 
</P>
<P>
 The groups' common thread is what they believe to be the overpaid status of 
city employees, but the bond market situation has temporarily diverted their 
attention to the supervisors. Mello, for example, favors recalling the entire 
Board of Supervisors. "We elected them to do a job and to watch our money and 
make sure it was spent properly. They didn't do that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello predicted that there will be a formal request by at least some of the 
citizen groups' representatives that the supervisors resign. At the very least, 
he said, the groups want to "just make life miserable" for the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Clark represents the Orange Taxpayers Assn. and says she's a little more 
patient than some of her peers. Yet, she says, the overall level of anger is 
not to be dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were angry before, and now they're twice as angry," she said. "I think 
frustration builds on frustration, and you don't know where it's going to 
erupt." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Mello advises patience with regard to the county's bond market 
situation. But that won't give the supervisors much relief because he agrees 
with their call for calm while still favoring their ousters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Board of Supervisors were asleep at the switch," he said. "That's where 
the buck stops. You can't blame it all on Citron." 
</P>
<P>
 Mello chuckled at my reference to the French Revolution. Actually, his 
favorite revolution was the American. He and like-minded compatriots in the 
other groups like it so much that they call their networking Committees of 
Correspondence, after the name given to the colonists' method of spreading the 
word against King George. 
</P>
<P>
 History has a habit of repeating itself, so I asked Mello if he wants another 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, we don't want to have a revolution," he said. "We have a good 
Constitution, we just have to get elected officials who follow it, who respect 
and treat citizens fairly, and who don't lie when they make campaign promises. 
We just need to recall a few of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, the local investment pool disaster has fueled groups like 
Mello's. Convinced that government has too much of their money in the first 
place, they're now in a position to argue that the bureaucrats don't know what 
to do with it when they get it. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, the supervisors may be hard-pressed to rebut that 
argument. Until they can explain all this, they may want to keep an eye peeled 
for crowds of angry citizens milling around Civic Center Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be time to man the battle stations. Sometimes these revolutionaries 
aren't happy till they have your head.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; HOW THE CRISIS UNFOLDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 THURSDAY, DEC. 1 
</P>
<P>
 * Rumors that Orange County has cash-flow problems jolt Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * After the market closes, local officials say the county's investment 
portfolio has lost nearly $1.5 billion of its value this year. FRIDAY, DEC. 2 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors, elected officials and federal regulators try to evaluate the loss 
from the county portfolio, which holds money from 185 municipalities, school 
districts and other government entities. 
</P>
<P>
 * County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron comes under increasing 
scrutiny for borrowing billions of dollars to gamble on risky investments 
called derivatives. He bet that interest rates would go down, but they went up 
instead. The amount owed on the loans increased while the value of the 
investments fell, resulting in the $1.5-billion paper loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two major credit-rating agencies say they may lower the rating for Orange 
County bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two legislators call for Citron's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Securities and Exchange Commission launches an inquiry into the matter. 
SATURDAY, DEC. 3 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials say three school districts and the County Department of 
Education borrowed a total of $200 million to invest through the treasurer's 
office. Later, officials of another school district, Placentia-Yorba Linda 
Unified, said they had also borrowed and invested about $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * As the county tries to reassure its investors, two of the largest ones -- 
the city of Newport Beach and the Irvine Ranch Water District -- say they may 
demand their money. SUNDAY, DEC. 4 
</P>
<P>
 * County supervisors hold emergency briefing sessions and set a meeting for 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Critics weigh a recall campaign against Citron, the county's only elected 
Democrat. MONDAY, DEC. 5 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials disclose that Citron resigned Sunday from the treasurer's post he 
had held for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Investors who try to sell Orange County bonds find few buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Moody's Investors Services says it may lower the county's credit rating, 
which would raise the cost of borrowing for local agencies. TUESDAY, DEC. 6 
</P>
<P>
 * With investors clamoring for their money, Orange County files for bankruptcy 
protection, freezing the assets of the investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 * The five school agencies that collectively borrowed hundreds of millions of 
dollars to invest in the pool say they face a severe cash crunch. WEDNESDAY, 
DEC. 7 
</P>
<P>
 * Municipal bond prices plunge on Wall Street and a major credit-rating agency 
lowers Orange County's grade to junk-bond level. 
</P>
<P>
 * Residents flood county offices to learn if they must still pay their taxes. 
THURSDAY, DEC. 8 
</P>
<P>
 * An internal audit shows that the county auditor warned officials more than a 
year ago that the investment pool was not adequately supervised. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wall Street brokerages dump nearly $9 billion in collateral put up by the 
county to back its loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county authorizes its attorneys to file suit against the brokerages, 
saying their action violates the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. FRIDAY, DEC. 9 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials disclose that investment firms have sold $11.4 billion in 
bonds they held as collateral on loans to the county, leaving its investment 
pool with a residue of shaky holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Citron, who has remained largely in seclusion since resigning Sunday, hires 
Costa Mesa attorney David Weichert. The district attorney's office says it will 
expand its inquiry into allegations that Citron might have accepted improper 
gifts from financial investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county files a lawsuit against Nomura Securities Co., a brokerage that 
sold $900 million worth of the county's bond holdings during the week. 
Officials promise further action against other Wall Street firms. SATURDAY, 
DEC. 10 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials suggest that a shortened workweek and layoffs of county 
employees are possible because of the crisis, and say they intend to halt all 
but the most essential spending. Supervisors indicate they are likely to 
postpone the purchase of a $94-million police communications system and the 
widening of the Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials seek bailout help from several banks. TODAY 
</P>
<P>
 * Montebello City Council, concerned about $47-million stake in the Orange 
County investment fund, meets in special session to consider hiring a 
bankruptcy attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orange County supervisors scheduled to meet, though they likely will 
postpone the session. MONDAY 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond markets to reopen after weekend break. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deadline for county residents to file property taxes.

ANTI-RACIST GROUP FIGHTS FLYER WITH FLYER; BIGOTRY: ACTIVISTS, RESIDENTS 
ANGERED BY HATE MAIL COME TOGETHER TO DISTRIBUTE A LEAFLET OF THEIR OWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before this day, they had been strangers, two women a generation apart from 
different corners of the San Fernando Valley. But on Saturday they came 
together to help fight what both consider to be an ugly precedent in their 
community: the circulation of racist flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining some two dozen other area residents, church group members and incensed 
social activists, Margarete Allen and Tasha Phillips went door to door in a 
three-block area of this racially mixed neighborhood to circulate their own 
anti-racist flyer and speak their mind about people who advocate hate and 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 For Allen, a Lake View Terrace resident, it was a day to try to take back her 
neighborhood, where anti-Latino flyers had been scattered just weeks ago at the 
height of the Proposition 187 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips, a church group member from North Hollywood, just wanted to speak out 
about a topic that, frankly, makes her blood boil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want to make a statement," Phillips, a 26-year-old apartment-complex 
worker, told one homeowner whom she approached in his front yard. "For me, it's 
important to take a stand and say that this kind of bigotry is just not cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting the women's flyer, the man paused and responded: "You're right. It's 
not cool." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The door-to-door canvassing came weeks after an unknown number of racist 
flyers were left in the mailboxes of homes in Burbank, Lake View Terrace and 
Santa Clarita. Organizers included the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council, 
the Valley branch of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, 
Hermandad Mexicana Nacional and the Burbank Human Relations Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 One offending flyer -- which attacked both blacks and Latinos, advocating a 
tougher immigration policy along U. S. borders -- was also left in students' 
lockers in Burbank and Santa Clarita high schools, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hate it would take for someone to first draw something like this and then 
put it in someone else's mailbox is incredible," said Dudley Chatman, executive 
vice president of the Valley Interfaith Council. "I have seen this type of hate 
before and it needs to be answered with an equally strong showing of love and 
unity." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting at the Lake View Terrace Community Center, the activists said the 
flyers indicated that racial hatred would not ease even after the passage of 
Proposition 187, which severely limits the social services available to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hate is out there," said organizer Rhetta Alexander. "These things are 
just a terrible reminder of the racism that still exists here. We just want to 
let people know that this kind of thinking does not represent this community. 
It has to be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, a white construction inspector for the city of Los Angeles who said she 
is married to a black man with whom she has two sons, received one of the 
flyers in her mailbox several weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just so upsetting, the hatred it showed," the middle-aged Allen said. 
"I didn't even show it to my two sons. I didn't want to hurt them." 
</P>
<P>
 But she did show it to several fellow church members, who helped organize 
Saturday's effort, in part, because they believed that leaving such flyers in 
mailboxes was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Splitting up into teams of two, the activists fanned out over the 
neighborhood. But for Allen and Phillips, spreading the message of hope got off 
to a shaky start. 
</P>
<P>
 They knocked on nearly a half-dozen doors before finding someone home: a man 
with a beer in his hand who said he didn't even live in the house. He took the 
flyer anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman accepted the flyer and brusquely ushered the women from her yard. 
</P>
<P>
 At another door, an elderly woman in curlers listened to Allen's pitch, 
seemingly anxious to close her door. Suddenly, her husband appeared and said 
that so much of this kind of hatred has circulated over the years in Los 
Angeles that he just tries to ignore it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, you just let go," the elderly woman said before closing the door. 
</P>
<P>
 At still another house, a man challenged the pair by saying that even 
circulating such well-meaning flyers was giving validity to those disseminating 
the hate mail. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group pressed on, vowing to continue their efforts next weekend in 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 By afternoon's end, both Allen and Phillips saw in one another a potential new 
friend. And both said they wouldn't let a few rude reactions dampen their 
spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised at some of the responses," Allen said. "People think you 
want to sell them something. Or convert them." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Phillips: "It's a touchy subject. I just don't think people are 
comfortable even talking about prejudice."

SMART MONEY; EX-ACADEMIC DECATHLON CHAMPS CASHING IN ON PRACTICE EXAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC GUZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While most college-bound high school grads would be content to pick up a few 
extra tuition dollars by working as office clerks or store cashiers, two former 
Taft High School Academic Decathlon champions have parlayed their renowned high 
school experience into cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Berdichevsky and Andrew Salter, wunderkinder of academia, have ventured 
from the esoteric domain of the ivory tower into the nuts-and-bolts world of 
business with their own start-up company that sells practice exams to decathlon 
teams around the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The enterprise, named DemiDec -- an abbreviation of academic decathlon -- has 
garnered the two 18-year-olds $20,000 since August. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our coach at Taft was always preaching theories of economic freedom to us," 
said Berdichevsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken it from theory into reality," added Salter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Academic Decathlon is a national high school competition that tests 
students in subjects including math, science and fine arts. Speech, interview 
and essay contests round out the competition along with the Super Quiz, a 
raucous, open-to-the-public exam in which decathletes are queried on current 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, John Marshall High School in Los Feliz won the city championship 
over the popular Taft and is headed for the state finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdichevsky and Salter have a sterling reputation in decathlon circles. Both 
of them were members of the Taft High team that shattered city and state 
decathlon records on its way to the 1993 national championship. Berdichevsky 
was the highest individual scorer at the city, state and national competitions, 
followed closely each time by Salter. 
</P>
<P>
 When Berdichevsky and Salter are together, they bounce around the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we talk decath, we get kind of . . . ," begins Berdichevsky 
</P>
<P>
 "Hyper?" suggests Salter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hyper," Berdichevsky agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 And now that Berdichevsky and Salter are freshman at two of the most 
prestigious universities in the nation -- Harvard and Stanford, respectively -- 
they have transformed their decathlon title into a calling card for their 
fledgling business. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last June the two champions found themselves short of pocket change after each 
being fined $27 for jaywalking across Winnetka Avenue to get to a bagel shop 
near Taft. In the midst of courthouse grumbling about the fines, they came up 
with the DemiDec idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Excited about their new endeavor, they decided to seek the approval of their 
coach, Taft instructor Arthur Berchin. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction when I found out they were doing this was, 'You're going to 
be selling this to all of my competitors and make things tougher for me,' " 
said Berchin. "But there was nothing I could do to stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with laptop computers, the two spent all summer sequestered in local 
libraries. The result was a thick stack of tests, study notes and a copy of the 
pair's award-winning decathlon speeches. Touting the kit as a "Passport to 
Chicago," site of the 1995 decathlon championships, they have sold about 200 of 
the $189 packages to schools across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Start-up costs were minimal. After all, they didn't pay themselves wages, and 
it costs only about $14 to print each 700-page package. 
</P>
<P>
 They mailed out query letters urging decathlon coaches to buy DemiDec to help 
their students "focus on victory," with insider hints from two former national 
champs. 
</P>
<P>
 Practice tests are a common part of training for decathletes, and a small 
number of companies, most founded by former coaches and testing professionals, 
have specialized in selling them to schools. Academic Decathlon officials do 
not endorse any particular company, instead offering their own set of study 
materials, said Judy Combs of the California Academic Decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 One sample of a DemiDec impromptu speech topic asks: "Has George Bush's 
professed dislike for broccoli done harm to the public opinion of the 
vegetable?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We had fun with those," said Berdichevsky. 
</P>
<P>
 A question for the Super Quiz that probably wasn't as much fun: 
</P>
<P>
 Genetic engineering consists of carrying the gene of interest into the target 
cell by first incorporating it into a: a) restriction endonuclease; b) 
enzyme-substrate complex; c) bacterium; d) plasmid; e) methylase. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: d) plasmid. 
</P>
<P>
 Berdichevsky and Salter's popularity persuaded many coaches who had met them 
at national and state competitions to buy the package sight unseen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were happy to see them and their entrepreneurial spirit," said George 
Floratos, who has led Torrance's West High to five consecutive county 
championships. "We purchased it primarily to help them out. We knew that to 
produce these tests was a monumental task." 
</P>
<P>
 But first-year jitters have led to accuracy problems in the tests, according 
to many of the coaches who bought the DemiDec packages. 
</P>
<P>
 In an early snafu, Salter and Berdichevsky had to mail out revised answer keys 
to their science test because none of the correct answers matched the 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found several errors, but we find errors in all testing materials," 
Floratos said. "But I'm sure their product will get better as they age and have 
more time to commit." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, were not so generous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought their tests because they were very personable and they had the aura 
of Taft's victory, but our team members were really thoroughly disgusted," said 
Chatsworth coach Nina Hackett, whose students sold candy to be able to afford 
the tests. "There were so many mistakes. After a while we found we just 
couldn't use them." 
</P>
<P>
 Salter, who had been unaware of the criticism, said it will be "extremely 
important to us to remedy those mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Berdichevsky said he and Salter plan to spend next summer creating new tests, 
taking extra time to ensure that there are no further problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In the competitive decathlon testing business, where only a handful of 
companies compete for scarce school district funds, a reputation for sloppiness 
could hurt the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, orders keep trickling in at the rate of about five a week, said 
Berdichevsky. Typical freshmen, the two are unsure of their plans. Salter can't 
decide whether to major in business or economics. Berdichevsky said he wants to 
be a writer, but frets because he, too, has not selected a major. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends from the decathlon team are calling me a dilettante because I refuse 
to focus on one thing," Berdichevsky said. "But I have to pick a major next 
month. The pressure is mounting."

CONSERVANCY BUYS WILSON CANYON FOR $3.9 MILLION; ENVIRONMENT: THE PURCHASE 
SECURES 246 ACRES ABOVE SYLMAR AS PARKLAND, ENDING FOUR YEARS OF TALKS. AREA IS 
CRITICAL TO PLANNED TRAIL SYSTEM. 
</P>

<P>
 Capping four years of negotiations, the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has 
signed an agreement to purchase 246 mountainous acres above Sylmar as parkland, 
officials announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy has agreed to pay $3.9 million to a developer and several 
private owners for Wilson Canyon, a rugged area of finger-like canyons and 
year-round streams north of Olive View Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The land is considered a critical part of the proposed Rim of the Valley trail 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase, to be funded by Proposition A park funds approved by the voters 
in 1992, will be the agency's first in the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Saturday to announce the agreement, an ebullient 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) told a crowd of horseback riders, hang 
gliders, Girl Scouts and anti-graffiti activists that the success of the 
four-year battle showed "there is open space in the northeast Valley that is 
worth purchasing as much as in the Santa Monica Mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz has been pushing for purchase of the land since community groups launched 
a protest seven years ago against a proposal by the developer Cantwell-Anderson 
to build 500 houses on the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The final agreement gives the owners $1.5 million less than the appraised 
value of $5.4 million, said Tim Cantwell, principal of Cantwell-Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cantwell said the decision of his firm and the other owners to take the 
loss was motivated by the current real estate market and a "clear understanding 
of what the community wants." 
</P>
<P>
 After gauging the community opposition, Cantwell said, he decided "that the 
best solution was to put this into public open space." 
</P>
<P>
 Cantwell said the owners had initially reached an agreement to sell to the 
Trust for Public Land for $6.6 million, but that fell through because no funds 
were available. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors revived the deal last April, 
approving the use of Proposition A funds for the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 A tentative agreement was reached in February, Cantwell said. Negotiations 
then dragged on as the parties worked out complicated details of rights of way 
for the maintenance of county debris basins on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Summing up the grueling negotiations, Katz said he got involved when his wife 
came home from a horseback ride fretting over the threat of development in the 
canyon, which connects the urban San Fernando Valley with Angeles National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a case of saving open space and saving my marriage," joked Katz, whose 
wife, Gini Barrett, is president of the Los Angeles City Animal Regulation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal then took so long, the once-slender lawmaker said, that his "Save 
Wilson Canyon" T-shirt -- altered with a marker pen Saturday to say "Saved" -- 
isn't as loose as it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale represents the end of a far longer saga for 11 Lockheed engineers who 
bought 145 acres of the land in the 1960s and were foiled in numerous attempts 
over the years to divest it. 
</P>
<P>
 William Lawry, secretary-treasurer of the group called Trela Land and Farming, 
said the buyers initially hoped to turn it over quickly to the Lutheran Church, 
which was shopping for a college campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the buyers, Lawry said, someone donated land to the church 
for the campus in Moorpark. Hopes to turn the land into a cemetery or landfill 
also never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he said, five of the original owners have died. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawry said he was not very sympathetic to the development opponents but 
eventually adopted a philosophical view. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of selling out just to leave something to his children, he said, he is 
setting aside parkland for his grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

MAHONY STRESSES BROTHERHOOD IN TALK TO VALLEY JEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, speaking at a Sabbath service in the 
San Fernando Valley's largest synagogue, praised the establishment of 
diplomatic relations this year between Israel and the Vatican, saying Jews and 
Catholics can now truly call each other brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are no longer strangers to one another, but you are our elder brothers and 
sisters," Mahony said Friday night to 1,200 members of Valley Beth Shalom and 
guests, including Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who read a portion of 
Scripture in the service. 
</P>
<P>
 "No longer does the lack of full diplomatic relations between the Holy See and 
the state of Israel divert us from other important areas of dialogue," said 
Mahony, who has led the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Harold Schulweis of the host synagogue said that Jews take heart from 
Pope John Paul II's formal remembrances of the Holocaust and his declared 
intention, despite poor health, to travel eventually to the Holy Land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pray for the health of the Pope, who enters the annals of Jewish history 
as a man of compassion, conscience, vision and reconciliation," said Schulweis, 
responding to Mahony before the Conservative Jewish congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The visit by Mahony, which was not his first to a Los Angeles synagogue 
worship service, focused on the steadily improving relations between Jews and 
Catholics since the Second Vatican Council (1962-65) and recent Popes' 
repudiation of anti-Semitism and recognition of Judaism as a vibrant faith in 
its own right, not merely a precursor to Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as the cardinal noted, given the painful history of Christian persecution 
of Jews in centuries past and controversies surrounding the Catholic church's 
actions during the Nazi-era Holocaust, "it is no wonder that many American Jews 
viewed with suspicion the Holy See's seeming reluctance" to recognize the state 
of Israel by establishing diplomatic ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, however, Israel and the Vatican announced their intention to 
exchange ambassadors, which they did several months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony emphasized in his Friday night talk that the primary obstacle to 
recognizing Israel was not religious or theological, but a practical matter of 
protecting the rights and safety of Arab Catholics living in and near Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up to now, the issue of full diplomatic relations . . . has been seen by many 
American Jews as solely a matter of the Catholic Church accepting Judaism and 
the Jewish people as a continuing valid response to God's covenant made with 
them through Abraham," the cardinal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, in fact, it has been the precarious plight of Palestinian Catholics both 
within and outside Israel which has preoccupied the pastoral concern of the 
Vatican," Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that many Arab Christians on the West Bank were being pressured from 
one side by Arab Muslims to support certain political positions and from the 
Israeli side to accept school and university closings and a bleak economic 
outlook under Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) signaled the 
start of peace negotiations last year "did it become 'safe,' as it were, for 
the Holy See to move closer to full diplomatic ties," Mahony said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sticking point in relations between Catholics and Jews in the past was 
the longtime insistence by the Vatican that Jerusalem become an "international 
city" rather than fall under the government of Israel alone. Mahony said the 
Vatican has quietly abandoned that notion "and sought rather 'international 
guarantees' to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Told of Mahony's comments that the Vatican had been worried about Catholics in 
Israel, Moshe Benzioni, Israeli deputy consul general in Los Angeles, said he 
was surprised by the cardinal's emphasis on those points in his speech. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Benzioni added, "Relations with the Vatican are good; there are 
really not outstanding issues anymore. We are quite flattered that the cardinal 
sought to address a Jewish audience on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Royale Vadakin of Los Angeles, a local pioneer in Catholic-Jewish 
relations, said the Vatican's non-recognition of Israel was always raised at 
otherwise cordial interfaith dialogues in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "By his presence (at Valley Beth Shalom), Cardinal Mahony signals locally that 
this is now a resolved issue," Vadakin said.

BUILDING EVACUATED, SUSPECT HELD; CRIME: APARTMENTS ARE EMPTIED, BUT ARMED MAN 
ALLEGEDLY HOLDING SON HOSTAGE IS ARRESTED WHEN LATER FOUND DRIVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Police surrounded and evacuated an apartment building Saturday in response to 
reports of an armed and distraught man holding his 11-year-old son hostage -- 
only to find him driving around the Valley with the child and weapons in his 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Akiro John, 34, was arrested and charged with assault with a deadly 
weapon, a felony, for an alleged earlier attack on his estranged wife's 
friends. He was being held at the North Hollywood police station in lieu of 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 John's son, from a previous relationship, was unhurt and was placed in 
protective custody, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama began shortly after 11 a.m. in the 5800 block of Whitsett Avenue, 
when friends of John's wife, Heidi -- who left him on Thanksgiving -- arrived 
to retrieve her belongings, said Lt. Nick Zingo of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's North Hollywood Division. 
</P>
<P>
 They told police they were greeted by a despondent John, who allegedly wore 
several handguns in his waistband, held another gun at his side and ordered 
them to enter the apartment with their hands up, Zingo said. The child was also 
in the apartment, Zingo said. 
</P>
<P>
 John spoke of suicide, the family friends told police. "He said he had only 24 
hours to live and that if anyone tried to stop him, he'd take them with him," 
Zingo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friends were allowed to collect Heidi John's belongings and leave the 
apartment; they then phoned for help, Zingo said.  
</P>
<P>
 By the time police arrived at about 12:15 p.m. and dispatched about 20 
officers and members of the Strategic Weapons and Tactics team throughout the 
neighborhood, it was unclear whether John was still in the apartment. 
Nonetheless, police ordered all occupants of the 22-unit apartment building 
evacuated, and cordoned off surrounding streets. 
</P>
<P>
 John and the child were stopped hours later in his pickup truck near the 
corner of Bellaire Avenue and Hatteras street. Zingo said John had four 
.45-caliber handguns and a rifle with him.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside the apartment, police found a 12-inch serrated hunting knife, a hunting 
bow with arrows, a Japanese ceremonial sword, two additional handguns and more 
than 2,000 rounds of ammunition, Zingo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zingo said that when John was questioned by police, he was "confused, going in 
and out of reality."

CREATURES GREAT, SMALL GET PORTRAIT WITH SANTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GLIONNA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget about the kids. Santa had his hands full Saturday as more than 40 pets 
and their owners lined up to have pictures taken with the red-suited gift-giver 
at a Santa Clarita pet store -- all to benefit an animal assistance 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene at Dan's Pet Supply was like a zoo as pet owners paraded in such 
animals as Twiggy the Iguana, a spider monkey, and a tailless rat its owner had 
dressed up in bat wings. There was a snake, a cockatoo and numerous cats and 
dogs -- including a Rottweiler that store owner Dan Jones said "must have been 
the size of a Shetland pony." 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa wasn't too happy about that one," he said. "Gosh, that was a big 
animal." 
</P>
<P>
 For a $5 fee that was donated to Pet Assistance, a local group that helps find 
homes for lost pets, owners got a Polaroid snapshot of their pet sitting on 
Santa's lap. This event followed a parade of animals around the store on 
Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the animals behaved themselves during this holiday benefit, Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of cats jumped over Santa's shoulder and onto a nearby Christmas 
tree," he said. "Owners were coaxing their pets to look toward the camera. It's 
amazing and funny how animals understand and respond. Some were afraid, of 
course, but most seemed like they were really into it." 
</P>
<P>
 About $200 was raised for the cause. "Most of the day, the owners were lined 
up 10 deep," Jones said. "Our Santa was busier than the one at the mall, easy." 
</P>
<P>
 But lest Santa think he was going to escape unscathed, one shaking little 
Chihuahua lost control of himself and left his calling card on Santa's lap. But 
there was little delay in the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa said he often gets a warm feeling from his work," Jones said, "but not 
that warm." JOHN GLIONNA

MIKE PENNER: MATER DEI WRECKS POLL, AMAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How will this Bishop Amat High School football team be remembered, now that 
James Free's desperation downfield lob to Daylon McCutcheon was high enough but 
not nearly long enough, nestling instead in the arms of Mater Dei safety Pete 
Campbell 27 seconds before the final gun? 
</P>
<P>
 How does "No. 1 In The Nation, No. 3 In Orange County" sound? 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in four seasons, Mater Dei has turned USA Today's national 
high school football rankings into a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Eisenhower and the Battle of Little Big A in the winter of '91? Ike 
was undefeated, No. 1 from coast to coast, on top of the prep world in the eyes 
of our favorite color-coded airline read -- and Mater Dei upsets the mighty 
Eagles, 35-14, in the Division I final at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, it was deja vu all over again. Redundancy at its finest, at 
least in the view of the screaming red boosters in the eastside Anaheim Stadium 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei scored the first touchdown of the game, took a 21-10 lead into the 
dressing room at halftime, increased that advantage to 28-10 in the third 
quarter and was still sitting on that 18-point lead with 10 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat's one-man offense, Young McCutcheon, made it interesting with a 
37-yard run for a touchdown and a 55-yard reception to set up a field goal, but 
the Monarchs staved off one final assault with Campbell's interception at the 
Mater Dei five, and that made it official. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 28, Bishop Amat 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if you prefer: Mater Dei 2, Top-Rated Team In The Land 0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was getting tired of playing all these No. 1 teams," Monarch Coach Bruce 
Rollinson quipped, "but we decided to build on that. We figured if we did it 
once, we could do it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Saturday's final, the top of the USA Today rankings looked like this: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Bishop Amat (13-0). 
</P>
<P>
 2. Miami Southridge (13-0). 
</P>
<P>
 3. Westlake Austin, Tex. (14-0) 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei was also 13-0, but it was slotted all the way down at No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Los Alamitos, whose 47-game unbeaten streak through the Division I 
quarterfinals broke a national record? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Los Al played a sensational game last Friday at Anaheim Stadium, pushed 
Mater Dei to the brink of oblivion, led by 10 points with 4 1/2 minutes left . 
. . but, crucially, failed to master the science of the onside kick. Mater Dei 
squeaked by at the gun, 28-24, and the Griffins, thus toppled off their perch, 
were dropped entirely from the USA Today top 25. 
</P>
<P>
 By the evidence displayed on this field the past eight days, both Mater Dei 
and Los Alamitos were superior teams to Bishop Amat. Better balanced, for sure. 
Passing attacks? Don't get us started. Both Mater Dei's John Flynn and Los Al's 
Kevin Feterik passed for more than 2,500 yards and 25 touchdowns in 1994. 
Bishop Amat's Free, in contrast, took season totals of 924 yards and eight 
scoring passes into the Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was Amat doing at No. 1? 
</P>
<P>
 What did the Lancers have that Mater Dei -- or Los Al, for that matter -- did 
not? 
</P>
<P>
 And who's to say a 13-0 team from south Florida is any better than a 13-0 team 
from Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
 County bankruptcy proceedings aren't supposed to be taken into account when 
these polls are compiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that old standby -- scores vs. comparable opponents -- didn't seem to 
favor Amat over Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 Amat beat Redlands, 43-20; Mater Dei beat Redlands, 53-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Amat beat Loyola, 20-7; Mater Dei beat Loyola, 31-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Both schools also dumped Trabuco Hills -- Amat by 27 points, Mater Dei by 13 
-- but Mater Dei also went undefeated against Orange County powers Los Alamitos 
and Esperanza and routed Division V finalist Servite, 55-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Where was the Lancers' edge? 
</P>
<P>
 Amat had one immensely hyped (although deservedly so) tailback in McCutcheon 
-- a 2,300-yard rusher with USC, Colorado, Nebraska, Michigan and Washington 
chasing him -- and a flock of Division I prospects, or so the college scouts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the college scouts speak, national prep pollsters listen, because 
what else do they have to go on? Very few key intersectionals get played on 
this level. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Bishop Amat had one great running back, Mater Dei had two very good 
ones -- Steve Bodnar, who netted 68 yards and a touchdown Saturday, and Joey 
Trampush, who added 50 yards and another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei also had Flynn, who threw for a highly efficient 167 yards and two 
touchdowns, and a defense that forced three turnovers and held the Lancers to 
14 first downs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know," Rollinson said, "is that we've got some great kids. When you go 
14-0 and knock off the No. 1 team in the nation . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 His voice trailed off, much like Bishop Amat's winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we can relax and figure out what we're going to get for Christmas 
shopping," Rollinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a New Year's resolution, don't believe anything you read in a national 
prep poll.

ORANGE COUNTY HALL OF FAME; A PLAYER AMONG PLAYERS; EVEN AT THE STAR-STUDDED 
LOS ANGELES TENNIS CLUB CRUICKSHANK LEFT HER MARK WITH SKILL AND CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1930s and early 1940s were salad days for the Los Angeles Tennis Club on 
Clinton Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Bing Crosby played there. So did Errol Flynn, Gilbert Roland and others from 
what was the movie industry. Some of the elite of Los Angeles business also 
gathered there when L.A. still was a gangling, growing city. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everyone who played good tennis in the city in those days found 
their way there, regulars and occasional visitors. If you really liked the 
game, it was the place to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Josephine Cruickshank was one of the L.A. Tennis Club's best during that era. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no wonder Flynn, as swashbuckling away from the set as he was on film, 
latched onto Cruickshank as his mixed doubles partner for the Motion Picture 
tournament in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn wasn't bad himself, but Cruickshank was in a different league. In fact, 
she outclassed most who played there in those days, as high as that level was. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was one of the best women to play tennis there around that time, if not 
the best of all," said Jack Tidball of Van Nuys, another top player of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruickshank is 85 now. She says she hasn't played tennis "in a long time," but 
still enjoys watching it on television and when she visits the club. Her 
apartment is only a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruickshank was ranked as high as fifth in the nation in women's open singles 
in 1930 and 1932, and was among the top 10 from 1929-33. She won the U.S. 
Tennis Assn. girls' 18 national doubles championship in 1927 with Midge Gladman 
and was the Southern California women's singles champion in 1933. Then, in 
1934, she represented the United States on the Wightman Cup team, playing 
doubles with Carolin Babcock. 
</P>
<P>
 Her rich competitive career, long before anyone even thought about a pro 
tennis tour, will be recognized again, 60 years after its heyday, with her 
induction into the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruickshank grew up in Orange County, where her father was president of a bank 
in Santa Ana before he sold it and later retired. The family lived in Tustin, 
and Cruickshank attended Santa Ana High before she went to the University of 
California, then settled in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Her longtime friends at the L.A. Tennis Club have been happy to hear of her 
new honor; the club was always a big part of her life. Never married, she was a 
secretary throughout her working career. 
</P>
<P>
 "She still loves to go there and visit her friends," said Martha Molina, who 
assists Cruickshank and lives in the apartment with her. "Ms. Cruickshank still 
does quite a bit of traveling, too, and enjoys herself very much." 
</P>
<P>
 Her niece, Lida Mainieri, who lives in Tempe, Ariz., said Cruickshank had a 
mild stroke several years ago, then hip replacement surgery after a fall about 
three years ago. "After that, she needed someone to stay with her and help her, 
and Martha's been doing that seven days a week, 24 hours a day. My aunt is the 
last of her family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friends remember how involved she has been with the junior program at the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the thing I'll always remember most about her," said Pat Yeomans of 
Los Angeles, who won the U.S. girls' 18 singles title in 1935. "She played with 
me regularly that year, as well as in 1936 and 1937 when I was in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "From about 1953 on through the '70s, she would volunteer her services to work 
with all the juniors in the club on Saturday mornings. She did a wonderful job 
of encouraging all our young players." 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Kerr, another longtime club member, says she appreciates the 
friendliness Cruickshank showed through the years as much as her tennis 
ability. "She was always nice to everyone she would meet, and that's why she 
has so many friends in tennis," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Bixler, president of the Southern California Tennis Assn. for 10 years 
after he retired from his job with a national sporting goods company, has known 
Cruickshank for more than half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 "We joined the tennis club at about the same time when we both were in our 
20s, although I'm a year older," Bixler said. "As soon as I saw her play the 
first time, there was no doubt in my mind how good she was. We had some 
interclub matches in those days, and Josie was always the class of the girls we 
played. . . . That's why 'Old White Horse' grabbed her for his mixed doubles 
partner. That's what we called Errol Flynn. I don't remember now why we called 
him that. I guess he'd ridden a white horse in one of his movies, but it stuck 
around the club." 
</P>
<P>
 Bixler said Cruickshank didn't mingle much with the movie crowd, except for 
the occasional match with a celebrity, even though she worked for one of the 
studios for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "Josie was just a hell of a tennis player," Bixler said. "She wasn't flashy, 
just really solid. She didn't miss. You had to really beat her if you were 
going to win. And she was competitive. She also loved to play bridge and 
backgammon, and she was very competitive in that too." 
</P>
<P>
 Bixler also remembers how Cruickshank worked to get children interested in the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a little school on Vine Street down the way, and the club adopted 
the school, so Josie invited all the kids who wanted to learn how to play the 
game to come down after school on Mondays, and she would teach them," he said. 
"If you were looking for someone to help in those days, she was always that 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 Mainieri also remembers that Cruickshank provided extra help in reading for 
children who were having trouble with it in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way she is," Mainieri said, "always giving of herself." The Orange 
County Sports Hall of Fame

JIM MURRAY: ARNIE WILL ALWAYS BE THE KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We always knew Arnold Palmer would be playing golf till they had to cut the 
shoes off him, or have an iron lung waiting for him at the 18th green. Even if 
there weren't a senior tour, Arnold would be on a golf course.  
</P>
<P>
 Palmer and golf were synonymous. Arnold American, I used to call him. Arnold 
without a golf club in his hand was as out of place as John Wayne without a 
horse, Ruth without a bat, Carl Lewis on a bicycle. An offense against nature.  
</P>
<P>
 He turned golf into a heavyweight fight. He didn't play a course, he slugged 
with it. Toe to toe. Sometimes, it was Dempsey-Firpo. The thing about Palmer 
was, he kept getting up. Other golfers had failures. Arnold had catastrophes. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody can hit a golf ball off a fairway. Arnold hit 'em off rocks in the 
Pacific Ocean, out of parking lots, over trees and through jungles. There was 
no such thing as an unplayable lie for Palmer.  
</P>
<P>
 Watching him play golf was like watching Dempsey fight, Kelly dance or Mays go 
after a fly ball. It wasn't that he had a gorgeous swing -- he slashed at the 
ball like a guy beating a carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was as strong as truck-stop coffee. He had forearms like a 
blacksmith's, wrists like wagon tongues. And he never saw the golf shot that 
could make him flinch. Arnold would try to par Rhode Island. No, birdie it.  
</P>
<P>
 He went after a course like a caveman. He made a two or a 12. He hit the ball 
in places where he had to chase the seals to play it or lift tree limbs and 
beer cans off it.  
</P>
<P>
 He was at his most dangerous from off the pace. You never wanted Palmer in 
your rearview mirror.  
</P>
<P>
 He never lagged a putt in his life. He never laid up or used an iron off a 
par-five tee. Palmer never tried to outsmart a course, he just charged it. He 
didn't want to win on points, he wanted the knockout. He wanted to hang it on 
his wall. He was like Dempsey with his man on the ropes, Tilden at match point. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the greatest long putter I have ever seen. He treated 40-footers as 
though they were tap-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he got it within 20 feet, you felt like saying, 'That's good,' " Dave 
Marr used to say.  
</P>
<P>
 The truck drivers loved him. The public loved him. Other golfers had 
galleries. Arnie had an army. If he goes to Heaven, God better have a handicap. 
Or Arnold might not stay.  
</P>
<P>
 He didn't make golf. Golf made him. But he lifted it out of the 
stockbroker-banker constituency and opened it to the public. He came along just 
as television did and it was a marriage made in golf heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan would have sold cars in any era. So would Snead. But Palmer brought in 
the people who sat in center-field bleachers at Ebbets Field or in the balcony 
at St. Nick's Arena. And they didn't come to see Good Housekeeping golf by some 
meticulous ex-Walker Cupper or Brigham Young graduate. They came to see Palmer 
with his shirt out, cigarette smoking, ball in the high rough and needing a 
three to tie for the lead.  
</P>
<P>
 You wouldn't put his swing in copy books. It was a wild slash, the kind you 
see at midnight at the driving ranges, but it hit the ball long and straight. 
Arnold won the U.S. Open at Denver in 1960 by driving the par-four, 346-yard 
first hole. He won 60 PGA tournaments and two British Opens. A guy's a 
superstar today if he wins a dozen tour events. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-foot putts don't go in anymore. Sometimes, the four-footers don't go, 
either. He has to hit a four-iron where once he hit a six. The holes get 
longer, the greens get smaller but the magic is, he's still Arnold American, 
Captain Golf. Maybe not the leader in the clubhouse anymore but the leader in 
the market place.  
</P>
<P>
 Americans cling to their icons, probably because we have so few. We get our 
royalty from sound stages and playing fields.  
</P>
<P>
 When they set up the Diners Club Matches down here at the PGA West Nicklaus 
Resort course this weekend, they chose 32 playing pros from the regular tour, 
16 from the women's tour and 16 from the senior tour.  
</P>
<P>
 But when they paired Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus on a seniors' team, they 
immediately relegated the rest of the cast to extras. The galleries, the 
autograph hounds, the guys with notebooks and microphones crowded around. It 
was a pairing made in golf heaven. It was 1960 again.  
</P>
<P>
 Golf permits the preservation of legend this way. It was like seeing Ruth and 
Gehrig again, watching Dempsey and Gene Tunney climb into the ring, cheering 
the 1959 Bob Cousy-Bill Russell Celtics.  
</P>
<P>
 When Arnold and Jack teed it up, they represented 130 tour victories between 
them, to say nothing of five British Opens and three U.S. Amateurs. They 
towered over their sport as few athletes have in history.  
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer didn't make golf, he just put it on Page 1. He made it as 
exciting as a "Rocky" movie. Arnold on the charge on a golf course was 
cut-to-the-chase stuff. The public adored him. It still does. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he has to say "what?" a lot. Even though the eyes need bifocals to 
read the greens and the hair is white and the old familiar slash looks like a 
window shade going up, Palmer is as charismatic as any American hero from 
Buffalo Bill to Sitting Bull. There might have been better players, but don't 
bet on it.  
</P>
<P>
 Arnold is as famous for his megafailures as his 60 triumphs. Once, in a final 
round of a U.S. Open, he had a seven-shot lead with nine holes to play. To lose 
that takes concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, no one wrote about the winner. "How I Lost the Open" was going 
to be the title of my essay. I thought it was terrible but it wasn't. It was 
Palmer. Part of the mystique. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a ball in the water on No. 18 Friday, which seemed typical. Arnold out 
on a rock again. But Nicklaus saved the par and, when the match went into 
overtime, the team of Nicklaus and Palmer won. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament organizers were overjoyed. Television promptly rescheduled the 
next day's competition to put the seniors' event on. The word spread. The 
galleries grew. We were all young again. 
</P>
<P>
 When Nicklaus and Palmer won again Saturday, dismissing Chi Chi Rodriguez and 
Jim Dent, 4 and 3, the Diners Club four-ball had a chance to become a historic 
event, which is already a Palmer specialty. If he and Jack can eliminate 
Raymond Floyd and Dave Eichelberger today, there should be a plaque on the 18th 
green commemorating the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three personalities rated the description "the King" in our generation. 
One was Gable, the actor. Another was Elvis, the singer. And the other was 
Palmer, the golfer. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold in the water or in the trees is still a bigger story than anyone else 
on the green. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf is lucky there was a Palmer, and Palmer concedes he was lucky there was 
golf. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his new book, "A Personal Journey," Arnold writes, "Some people think 
of me as just plain lucky and I can't argue with them. I would like to say, 
however, that a man might be walking around lucky and not know it unless he 
tries." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer tried. He gave luck two shots a side. And still won four ways -- the 
nine, the 18, the match and the life.

SALAAM RUNS AWAY WITH HEISMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Rashaan Salaam was going through a long list of "thank yous" Saturday, he 
got to Rick Wood and decided a little more was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come a long way," he told his high school football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The journey was from a Southeast San Diego neighborhood to La Jolla Country 
Day School to Colorado to New York. From a private school where he was sent 
against his wishes to a state university that he wasn't sure he wanted to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 From eight-man football to the Big Eight to the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting the season as a Heisman candidate only in the minds of people 
who published the Colorado media guide, Salaam, a junior tailback, became the 
Buffaloes' first winner of the award at the New York Downtown Athletic Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the question is whether Salaam will take the next step, to the NFL draft, 
this spring or try to duplicate the exploits of Archie Griffin, the only 
two-time Heisman winner. 
</P>
<P>
 At midseason, Salaam said he didn't want the Heisman because it would bring 
pressure to leave school early. But Thursday in New York, he said: "I want it 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 He has it and said his decision is made, that he will announce it on Jan. 6, 
after the Fiesta Bowl game between Colorado and Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Will he or won't he? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure, but just winning the Heisman adds to his value," Wood said. 
"It's instant endorsements, instant money. It would be hard not to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The Heisman voting wasn't close. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam received 1,743 points from among 920 voters -- 870 members of the media 
and the 50 living Heisman winners -- based on three points for first place, two 
for second and one for third on their ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State's Ki-Jana Carter was a distant second, with 901 points. Steve 
McNair, Alcorn State's quarterback, was third with 655 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam, who ran for 2,055 yards, led all six regions polled. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the first running back to get the award since Barry Sanders in 1988 and 
completes a sweep. The three other backs to rush for more than 2,000 yards in a 
season -- Sanders, USC's Marcus Allen and Nebraska's Mike Rozier -- won the 
Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam rushed for 24 touchdowns in a season in which he was held scoreless 
only once -- by Oklahoma State -- and below 100 yards only by Wisconsin, in a 
game in which he scored four times. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Colorado's second game of the season and the 55-17 victory provided a 
nationally televised theater in which Salaam's bid for the Heisman began to 
take shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisconsin, Salaam said, "played real tough defense. I had 25 carries for 86 
yards in that game, but I couldn't get the home run. I just had to pound it up 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
 After a 34-31 victory over Texas in which he rushed for 317 yards in 35 
carries, it seemed everybody wanted to know about Rashaan Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't get much help from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't learned to like (the attention), but I've learned to deal with it. 
You've got to go with the flow," he said in what, for the shy Salaam, is a 
major address. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, to make certain Salaam wasn't overlooked at La Jolla Country Day, put 
together a highlight tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaam wanted to go to California, but when Bruce Snyder left as coach to go 
to Arizona State, Colorado moved up in the pecking order. Salaam signed with 
the Buffaloes, then spent a year wondering why. 
</P>
<P>
 After his freshman season, his mother, Khalada, told him to drop the idea of 
transferring. As a sophomore he split time with Lamont Warren. When Warren 
decided to leave Colorado early for the NFL, the road was open for Salaam. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as Lamont announced he was leaving, you could see the change in 
Rashaan," Colorado Coach Bill McCartney said. 
</P>
<P>
 That change resulted in his winning college football's highest award, and 
among Salaam's thank yous Saturday was one to "Coach Mac, for just keeping the 
faith in me when I was slipping."

ELWAY'S STATUS STILL UP IN AIR; PRO FOOTBALL: BRONCO QUARTERBACK HAS BEEN 
LIMPING, BUT RAIDERS EXPECT HIM TO PLAY IN TODAY'S GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The biggest moment in today's Denver Bronco-Raider game might take place 
before the opening kickoff. The biggest snap Denver quarterback John Elway 
takes might be before the Raiders are even on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, the heart, soul and offense of the Broncos since 1983, is questionable 
for today's game at the Coliseum because of a strained muscle in his left knee, 
an injury that forced him out of last Sunday's game against the Kansas City 
Chiefs in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway says he'll make his final decision during the pregame warm-up. The 
Raiders say they expect him to play. Yes, they know he didn't practice until 
Friday. Yes, they know he was still limping noticeably. But they wouldn't 
believe he won't be there if they saw him in a body cast. Football teams prefer 
to prepare for the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 If Elway can't go, his place will be taken by veteran Hugh Millen, who came on 
last week to lead the Broncos to an overtime victory over Kansas City, even 
though he completed only five of 13 passes for 37 yards. That's a long step 
down from Elway. 
</P>
<P>
 That victory brings Denver into town with a 7-6 record. The Raiders, also 7-6, 
thought they had left the Broncos for dead the last time they played. As the 
Raiders left Denver in September with a 48-16 victory that left the Broncos 
0-3, Coach Wade Phillips was facing a lynch mob.  
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, the Raiders must feel as if they are seeing a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 Here comes Phillips, who turned his critics into cheering fans by leading the 
Broncos to seven victories in nine games, including four in a row, to put them 
solidly back into the race for a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway's absence or inability to perform at his normal level might curtail 
Denver's resurrection. But how did Phillips and his crew manage to get even 
this far back? 
</P>
<P>
 Defense. 
</P>
<P>
 For a long time, it seemed as if the Broncos felt they could get by without 
much in the way of defenders. They spent the months before the season opener 
stocking their offense with new toys for Elway -- receivers Anthony Miller and 
Mike Pritchard and running back Leonard Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the defense, Denver refused to re-sign expensive veterans such as 
linebacker Karl Mecklenburg and safety Dennis Smith. Phillips joked that his 
team would have to win games, 38-35. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody was laughing when the Broncos lost their first four, including that 
humiliation by the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 After that loss, the Broncos figured maybe they could use Smith after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who played at USC and lives in Los Angeles, watched the debacle against 
the Raiders from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frustrated," he said, "because I knew I could help this team, and I 
wasn't being given the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos called the day after the dismal defeat to their hated rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was the loss to the Raiders," Smith said. "That had a lot to do 
with it. I think if we had won that game, I would not have been called back. So 
I thank the Raiders for contributing to bringing me back." 
</P>
<P>
 After today, the Raiders might say, thanks, but no thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Mecklenburg, who was signed just before the season opener, have 
provided the leadership the Denver defense lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not the Pro Bowl players they were as far as their impact on the 
game," Phillips said, "but I think the one thing that really helped me was that 
these two guys knew I was trying to do the right thing and they would stand 
behind me. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we had such a bad start, they came in and said, 'Believe in what the 
coach is telling you. We've played for him a long time, and we know what he is 
saying is right. If you keep trying to do the right thing, things will work 
out.' Having those guys to back you up helped as much as anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Mecklenburg and Smith have also made their presence felt on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos might not have pulled out last week's overtime victory over the 
Chiefs had it not been for them. With Kansas City on the Denver 20-yard line in 
overtime, within range to try a game-winning field goal, Mecklenburg forced 
Marcus Allen to fumble. Smith recovered and the Broncos won, 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
 The Denver defense hasn't soared in the rankings since the turnaround. The 
Broncos remain last in the league, having given up 4,667 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But they maintain that they started off so poorly that they can never catch up 
statistically. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a marked difference, however, on the scoreboard. After giving up 137 
points in its first four games, Denver has given up 164 points in the last 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest changes have been: blitzing more with the linebackers, freeing the 
safeties to blitz by having the cornerbacks play man-to-man, and switching 
safeties, with Smith going to free safety and Steve Atwater to strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to get Steve more involved closer to the line of 
scrimmage," Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Denver does, Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler has to be rubbing his 
hands at the thought of another afternoon against the Broncos. In four games as 
a Raider against the Broncos, he has completed 63.2% of his passes for 1,206 
yards and 12 touchdowns with no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raider dominance over Denver began long before Hostetler arrived. The 
Raiders have beaten the Broncos seven consecutive times at the Coliseum and 10 
of 11 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders beat the Broncos in the regular-season finale last year to get 
into the playoffs, beat them a week later in the first round of the postseason, 
beat them in the preseason at Barcelona and then administered what looked like 
a knockout blow in September. Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Lionel Washington and tailback Ty Montgomery were not activated for 
the game. . . . Bronco end Shannon Sharpe, the team's leading receiver, has a 
swollen knee and sore ankles but is expected to play.

PRICE GOUGES CRENSHAW, 38-6; CITY SECTION: SYLMAR BACK HAS 166 YARDS, THREE 
TOUCHDOWNS AS SPARTANS WIN 4-A TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Migraine headaches kept Sylmar High's star running back Durell Price off the 
practice field for two days this week, but the intense pain in his head wasn't 
enough to slow the conductor of the Spartan Express, which rolled through the 
City Section Division 4-A championship game without a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Price scored the first two times he touched the ball and finished with 166 
yards and three touchdowns in 19 carries to pace Sylmar's 38-6 rout of Crenshaw 
in the City 4-A final in front of about 4,000 Saturday at El Camino College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was questionable for the game, but I said, 'Hey, this is what I've been 
working for all year. I'm not gonna sit out for nothing,' " said Price, who 
scored on runs of 38, 25 and eight yards. "If I can walk, I'm gonna play." 
</P>
<P>
 Price's first and second carries looked like a walk in the park, thanks in 
part to an inspired offensive line that enabled Sylmar to score on three of its 
first six plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been challenging (the offensive line) for the last two weeks because we 
knew how physical these teams are," said Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman, who is 
unbeaten in four City championship appearances.  
</P>
<P>
 "And they came through remarkably. That's where the game is won -- on the 
defensive and offensive lines." 
</P>
<P>
 After Crenshaw went three-and-out on the game's opening drive, Sylmar 
quarterback Greg Marquez completed passes of 22 and 12 yards on the Spartans' 
first two plays to set the stage for Price, who left the game often because of 
headaches, shortness of breath and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
 Price took a pitch, darted left, shook off an attempted ankle tackle near the 
line of scrimmage and raced 38 yards down the Sylmar sideline for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (12-2) responded with its best drive of the day, going 69 yards in 14 
plays and scoring on a five-yard run by Brandon Seals (54 yards in 16 carries) 
to close to 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rest of the game belonged to Sylmar (14-0), which notched its second 
City title in three years.  
</P>
<P>
 On the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Marquez connected with Davon 
Young over the middle on a 62-yard scoring play for a 14-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Hernandez recovered a squib kick and the Spartans set up shop again, 
this time at the Crenshaw 32. 
</P>
<P>
 After a seven-yard run by Young, Price took a handoff on the next play, bolted 
through a hole, then went untouched for a 25-yard touchdown and a 21-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a hole about five yards wide and I just ran through it," Price said. "I 
ran to daylight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartan coaching staff put the offensive line on the hot seat Saturday -- 
and the linemen responded, paving the way for a 351-yard offensive effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody kept telling us if we don't win, it's gonna be the line's fault. So 
we had to step it up all week in practice," said senior Brandon McGee, a 
starting center and nose guard who also played for Sylmar's 1992 championship 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams stalled on second-quarter possessions, until Crenshaw got a break.  
</P>
<P>
 A Crenshaw punt glanced off Young's foot and Crenshaw's Karlos Dixon recovered 
at the Sylmar 13 late in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 But two plays later, Young made amends by intercepting Ricky Lumford's pass at 
the three to preserve the Spartans' 21-6 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans dominated the second half -- limiting the Cougars to 19 yards -- 
and left Crenshaw Coach Robert Garrett all but speechless.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a good idea for me to say anything at this time," said Garrett, who 
refused to answer any postgame questions. "There's just nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez, who completed seven of 11 for 154 yards, capped a 75-yard scoring 
drive with a 13-yard pass to Galdino Cortes to open the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw gained only three yards in its next two possessions and Sylmar got 
the ball on the Crenshaw 41 after a shanked punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, whose 1,936 yards rushing this season make him the prime candidate for 
4-A player of the year honors, scored his third touchdown on the first play of 
the fourth quarter on an eight-yard run, breaking four tackles to get into the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he had the explosiveness today," Engilman said. "He looked like 
he was a little slow and that's why we kept pulling him out."

MORNING BRIEFING: THIS PENALTY BOX SUGGESTION GOOD FOR WASHED-UP PLAYERS

 Tom Powers writes in the St. Paul Pioneer Press about the NFL Competition 
Committee's being asked to study the possibility of a penalty box for defenders 
who deliver late or flagrant hits to the quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "How about the men's room on the main concourse?" he suggests. "What a 
deterrent that would be. All the dads taking their young sons to the potty 
could point to the man in the cage next to the soap dispenser and say: 
</P>
<P>
 " 'See what happens when you don't play by the rules?' " 
</P>

 Trivia Time: How many times has a USC offensive lineman made first-team 
All-American since 1964?

<P>
 Look-alikes? Remember the story of golfer Ernie Els encountering a poisonous 
snake on a course in South Africa?

 All-out ride: Jockey Randy Romero, who has won nearly 4,000 races and recently 
launched a comeback at Hollywood Park, left his imprint at Santa Anita when 
riding there in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing he was beaten despite a vigorous ride, Romero resorted to yelling at 
his mount, Flawless Performer. The screaming dislodged Romero's partial 
dentures. Flawless Performer won, but the jockey's teeth were lost, never to be 
found.

 Don't answer this: John Eisenberg in the Baltimore Sun:

 "If you know for a fact that Illinois and East Carolina are playing in the 
Liberty Bowl, and that South Carolina and West Virginia are playing in the 
Carquest Bowl, and that Baylor and Washington State are playing in the Alamo 
Bowl, you need help."

 Hallelujah: Mike Lupica in Newsday: "When I'm channel-surfing and see Jimmy 
Johnson's face, there's always a moment when I expect him to start reading from 
the Book of Revelations and flashing the toll-free donation number."

<P>
 Mind games: Kansas City Chief Coach Marty Schottenheimer has a "12 o'clock 
rule," which prohibits players from thinking about a loss after midnight the 
day of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Said running back Marcus Allen: "Sometimes we act like losing doesn't hurt. 
Sometimes you've got to forget the 12 o'clock rule."

 Superwoman: Phil Whitten, editor of Swimming World, on the disclosure that 
Kristin Otto of then-East Germany, who won six gold medals in the 1988 Olympic 
Games, had a high level of testosterone:

 "Otto had more testosterone in her than the entire starting team of the Dallas 
Cowboys."

 Game plan: Frank Howard, 85, former Clemson football coach, on the 
disadvantages of the modern passing game: "It's a pretty good idea to hang onto 
the football as long as you can. If they ain't got it, they ain't going to beat 
you with it."

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; ALL OF A SUDDEN, THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A night at the Lakers: It ain't like last year. 
</P>
<P>
 George Lynch throws the ball away, whereupon Nick Van Exel taps himself in the 
chest and snarls, "Throw me the . . . ball!" interjecting a compound adjective 
to show how strongly he feels. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Ceballos, who has suggested Van Exel should throw him the ball, 
continues on the pace that should take him back to Phoenix as an All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlade Divac blocks shots, just like an NBA center. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Jones looks promising. 
</P>
<P>
 Elden Campbell awakens from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 Give or take the occasional embarrassment, something is stirring here, giving 
local professional basketball a new -- thank heaven -- look. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers bristle with energy, some nights, anyway. The Clippers lack just 
about everything but young legs and effort. If it isn't like the glory days, 
look at it this way: Neither is striking, being locked out or threatening to 
leave town. Among local major league teams, this makes them unique. 
</P>
<P>
 A public, spoiled by a decade of greatness (Lakers) and one memorable 
half-season (Clippers), is unimpressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers claim an average of 7,505 for their first eight games in the 
Sports Arena which -- even if true -- would be little more than half the 
average of the 26th worst-drawing team, Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers haven't drawn 14,000 since opening night. When they waxed the 
Houston Rockets a week ago, only 13,056 showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 When they ran up a 19-point first-quarter lead on Golden State to win their 
seventh of eight, they drew their second-smallest crowd, 10,579. 
</P>
<P>
 When they nose-dived Friday against the Clippers, the body count was 10,768, 
not counting the 12 stiff Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker officials, resigned to rebuilding their fan base, are hanging in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we disappointed?" Forum spokesman Bob Steiner says. "We're not pleased. 
But I don't know what else you can expect." 
</P>
<P>
 In front-running L.A., one season out of the playoffs and four out of the 
finals is an interminable drought, but the Laker turnaround has been 
remarkable. The day before Magic Johnson retired in 1991, they had one starter 
-- Divac -- younger than 30. Now their oldest starter is Divac, 26, and the 
unit's average is 23.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry West, the Wizard of Inglewood, pulled it off with a single trip to the 
lottery and no pick higher than No. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 With the franchise crying out for a marquee/genius coach and neither Johnson 
nor Rick Pitino interested, West hired Del Harris, who is more professorial 
than charismatic but is known as as a coaches' coach and quickly showed why. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris not only put in the fast-paced offense Jerry Buss required, he turned 
the program around defensively. 
</P>
<P>
 In their 7-1 spurt, the Lakers held opponents to an average of 95 points. 
</P>
<P>
 They're No. 1 in the league in steals, No. 2 to the Rockets in opponents' 
field-goal percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it only gets harder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers will have all they can do to make the playoffs. Bent on recapturing 
their greatness, they still have to steal a superstar (oh, why couldn't they 
win 23 games last season rather than 33 and dial up their chances at Grant 
Hill?) 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, this column presents its first consumers' guide: Go to the Forum 
before prices go up again and they start blocking out preferred locations for 
the studio people; go to the Sports Arena, where tickets are plentiful and the 
home team, a bunch of mutts to warm the heart of anyone who ever rooted for an 
underdog, is more and more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 What the heck, it beats last year. IN CLIPPERDOM, THE WORD IS NO LONGER GOODBY 
</P>
<P>
 A night at the Clippers: It ain't like anything you've ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been fewer wilder scenes at the Sports Arena than that after Pooh 
Richardson's shot beat Milwaukee on Wednesday on a busted play Bill Fitch named 
the "drop-kick special." 
</P>
<P>
 Players wearing towel-turbans for luck mobbed Pooh. Fitch kissed the floor. 
The players awarded Fitch the game ball, a nice touch since he had been wearing 
them out on the practice floor through this monthlong ordeal. Still on their 
high Friday, they gave the Lakers a spanking to remember; the subs jumped off 
the bench with two fingers in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it never gets easier. 
</P>
<P>
 On talent and experience, the Clippers may be the most- overmatched team ever 
to play in the NBA. The 9-73 76ers had three players who had averaged double 
figures. Last season's Dallas Mavericks, who started 2-39, were a collection of 
superstars compared to the Clippers, who have one player -- Elmore Spencer, 
currently on the injured list because of personal problems -- who finished 
1993-94 as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be many pointed lessons, as Fitch tries to persuade talented rookie 
Lamond Murray not to unleash his three-point rainmaker with 15 seconds on the 
24-second clock and Gary Grant not to laugh out loud at Spencer's scoop layup. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a new feeling in a dressing room where camaraderie has replaced 
mass exodus as a motif, for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope upper management can figure out how to support it, for a change. 
For starters, a Clipper official reckons a move to Anaheim would mean an extra 
$20 million, not to mention the thrill the players would get actually playing 
in front of people. HOLD 'EM AND HE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING 
</P>
<P>
 The more problems the New York Knicks have, the harder Pat Riley coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 How about the old surprise-them-with-a-vacation trick, coupled with a 
poor-us-nobody-respects-us announcement? 
</P>
<P>
 Riley took the Knicks to Orlando two days before their game against the Magic 
and turned them loose in the Magic Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted, "They (the Magic) probably think they're better than us, and 
that's probably why they're good. I don't think anybody respects the Knicks 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Proving his point, the Magic won, 125-100. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knick problems are thought to be sore knees (Patrick Ewing's) or toes 
(Charles Oakley's), rather than a lack of heart, but Riley went to the whip. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in New York, he said the problem was "the old comfort zone. It's 
complacency at its best, the theory of entitlements. . . . That is over. You 
produce on the court to play. That's not a warning or a threat. It's just doing 
the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The right things didn't include a team meeting, suggested by John Starks, 
rejected by Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 The East being what it is, the Knicks won three in a row -- in a string of 
games in which they won't even see a .500 team until Dec. 15 -- and roared 
their defiance at a world closing in on them fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to get to the championship, you've got to come through New York," 
Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to playing them (the Magic) again. We'll be counting down 
the days. At least I will." 
</P>
<P>
 He'd better get healed. In two games, Shaquille O'Neal has outscored Ewing, 
79-39, and outrebounded him, 32-7. NEXT: WORM RUNS OVER TOOTH FAIRY? 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to imagine where Nike, which advertises itself as a company that 
cares about sports, can go from its ad in which Dennis Rodman, having raised 
himself to celebrity status in an ongoing exhibition of self-mutilation, is 
shown mugging Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, Charles Barkley has staked out the I'm-no-role-model role. (This 
was before Nike reintroduced a fatherly Charles, advising us to Participate in 
the Lives of America's Youth, proving Nike still cares, even if it can't 
remember.) 
</P>
<P>
 How about Worm, wearing $150 Nike cross-trainers, kidnaps the Easter bunny and 
holds him for ransom? 
</P>
<P>
 How about Worm, wearing $150 hob-nailed Nikes, kicks Barney, deflating his 
costume in the middle of the "I Love You" song? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back on earth. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs, having found out what they are without Rodman -- a .500 team -- are 
holding the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman, scheduled to rejoin the team from his paid suspension last week, 
called during practice to tell Coach Bob Hill he was in Dallas, where the keys 
to a friend's pickup truck had been stolen and some of Worm's possessions had 
been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you hate it when that happens? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently skeptical, the Spurs re-suspended Rodman, this time without pay, 
when Rodman reported. Who says he's crazy? FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Heat trainer Ron Culp on Ron Rothstein, who coached Miami to its 0-17 record 
in 1988: "I was actually afraid he'd drop dead. He'd get so red in the face and 
become so agitated, I thought he might have a stroke or a heart attack. At the 
very least, I thought he'd hyperventilate and pass out. He was just so intense, 
he'd get himself into such a physical and emotional state, you'd worry about 
him. Coaching was his life and he took it very, very personally." . . . 
Aftermath: The uptight Rothstein is on Mike Fratello's Cleveland staff. 
Assistant coaching is now his life, and he's better off for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Robinson averaged 24.6 points on a five-game trip and inserted himself 
into the rookie-of-the-year race thought to have been ended early by Grant 
Hill. . . . Jason Kidd, plagued by shooting problems -- at 33%, he'll need a 
lot of work to get himself up to "poor" -- is a distant third but has 
nevertheless been impressive. "He's a man," Spur Coach Bob Hill said. "He 
manhandled us, kicked our butts all night. His stats don't mean a thing. He's 
special. He played like a veteran." . . . Officials from the NBA and the 
players' association are finally meeting with both sides saying they want a 
deal before the Feb. 12 All-Star game. The NBA has offered to increase the 
players' percentage of revenues from 53% to 57% and their cut of licensing 
money from $500,000 a year to $25 million but wants a four-year limit on 
contracts, elimination of balloon payments and a cap on offers for free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Nostalgia, it's great: Introductions of great ex-Celtics in Boston Garden's 
last season brought Danny Ainge, who with Kevin McHale introduced a joyful note 
of irreverence in the '80s. Ainge on a fond memory: "It was when Froggy -- M.L. 
(Carr) doesn't like to be called that anymore -- but when Mr. M.L. Froggy Vice 
President Carr was in a game and Bill Fitch sent Gerald Henderson in for him. 
M.L. didn't want to come out, and when Gerald came up to him he said no. Gerald 
was standing out there, and we had six guys on the court. Fitch had to call a 
timeout to convince M.L. to come out of the game." . . . Red Auerbach on Lenny 
Wilkens, who's about to break his all-time record for victories: "Remember, he 
didn't do it in 20 years." Said Wilkens, who'll do it in 21 years plus two 
months after gigs in Seattle (twice), Portland, Cleveland and Atlanta: "Tell 
him I didn't have the players he had, either. Give me a break -- Russell, 
Havlicek. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando teammates Jeff Turner, Scott Skiles and Larry Krystkowiak railed at 
the excesses of youthful teammates last season, but Turner says things have 
changed: "There is a lot more maturity than there was last year. And the two 
veterans, Horace Grant and Brian Shaw, these guys played on other teams and 
say, 'Hey, this is the way you're supposed to do it.' " . . . Nick Anderson: 
"Now guys are coming in an hour, an hour-and-a-half before practice. We have a 
game, and guys come in the day before, shooting, doing weight work. It's just 
totally different." 
</P>
<P>
 The Incredible Sulk: The Warriors' 2-8 plummet since trading Chris Webber 
isn't hard to explain since several young players are carrying a torch for 
departed teammates. Latrell Sprewell and Keith Jennings have Webber's No. 4 on 
their sneakers; Jennings also has Billy Owens' 30. Even Coach Don Nelson has 
complained he has lost his spirit for the moment. Solution: Trade Tom Gugliotta 
and several No. 1s to Chicago for Scottie Pippen (a deal the Bulls reportedly 
would have accepted last summer if the Bullets had offered it), make Carlos 
Rogers a power forward, field the most athletic team ever put together and, as 
the Eagles would say, get over it.

 Up leaps Lamond Murray and the score is 20-10, Clippers, and pretty soon up 
pops Malik Sealy and the score is 40-18, Clippers, until eventually the Lakers' 
home crowd begins booing the Lakers , whose spokesperson, Chick Hearn, 
dutifully reports the score to his TV and radio audiences and then adds: "This 
is not an April Fool's story, folks." 
</P>
<P>
 And before long Loy Vaught lays one in to make the score 51-28, Clippers, and 
then just before halftime Pooh Richardson pumps from three-point land and 
swishes one to make the score 63-35, Clippers, and one of the Lakers fumbles 
the basketball out of bounds and Hearn turns to his partner, Stu Lantz, to ask: 
"How did this team lose 16 in a row?" 
</P>
<P>
 To which Stu responds: "They didn't play against an uninspired Laker team, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a turnabout. Here we have the Lakers, who have been giving us such 
solid basketball for weeks. And here we have the Clippers, who have been 
serving up NBA Lite. And who is beating whom? Correction: Who is pounding whom? 
Who is mopping up the Forum floor with the Lakers, laughing from the bench and 
bumping elbows and Arsenio'ing with their wrists? The boys of winter 
themselves, the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 How do we apologize to an entire basketball team? Making fun of the Clippers 
seemed such good sport. We forget that they are flesh and bone. We forget that 
if a Clipper is pricked, does he not bleed? Most of all, we forget that it is 
not the Clippers' fault that they are weak. What they lack is skill, not 
desire. 
</P>
<P>
 Into town they had come, the messengers of doom, from magazines and TV 
networks, everyone this side of Connie Chung, to tell the world about this 
drive-by basketball team from Los Angeles that couldn't shoot straight. Some of 
the players understood. Others tried to tune it out. One of the Clipper 
announcers carped about "incredible negativity" from the media, as though after 
that 16th consecutive loss, the next morning's headline should have read: 
CLIPPERS LOSE AGAIN, BUT SURE DO TRY HARD. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. OK. We sympathize. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't normally attract that sort of national attention," says the 
good-natured Vaught, making the best of a bad situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "But. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But what, Loy? Something on your mind? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, look. They wanted to see us keep losing, if truth be told. It made it a 
better story. But see, that's not our job. Our job is snapping streaks and 
winning games. That's what we want. We want them writing what we want to read." 
</P>
<P>
 Makes sense. This is a perfectly understandable reaction. Only, remember this, 
everybody: We also would have been there if they had won 16 in a row. That's a 
story too. It isn't about negativity. We would be perfectly happy to serve you 
up a little positivity, if there be such a word. We don't poke fun at teams 
that go 16-0. We poke fun at teams that go 0-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Except, not tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Not as the second half begins with a layin by Sealy and a couple of free 
throws by Tony Massenburg until the score is 67-35, Clippers. Whereupon we see 
the Lakers at their absolute worst, an airball by Nick Van Exel and a technical 
foul on Antonio Harvey for taunting and a pass from Vlade Divac to an invisible 
teammate and a couple of passes from Eddie Jones to nobody in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 And all a disappointed Chick Hearn can do is sit there asking, in all honesty: 
"Am I reading this incorrectly, Stu, or are the Lakers, on both ends of the 
floor, totally out of sync?" 
</P>
<P>
 To which Lantz can only agree: "Oh, yeah. Totally out of sync." 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't only the Lakers who are doing everything wrong but the Clippers 
who are doing everything right. Richardson has double-figure assists, and 
Vaught has double-figure rebounds and the whole starting lineup has 
double-figure points. Sealy feels so loose that he uncorks 25 shots. He is 
dominating the Lakers so thoroughly, you would think he stole their playbook. 
</P>
<P>
 It feels so good for a change to go to the dressing room proud of yourself, to 
be unafraid of what anyone will say, to your face or behind your back. 
</P>
<P>
 Sealy suppresses a smile when reminded that he was the one, after the victory 
virgins finally won their first game, who had said: "If we go 66-0 the rest of 
the way, maybe you guys will write about that! Ha, ha, ha!" 
</P>
<P>
 Felt so good, didn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you've got to have something to laugh about, don't you?" Sealy asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth quarter has a nervous moment or two. But then Eric Piatkowski tips 
one in to make the score 97-79, Clippers, and then Randy Woods dumps a running 
jumper and the final score ends up 109-84, Clippers, and there isn't anything 
that the Lakers can do except feel lousy, and Chick Hearn is saying, "There 
isn't much you can say about this but, 'I'm sorry.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, though, have plenty to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaught feels so good about what just happened, he actually says, "We feel 
we're capable of beating any other team in the league. We are doing all the 
things that are conducive to winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Sealy: "Even our friends talked about us, just like the people not our 
friends. We had to get that off our chests. And we have." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a Clipper no longer means having to say you're sorry.

BASEBALL PLAYERS MAKE A PITCH; LABOR: OWNERS COOL TO UNION PROPOSAL OF COST 
CONTROL AND PARTNERSHIP THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS SALARY CAP OR FREE AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Major League Baseball Players Assn. presented a proposal to the owners 
Saturday that union leader Donald Fehr said addresses management's desire for 
cost controls and a partnership with the players, but the chairman of the 
owners' negotiating committee seemed to express doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 John Harrington, chief executive officer of the Boston Red Sox, said in a 
statement the owners were encouraged by player concerns about their "mutual 
self interest in growing the game through a lasting relationship," but "we have 
consistently told the union (that) the clubs must evaluate any proposal based 
on the following: 
</P>
<P>
 "Does the plan address cost certainty? Does it result in reduction of player 
costs from 58% of revenue to 50%? Does it deal with payroll disparity and 
encourage competitive balance?" 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington and his committee met Saturday night to study the proposal, but in 
raising those familiar questions he seemed to suggest that it is unlikely to 
provide the framework for a negotiated settlement before the owners meet in 
Chicago on Thursday to implement a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a management source said the owners would probably have a 
counterproposal today, an anguished union lawyer said, "They've already . . . 
on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was formulated during the recent three-day meeting of more than 
80 players in Atlanta. Special mediator William J. Usery expressed displeasure 
that Fehr, surrounded by a committee of 15 players, called a news conference 
here to release the details after presenting it to the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "In any mediation I'm delighted when one or the other side makes a proposal or 
counterproposal, but the negotiations have to take part across a table, and 
when the details become fodder for public debate it makes a very difficult 
dispute even more difficult," Usery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fehr: "Bill did ask us to consider not doing it, but there was such 
tremendous anticipation (of the details) -- among the media and our membership 
-- that I felt we had no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said his economists estimated that the plan could save the owners $100 
million in salaries over the three-year period that the union has proposed the 
revenue-sharing phase stays in place -- "the drag on salaries that the owners 
keep talking about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The essential points: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Based on 1994 figures, the union proposes a tax on all payrolls of about 
5%, generating about $35 million to be shared with small-revenue teams. It also 
proposes making American and National league gate splits uniform. American 
League home teams now keep 80%, with the visitors getting 20%. The NL split is 
about 95-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The union proposes making it 75-25, generating another $23 million for the 
clubs to share. Added to the $35 million, the total becomes $58 million, which 
matches the total owners agreed to share when they finally agreed to revenue 
sharing at a January meeting in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have responded directly to the club's stated desire for a revenue stream 
of $58 million without destroying the market," Fehr said. "More importantly, 
our plan would produce that $58 million immediately. The owners' plan is to be 
phased in and doesn't produce it until the fourth year." (The owners' plan, 
however, is linked to the salary cap that is conspicuously absent from the 
players' plan). 
</P>
<P>
 -- The union proposes an industry growth fund of at least $60 million, with 
the players taking $30 million from their licensing revenue and the owners 
matching it from expansion fees. The fund would be administered by four players 
and four owners, with the money used for joint marketing and developmental 
projects, including stadium improvement where needed. The potential growth, 
Fehr said, would make it possible to dissolve the revenue-sharing facet after 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The union also proposes that the players have a voice in virtually all 
other major industry decisions, urging immediate hiring of a commissioner and 
expansion by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in history, the players are investing their own money to 
ensure the future of the game," Atlanta Brave pitcher Tom Glavine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but it seems doubtful the owners will find common ground in a 
proposal that makes no changes in free agency or arbitration and does not seem 
to include the desired spending disincentive represented in a straight cap or 
high tax rate.

ANTEATERS COME THROUGH IN CLUTCH; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THEY MAKE A FREE THROW, 
BLOCK A SHOT LATE IN 73-70 VICTORY OVER SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 UC Irvine is a long way from wowing Dick Vitale, but the Anteaters are 
learning how to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a toddler taking his first tentative steps, Irvine was alternately 
swaggering and staggering Saturday night. But the Anteaters hung on for a 73-70 
victory over the University of San Diego before 1,767 in the Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in almost a year the Anteaters (2-2) have won two in a 
row. And it's a streak that might have been three had they been able to make a 
free throw in the final seconds of regulation last week against 14th-ranked 
Ohio University. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the exact same situation tonight as we were against Ohio and the 
difference was that this time we made one of the free throws," Coach Rod Baker 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Bobcats, freshman Kevin Simmons missed the front end of a 
one-and-one situation and Irvine lost in overtime. Against San Diego, senior 
Mark Odsather made one of two free throws with seven seconds remaining and then 
senior guard Zuri Williams blocked David Fizdale's three-point attempt at the 
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a monster game for us," Baker said. "It's a win on the road against 
a good team. If we're ever going to be any good, we have to win these." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego (3-2) didn't go quietly into this night, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters trailed, 54-50, with less than seven minutes to play. But Irvine 
-- thanks largely to the offensive spark of freshman guard Brian Keefe -- went 
on a 12-0 run and eventually led by eight after point guard Raimonds Miglinieks 
made two free throws with 4:27 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine, which came into the game shooting 63% from the line, made 14 of 18 
free throws in the final 7:14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters seemed to have seized command of the game when Williams made one 
of two free throws to put the Anteaters ahead, 71-64, with 24 seconds 
remaining. But Doug Harris, who made four of six three-pointers and led the 
Toreros with 23 points, made a three-pointer over Williams' outstretched arm 
with 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalid Channell, who had nine points and eight rebounds, made a free throw to 
give Irvine a 72-67 advantage with 15 seconds remaining, but Sean Flannery made 
a shot from about three feet beyond the three-point line to cut the Anteaters' 
lead to two with seven seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I missed the first free throw, I was thinking, 'Oh, no, another Ohio 
U.,' " Odsather said. "But I was determined to make them have to make one from 
20 feet instead of two feet to get this one into overtime." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine trailed, 36-29, at halftime. But the Anteaters outrebounded the Toreros 
by nine in the second half and shot 54% from the floor after hitting only 38% 
of their first-half field goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different game when you make a couple of shots," Baker said. "Our big 
guys stepped up in the second half and we made some free throws when it 
counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were leading and then we were leading. Hey, from where I was pacing, 
that was a great college basketball game." 
</P>
<P>
 First-year San Diego Coach Brad Holland, who left Cal State Fullerton in 
September, saw it a bit differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got outhustled in the second half," Holland said. "They're a good team, 
but we beat ourselves tonight. We missed six or seven close-in shots and our 
interior defense was so awful that we either gave them easy shots or fouled 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters are not going to quibble about whether they played well or San 
Diego played poorly. A victory is a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed this," Channell said. "It's a stepping stone for us. We're getting 
more and more used to how to play during crunch time. We're learning how to 
finish these kinds of games."

NCAA VOLLEYBALL NORTHWEST REGIONAL; 49ERS CAN'T OVERCOME OHIO STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those confused expressions and frustrated grimaces told the story. 
</P>
<P>
 After finding a little extra to overcome challenges so many times before, the 
Long Beach State women's volleyball team could search all it liked, but it 
couldn't come up with what it needed on this night. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending national champion 49ers were overpowered by Ohio State, 15-5, 
14-16, 15-9, 15-5, Saturday night in the Northwest Regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State (29-2) plays Stanford (30-1) in the final four Thursday at Austin, 
Tex. The championship game is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buckeyes last played in the final four in 1991, when they lost to eventual 
national champion UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State dominated the deciding fourth game Saturday night, hitting .529%. 
The Buckeyes led, 13-2, at one point. Junior middle blocker Jenny Jackson ended 
the match with a kill. Jackson led Ohio State with 21 kills. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended the college career of 49er senior outside hitter Nichelle 
Burton, who had a match-high 24 kills. Burton, the Big West player of the year, 
was a two-time All-American selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton said Friday night's emotional five-game victory over Hawaii in the 
regional semifinals took something out of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night was a little bit of a factor," Burton said. "I think we were a 
little tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, which finished 27-6, endured a draining season. The 49ers were in 
a tight Big West race with Hawaii, UC Santa Barbara and Pacific, and won their 
fourth consecutive conference title in their final conference match. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't much left," Long Beach Coach Brian Gimmillaro said. "We didn't 
attack the ball at the net." 
</P>
<P>
 After three games Saturday night, Ohio State led, 2-1. The 49ers led in the 
third game, 8-6, on a kill by Burton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buckeyes tied the score, 8-8, then controlled the game, limiting the 49ers 
to one point the rest of the way. The game ended, 15-9, when a kill attempt by 
49er senior middle blocker Traci Dahl went long. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second game, it appeared as though Long Beach was on its way to 
being swept. Leading, 1-0 in games, Ohio State took a 10-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burton wouldn't let the 49ers fold -- and Brita Schwerm provided help. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers rallied, and Burton's consecutive kills cut the Buckeyes' lead to 
10-9. The score became 10-10 when a kill attempt by Ohio State's Jackson went 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 A block and a kill on consecutive plays by freshman middle blocker Nique Crump 
gave Long Beach a 12-10 lead, its first since leading, 2-1. From there, the 
game was tied at 12-12, 13-13 and 14-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Schwerm, who had 19 kills in the match, gave the 49ers a 15-14 lead with 
her fifth kill of the game. Her sixth kill from the left side ended the game.

RAMS HOPE 'SPARK' WILL END FIZZLE; PRO FOOTBALL: CHANDLER WILL START OVER 
MILLER AGAINST THE BUCCANEERS IN AN ATTEMPT TO FIRE UP THE TEAM AS IT STRIVES 
TO STOP FOUR-GAME LOSING STREAK.

 In previewing today's struggle for victory No. 5 between the Rams and Tampa 
Bay Buccaneers, Ram defensive end Fred Stokes said, "I'm a football fan, and if 
I wasn't playing, I don't think I'd watch the game." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 32,000 fans, however, have already paid $20 to $40 to watch the Rams 
and Buccaneers, who are bound by poor performances and who are projected to 
play elsewhere next year with new coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure there's not going to be too many people watching, but it still 
doesn't matter to us," Ram linebacker Shane Conlan said. "We just gotta win 
some games. We're paid to do a job, and we haven't done it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who have given up 31 points in each of their last three games, have 
dropped four games in a row, including a lackluster 31-15 loss to New Orleans 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Tampa Bay has won two games in a row for the first time since 1992. The 
Buccaneers can make it three for the first time since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Although one more defeat assures Tampa Bay of a 12th consecutive season with 
10 or more losses, the Buccaneers remain motivated. They are talking about 
finishing with five consecutive victories, and Coach Sam Wyche is fired up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're practicing as well as any of the teams that are getting themselves 
ready for postseason play," he said. "You don't see teams practicing this way 
when they probably aren't going to be in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram Coach Chuck Knox has selected Chris Chandler to counterattack such 
optimism. In confirming what he has denied all season, Knox announced this week 
that he was picking a ready-to-play Chandler over a ready-to-play Chris Miller 
to start against Tampa Bay in an effort to "spark" his troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it supercharges the guys because Chandler is in there," Ram 
running back Jerome Bettis said. "But I guess we have a tendency to win more 
games with Chris Chandler in there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have won twice with Miller at quarterback and twice with Chandler as 
their starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Chandler's wins look prettier," Bettis said. "I don't know if 
quarterback is the problem anyway. It's a team problem. It's really hard to say 
why they would make a move like that, because I don't see the difference in 
quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have changed starting quarterbacks five times this season -- mostly 
because of injuries to Miller and Chandler. Miller was hired to be the team's 
starting quarterback, but Knox soured on his leadership skills and his penchant 
for mistakes. Chandler demonstrated an ability to control the ball and guided 
the Rams to their best victory, a 16-0 showing at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 When various media outlets reported that Knox preferred Chandler to Miller 
earlier this season, Knox strongly objected. Several of his assistant coaches, 
however, told a different story. Now, a week after Miller's best showing and 
after announcing that a change "is no reflection on Miller," Chandler takes 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just change for change's sake," Ram offensive line coach Jim Erkenbeck said. 
"Maybe that's a way to ignite this team. The bottom line is the team hasn't 
been successful the last four weeks, and the easiest change to make is at 
quarterback -- a change that would have an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, who has a record of 17-26 as a starter, including an 0-6 mark while 
with Tampa Bay, has completed 63.6% of his passes with five touchdowns and two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played well all year," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be matched against the NFL's 20th-ranked defense, one that is also 
second-to-last in the league against the run. The Buccaneers are tied with the 
Cincinnati Bengals for fewest interceptions with eight, and only Denver, with 
12, has fewer sacks than Tampa Bay's 17. 
</P>
<P>
 On offense, the Buccaneers rank 23rd, having scored 191 points. Only Houston 
and Arizona have scored fewer. Quarterback Craig Erickson has thrown for 12 
touchdowns with seven interceptions, and rookie running back Errict Rhett, who 
ran 40 times for 192 yards last week, has gained 774 yards in 215 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to play football, a game we have played since we were little 
kids," Ram safety Anthony Newman said. "It doesn't matter who is playing 
quarterback or what is going on. We might be out of the playoff race and out of 
everything else, but our incentive remains the same since we were little kids 
playing this game: to win a football game."

PREP SCHOOL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES; ORANGE LUTHERAN LETS IT SLIP AWAY

 It all fell apart for Orange Lutheran in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 With five of the Lancers' seven turnovers coming after the intermission, a 
19-13 halftime lead by Montclair Prep quickly became a 53-13 rout in the 
Division X title game Saturday night at Los Angeles Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had too many mistakes," Orange Lutheran Coach Jim Kunau said. "You 
can't turn the ball over that many times against a team like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep converted four of the seven turnovers into touchdowns. It 
scored on three in the second half, outscoring the Lancers, 34-0, in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep's first second-half score came after a fake punt by Orange 
Lutheran turned out to be a bad decision when the Mounties dropped Matt 
Stratton for a one-yard loss. On the next play, quarterback Darrel Dent hit 
Kenny Peffer on a 47-yard touchdown pass for a 25-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the rash of turnovers by the Lancers. Orange Lutheran's Che Holloway 
fumbled twice on consecutive kickoffs, leading to touchdown runs by Akil 
Anderson and Demetrius Green for a 39-13 advantage with 50 seconds remaining in 
the third quarter. It was a cakewalk from there. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Joe Juliano accounted for five of the turnovers. Three of his 
passes were intercepted in the second half, and he fumbled twice in the first 
half, the first coming on the game's first play. That turnover led to a 
one-yard run by Dent, with 7:48 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep had no turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when it didn't turn the ball over, Orange Lutheran had problems getting 
into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 On their second possession, the Lancers drove to the Montclair Prep four-yard 
line but after Holloway got down to the one on first and goal, they failed to 
score on three rushes. On fourth and goal, Holloway was stopped for no gain 
with 3:45 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't score then and that really hurt," Kunau said. "That was one 
possession where we really needed to score." 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano, who completed 10 of 14 passes for 180 yards in the first half, 
managed to complete only seven of 19 for 63 yards in the second half, most 
coming in the fourth quarter when the outcome was settled.

PREP SCHOOL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES; MONTCLAIR PREP ROUTS ORANGE LUTHERAN; 
DIVISION X: SEVEN TURNOVERS ARE LANCERS' UNDOING IN 53-13 LOSS. MOUNTIES WIN 
SECOND TITLE IN THREE YEARS.

 Montclair Prep forced seven turnovers and scored 34 consecutive second-half 
points to romp past Orange Lutheran, 53-13, and claim the Southern Section 
Division X championship Saturday in front of about 1,500 at Los Angeles Valley 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mountie defense picked off three of Lancer quarterback Joe Juliano's 
passes and recovered four of five Orange Lutheran fumbles. Two of those fumble 
recoveries came in the third quarter on kickoff returns, when Montclair Prep 
scored three touchdowns to blow open a close game. The Mounties' 53 points was 
a season-high; two weeks ago they scored 50 against Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Montclair Prep's (11-1) second Southern Section title in three years; 
they were the Division IX champs in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounties quarterback Darrel Dent rushed for 251 yards in eight carries and 
scored three times, and passed for 106 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Akil Anderson had 115 yards in 29 carries and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we've been hearing is we don't belong in this division," Mounties Coach 
George Gianinni said, referring to the fact Montclair Prep belongs to no league 
and was an at large selection by the section. "But until they started fumbling 
it was anybody's ball game. They did an excellent job preparing for us; they 
exploited our weaknesses on defense, and took away our basic game plan. They 
just couldn't stop Darrel." 
</P>
<P>
 "It became a motivating factor," said Dent, nephew of San Francisco 49ers' 
Richard Dent. "We didn't care what division they put us in, we just wanted to 
dominate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano tried to keep up with his counterpart, passing for 243 yards and two 
touchdowns. But he lost two of the fumbles, as did running back Che Holloway on 
the kickoff returns.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of the kids," Lancers Coach Jim Kunau said. "Darrel made huge 
plays and when you make six turnovers you're not going to beat a great team. 
But it's still been a season to remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Both coaches said before the game that stopping the other quarterback would be 
the key to winning. "We must pressure Juliano and contain him," Gianinni said. 
"We can't let him escape. If we can stop him, we can win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mounties' strategy worked. Montclair Prep took immediate control, with 13 
first-quarter points. After recovering a Juliano fumble at the Lancer 47 on the 
game's first play, Anderson scored on a one-yard dive. Then after stopping the 
Lancers outside the one-yard line on a fourth down run, the Mounties went 99 
yards in three plays -- 91 on a naked bootleg sprint by Dent. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran did not find a way to slow down Dent in the second quarter. 
The 6-1, 193-pound senior gained 196 yards on six carries in the half, 
including second touchdown run of eight yards.  
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran scored 90 seconds into the second quarter, when Juliano 
completed a three-yard pass to Aaron Kenney. And with 1:16 left to play in the 
half, Juliano trimmed the margin to 19-13 with a nine-yard touchdown pass to 
Dan Young, who finished with eight receptions for 125 yards.

ROUNDUP; MCGAUGHEY RETURNS TO SPARK ATASCADERO TO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ryan McGaughey, who was in a hospital bed a week earlier, rushed for 202 yards 
and two touchdowns in 32 carries, caught a touchdown pass of 13 yards and 
blocked an extra-point kick to lead Atascadero to a 42-20 victory over Ojai 
Nordhoff and its second consecutive Southern Section Division IX championship 
Saturday night in front of 6,000 at L.A. Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 McGaughey, who came into the game with 1,861 yards rushing, was hospitalized 
with meningitis during the Greyhounds' semifinal victory over Harvard-Westlake 
the previous week.A return for the final was in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He listened to the game on the radio last week while he was getting a spinal 
tap," Atascadero Coach Larry Welsh said of the 160-pound senior. "He said he 
was going to be here. And he came to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Josh Hawkins rushed for 135 yards and scored all three Nordhoff 
touchdowns. He scored on runs of 11 and seven yards and romped 85 yards with a 
short pass from Mike Gardia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Southern Section Division VII championship game: 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo Grande 16, Manhattan Beach Mira Costa 0 -- Sophomore Jimmy Pratt scored 
two touchdowns and led a productive Arroyo Grande rushing attack, as the Eagles 
gained all 227 of their yards on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt, who scored on runs of one and 29 yards, finished the game with 71 yards 
on 15 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the City 4-A championship game: 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar 38, Crenshaw 6 -- Durell Price, a junior running back, carried 19 times 
for 166 yards and three touchdowns to lead Sylmar in front of about 2,000 at El 
Camino College.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL CHAMPIONSHIPS / CITY SECTION 4-A DIVISION; UNBEATEN SYLMAR 
POUNDS OUT A TITLE 
</P>

<P>
 Durell Price's headache didn't go away, but then neither did he. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, a junior running back, carried 19 times for 166 yards and three 
touchdowns to lead Sylmar High to a 38-6 victory over Crenshaw in the City 
Section 4-A football championship game before an estimated 2,000 at El Camino 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, and even before the game, Price suffered from migraine 
headaches, but he said that there was no way he would sit out this game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had to suck up the pain and go out there," Price said. "I thought we 
would be in for a longer day, but we were able to come out and get a jump on 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 And Sylmar (14-0), ranked No. 5 in The Times' poll, kept on jumping.  
</P>
<P>
 Three minutes into the game, Price broke down the sideline for a 38-yard 
scoring run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told the line, 'Just give me a little crack and I'll get six (points),' " 
Price said. "But it was so big I couldn't have done anything else but score." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw (12-2) responded with a five-minute drive that culminated in a 
five-yard scoring run on fourth down by Brandon Seals. The extra point was 
missed, but 19th-ranked Crenshaw was down by only a point early in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, it seemed that Crenshaw had potential to wear down Sylmar. 
Seals and fellow running back Farrel Payton had gained more than 1,000 yards 
each this season.  
</P>
<P>
 But before the first quarter was over, the Spartans had a 21-6 lead. Davon 
Young scored on a 62-yard pass play from Greg Marquez and Price scored on a 
25-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw's only real break came with 40 seconds to play in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw had to punt, and Sylmar's Young decided to let the ball roll. But the 
ball bounce strangely, nicking Young on the ankle and Crenshaw recovered the 
ball at Sylmar's 13-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Payton ran off tackle for one yard, then Crenshaw called time out with 30 
seconds left. A pass play was called, but Sylmar was ready and chased Ricky 
Lumford toward the sideline. Lumford tried to throw across his body on the run, 
and Young intercepted to stop the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 A running team, Crenshaw was going to have to complete a few more passes or 
make some defensive stops. But they did neither. 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing they believed they could count on -- their running game -- was 
slowed to where both Seals and Payton finished with 58 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Payton said Crenshaw abandoned the running game too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were able to run on them, but we stopped running the ball," 
Payton said. "At halftime, it was still 21-6, so we had (24) minutes left. We 
didn't even talk about play selection, we just talked about playing hard." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sylmar scored 3 1/2 minutes into the second half, and Crenshaw decided 
that 20 minutes left in the game wasn't enough time to run the ball for three 
or four scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar stacked its defense to commit eight players to the line of scrimmage. 
When Crenshaw tried to run, there wasn't much room. When Crenshaw tried to 
pass, the rush was so quick that Lumford did not have time to throw. When he 
did have time, he didn't have open receivers.  
</P>
<P>
 Offensively, Sylmar kept running Price effectively and used up the clock. 
Price scored his third touchdown on the first play of the fourth quarter and 
helped set up Sylmar's late field goal for the final points.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION VII; ARROYO GRANDE WINS TITLE ON THE GROUND

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophomore Jimmy Pratt scored two touchdowns and led a productive Arroyo Grande 
ground attack as the Eagles shut out Mira Costa, 16-0, to win the Southern 
Section Division VII football title Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt, who scored on runs of one and 29 yards, finished with 71 yards in 15 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo Grande gained all of its 227 total yards on the ground. Andy Sowell had 
52 yards in 10 carries, Eric Schandel had 49 yards in eight carries and Jarrett 
Garife added 36 yards in seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa led in most offensive categories, producing 15 first downs to 10 
for Arroyo Grande and compiling a 239-227 edge in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mustang sophomore quarterback Keith Cooper struggled, throwing two 
interceptions, one of which set up an Arroyo Grande touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Thornberry returned an interception 26 yards to set up Pratt's second 
touchdown early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Arroyo Grande's two other scoring drives each consumed nearly six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles drove 70 yards in 17 plays to set up Pratt's one-yard run in the 
second quarter and marched 57 yards in 15 plays to set up a 20-yard field goal 
by Sal Rivas early in the fourth quarter. ERIC BURDICK

 Montclair Prep forced seven turnovers and scored 34 consecutive second-half 
points to defeat Orange Lutheran, 53-13, Saturday and win the Southern Section 
Division X championship before an estimated 1,500 at Los Angeles Valley 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mounties' defense intercepted three of Lancer quarterback Joe Juliano's 
passes and recovered four of the five Orange Lutheran fumbles to dominate the 
game. Two of those fumble recoveries came in the third quarter on kickoff 
returns, when Montclair Prep (11-1) scored three touchdowns to blow open a 
close game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Montclair's second Southern Section title in three years. The Mounties 
were the Division IX champions in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the Lancers (11-3) had played a perfect game, they would have 
probably lost because of the exploits of Montclair quarterback Darrel Dent, who 
rushed for 251 yards in eight carries and scored three times. He also passed 
for 106 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Akil Anderson had to work all night for his 115 yards in 29 carries, 
but he did score two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we've been hearing is we don't belong in this division," Montclair Prep 
Coach George Gianinni said, referring to the fact Montclair Prep belongs to no 
league and was an at-large selection. "But until they started fumbling, it was 
anybody's ballgame. They did an excellent job preparing for us; they exploited 
our weaknesses on defense, and took away our basic game plan. They just 
couldn't stop Darrel." 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano tried to keep up with his counterpart, passing for 243 yards and two 
touchdowns. But he lost two of the fumbles -- as did running back Che Holloway 
on the kickoff returns -- and those mistakes did as much to wipe out Orange 
Lutheran's hopes for a first title as Dent and Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of the kids," said Lancer Coach Jim Kunau. "Darrel made huge 
plays and when you make six turnovers you're not going to beat a great team. 
But it's still been a season to remember."

 Ryan McGaughey, who was in a hospital bed a week earlier, rushed for 202 yards 
and two touchdowns in 32 carries, caught a touchdown pass of 13 yards and 
blocked an extra-point kick to lead Atascadero to a 42-20 victory over Ojai 
Nordhoff and its second consecutive Southern Section Division IX championship 
Saturday night before 6,000 at L.A. Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 McGaughey, who came into the game with 1,861 yards rushing, was hospitalized 
with meningitis during the Greyhounds' semifinal victory over Harvard-Westlake 
the previous week. A return for the final was in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He listened to the game on the radio last week while he was getting a spinal 
tap," Atascadero Coach Larry Welsh said of the 160-pound senior. "He said he 
was going to be here. And he came to play." 
</P>
<P>
 He looked like he came out of the hospital with new legs as he rushed for 61 
yards in six carries and scored on a 13-yard swing pass from Andrew McCrory in 
the Greyhounds' opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was off to the races for Atascadero (10-4), which led, 20-7, after 
McGaughey dived in from one-yard out with 1:48 left before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was beautiful," McGaughey said. "Everyone just jelled." 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, Norhdoff (10-4) appeared to be a team of destiny, beating 
top-seeded Santa Ynez, 30-19, to reach a section championship game for the 
first time in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rangers looked sluggish and out of step against the quick, elusive 
McGaughey and the big offensive and defensive lines of Atascadero. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Josh Hawkins rushed for 135 yards and scored all three Nordhoff 
touchdowns. He scored on runs of 11 and seven yards and ran 85 yards with a 
short pass from Mike Gardia. 
</P>
<P>
 His combined rushing and receiving yards accounted for 245 of Nordhoff's 255 
yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a little down," Hawkins said. "We could have played better. We were 
flat and we couldn't make anything happen."

ENGILMAN FINDS SUCCESS AS PLAYWRIGHT; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: SYLMAR FOLLOWS HIS 
SCRIPT IN BEATING CRENSHAW FOR THE CITY 4-A TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sylmar High football Coach Jeff Engilman couldn't have scripted the execution 
of his offense any better than in the first quarter of Saturday's City Section 
4-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Engilman did write the script. 
</P>
<P>
 Using plays planned days in advance and helped by timely audibles by 
quarterback Greg Marquez, the Spartans scored three touchdowns on their first 
six offensive plays, establishing the pace in what became a 38-6 rout of 
Crenshaw at El Camino College for Sylmar's second title in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, Sylmar's offense relied on straight-ahead running 
between the tackles, but Engilman and Marquez used play-action passes, 
misdirection and wide-open receivers to make the script a horror show for 
Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sylmar's first possession, Crenshaw employed a nine-man defensive front to 
contain tailback Durell Price. It was exactly the defense Engilman expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past we haven't been able to throw the ball well," Engilman said. "We 
had to show we could throw and make them react. It's a lot easier for Durell to 
run with seven men on the line instead of nine." 
</P>
<P>
 The script called for a play-action pass to take the pressure off Price, who 
was suffering from flu-like symptoms and headaches that caused him to miss two 
days of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars were fooled by the fake and Marquez found fullback Thomas Toledo 
open for a 22-yard gain to midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 With Crenshaw still showing the nine-man front, Marquez passed again, this 
time to receiver Mike Cervantes for a 12-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good, loose practice on Thursday and I felt like I was throwing well 
going into the game," Marquez said. "We wanted to show right off they couldn't 
concentrate just on Durell." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw reduced its nine-man front to seven. The Spartans responded with a 
handoff to Price, who broke a tackle and ran 38 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sylmar's next possession, receiver Davon Young slipped behind the Cougar 
secondary, caught Marquez's pass on the run and raced down the sideline for a 
62-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watched so much film on Crenshaw, we were so prepared, it seemed like we 
knew exactly what to do," Young said. "I still was a little surprised it was 
working so well." 
</P>
<P>
 After Sylmar recovered a squib kick, a reverse by Young gained seven yards and 
Price ran 25 yards for a touchdown when the Spartan line cleared the right side 
of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got outside and I couldn't help but score, there was nobody there," 
Price said. "Our line was just blowing them off the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar gained 166 yards on the six plays, established a 21-6 lead and sent the 
Crenshaw coaches into panic. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Cougars' next possession, quarterback Ricky Lumford badly misfired on 
two long passes. Lumford completed just one of 11 and kept Crenshaw from 
establishing its offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw slowed Sylmar for the rest of the half but the Spartans went back to 
the script for the final act that finished Crenshaw's hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez used the play-action pass utilized on the first play of the game for a 
13-yard touchdown to tight end Galdino Cortes, extending the lead to 28-6 early 
in the third quarter. The Cougars, fooled again on the run fake, didn't have a 
defender within 10 yards of Cortes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little shocking that we rolled over them like we did," Marquez said. 
"We were confident because we prepared not just during the week but for the 
past five months."

 Carly Funicello's six-foot turnaround jump shot with 41 seconds left in 
overtime gave Alemany High a 53-52 victory over Buena in the championship game 
of the Buena tournament Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Funicello, the tournament's most valuable player, had 20 points and 10 
rebounds for the Indians (4-0), the state's second-ranked team. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Samantha Rigley scored 12 points, while Kelly McKay added 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena, which lost its tournament for only the second time in 18 years, was 
paced by Kori Sebek's 19 points. Guard Eboni Conley added 10 for the 
fifth-ranked Bulldogs (2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians had a chance to win it in regulation, when Rigley was fouled with 
six seconds left and the score tied, 49-49. However, Rigley missed her first 
free throw in seven attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs had two possessions after Funicello's overtime winner. However, 
both times Buena missed its shots and both times Funicello rebounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park 52, Hart 37 -- Jann Thorpe had 13 points and eight rebounds to 
lead Newbury Park (6-1) to third place. Teammate Julie Wastell added 11 points

HIGH SCHOOL CROSS-COUNTRY / NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS; ARMS BETRAY CAMARILLO'S 
HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the previous two cross-country meets, his legs had felt dead during the 
final stages of the race. Saturday, it was Eleazar Hernandez's arms that 
couldn't propel him any faster in the Foot Locker national championships at 
Morley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo High senior was one of five runners in contention for the title 
with 800 meters remaining, but as he began his ascent on the final hill, his 
arms lacked the snap that usually drives him up hills as fast as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I hit that hill, my arms were just really tired," Hernandez said. "I 
couldn't do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Hernandez held on to place fifth with a time of 15 minutes 9.5 
seconds over a course that was 60-70 yards short of 5,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Arce of Palmdale passed three runners in the final 200 meters to 
finish seventh in 15:11.8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a really good kick, but I just didn't feel as good as I had hoped," 
Arce said. "With all the turns and the surging going on, I couldn't get 
comfortable. I just never got into a good rhythm." 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, Hernandez and Brett Strahan of Hart, who placed third, fourth and fifth 
in the West regional in Fresno on Dec. 3, held down the 15th-17th positions 
during a 4:47 opening mile but became spread out after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was in fifth at the two-mile mark (9:50) with Arce 10th at 9:53 and 
Strahan 20th and tiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, Hernandez joined Matt Downin of the Pinkerton Academy in 
Hampstead, N.H.; John Mortimer of Londonderry, N.H.; Brandon Leslie of Gallup, 
N.M.; and Tim Broe of East Peoria, Ill., in the lead pack. Those five ran 
together until the final hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie opened a five-meter lead on Mortimer and Downin near the top of the 
hill, but the New Hampshire duo passed him on the descent. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-described best friends raced stride for stride for the next 500 
meters before Downin pulled away in the final 100 to clock 14:58.3. Mortimer 
was second in 15:03.1 with Leslie third at 15:06.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan finished 26th in 15:45.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Skieresz of Agoura and Elaine Canchola of Nordhoff were both shooting for 
top-10 finishes in the girls' race but fell short of their goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz finished 14th in 17:43.6 and freshman Canchola placed 19th in 
17:57.9. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Rosa sophomore Julia Stamps was a runaway winner in 16:41.9. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz went out conservatively in hopes of working her way up through the 
pack as she had in 1992 when she finished third, but she never got higher than 
12th. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could see a group of girls ahead of me (at two miles)," Skieresz said. "But 
I couldn't quite catch them. My legs just felt very flat." 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola, the runner-up in the West regional, was among the top 10 runners 
after the first mile, but she dropped to 17th at two miles before finishing 
19th.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / STEVE ELLING: ANTELOPES' TITLE-GAME PERFORMANCE WAS ONE FROM 
THE HEART 
</P>

<P>
 Talk about mood swings. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-three weeks ago, Caleb Smith was the last person to leave the football 
field at Antelope Valley High. Heck, they even turned out the stadium lights on 
the poor guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there he stood, under a goal post, ruminating on the Antelopes' emotional 
15-11 loss to Mater Dei in the Southern Section semifinals. Nobody was left in 
the stadium but Smith and a custodian. Smith couldn't let go. A nagging notion 
kept caroming around in his noggin as he tearfully stared into the sparkling 
desert sky. 
</P>
<P>
 We should be good in '94, but will we be this good? Will we make it this far? 
I sure hope so.  
</P>
<P>
 And when you wish upon a star. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley's 36-15 upset of Hart in the Division II championship game 
Friday night was as one-sided as it was shocking. At jam-packed College of the 
Canyons, a stadium mothballed for much of the season because of earthquake 
damage, this was another hefty jolt for the Richter scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Hart (13-1) entered not only unbeaten but unbowed, having scored 
more than 50 points in two preceding playoff victories. It was over so quickly, 
only one sound was audible on Hart's half of the stadium: Gasp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians were dispatched efficiently and expediently. Unbelievably, Hart 
committed five turnovers and trailed by 29 points at the half -- precisely the 
team's average margin of victory over the first 12 games. No previous opponent 
had scored more than 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody had to put pressure on (quarterback Steve McKeon)," Antelope Valley 
Coach Brent Newcomb said. "Or they'll rain down on you all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley issued thunder from asunder in the form of Smith and defensive 
linemen Chad Shrout, senior co-captains who played like Smith and Wesson in 
accounting for seven sacks and much of the team's early lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the kid with the Biblical first name, was whooping and hollering like a 
hellion. Shrout was busting heads in such a frenzy that he nearly knocked 
himself cold. 
</P>
<P>
 In no place was Antelope Valley seemingly more undermanned than on its 
defensive front. Throw Hart's massive offensive line in a hot tub and they'd 
issue flash-flood warnings throughout the Santa Clarita Valley. With an average 
size of 6 feet 4 and 266 pounds, the front five were immovable -- but hardly 
impermeable, as it turned out. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley (11-2) threw a few subtle wrinkles at Hart. Seconds before the 
snap, the defensive line would shift slightly and line up in the gaps. The 
first step was critical as each player tried different slants and angles. Hart 
ballcarriers were relentlessly pressured in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our speed really helped," Smith said. "When their linemen got their 
hands on you, they did a good job. But sometimes, we could get around the 
corner or get inside on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shrout: "It was tough getting around those big guys. But we changed 
things up and used our speed to outmaneuver 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith (6-4, 220) looked like a latter-day Fred Dryer. Shrout (6-2, 235) is 
built more like Fred Flintstone. McKeon, hopelessly behind from the first 
quarter on, was the quarry. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he had a moment to throw, McKeon was ceaselessly pounded. Antelope 
Valley had more delivery sacks than a take-out restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the Antelopes' inability to throw -- how the heck did they manage 
a 29-0 halftime lead without completing a pass? -- it was crucial for them to 
score first. Otherwise, Hart's quick-strike offense might have hopelessly 
buried them. Leave it to Smith and Shrout, which rhymes with twist and shout, a 
theme played over and over and over in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart running back Ted Iacenda fumbled twice before halftime. In each instance, 
Smith pounced on the ball and curled around it in the fetal position. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart was in a futile position, already down, 16-0, with 9 minutes 14 seconds 
left in the half. Shrout, an all-state kicker who thumped field goals of 45, 28 
and 43 yards, might have added another sack or two had he not missed a series 
in the second half. After making a vicious third-quarter tackle, he wobbled to 
the sideline, complaining that he couldn't see straight. Hart could relate. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrout briefly had trouble finding his chin strap. Assistant coach James 
Richards pulled Shrout aside, helped yank off his helmet and administered the 
ol' concussion test. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards: What day is it? 
</P>
<P>
 Shrout: Uh, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards: Who are we playing? 
</P>
<P>
 Shrout: Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards: What's your phone number? 
</P>
<P>
 Shrout: Two, three . . . Oh, come on! 
</P>
<P>
 The pair broke out laughing. By that point, this was not an isolated response. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith popped his lid, too. Moments after the final gun sounded, Smith tossed 
his helmet to the ground and joined the raucous rugby scrum at midfield. Five 
minutes later, he hadn't located it and wasn't the least concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Smith played in the playoff loss to Mater Dei with a shattered bone 
in his thumb. A few weeks later, two pins were surgically inserted to mend the 
break. A nasty scar remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Broken hearted, broken thumb. . . . What a different ending in '94. He 
couldn't begin to put his finger on the difference in terms of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's awe-inspiring," said Smith, the Golden League's lineman of the year. "I 
can't even speak right now. I don't have the words." 
</P>
<P>
 Shrout, however, had plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, a year, a game, a play, goes exactly the way you want it," said 
Shrout, whose every move was watched by a scout from Notre Dame. "This year was 
that way for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the time we put in, the running, the sweat. We deserved this."

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FINALS; ATASCADERO'S MCGAUGHEY LEAPS OUT OF BED, 42-30; 
SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION IX: HE HAS 202 YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS AS 
GREYHOUNDS DOWN NORDHOFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Those relentless Nordhoff Rangers finally relented. 
</P>
<P>
 Atascadero running back Ryan McGaughey, who lay in a hospital bed a week 
earlier, returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-9, 160-pound senior rushed for 202 yards and two touchdowns in 32 
carries, caught a touchdown pass of 13 yards and blocked an extra-point attempt 
to lead Atascadero to a 42-20 victory and its second consecutive Southern 
Section Division IX championship Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 McGaughey, who entered with 1,861 yards rushing, was hospitalized with viral 
meningitis during the Greyhounds' semifinal victory over Harvard-Westlake the 
previous week. A return for the final was in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He listened to the game on the radio last week while he was getting a spinal 
tap," Atascadero Coach Larry Welsh said. "He said he was going to be here. And 
he came to play." 
</P>
<P>
 He looked like he came out of the hospital with new legs as he rushed for 61 
yards in six carries and scored on a 13-yard swing pass from Andrew McCrory in 
the Greyhounds' opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was off to the races for Atascadero (10-4), which led, 20-7, after 
McGaughey's one-yard dive with 1:48 left before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff linebacker Russell Farrar threw him to the turf on the previous play 
on third and goal from the two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGaughey wouldn't be denied. On fourth down, he leaped over the pile at 
the line of scrimmage and leaned over the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was beautiful," McGaughey said. "Everyone just jelled." 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, Nordhoff (10-4) appeared to be a team of destiny by beating 
top-seeded Santa Ynez, 30-19, to reach a section championship game for the 
first time in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rangers looked sluggish and out of step against the quick, elusive 
McGaughey and the big offensive and defensive lines of Atascadero. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Josh Hawkins rushed for 135 yards and scored all three Nordhoff 
touchdowns. He scored on runs of 11 and seven yards and romped 85 yards with a 
short pass from Mike Gardia. His combined rushing and receiving yards accounted 
for 245 of Nordhoff's 255 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a little down," Hawkins said. "We could have played better. We were 
flat and we couldn't make anything happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff took a 7-6 lead on Hawkins' 11-yard sweep in the first quarter. But 
the lead was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Five plays later, Jordan Cunningham ran 51 yards for a score on a reverse 
pitch. Then came McGaughey's one-yard plunge and a one-yard quarterback sneak 
by McCrory to make it 28-7 early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Atascadero, which piled up 414 yards, 304 on the ground, could do no wrong. 
After Hawkins and McGaughey traded touchdowns, McCrory, on fourth and 11, threw 
into double coverage. Josh Brown leaped and caught the pass at the back of the 
end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat ended a seven-game winning streak by Nordhoff, which was 3-3 and 
struggling before beginning its march to the final.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FINALS; MONTCLAIR PREP'S DENT WRECKS ORANGE LUTHERAN; 
SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION X: QUARTERBACK RUSHES FOR 265 YARDS, SCORES THREE 
TIMES IN 53-13 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 Many dream of ending their high school careers this way but Darrel Dent now 
knows what it feels like. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior quarterback ran for 265 yards and three touchdowns and passed for 
another to lead Montclair Prep to a 53-13 victory over Orange Lutheran in the 
Southern Section Division X championship game Saturday night at Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach (George Giannini) wanted me to go out in fashion," Dent said. "He said 
to go out in style." 
</P>
<P>
 Dent, who had eight carries, was downright dapper in leading the Mounties 
(11-1) to their second section title in three seasons and third since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored on runs of 91, eight and 42 yards and had a 47-yard touchdown pass 
play as Orange Lutheran (11-3) keyed on stellar running back Akil Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we motioned our backs, they shifted everyone to that side and we had the 
bootleg open for Darrel," Giannini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who had gained 871 yards in the previous three playoff games, still 
rushed for 116 yards in 30 carries and scored twice, including a one-yard run 
in the third quarter when the Mounties scored 20 unanswered points after 
leading, 19-13, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mounties took advantage of fumbles by Orange Lutheran's Che Holloway on 
back-to-back kickoff returns to blow the game open in the third quarter. They 
turned both turnovers into scores, the first on the run by Anderson and moments 
later on a four-yard run by Demetrius Green, who also scored in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Those came after Dent had connected with wide receiver Kenny Peffer on a 
47-yard pass play early in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told us (at halftime) to go out there and maintain our level of 
consistency and we would be all right," Dent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran had seven turnovers, including three passes thrown by 
quarterback Joe Juliano that were intercepted by Henry Bell, Langston Woodberry 
and Mark Zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mounties got a break right at the start and capitalized on it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the game's first offensive play, Juliano fumbled the snap and linebacker 
Will Tuccio recovered at the Lancer 47-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep took eight plays to score, with Anderson capping it with a 
one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers marched 67 yards in six plays on the ensuing possession, but 
failed in three attempts to to score from the Montclair Prep one-yard line.  
</P>
<P>
 On third and goal from the one, Tuccio and safety Kenny Peffer stopped 
Juliano, and Woodberry stopped Holloway on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mounties struck quickly after that on a 91-yard sprint along the left 
sideline by Dent for a 13-0 advantage late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran pulled to within 13-7 early in the second quarter on a 
three-yard pass from Juliano to tight end Aaron Kenney. 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano was 17 of 33 for 243 yards and two touchdowns.

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in four years, it won't be Marshall and Youngstown State 
playing for the NCAA Division I-AA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it will be Boise State and defending champion Youngstown State 
meeting next Saturday at Huntington, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall (12-2), after taking a 17-0 lead in the first half, gave up two 
fourth-quarter touchdowns and lost to Boise State, 28-24, in a semifinal game 
at Boise, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other semifinal, Youngstown defeated Montana, 28-9, at Youngstown, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Boise State (13-1) will make its first championship game appearance since 
1980, when it won the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading Youngstown (13-0-1) over Montana (11-3) was Shawn Patton, who rushed 
for 142 yards in 26 carries and scored two touchdowns. Youngstown State beat 
Marshall for the title in 1991 and '93. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 North Alabama and Albion won titles in NCAA Divisions II and III, and 
Northeastern State (Okla.) won the NAIA Division I championship. 
</P>
<P>
 North Alabama became only the third team to win consecutive Division II 
championships, relying on its "Purple Swarm" defense to preserve a 16-10 
victory over Texas A&M Kingsville. 
</P>
<P>
 Albion took the Division III title, beating Washington & Jefferson, 38-15. 
</P>
<P>
 In the NAIA championship, Northeastern State defeated Arkansas Pine Bluff,

 Given Chris McCarron's history in the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Cup, Savinio 
should be paid special attention in today's 15th running of the Grade I stake. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron has won three in a row and four of the last five runnings of the 1 
1/2-mile race. He has six victories overall, beginning with John Henry in 1983. 
His other victories have come with Alphabatim (1984), Frankly Perfect (1989), 
Miss Alleged (1991), Bien Bien (1992) and Fraise (1993). 
</P>
<P>
 The Turf Cup has attracted 11 entrants. Savinio, a 4-year-old gelded son of 
The Minstrel, is the co-third choice at 4-1 after an easy 4 1/2-length victory 
in the closing-day Carleton F. Burke Handicap at Oak Tree. Before that, he was 
second to Romarin, who won the recent Hollywood Mile, and second to 
multiple-stakes winner Earl Of Barking. 
</P>
<P>
 More relaxed than he was earlier in his career, Savinio worked a mile in 1:37 
on Nov. 25 at Santa Anita, and the main question with him, as well as with 
several others in the race, is how will he handle the 1 1/2 miles? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the turning point for Savinio was gelding him," trainer Walter 
Greenman said. "We did that about a year ago and he's seemed to relax more, 
been able to rate better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris rated him perfectly last time and the horse really exploded once he was 
asked to run. I'm hoping the same kind of effort can win the Turf Cup. The only 
question is the distance." 
</P>
<P>
 Dare And Go, who had much trouble when second in the Hollywood Derby, is the 
5-2 favorite for the Turf Cup, and distance shouldn't be a problem for him. He 
was third, beaten a length, going 1 5/16 miles in France, and the horse that 
beat him was Breeders' Cup Turf winner Tikkanen. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Stevens, who is seeking his first victory in this race, will ride for 
trainer Richard Mandella. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 furlongs are a concern for River Flyer, the 7-2 second choice. The 
3-year-old son of Riverman has developed into a monster for trainer David 
Hofmans, rattling off four successive victories on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, he overcame a slow start and an extremely wide first turn to 
win the Hollywood Derby by nearly two lengths. But that race was only 1 1/8 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question mark is the added distance," Hofmans said. "Some horses can run 
1 1/8 miles, some horses can run 1 1/4 miles, but they can't go 1 1/2 miles. It 
will just be interesting to see if he can relax a little bit on the front end 
and finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Antley will again be aboard River Flyer, who will be trying to make it 
consecutive stakes victories at Hollywood Park for John and Betty Mabee's 
Golden Eagle Farm. Best Pal took the Native Diver a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 From the rail out, the rest of the Turf Cup field: Jackdidi (Eddie 
Delahoussaye, 15-1), Southern Wish (Alex Solis, 4-1), Square Cut (Fernando 
Valenzuela, 20-1), Truly A Dream (David Flores, 20-1), Regency (Kent 
Desormeaux, 20-1), Frenchpark (Corey Black, 20-1), Lindon Lime (Shane Sellers, 
10-1) and Mashaallah (Laffit Pincay, 20-1). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Santa Anita's Strub Series for 4-year-olds of 1995 is getting more attractive 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat and Concern, the first two finishers in the Breeders' Cup Classic, 
are pointing for the last two legs of the Series -- the San Fernando and Strub 
-- and some of their competition will be provided by two colts who proved they 
are healthy again this past week at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after Strodes Creek made a successful return in the J.O. Tobin, 
favored Wekiva Springs beat his elders in the $108,750 Vernon O. Underwood 
Breeders' Cup Stakes Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly bet down to even money in his first start since Sept. 11, the 
gray son of Blushing Groom was outrun early, then ran down 27-1 shot Gundaghia 
inside the final sixteenth to win by 1 1/2 lengths in 1:08 1/5. Cardmania, the 
3-1 second choice, got up to beat Gundaghia a nose for the place. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the fifth victory in six starts for Wekiva Springs, who is owned by 
Don Dizney and Jim English and trained by Bob Hess. Bothered by quarter cracks 
earlier in his career, the Florida-bred cruised home by six lengths in 1:08 1/5 
on Sept. 11 at Del Mar, but then came down with a stomach virus. 
</P>
<P>
 That quashed his Breeders' Cup plans and now his connections hope he's able to 
stay healthy next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only doubt was his ability to beat top quality horses like this 
sprinting," Hess said. "(Six furlongs) is not his distance. I was shocked (at 
the short price). Cardmania is a superstar and, in my opinion, he deserved to 
be favored." 
</P>
<P>
 Polar Route was fourth, then came Gotta Groove, who set the pace through the 
first five furlongs, Demaloot Demashoot, Lost Pan, Concept Win and Saratoga 
Gambler. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 All starters in the Turf Cup will carry 126 pounds except for the 3-year-olds 
Dare And Go and River Flyer, who will carry 122, and the filly Truly A Dream, 
who will carry 119. . . . American Day, a half-brother to Best Pal, was 
impressive breaking his maiden in Saturday's sixth race. Owned by Golden Eagle 
Farm, trained by Richard Mandella and ridden by Kent Desormeaux, the 3-2 second 
choice won by 13 lengths in 1:41 4/5 for the 1 1/16 miles on turf. . . . Stuka, 
who backed into a victory in the Santa Anita Handicap after the controversial 
disqualification of The Wicked North, has been retired and will stand at stud 
at The Vinery in Midway, Ky. Stuka finished with five wins, a second and three 
thirds in 17 starts and earnings of $915,675 for owner Allen Paulson and 
trainer Gary Jones. . . . Marvin's Faith won the $100,000 Bay Meadows Derby 
Saturday, beating longshot Western Trader. Favored Fadeyev was unplaced.

PREP CROSS-COUNTRY / NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS; ESPERANZA'S PUGMIRE FINISHES 9TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, she was an 800-meter specialist in track. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she moved up to the 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing ninth in the Foot Locker national cross-country championships 
Saturday at Morley Field, Courtney Pugmire of Esperanza might focus her 
attention on the 3,200 in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 It wouldn't be a bad choice, considering how well she has performed this fall 
at distances of three miles and 5,000 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really had no goal coming into this meet," Pugmire said after running 17 
minutes 31.4 seconds over a course that was 60 to 70 yards short of 5,000 
meters. "I was just excited to be here running against this type of 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pugmire won the Southern Section Division I title Nov. 19 and placed 
second in the State Division I final the next week, she did not envision 
herself competing in the national championships until she placed fourth in the 
West regional Dec. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was going to take a shot at making the team in the West regional, 
but I didn't expect to qualify," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she did, she didn't waste the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some runners in Pugmire's position might have been content with simply making 
it to nationals, but Pugmire saw it as no-lose situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't a lot of pressure on me because I didn't expect to be here and 
no one expected me to win," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pugmire was in 13th place after the first mile before moving into eighth at 
two miles. She fell back to 11th at 2 1/2 miles, but passed two runners in the 
final 600 meters and barely missed a third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so close to those girls that I just told myself to dig down as deep as 
I could and go after them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park freshman Heather Garritson finished a disappointing 23rd in 
18:09.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Garritson, the State Division III champion, was in 28th place after a mile 
before moving into 26th at two miles and 25th at 2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Rosa sophomore Julie Stamps won easily. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending State champion in the 3,200 meters finished in 16:41.9, more 
than 20 seconds ahead of runner-up Sally Glynn (17:12.1) of Johnson High in 
Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Erin Davis of Saratoga Springs (N.Y.) held second place for 
most of the race before finishing fourth in 17:18.1.

HOMETOWN JINGLES; BUY LOCALLY, STRAPPED O.C. CITIES SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This South County city will use a light touch when its shop-near-home campaign 
debuts next month, but the message will be clear: Residents who buy their gas, 
groceries and holiday gifts in nearby cities are economic traitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop-where-you-live campaigns historically have been little more than thinly 
disguised chamber of commerce gambits designed to drum up hometown support for 
local merchants during the important holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the unprecedented bond crisis threatened to force service cuts at 
cash-strapped cities, municipal officials were embracing shop-where-you-live 
campaigns as a painless way to raise sales tax receipts to pay for police, 
safety and recreation programs, among other services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's critical now," said Mary Kluver, a banker and president of the Laguna 
Niguel Chamber of Commerce, which is sponsoring the shopping campaign. "Nobody 
knows right now what the implications are (of the bankruptcy debacle) but this 
campaign is a way to put dollars into the city budget immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Local governments view today's shop-near-home campaigns as a way to plug sales 
tax "leakage" -- when residents bypass hometown merchants in favor of 
out-of-town businesses. Leakage is most harmful during the holiday season, when 
the average retail operation rings up 19% of its annual sales. Laguna Niguel, 
for example, generates nearly $800,000 of its annual $3.8 million in revenue in 
the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts are increasingly attractive because, at a time when revenue 
sources are drying up, shop-near-home programs promise increased municipal 
revenue at no additional cost to taxpayers. Several cities have implemented 
them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Phoenix council members responded to a four-year drop in sales tax receipts 
by going on television to remind residents that out-of-town holiday shopping 
trips result in less funding for police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 * El Cajon used newspaper advertisements that detailed how much each city 
department receives when a shopper dropped $100 at a local clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cupertino, Calif., hopes to bolster sales tax receipts by routing any 
increase in excess of last year's total to a popular local library branch. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laguna Niguel's upcoming shop-near-home campaign will tie its nearly 
$4-million sales tax receipts directly to cops on the beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to let people know that, in Laguna Niguel . . . shops equal 
cops," City Manager Tim Casey said. "We're making a direct connection between 
sales tax revenue as our most important General Fund revenue source and public 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
 That's an easy case to make because Laguna Niguel's current sales tax receipts 
are equal to the $3.8-million bill for police services provided by the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department. More than 30 Sheriff's Department personnel work 
in Laguna Niguel, and about a dozen squad cars patrol within the city's 
boundaries. The upcoming 13-week, shop-near-home campaign will tell the city's 
54,100 residents that they can further improve the quality of their lives by 
shopping where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign is being funded in part by a $35,000 city grant. But most of the 
$250,000 marketing and advertising campaign will be paid for by local 
businesses. It will include heavy newspaper, television and radio advertising 
as well as banners and a contest to draw consumers into participating stores.  
</P>
<P>
 The campaign will begin after the holiday season, partly because Laguna Niguel 
lacks a major regional mall for holiday shoppers. And merchants agree that they 
could use help drumming up business in the traditionally slow first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to do something that was above what every other city seemed to be 
doing," said Laguna Niguel Chamber of Commerce President Mary Kluver, who is 
manager of the Monarch Beach branch of Mariners Bank. "We didn't want some 
bumper sticker or slogan. We really want to make people aware that where they 
shop is important to their city." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Laguna Niguel's affluent residents accounted for about 2% of 
Orange County's overall 2.6-million population -- but the city was collecting 
just 1% of countywide tax receipts. Sales tax receipts were hurt by the fact 
that the relatively young community lacked stores, theaters and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Laguna Niguel added warehouse stores, major discounters and theaters, 
annual sales tax receipts rose to $3.8 million from $2 million. There's still 
plenty of room for improvement, though, because residents still are spending an 
estimated $400 million, according to a city estimate, on out-of-town goods and 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent poll showed that 70% of Laguna Niguel residents said they would be 
willing to change their shopping habits if it would help maintain or improve 
safety services. City officials agreed, however, that it's still up to hometown 
retailers to match the prices, quality and service available elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 While city officials are eager to boost tax receipts, few shoppers seem to 
know where their taxes go. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I'd never considered before," said Stacey Nunz, a 12-year 
Mission Viejo resident who has patronized many out-of-town shops. "I used to 
just head off to wherever it was convenient to shop." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunz changed her shopping patterns after reading a letter that Mission Viejo's 
Economic Development Commission recently mailed to 80,000 households. The 
letter reminded residents that part of the sales tax levied on holiday gifts 
returns in the form of improved city services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you purchase something as large as a car or as small as a teddy bear, 
you can feel good knowing you are making our community an even better place to 
live," wrote Ben Meharg, chairman of Mission Viejo's Economic Development 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Meharg's letter sat well with Nunz.  
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought, here's another piece of junk mail, but it turned out to 
be one of the most intelligent, well-penned of letters," Nunz said. "In effect, 
they were courteously reminding me to do something that will benefit me, my 
family and neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunz was an easy sell, but marketing experts agree that it will take longer to 
change most shoppers' habits. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cupertino agreed earlier this year to use sales tax receipts to support a 
cash-strapped library, civic and business leaders thought the campaign would 
have an immediate impact among residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales during the first quarter, the most recent data available, were 
generating less tax revenue than a year ago, leading officials to acknowledge 
that it will take time to change people's patterns. "We're realizing that 
shopping habits do not change overnight," said Greg Sellers, whose 
Cupertino-based marketing company helped design the campaign. "The message 
we're getting is that it takes a lot longer for this kind of thing to sink in." 
</P>
<P>
 While shop-near-home campaigns aren't a quick fix, they're appealing tools for 
cash-strapped cities with few available alternatives to replace rapidly 
shrinking sources of federal and state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all trying to stem retail sales tax leakage," agreed John Statton, 
executive director of the Cupertino Chamber of Commerce, which supported the 
use of sales tax receipts to help revitalize the local county library branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipalities also are competing with each other for new retail development. 
"We all want those sales tax dollars," Statton said of the prospect of new 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo's sales tax receipts are expected to rise noticeably during the 
holiday season thanks to sales at Mission Viejo Freeway Center, a new shopping 
center near Interstate 5 that's home to Comp USA, Borders Books and Music, and 
Toys R Us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those retailers rushed to open their stores before Thanksgiving because they 
know so much of their annual sales come during the Christmas season," Mission 
Viejo Deputy City Treasurer Josephine Julian said. "Well, it's also very 
important to the city to have them open before Thanksgiving. We're already 
penciling in those anticipated revenues in the next budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo credits an ongoing shop-near-home campaign for helping to boost 
sales tax receipts by 17% to $7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, up 
from $6 million a year earlier. Sales tax receipts account for about a quarter 
of the city's $27-million operating budget.  
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 13, a law that requires two-thirds vote in a general election to 
increase property taxes, is pushing California municipalities to fight for 
sales tax receipts, but other states are feeling the pinch as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix cited slumping sales tax receipts last year when it abandoned a 
longstanding policy that prohibited the use of city tax dollars to provide 
financial incentives for retail redevelopment projects. But neighboring 
municipalities had already used aggressive subsidies to ring Phoenix with new, 
attractive shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony in all of this is that, the way the tax structure works, retail 
development doesn't increase the economic pie in the community as a whole the 
way, say, a manufacturing plant does when it moves here from California," said 
Dave Krietor, director of the Phoenix Community and Economic Development 
Department. "We're all forced to compete with each other for our parochial 
needs." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a competition that continues long after the last holiday wreath is taken 
down because consumers spend billions of dollars each year during daily 
shopping trips for milk, bread and gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Those gallons of milk add up, said Casey, who each year drafts a list of the 
top 20 sales tax generators in Laguna Niguel. The list "really opens your 
eyes," Casey said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You've got your real obvious ones, the HomeBase and (Price Costco), but 
you've also got gas stations and drug stores," Casey said. "It's the little 
things. . . . if you fill your gas tank before you leave town, you can have a 
dramatic impact on your local tax base."

JAMES FLANIGAN: OVER THE LONG HAUL, AIRLINES ARE A VITAL BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How rapid is change in business today? A reported comment questioning whether 
the airlines -- one of the leading industries of the 20th Century -- could ever 
really be a good, substantial business caused airline stocks to sink last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Noted investor Warren Buffett later denied he made such a comment, but the 
point is that Wall Street didn't need to check. Professional investors agreed 
with the sentiment that the airlines had become a low-profit, commodity 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 All the shining projections of growth in vacation and business travel mean 
little in the market these days. Even the competitive success of the U.S.-based 
airlines, American, United and Delta in international markets cuts no ice. 
</P>
<P>
 And such pessimism seemed to be confirmed last Thursday, when Southwest 
Airlines, the efficient, competitive company that had become the darling of 
Wall Street and of thrifty passengers, said that profits would be off sharply 
in the fourth quarter. Southwest's stock price, already down this year to $20 a 
share from $39, fell 15% on that day. The stock closed Friday at $17.25 a share 
on the New York Stock Exchange, up 12.5 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, said Southwest, was renewed fare war competition, from United's 
cut-price shuttle in California and from aggressive new airlines entering the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Fare wars, even in a holiday season with passenger traffic growing almost 5% 
this year? Does the airline business, indeed, make any sense? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is yes, but fasten your seat belts. It is a wildly active business 
these days, full of innovation and entrepreneurship but still full of promise 
for some of the traditional big lines. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand how energetic the business is these days, look at Wall Street's 
newest darling, ValuJet Airlines. Founded in Atlanta less than 14 months ago by 
four airline executives in their 40s, ValuJet is already tearing up markets in 
the Southeast and ambitious to grow into the Middle West. 
</P>
<P>
 It has 17 DC-9 airplanes in its fleet and will soon have 27, bought on 
five-year credit from McDonnell Douglas. ValuJet flies to 17 cities for fares 
of $39 to $59 a trip, with no tickets. Computers assign confirmation numbers to 
passengers, who pay by credit card and board the plane, where it's first-come, 
first-served for seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Such no-frills service and very low labor costs keep ValuJet's costs a shade 
under Southwest's but a third less than the average cost of full-service 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 ValuJet has come on fast. In the nine months ended Sept. 30, it grew to $86 
million in revenue and earned $13.8 million in net income. Since going public 
on Nasdaq in June, its stock has gone from $12.50 a share to about $23. On 
Friday it closed at $22 a share, off 50.25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 What does that burst of success tell us about business in America today? That 
there are a lot of skilled people out there, many from the shrinking defense 
industry and armed forces, willing to work for less money. ValuJet pays 
mechanics $8 to $12 an hour -- half to two-thirds of what other airlines pay. 
It pays pilots about $43,000 a year, a lot less than other airlines pay. 
</P>
<P>
 But it pays bonuses, which can add one-third of pay, to all employees based on 
the growth of the business. And its rapid growth creates opportunities for 
people to move up quickly. "It's a young company," says one employee in his 
20s. 
</P>
<P>
 ValuJet's success also tells us there are a lot of investors eager to back 
start-up companies. Chairman Robert Priddy, President Lewis Jordan and Las 
Vegas investors and former airline owners Maurice Gallagher and Tim Flynn put 
up $3.4 million and were able to attract $73 million more through private and 
public sales of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 It tells us of the unpredictability of business. ValuJet's DC-9s are old 
planes, supposedly unusable because of noise regulations. But in response to 
the need, several small companies have developed engine adaptations, called 
hush kits, which cost almost half as much as a whole airplane but allow them to 
meet regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 So ValuJet is adding destinations in Detroit and Miami, and bringing further 
pressure on troubled USAir Group, in which Buffett invested $358 million five 
years ago in the belief that regional airlines had a bright future. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called Sage of Omaha was right on that count. Southwest and its many 
imitators, including ValuJet, have all succeeded regionally. But they have 
operated efficient, low-cost operations while Buffett's USAir has one of the 
highest cost structures in the business. Buffett's mistake was not comparing 
costs and anticipating change. 
</P>
<P>
 But does the success of low-cost regionals mean the whole business falls to 
no-frills operators, that the traditional industry is a dodo bird? No, not at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Such airlines, offering no connections with other flights, are limited to 
short hauls to begin with. And there can be problems in growth and low wages. A 
mechanic earning $8 an hour to start and having to certify the airworthiness of 
planes may be getting paid too little for such responsibility. Nurses came in 
short supply years ago when their wages got out of whack. Southwest, it should 
be noted, pays better than the industry average on an incentive basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The major airlines are responding to the challenge, becoming leaner in their 
own operations and also relinquishing some routes to the newcomers to 
concentrate on longer hauls and bigger markets where they can make a profit. 
What we're getting is a mix of services, depending on distance and time, price 
and comfort. 
</P>

 Lee Howard of Airline Economics, a Washington consultant, notes that low-cost 
regionals, including Southwest, carry less than 10% of airline traffic. And 
with travel picking up, the big carriers, notably American, are returning to 
steady profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the biggest and most overlooked point of all is that passengers are 
winning big, from lower fares to extra travel options domestically and 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 So consider the airlines: A business attracting investments, entrepreneurs, 
customers and ambitious workers and fostering innovation and competitive 
operations at home and abroad. If that isn't a healthy industry, what is?

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: INSIGHT; BALANCED-BUDGET AMENDMENT WOULD SPELL 
DISASTER FOR ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT EISNER, ROBERT EISNER is William R. Kenan professor emeritus of 
economics at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. He is the author of The 
Misunderstood Economy: What Counts and How to Count It. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How about amending the Constitution to mandate prayer in the public schools 
for a balanced budget? That would make about as much sense as the 
balanced-budget amendment Republicans have promised to make the first order of 
business in the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 That amendment is bad law and terrible economics. If it could ever be 
enforced, it would require -- given political realities -- some combination of 
significant cuts in Social Security, shrinkage of the safety net for the poor 
and sacrifice of programs for investment in our children and our future. More 
likely, it will suffer the fate of the Prohibition amendment, which was 
repealed after 13 years of bootlegging and speak-easies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the public -- and, I fear, our politicians -- have no understanding of 
how the federal budget deficit is calculated and what a "balanced budget" would 
mean. People often say, "I balance my checkbook; why can't the government 
balance its?" In fact, by the weird methods of federal accounting, almost all 
of us would prove guilty of maintaining unbalanced budgets and running 
deficits. After all, most Americans have gone hugely into debt by buying 
houses. Many more have borrowed to finance their own or their children's 
college education. We properly view spending out of such borrowing as 
"investment" -- in a home in which we can live for decades, or in schooling 
that will pay off over a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all American business borrows, and borrows heavily, to finance 
investment in new plant and equipment and new technology. But our federal 
government, unlike private business and state governments and national 
governments around the world, keeps no separate capital budget. All federal 
spending -- for investment, for paying government workers, for lending to small 
business, for Social Security, for interest on the debt -- generally is lumped 
together as "outlays." When outlays exceed tax revenues, we have a "deficit." 
It is as if a family made no distinction between spending to buy a house or go 
to school or invest in a business and gambling away borrowed money in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All this -- and more -- ignored in the various proposals for a balanced budget 
amendment. One section of one proposal declares: "Total outlays . . . shall not 
exceed total receipts." That is like commanding the waves of the Pacific Ocean 
to cease lapping the shore. What if the waves refuse to obey? Tax receipts go 
down, automatically, when individual and business incomes go down. Outlays for 
unemployment insurance go up, automatically, when unemployment rises. That 
means that even if we somehow could start with a balanced budget, the budget 
would become unbalanced if the economy slowed, as tax receipts fell and outlays 
rose. What do we do then? Put the tax collector in jail for violating the 
Constitution? Or do we raise tax rates and cut unemployment benefits to try to 
balance the budget? By reducing people's purchasing power, either of these 
actions would only slow the economy further. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 1995 Clinton deficit is now projected at about $170 billion, little more 
than half of the $327 billion forecast by the Bush Administration for 1993 just 
before it left office. In major part, the reduction is coming about because the 
economy -- while it still has plenty of room for improvement -- has been 
getting better. The $170-billion deficit would mean $170 billion in new 
borrowing, and hence an increase in the federal debt of $170 billion. But that 
increase -- some 5% percent of the $3.5 trillion outstanding -- means the debt 
will be growing less rapidly than the nation's income. That is well within the 
guidelines of prudent finance for business or individuals: The debt-to-income 
ratio would be coming down. 
</P>
<P>
 Reducing the deficit further carries grave risks. Balancing the budget, if it 
were done next year -- and note that we could face similar problems whenever an 
amendment took effect -- would take away roughly $170 billion in sales from 
American business, as our purchasing power would be reduced by that sum. I hope 
all in the new Congress can calculate how many jobs that would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But worst of all is the idea of putting this outrageous and perverse economic 
dogma into the U.S. Constitution. It would plunge courts and accountants and 
lawyers into perennial battles over how to report the budget. It would invite 
all kinds of tricks and subterfuges to report a "balance." Instead of making 
outlays itself, the federal government could order the states or private 
business to make them, or could pass regulations requiring individuals 
themselves to make expenditures. Washington could endlessly refine what is "in" 
the budget and what is "off-budget" -- at least until the next judge caught up 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 A budget truly "balanced" by current federal accounting procedures would be a 
disaster for the economy. Given justifiable resistance to large tax increases, 
it would block us from essential investment spending for public infrastructure, 
education and research and a successful war against the crime that is 
destroying our cities and so many of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 And, worst of all, backers of a constitutional amendment would mandate all 
this and lock it into the basic guarantor of so many of our rights and 
liberties -- the Constitution. It ain't broke. Don't try to fix it!

HOUSE HUNTS BY COMPUTER SAVING TIME AND TEDIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I want this one!" Three-year-old Evan Donnelly is pointing to the color 
photograph of a tile-roofed house on his parents' computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, this house is too small, I can tell," said Mary Donnelly, sitting with 
her son in their Yorba Linda bedroom. "Go to the next one," she tells her 
husband, Brian. 
</P>
<P>
 With a click of the mouse, the computer brings up another listed property that 
matches the family's preferences. The routine is a familiar one for the 
Donnellys. They've been spending evenings shopping for their dream house -- 
without ever leaving home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Donnellys "visit" properties after work via computer. By using a CD-ROM 
program, they say, they have found a way to eliminate some of the tedium, 
frustration and stress of house-hunting. There's no need to drive through 
unfamiliar neighborhoods on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "With two children, looking for a home can be an exhausting process," Mary 
Donnelly said. "This makes it easy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Donnellys aren't alone in turning to computers for house-shopping help. 
</P>
<P>
 When more than 17,000 real estate brokers gathered in Anaheim last month for 
their annual national conference, the group focused on how to give clients more 
electronically packaged information. Computers anchored almost every booth as 
the brokers gathered to buzz about the latest high-tech marketing tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Most agents have come to realize that colorful yard signs, open 
houses and a smiling realtor are no longer the best ways to sell residential 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate agents in the San Fernando Valley and Orange County are among the 
first in the nation to use on-line systems that tap sophisticated data sources. 
And, as major real estate companies rush toward the information superhighway, 
brokers still using outdated methods could be left rolling behind in the dirt 
like lost hubcaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales agents are betting that, like the Donnellys, their clients will demand 
more and better information before they begin shopping for a home. Though some 
brokers are nervous about giving up some control, most predict that shoppers 
one day will work only with brokers who provide the most complete and current 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "The floodgates are about to open," said Mark Surfas, director of on-line 
communications at Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate in Mission Viejo, one 
of the nation's largest real estate brokerages. "We're blending a lot of 
different technologies together and turning this into a real estate information 
Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, shoppers can select their next dwelling at computer kiosks in 
seven California malls. A kiosk is slated to be installed in the Glendale 
Galleria and five other malls next year. Computers have replaced model homes in 
Aliso Viejo. Prospective buyers instead look at computerized images of home 
designs developed by two Orange County companies. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for the ultimate home-buying experience, consumers may one day use 
virtual reality centers -- with computer-generated, three-dimensional house 
designs -- to "walk through" rooms in houses or even entire neighborhoods 
without ever going outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 While on-line networks are not yet available in most of Southern California, 
the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors has unveiled a system that lets 
buyers use a computer network to choose a dwelling to buy, electronically fill 
out escrow and title forms and get preliminary approval of a mortgage loan in a 
single visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the only board in the country doing this . . .," said Almon R. 
Smith, executive vice president of National Assn. of Realtors, which is 
developing a nationwide system based on the Valley model. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is sweeping the entire industry. When you get down to it, real estate -- 
more than anything else -- is about the flow of information. Everyone's trying 
to figure out how to link things together." 
</P>
<P>
 With 7,500 members, the San Fernando board is the nation's third largest real 
estate board and the largest in California. It is the first to offer its 
members a network that stores up to 10 color photographs of each listing with 
full descriptions of each house, recent improvements and information on schools 
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Bell-designed system can also screen and select listings to fit a 
buyer's specifications and print out maps showing the location of each address. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Century 21 office just up the street from the Meadows apartment complex 
in Northridge, where 16 tenants died in the Jan. 17 earthquake, Lisa and Bill 
Smith are shopping for their "first real home." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's condo was damaged in the earthquake, but neither is willing to 
give up on the Northridge area. Both admitted, though, that neighborhoods 
littered with earthquake-damaged houses add a special challenge to home buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see right here, the chimney is gone," said their realty agent, Marc 
D. Schwartz, pointing to one house shown on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz plugs into the computer the Smiths' specifications -- three bedrooms, 
maximum price of $160,000, favorite neighborhoods -- and pulls up 75 
properties. The Smiths quickly scan the photos on the screen and discard the 
undesirables, especially those with serious earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants a big house, and I want a big garage," said Bill Smith, 30, who 
owns a window cleaning company. "This saves us so much time because we discuss 
it right here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mission Viejo Mall, a computer kiosk designed by New Home Search offers 
photos and floor plans of listed homes. Using CD-ROM technology, buyers can 
tour both new and resale properties just by touching a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking for a home is a grueling process," said John Giamo, head of Visual 
Listings Inc. in Brea, who joined Jeff Meyers of the Meyers Group, a Newport 
Beach real estate data company, to create New Home Search in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Visual Listings also produces a real estate CD-ROM packed with up to 25,000 
listings. The Donnellys are among a test-marketing group of about 30 clients 
who receive the disc free at home each week, and about 100 brokerages subscribe 
to the CD-ROM service for $35 a disc. The company charges brokers about $20 to 
place a listing for a resale home in the database; it charges builders $150 to 
list new houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the service say the cost of manufacturing a CD-ROM is prohibitive 
(the company says a disc costs about $6 now, and could get cheaper). They point 
out that listings can expire quickly. Giamo admits that the program is still 
developing, but said computer users will be able to get the listings on the 
Internet by spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Giamo said the system developed in the San Fernando Valley is tailored to 
brokers' needs, not those of consumers. His system, he said, is designed 
specifically for buyers. And that, he says, makes Orange County realtors a 
little nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very frustrating situation with Orange County brokers; they have 
not embraced the technology, but consumers love it," Giamo said.  
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Smith, executive vice president of the East Orange County Assn. of 
Realtors -- which has 2,100 members in Santa Ana, Orange, Anaheim Hills and 
Tustin -- acknowledged a certain resistance to change. But his group's agents 
can now put listings on the Prodigy on-line service, and he said he believes 
that eventually, all brokers will be on line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been looking at similar things to what San Fernando Valley has done. 
We find our members are very receptive to some of the high-tech innovations," 
Smith said. "But there is always some resistance to anything new." 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet, a global connection of computer networks and databases, will 
help provide a more intimate setting in which to shop for a house. Offers and 
listings are already appearing on the World Wide Web, a subdivision of the 
Internet where members can advertise. The system allows for text to be combined 
with sound and even video, providing an opportunity to show many features of a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate and Century 21 Real Estate Corp. -- 
are spending millions of dollars to get their hundreds of thousands of brokers 
wired with the latest high-tech sales gadgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Coldwell Banker is expanding its fledgling Scoop software program so that by 
early next year, consumers can walk into a Coldwell Banker office to look at 
pictures of homes, check out schools and shop for a mortgage loan on the 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential Real Estate Affiliates of Costa Mesa is building a $1-million 
center on the East Coast with interactive television to view homes -- virtual 
reality centers where potential buyers will "walk" through dozens of homes 
without leaving the office. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing missing is the sales agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no salespeople there -- but you can find out about everything: 
homes for sale, mortgages and escrows," Prudential spokesman Ron Tepper said. 
"The real estate transaction is the most barbaric thing there is. We want to 
change that and give consumers what they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all brokers embrace the idea of multimedia house-hunting. Realtors, 
through their local boards, are used to controlling the information on listed 
properties and don't like the idea of direct customer access. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is still a lot of electronic sizzle," said Dick Rafferty, a broker with 
Electronic Realty Associates in Fountain Valley. "People don't buy homes off 
the computer. They have to go look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 And many realtors said that although the computers can supply customers with 
the most up-to-date information, many buyers will still need a professional 
real estate broker to guide them through purchasing the house of their choice.

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: WILL 1995 BE THE YEAR GROWTH STOCKS TAKE OFF? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Against a generally favorable economic and political backdrop, growth stocks 
might actually start to grow again. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be a welcome change for several hundred mutual funds that seek out 
companies with promising sales and earnings potential. Most of these funds are 
showing modest losses so far in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, they have been outperformed since 1991 by their archrivals -- funds 
that invest in bargain or "value" stocks. These are companies characterized as 
cheap in terms of having a low price-earnings multiple, a low price-book value 
ratio, a hefty dividend yield or the like. 
</P>
<P>
 The two categories of stocks tend to alternate in and out of favor for years 
at a stretch, and many growth-fund managers are becoming hopeful that 1995 will 
be their year. This optimism can be boiled down to several key reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * In a slowing economy, which many people are forecasting for 1995, growth 
companies are better able to maintain impressive financial results, at least 
compared to value stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. economy is in the mature stages of its current expansion," says 
Michael Gerding, manager of the Founders Worldwide Growth Fund in Denver. "Such 
an environment favors growth stocks, and small growth stocks in particular," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Higher interest rates, while bad for stocks generally, will put added 
pressure on firms in debt-laden industries such as the electric-utility 
business and energy production. Big borrowers, including many cyclical 
companies, often fall into the value camp. 
</P>
<P>
 * A lower capital-gains tax rate, if the new Republican Congress can push one 
through, would tend to favor investments that deliver appreciation rather than 
dividends. True growth companies pay little if anything in the way of 
dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 A cut in the capital-gains rate would also tend to shift investor enthusiasm 
toward stocks generally, notes Hans Ziegler, chief executive officer of Stein 
Roe & Farnham in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 * It's about time for growth stocks to rotate into favor. Value companies have 
been winners most of the time from 1981 on, having logged much better 
performance in 1992 and 1993. "Growth shares currently are undervalued relative 
to the market on a historical basis," says Ziegler. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the growth is doing better, raising hopes in the growth camp that 
the momentum is shifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Flynn, a manager at Stratford Advisory Group in Chicago, says his firm in 
recent months has been recommending that clients shift their holdings of 
domestic stock funds to 75% growth, 25% value from a 50-50 split this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Margie Mullen of Mullen Advisory in Los Angeles recommends a 50-50 split 
between the two, but that represents her heftiest growth weighting in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "After three years of under-performance, I think growth will do well," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 As a caveat, it's not always easy to identify one type of stock from the other 
-- investment beauty often is in the eye of the portfolio manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, classifications change. A few years ago, pharmaceutical companies 
were viewed as classic growth stocks because of their superb record of profit 
increases. But these issues got clobbered when the Clinton Administration 
raised the specter of health-care reform, and now many drug manufacturers have 
become value plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more troubling for mutual fund shareholders, you can't assume that a 
particular growth fund will be holding growth stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth nomenclature is used to describe funds oriented toward capital-gain 
returns rather than dividends. Many fine growth funds actually follow a value 
investing approach. Some even have "value" in their names. 
</P>
<P>
 But you are more likely to find value portfolios in the growth and income and 
equity-income fund categories. 
</P>
<P>
 It's worth noting that not everybody thinks growth stocks will necessarily 
outperform in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In a soft market, especially one marked by rising interest rates, stocks with 
high price-earnings ratios often get banged up the most, says Judy Vale, 
manager of the value-oriented Neuberger & Berman Genesis Fund in New York. 
Growth stocks trade at higher P-E ratios than value shares. Considering that 
interest rates still appear to be rising, that could be an important negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Vale combines the two approaches in that she looks for growing companies whose 
share prices have stumbled. There's a perception that value firms often are 
"static," she says, but in many cases the shares of quality companies have been 
beaten down simply because management reported a flat quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of companies continue to have strong fundamentals, but their stock 
prices are off," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the blurry lines between many growth and value stocks, not to mention 
the difficulty of predicting which category will fare better, it's often wise 
to cover your bases. The easy solution is to buy at least two stock funds -- 
one with a growth orientation and the other with a value slant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Neff, one of the most successful fund managers ever, will step down from 
the helm of Vanguard Windsor at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Neff became manager in 1964, when the fund had $75 million in assets. Today, 
it counts $10.7 billion. Under his direction, Windsor beat the market through 
most of the 1980s, stumbled badly in 1989 and 1990, and has since resumed its 
relatively good performance. The fund is currently closed to new investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Neff will stay on in an advisory role. Charles Freeman will take over as lead 
manager of Windsor. He has worked for the fund since 1969.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: FEDERAL PLAN ABOUT TO SHAKE UP STUDENT 
LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The U.S. Department of Education will soon unveil a plan that is expected to 
let millions of indebted former students into the direct lending program for 
the first time and spur a virtual cat fight for college consolidation loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Direct lending, a controversial program that lets students bypass banks and 
get loans directly from the federal government, allows easier repayment terms. 
Currently, however, the program is offered only through about 5% of the 
nation's universities, colleges and trade schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Direct lending's portion of the student loan market could soar overnight, 
thanks to the loan consolidation program expected to be revealed next month. 
The plan would allow former students and some who are still in school to 
refinance old bank loans with direct loans from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "All students who are in repayment on federal loans will be given the 
opportunity to consolidate into a direct loan," said a spokeswoman for the 
Education Department in Washington. "They will have to contact their current 
lender first, but if that lender doesn't offer an income-contingent repayment 
plan that's acceptable to the student, they will be able to get a direct loan." 
</P>
<P>
 The Education Department is not going to second-guess students who say the 
loans they were offered were unacceptable, she added, so virtually anyone who 
is paying off a student loan will be able to convert the debt via a direct 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the government plan already has prompted a flurry of activity among 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The end result for college students is a widening array of complex choices -- 
some offering real benefits, others offering risks and high costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a loan consolidation, a student simply refinances all -- or a portion -- of 
the old student loans into one new one. In the past, there was no interest rate 
benefit to consolidating these loans, but a borrower could pay a smaller amount 
over a longer period of time and make the payments to one lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Student Loan Reform Act will create real interest rate disparities 
between different types of consolidation loans. In a nutshell, if you 
consolidate your loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program, or 
FFELP -- the loans handled by banks -- the interest rate is the weighted 
average of what you are currently paying, rounded to the next full number. In 
other words, if your average rate is now 8.57%, you'd pay 9% when you 
consolidated the loan. That rate is fixed for the life of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direct loan consolidation program, the interest rate will equal the 
Stafford loan rate at the time you get your loan. Right now, that rate is 
attractive. The Stafford rate is variable, adjusted once each year. The current 
variable rate is 7.43%, but it is capped at 8.25%. Translation: The loan rate 
can go below 8.25%, but it can't go higher. 
</P>
<P>
 For students who have old Stafford loans at 10% interest, direct loan 
consolidation is clearly a bargain. You can get these direct loans with 
standard 10-year terms or with graduated payments.  
</P>
<P>
 The direct loan program offers an array of other repayment options aimed at 
making the loans more affordable for students who want to go into important, 
but low-paying professions such as teaching and social work. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, where conventional student loans require borrowers to pay off 
the debt within 10 years, the direct loan program would allow them to stretch 
the payments over far longer periods -- for up to 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One option, called income contingent repayment, drops payments to whatever 
level is necessary to suit the borrower's income. Those with very modest 
earnings may even pay less than the interest due -- impossible with ordinary 
student loans.  
</P>
<P>
 There is a compelling downside to the easy-repayment terms, however: When you 
pay over longer periods, you pay more. That's simply because the interest you 
owe is calculated based on the balance of your loan. When you pay over longer 
periods of time, the balance is whittled down more slowly, and that boosts the 
interest cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, a student with $25,000 in loans would pay about $300 a month -- a total 
of $36,000 -- to pay off the debt in the standard 10 years, according to the 
Education Department. With a 20-year extended repayment plan, the student would 
pay about $200 a month, or a total of $48,000 over the life of the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers who use the income-contingent option can face an even costlier 
prospect. That's because under this program they are allowed to pay less 
monthly than the interest accruing on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is called negative amortization. It means the loan balance grows -- 
and you owe interest on a steadily increasing amount -- even though you are 
making all the required payments. In the worst-case scenario, an 
income-contingent borrower could see the loan balance balloon to 150% of the 
original debt. 
</P>
<P>
 If the loan isn't paid off in 25 years, the government will "forgive," or 
cancel, the remainder of the debt. But be aware that any amount of debt that's 
forgiven is considered taxable income, so you could be faced with a whopping 
tax bill in exchange.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) A Debt 'Refi' Can Be Costly 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with a student loan is likely to be bombarded with information about 
"loan consolidation" in the next few months, as a new government program will 
inspire competition in this otherwise staid segment of the lending industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Student loan consolidation programs allow you to roll several old loans into 
one new one, which can save you both time and money -- sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But students need to be cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the new student loan consolidation plan offered by University Support 
Services, headquartered in Washington, D.C. Despite the official-sounding name 
and address, U.S.S. is a private lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike federal student loans, there are no payment deferrals with private 
loans. If you don't pay, you'll hear from debt collectors and your credit 
rating will be shot. There is no "cap" on the U.S.S. variable interest rate, 
and there is a 5% loan origination fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the government's so-called "direct loan" consolidation program the most 
you'd pay in annual interest on a $25,000 loan would be $2,062.50 with the rate 
cap. With the U.S.S. loan, you would pay $3,527.50 if interest rates are as 
they were for the last 13 years and average 14.11%. When you add that to the 
$1,250 origination fee, this loan costs roughly $2,715 more than the federal 
loan in the first year. Over the life of the loan, the sky's the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the advantage of this loan? 
</P>
<P>
 Private loans such as U.S.S. makes allow you to consolidate many kinds of 
loans, including credit card debt, as long as the money was spent to finance 
your college education, says Pierre Escandar, U.S.S. executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, this loan offers convenience by allowing you to write just one 
check each month to pay student debts. U.S.S. also says it's committed to 
superior service, and Escandar predicts people will pay extra for these 
benefits. "It's why people use Federal Express rather than UPS," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Here's a question for you graduates: Is a little extra convenience worth 
upward of $2,715? The way you answer will determine how good your parents feel 
about sending you to college.

RUSSIAN PLAYERS WANT A CUT OF ITS DIAMOND MARKET; TRADE: THE NATION'S DEAL TO 
SELL 95% OF ITS ROUGH EXPORTS TO GEM GIANT DE BEERS OF SOUTH AFRICA WILL EXPIRE 
NEXT YEAR. YAKUTIA REGION IS ONE OF WORLD'S LARGEST PRODUCERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the first team of Soviet geologists found diamonds under the ice in this 
desolate Siberian outpost, they sent back to Moscow a coded message: "We have 
smoked the pipe of peace; the tobacco is good." 
</P>
<P>
 That was in 1955. Two years later, Soviet Russia started selling its gems to 
South Africa's diamonds giant De Beers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, all Russian diamond sales were handled centrally in Moscow. 
No more. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, world markets watch as Russia's emerging new players fight for a share of 
diamond spoils, making it impossible to know who controls the gems in one of 
world's biggest producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants to sell diamonds," said Vitaly Basygysov, mayor of Mirny 
(translated as Peaceful), a poor diamond town six time zones east of Moscow in 
semiautonomous Yakutia. "People don't like monopolies." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, under a five-year deal expiring in 1995, sells 95% of rough gem 
exports via De Beers' Central Selling Organization, which controls 80% of the 
world market. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russian diamonds -- polished and industrial -- are leaking to the world 
outside the De Beers system. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no real boundary between Russian industrial diamonds and rough gems," 
said Nikolai Eudin, director of a diamond sorting plant in Mirny. "It's no 
secret that Indians buy industrial stones and polish them into top-quality 
diamonds." 
</P>
<P>
 An increasing number of cutting plants enjoying the right to attractively 
priced rough gems are adding to the leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Semion Zelberg, vice president of Almazy Rossiya-Sakha, Russia's diamond 
mining and marketing conglomerate, sees cut diamond turnover soaring to $1 
billion annually in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yakutia's Tuyimaada firm hopes to double the number of its polishing plants to 
16 in 1995 and market 200,000 carats of cut diamonds to Russia and the world 
through its foreign partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Businessmen from Japan and India come here to buy cut diamonds," said Deputy 
Chairman Svetlana Maksimovna. "We have joint ventures with Israeli and Japanese 
firms. We are positioning ourselves to supply more to the West." 
</P>
<P>
 Such remarks are enough to give diamond traders the shivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Market confidence is very important," said Raymond Clark, head of De Beers 
Centenary in Moscow. "Russians understand the theory of single-channel 
marketing, but it doesn't always work out in practice." 
</P>
<P>
 De Beers is spending a fortune to plug leaks from Russia. "We've had cracks 
before," Clark said. "Somehow we managed to weather the storms. I don't see why 
we can't do it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all De Beers' business partners in Russia agree on the need for a 
monopoly. But there are just too many of them and each one now wants a bigger 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Zelberg said: "De Beers sees itself at the same level as countries and not 
companies. It should deal directly with our company, not government officials 
in Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
 In Yakutia, Foreign Economic Relations Minister Vitaly Artimonov said the 
republic is not getting enough: "We're losing money. This problem is being 
openly put before De Beers." 
</P>
<P>
 Yakutia, a republic the size of India which produces one-fifth of the world's 
diamonds, is the latest potentially market-moving force to emerge on the world 
diamond market. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia wants equal terms, higher prices and increases in its current quota, 
26% of De Beers' world sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Russia is not Africa," said Nurgun Timofeyev, director of the rough diamonds 
trading arm of Almazy Rossiya-Sakha. "With Russia, you can only cooperate. You 
cannot dictate your terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Disputes are also simmering between Russia and Yakutia. 
</P>
<P>
 Artimonov said Yakutia wants to keep 40% of its gems compared to 20% now. 
Officials in Moscow laugh at this, noting Yakutia has no license to trade rough 
or cut diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Yakutia wants to go it alone, it has to quit the Russian Federation 
first," said Yuri Kotlyar, deputy chairman of the Precious Metals Committee in 
Moscow.

FEW KNOW WHERE TAX DOLLARS GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent survey of Laguna Niguel residents uncovered "an alarming lack of 
knowledge" about sales tax receipts, according to Laguna Niguel City Manager 
Tim Casey. Most respondents knew that the state benefited from the sales tax, 
but less than a quarter knew that their hometown recouped tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know they're paying sales tax, but where they don't put two and two 
together is that some of it comes back to the city," said Terry Saverson, 
executive director of the El Cajon Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where campaigns are helpful," Saverson said. "It raises the awareness 
level, it makes people stop and think that, 'Because I shop (locally) it comes 
back to me in real, hard benefits.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the total sales tax is 7.75%. The state levies a 6% tax, 
local cities (or the county, in unincorporated areas) charge 1%, the county 
levies 0.25% for highways and transportation, and the Orange County 
Transportation Authority collects 0.5%.  
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, the total tax is 8.25%. The state levies a 6% tax, 
cities charge a 1% tax and three transportation-related taxes account for the 
remaining 1.25%. GREG JOHNSON

IN A BREAK FROM PAST, POOL HALLS GO UPSCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The image of the smoke-filled pool hall filled with hustlers seeking an easy 
mark is giving way to the swanky upscale "billiard center" that is fast 
becoming the hot club of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pool halls were previously synonymous with a bunch of bums sitting around all 
day," said Daniel Gauci, a past president of the Billiard Congress of America. 
"We are crushing the old image of sleazy pool halls and creating a new one."  
</P>
<P>
 The new clubs are combining pool tables with tony restaurants and hip discos 
to provide a sporting alternative to bars and dance clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is no exception. Pool players and people watchers can choose 
from Irvine's Metropolis, Plush Pockets in Lake Forest, Classic Q in Newport 
Beach and Orange County's newest upscale pool hall, On The Break Grille and 
Sports Club, at the former Golden Bear site in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shark Club billiard pub in Costa Mesa combines California cuisine, 
progressive music, shark tanks and pool tables in an "industrial renaissance" 
atmosphere. And people, unlike those at other pool halls, are not there to 
practice their pool skills. If they were, they would be in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekend nights, at all of Orange County's highbrow pool halls, patrons can 
wait several hours for a table. And the price to play can be as much as $12 per 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the 500-year-old sport has had a revival, helped by the 1980s hit 
movie "The Color of Money," which focused on the high-stakes betting side. It 
is no longer a frowned-upon activity. In fact, it is now the world's fastest 
growing sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Pool is now ranked the No. 2 participation sport for men behind soccer and is 
among the top 10 for women. 
</P>
<P>
 One new club that is part of the revolution sweeping the country is The Ball 
Room, a 10,000-square-foot complex in Houston's center-city night life 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar clubs have opened throughout the country in cities such as Chicago, 
Los Angeles and New York amid industry projections that two to three upscale 
billiard parlors are opening every week in major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical club could cost millions to get started, including interiors and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ball Room combines a pool hall with bar and restaurant that attracts 
well-heeled people willing to pay $10 for an hour of pool and $30 for a bottle 
of wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the building, which underwent about $700,000 in renovations, are 
reproductions of Renaissance masterpieces and a fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior, painted in jewel colors, has plush furniture. The pool tables 
are surrounded by lamps covered in crushed velvet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're using pool as a means of social interaction. This is a very 
non-threatening environment, but it's a place where boys still want to meet 
girls and girls want to meet boys," said Ken Wales, co-owner of The Ball Room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pool is not a fad, it's always been around, but it's definitely undergoing a 
revival."  
</P>
<P>
 Hotshots can even compete with each other at a $2-per-game challenge table, 
but people don't line up quarters on the table as is done in traditional pool 
halls. Here, a hostess keeps track of contenders on a gold-framed chalkboard, 
racks the balls and even referees any disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 For those looking for a quiet atmosphere, people can shoot pool in the Green 
Room, closed by emerald velvet theatrical curtains, on two ornately carved 
$30,000 Renaissance Royal George tables, complete with tassels and leather 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those looking to meet someone special, the new clubs are providing an 
environment where women and men can compete at a sport on a relatively level 
playing field. 
</P>
<P>
 "To just hit the balls around and have some fun doesn't require a lot of 
skill, dexterity or practice," said Dina Langone, who visited the bar recently 
with a group of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's easy to meet people without pressure." 
</P>

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; JUSTICE FOR ALL; DON CARDINAL IS PASSIONATE IN HIS BELIEF 
THAT FACILITATED COMMUNICATION MARKEDLY IMPROVES THE LIVES OF THE AUTISTIC. AND 
HE'S STANDING FIRM EVEN AS CRITICISM MOUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Cardinal -- former street tough, college dropout, and now academic and 
advocate -- opens a door to show a visitor his world. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside room H105 of Whittier's California High School sit six fidgeting 
students, including 15-year-old Dan McMillan. Dan has autism, a brain disorder 
that's all but closed him off from his surroundings. He sniffs Cardinal's 
sleeve curiously; he can't speak beyond a moan and squints through thick 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's teacher catches his eye, and asks him: "Can you tell Don what 
classes you had today?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dan hesitates, then stares up at the mustachioed man encouraging him with a 
broad smile. 
</P>
<P>
 He is asked again. Finally, Dan's teacher grips and supports his hand with her 
own, extending his index finger toward a keyboard on a table in front of him. 
Dan pushes down and points at the letter H. Then he stabs at what appear to be 
I, S, T, O, R and Y.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ah," the teacher says. "History." All the while, Cardinal -- a special 
education professor at Chapman University in Orange -- beams like a proud 
godparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal asks: "Who would not want a person to be able to communicate like 
this?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer: Lots of people. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called "facilitated communication," or FC, and it works this way: A 
severely disabled student points to letters on a keyboard with assistance from 
a teacher -- or "facilitator" -- who supports the person's hand or arm, or 
touches the students' shoulder. The letters spell out words, and sometimes 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Although facilitated communication has won passionate believers among some 
parents and teachers, to others it's no more than an insidious farce that fills 
desperate mothers and fathers with false hopes. A cadre of autism specialists 
across the nation cites court cases in which children falsely reported sexual 
abuse through facilitated communication, and charges were raised that 
facilitators influenced the children's words. No one has shown with scientific 
validity, detractors say, that disabled people are actually communicating their 
own thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 FC has been debunked and discarded on news shows such as "60 Minutes" and 
"20/20" -- and some autism experts have made it their life's work to show it's 
a hoax. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Cardinal comes in, standing his ground as a hurricane of 
controversy swirls around. Cardinal, 43, bridges the gap between scientist and 
activist. He talks regularly to the faithful and the skeptics -- "we're all in 
the debate," he says -- as he conducts the nation's largest study (43 subjects 
at several Southern California sites) to see if the technique is effective.  
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal, who directs Chapman's special education program, supports the 
method, but wants to prove it in a way that's accepted by staunch opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 TV newsmagazines have interviewed him; his articles have appeared in higher 
education publications and journals. He's touted as the prime researcher 
supporting facilitated communication on the West Coast, and has presented 
workshops with the Syracuse University professor who introduced the method to 
mainstream America in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal has come a long way from school-kid days when he worked 
60-hour-a-week summers for minimum wage in his strict father's plumbing-parts 
factory. Two of his turbulent late teen years in Downey vanished down a drain 
of drug use, he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 But he turned his life around, got his doctorate in special education, gained 
a family and charged ahead with a passionate, driven zeal to be an advocate for 
disabled peoples' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Social justice for people with severe disabilities is one of the last 
frontiers," Cardinal says. "When the FC fight came up, I looked at my wife and 
said, 'How can I resist this one?' This is my issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton Professor Emeritus Leo Schmidt, Cardinal's longtime 
mentor, says Cardinal knows the dangers of researching the controversial 
method. "But like he has been all his life, he's been more than willing to 
explore," Schmidt says. "That's something many academicians have forgotten 
about." 
</P>

<P>
 Cardinal reclines at a table in Chapman University's cafeteria. It's abuzz 
with college students, chattering and taking a break from class. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a horrible high school student," he says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no family history of college. All four grandparents emigrated from 
Italy. His mother, Rose, finished fourth grade. Sam, his father, made it only 
through eighth, but managed to build a small plumbing-supply wholesaler into a 
successful business. 
</P>
<P>
 Every summer, from ages 14 to 17, Cardinal worked in one of his father's three 
factories, making plumbing valves and pipes. From the time the whistle blew in 
the morning to the moment he locked the plant's doors at night, Cardinal was 
there. And winter vacations? He was there, too, all the time working for $1.75 
per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had me do the real crap work," Cardinal says, remembering hours spent 
bending pipes and dodging greasy, heavy machines. "It was clear he was raising 
me to have character." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal's 16th birthday provides some insight into their relationship. He 
wanted Dad to give him four new tires for his car. But Dad gave him a single 
tire and told his son he needed to figure out how to buy the other three 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a day later, Cardinal's life was forever changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal was driving through the city of Bell when he saw a car resembling his 
father's smashed into a telephone pole. He pulled over to see what had happened 
and one of the officers asked: "Is your dad named Sam?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, Cardinal had a chance to talk to his dad before the older man 
was taken into intensive care, but he decided against it. "Dad is kind of 
formal, this isn't the time to talk to him," Cardinal remembers thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 His father didn't make it out of the operating room. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Dad died," Cardinal says with a sigh, "I felt directionless." 
</P>
<P>
 He changed his lifestyle, hanging out with childhood friends, partying, doing 
drugs and getting arrested more than a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the cops took him to jail on his 19th birthday and his buddies 
weren't there to bail him out, he had no choice but to call his mother. The 
disappointment on her face was enough to make Cardinal quit drugs and move away 
from the neighborhood guys. 
</P>
<P>
 He turned his school record around too. A few spaced-out quarters at Cerritos 
College left him a legacy of a 1.68 grade point average and academic probation, 
but with his father's business dreams in mind, he retook all the classes he'd 
failed -- "I couldn't even remember taking them the first time," he says -- and 
transferred to Cal State Fullerton to study finance. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Cardinal rediscovered the business savvy his father had drilled into 
him. "In college, being a tough guy no longer meant how much you can 
bench-press," he says. "After that, I became an academic tough guy." 
</P>
<P>
 A career in business seemed assured. Until his final semester. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, Cardinal trotted over to visit his girlfriend at the Anaheim park 
where she cared for a group of developmentally disabled people. Half a dozen 
people ran up to hug him when he walked through the door, which isn't an 
everyday happening for someone trained in the hands-off world of business. He 
liked the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 He started volunteering to work with autistic and other developmentally 
disabled people in Anaheim while finishing his degree, and soon his interest 
became his obsession. He began to think the unthinkable -- giving up big bucks 
in business to work with the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, he got his master's degree in special education and within 
another nine years he earned his doctorate at Claremont Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
 While in graduate school, Cardinal was becoming outspoken for what he believed 
were the rights of disabled people. That meant zipping to professional 
conferences on the developmentally disabled, including one in San Francisco in 
1986. That's where he ran into Kathy Mahaffey, whom he married. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he really cares about people," says Kathy Cardinal, 40, who counsels 
families with severely disabled children in San Bernardino County. "He's taken 
a personal responsibility to contribute to the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when you hear stories about Don Cardinal's work after graduation, it's 
a wonder he didn't abandon the field. 
</P>
<P>
 First came a job at a high school for the severely disturbed in Riverside 
County, where one particularly troublesome girl, a former prostitute, once 
swung from chandeliers. "You literally would go to the board in the morning to 
look to see if somebody ran away or committed suicide," Cardinal says. 
</P>
<P>
 A large man, it was his job to pin down violent patients until doctors could 
inject them with a tranquilizer, he says. When he took a job at Fairview 
Developmental Center in Costa Mesa, he somehow inherited a similar chore. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers having to hold down Fairview's biggest patient one day, a patient 
he says "could bite through plastic chairs." By the time Cardinal had straddled 
the patient like a horse and wedged his head against the ground, he realized he 
had to get out of there as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets to be too much sometimes," he says. "There started to be too much 
separation between humanity and the type of behavior you have to perform in 
that kind of environment." 
</P>
<P>
 He arrived at Chapman in 1988 as an associate professor of special education 
and achieved tenure last year. The Cardinals now live in Chino Hills, where 
they are raising daughter Megan, 4, and son Nicholas, 1. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chapman, Cardinal championed the full inclusion of developmentally disabled 
students in regular school classrooms -- but his big cause became facilitated 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can't accept the idea that there's a real person inside some of these 
bodies that people had lost hope for," he says. "That idea doesn't fit their 
ideal of a subordinate human being." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Facilitated communication started spreading in the United States after Douglas 
Biklen, a professor of special education at Syracuse University, saw the method 
used in Australia and wrote a story about it in a Harvard University education 
journal in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two to three years, professionals and academics in special 
education and health fields have engaged in bitter intellectual warfare over 
the method. Detractors say no scientific studies have proven that it works. And 
often, as the autistic students point down at letters on keyboards, they appear 
to be looking away. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, particularly teachers and parents, say that careful observation of 
people using the method in their natural environment -- school or home -- shows 
that it's true communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of lawsuits and sexual abuse charges have been linked to the practice. 
Some of the cases have been thrown out of court because judges have decided 
that evidence from facilitated communication conversations isn't reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody says, 'I've got this easy way for you to communicate to your 
child for the first time ever and a way to show he's got more cognitive skills 
than you thought,' that's incredibly seductive," says Gina Green, director of 
research at the New England Center for Autism and a facilitated communication 
critic. 
</P>
<P>
 Green and two other autism experts published a letter last week in the 
Chronicle of Higher Education criticizing Cardinal for ignoring what they say 
are facts showing that facilitated communication does not work. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Green: "I've seen too many kids deprived of appropriate and effective 
intervention because of FC, and too many parents and others deluded by the 
'beliefs' of FC proponents." 
</P>
<P>
 The verbal warriors, both those in favor of the method and against it, stepped 
up their bickering after the TV newsmagazines picked holes in facilitated 
communication on national television. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal was besieged with calls after each show, and has received calls from 
national magazines and newspapers. "Once, one of the TV news shows called us at 
home on Easter, during our private time," Kathy Cardinal says bitterly. 
"Sometimes this whole thing can get really frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal's supporters say he has the right kind of enthusiastic personality to 
handle the questions, and the passion to keep fighting for his beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a wonderful influence on everyone," says University of Buffalo 
Professor Judith Duchan, a fellow believer. "We all kind of count on him to be 
a spokesman. . . . He's also very funny. He takes issues of criticism 
seriously, but his way of handling it is to caricature it." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate that consumes his life isn't just about social justice, Cardinal 
says. It's about why many researchers will only accept strictly scientific data 
to justify conclusions on a subject like facilitated communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal says he is a bridge between pure scientists and qualitative 
researchers -- people like sociologists and anthropologists -- who use 
conclusions gained from observation in the field to support theories. 
</P>
<P>
 Duchan is a qualitative researcher who says Cardinal is valuable because he's 
a "techie" in an often "fuzzy" field. "I'm not as believable as someone from 
their own ranks, someone who does very careful experimental research," says 
Duchan, who has asked Cardinal to write a chapter in her upcoming textbook.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's why Don is so interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernard Rimland, a skeptic of facilitated communication, says only 
scientific research should count in the debate. "Qualitative research is 
half-baked research," says Rimland, head of the San Diego-based Autism Research 
Institute. "The term 'qualitative research' is used in an attempt to sound 
reputable by those who don't want to go to the trouble of collecting real 
data." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cardinal's Chapman office, a fax machine beeps and whines constantly. A 
self-professed techno-nerd, Cardinal treats his computer and his Newton -- a 
hand-held calendar and organizer that's his newest purchase -- like prized 
members of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 He's an odd mix, a technology-and-number fanatic who also thrives on human 
touch. Few of the behaviors or habits of developmentally disabled people bother 
him, whether they start sniffing his sleeves or yelling in his ear. During the 
Christmas season each year, he volunteers to play Santa Claus at parties for 
disabled children "because he doesn't mind when kids drool or throw up on him," 
Kathy Cardinal says. "It's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps Cardinal interested in the debate are the issues and the people -- 
the families -- involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Rita Rubin of Whittier is quick to say that Cardinal and his work with 
facilitated communication has changed her life and that of her 16-year-old 
autistic daughter, Sue. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sue was 13, an instructor at her school in Whittier introduced her to 
facilitated communication. She was a girl who had always been labeled as 
developmentally disabled, her mother says, and was told her IQ was about 50. 
Her mother described her as an automaton. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Sue is a junior at Whittier High School, taking advanced placement history 
and honors English classes with the help of a few aides. Sure, reading Herman 
Melville's "Billy Budd" gives Sue a hard time, but it's hard for most kids, her 
mother jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal had never seen facilitated communication until he saw Sue Rubin in 
action back in 1991, he says. He was fascinated, and since then, he has taken 
Sue and Rita Rubin along to conferences and workshops to demonstrate what he 
believes is the power of facilitated communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sue loves him, I think because he really respects her as a valuable person 
who has her own ideas," Rita Rubin says. "He has a tremendous amount of empathy 
for the kids, and at the same time as an academician, he thinks very clearly, 
so he's not a fluffy person." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at California High School, teacher Darlene Hanson holds Dan McMillan's 
hand firmly as he keeps poking at numbers on a keyboard in front of him, doing 
what appear to be multiplication problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think about Don and who he was before facilitated communication . . . 
he was always talking about social equality," Hanson says. "Sometimes I think, 
'Don, when you talked about this issue before facilitation, people didn't 
listen to you!' 
</P>
<P>
 "But he's always been giving out the same information: People should be 
accepted for who they are." Donald N. Cardinal 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: Yes; born in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married to Kathy Cardinal; they have a daughter, Megan, 4, and a son, 
Nicholas, 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Education: Bachelor's degree in business administration at Cal State 
Fullerton; master's degree in special education at Cal State Fullerton; 
doctorate in education with a special education emphasis at the Claremont 
Graduate School. 
</P>
<P>
 Past Jobs: Chemical truck driver, press operator in a trophy factory, 
construction firm owner, assistant controller of finance, special education 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Passions: Baseball and the Los Angeles Dodgers; construction work; playing 
with his children. 
</P>
<P>
 On reason: "Science has always been a support system for me, but it's never 
been proof. It's people's best guesses." 
</P>
<P>
 On time: "When I'm not either being a father or producing as a teacher, I feel 
very uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 On intelligence: "Before, my self-concept was still left in high school, when 
I was pretty convinced that I was behind everyone else. Now I realize that 
accomplishing things is a lot of hard work -- I don't think I'd score really 
high on an IQ test, but I work really hard."

MOUTHING OFF; AN EGG CREAM DRINKING CONTEST HELPS EX-NEW YORKERS SETTLE AN OLD 
SCORE AND CELEBRATE OLD TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH HANANIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Call it the Battle of the Boroughs. Call it ex-New Yorkers going after their 
own. Call it what you will but there they were, expatriates from Queens, Staten 
Island, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Manhattan -- all vy ing to see just who had the 
biggest mouths.  
</P>
<P>
 The November showdown -- officially an egg cream drinking contest sponsored by 
the New York Alumni Assn. -- had been a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, after all, represents 15,000 ex-New Yorkers who ceaselessly 
complain (as New Yorkers are prone to do) about L.A.'s unending supply of fresh 
fruit, expansive beaches, open-air tennis courts and sunny skies. 
</P>
<P>
 According to co-founder and labor arbitrator Lou Zigman, most meetings center 
around games of stickball -- a sort of street baseball played with a Spaulding 
rubber ball and broomstick. (After Spaulding stopped manufacturing its 
trademark pink balls, Zigman made up a stamp and superimposed it on 
non-Spaulding balls for "greater authenticity.") 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings also feature games of hopscotch chalked in yellow; immies -- the 
pushing of bottle caps, hockey-like, into a series of squares using only the 
thumb and forefinger; marbles; bellyfuls of Nathan's hot dogs, and an annual 
play staged at Beverly Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The plays are not run of the mill. This year's event was chaired by Milton 
Berle, Jon Voight and Louis Gossett Jr. Participants in previous years have 
included Gene Barry, Bea Arthur, Sid Caesar, Tony Danza, Dom DeLuise, Garry 
Marshall, Rita Moreno, Tony Orlando, Neil Sedaka, Connie Stevens and Brenda 
Vacarro. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds from the $17 annual membership dues, $25-$50 tickets and 
voluntary donations -- totaling more than $200,000 in nine years -- have been 
shipped back to Lincoln High School in Coney Island, Erasmus Hall in Brooklyn 
and the Professional Children's School in Manhattan, said Zigman. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he insists, the Beverly Hills-based group's primary mission is neither 
philanthropy nor mere socializing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, it is discussing the weighty issues of the day -- whether incoming 
Gov. George Pataki, for example, will be a disaster for the city whose 
Republican mayor endorsed the Democratic incumbent, Mario Cuomo -- and which 
borough's residents have the biggest mouths.  
</P>
<P>
 After years of wrangling and a series of pointed exchanges in the 
association's 24-page newsletter, the Eagle, Zigman dug deep into his 
negotiating experience and hit upon the only feasible solution. In a 
precedent-breaking event, the association sponsored its first egg cream 
drinking contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Each borough would hand-pick five of its hardiest representatives. Whoever 
made and collectively wolfed down their pint-sized egg creams fastest would be 
acknowledged as having the biggest mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges would include Zigman and his wife, Fran; Len Lesser (the uncle in 
"Seinfeld") and Martin Landau, who flew back especially from New York where he 
is filming "City Hall," to help officiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping coordinate the event would be Stanley Ross, former head writer for the 
TV series "Batman," now co-owner of Hamptons, a restaurant named after the 
city's favorite summer getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The main difficulty, Zigman and Ross soon discovered, was not in getting the 
judges or even attracting the participants. Rather, it was in obtaining the 
proper ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its name, an egg cream includes neither egg nor cream. Rather, 
according to no less an authority than the New York Times, the name derives 
either from its foamy head, which resembles beaten egg whites, or from the 
French eau creme -- creamed water. 
</P>
<P>
 What is certain about the egg cream, however, is that its modern incarnation 
was invented in Brooklyn, and that it consists mostly of seltzer water, 
garnished with a dash of milk.  
</P>
<P>
 Oh yes, it must also include two fingers full of Fox's U-Bet chocolate syrup. 
Trouble is, Fox's U-Bet is made only in Brooklyn, and the tiny company doesn't 
exactly have a major national distribution system.  
</P>
<P>
 After a series of futile phone calls, Ross considered bending the rules a bit 
and substituting Hershey's. Hershey's headquarters, after all, is merely a 
state line away away. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, using Hershey's would be like -- well, it would be like spritzing the 
seltzer water directly into the milk and syrup instead of letting it bounce off 
the side of the glass, the bubbles tingling up in a champagne-like delicacy. It 
just wouldn't be an egg cream.  
</P>
<P>
 So Ross spent an additional day making more calls, finally locating a local 
supplier. Paying top dollar, he had the yellow-and-red-label glass bottles of 
the precious syrup delicately shipped over to Hamptons. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest was on! 
</P>
<P>
 Staten Islanders, it turned out, preferred to genteelly sip on their drinks. 
Residents of Queens made a lot of noise, but when push came to shove couldn't 
quite hold their own. The Bronx may be home of the Bronx cheer -- but little 
else. And Manhattanites -- well, residents of the star borough, home of the 
Empire State and Chrysler buildings -- alas, Manhattanites came in a distant 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by singer Phil Margo of the Tokens ("The Lion Sleeps Tonight"), the 
Brooklyn contingent poured the U-Bet into their glasses, added milk and 
seltzer, stirred it all up -- and chugged down the frothy mix before residents 
of the other boroughs knew what had hit them. 
</P>
<P>
 During victory ceremonies, however, Margo and his teammates looked anything 
but lionish. In the heat of the moment, it seems, teammate Kelly Arnold had 
poured not two but eight rich fingers full of U-Bet syrup per pint. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Margo roared, "Nobody will ever question Brooklyn again. We've got the 
biggest mouths around.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've proved it."

 A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC; VIENNA'S GLITTERING MUSICAL SEASON LIGHTS UP AS WINTER 
BLANKETS AUSTRIA'S CITY OF MAESTROS; DESTINATION: AUSTRIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stephen Williams, Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Music is Vienna; Vienna is music. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been the way for centuries, and in this upcoming winter season -- 
when, for most Viennese, music is as much a necessity as a woolen coat and warm 
hearth -- there is opera, there is symphony. There is dance and ballet, and the 
Vienna Choir Boys in the Hofburg Chapel, and the fabulous Philharmonic in the 
Musikverein. 
</P>
<P>
 There is music beyond the classics: Maximilian Schell last summer donned the 
tweeds of Prof. Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady" in the beautifully restored 
Ronacher Theater, where the strains of Sondheim and Loewe and Rodgers 
reverberate off the boards. This year "Grease -- Das Musical" is in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music and Vienna; that's no cliche but a true description of the city," 
writes Andrea Schurian in the "Insight Guide to Vienna." "From the cradle to 
the grave, the Viennese are accompanied by music. In the concert hall listening 
to the Philharmonic or drinking Heuriger (young wine) and swaying to typical 
Viennese Schrammel songs -- life and love in Vienna is governed by music." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every great European classical composer, excepting Russians and 
Italians, lived in or passed through Vienna, most during the golden days of the 
Hapsburg dynasty. Much of Vienna's musical legacy was created by those not 
native to the city: The three composers central to Viennese Classicism were 
Mozart from Salzburg, Haydn from Lower Austria and Beethoven from Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 For visitors, there is no need to be deliberate in search of music in this 
city. Music -- robust, delicate, intoxicating -- will find you.  
</P>
<P>
 A piano medley of light classics -- a little Mozart, a little Johann Strauss 
-- wafted into my hotel room one midday as I tried to shed jet lag with an 
afternoon nap. An hour later on the Karntner Strasse, the pedestrian-only 
boulevard that runs from the Ringstrasse to St. Stephen's Cathedral 
(Stephansdom) and bisects the center city, an old woman in a long coat and a 
babushka played for schillings on her saxophone, a plaintive "Send in the 
Clowns." 
</P>
<P>
 Passing by the City Conservatory, I heard from an open window a student 
grappling with the first movement of Tchaikovsky's Violin Concerto. On a Sunday 
noon, I joined the crowds at the Hoher Markt to hear the old glockenspiel on 
the Art Nouveau "Anker" clock compete with the clomp of passing horses and 
carriages and the exhaust arias of BMWs. One night late -- again from my hotel 
-- a gathering of drunks in the street below serenaded us with an out-of-tune 
but thoroughly impassioned chorus from Beethoven's "Ode to Joy." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider these names, some past conductors of the Vienna State Opera: Gustav 
Mahler, Richard Strauss, Karl Bohm, Herbert von Karajan, Lorin Maazel and 
Claudio Abbado. The opera is a cherished form, and the Opera House a national 
shrine to culture. Critics rank it in the top five of Europe, and it ranks high 
as well with international stars: When Luciano Pavarotti played in the summer, 
scalpers had no trouble getting $800 for a ticket.  
</P>
<P>
 Tours of the State Opera, or Staatsoper, are offered daily for 40 schillings, 
about $4, in several languages, including English. Guides show off the 
artworks, the tapestries, the Grand Hall and the massive chandelier: three tons 
of Bohemian crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Musikverein, at Boesendorferstrasse 12, was built in 1870 and houses the 
Vienna Philharmonic during its season of concerts, while the Konzerthaus, at 
Lothringerstrasse 20, built earlier this century, accommodates rock and popular 
music as well as classical.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of Vienna's better sounds aren't free. On any given evening during the 
"season" -- from September until late June -- music lovers might have their 
choice of a half-dozen or more events. Obtaining tickets is quite another 
matter.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Vienna State Opera's hard-to-get-into reputation, devotees can 
almost always gain entry to the Staatsoper via Stehplatz , or standing-room. 
These cheap spots are less than $3 -- but involve queues, waits and a rail to 
lean on in nosebleed territory.  
</P>
<P>
 Much more difficult to obtain are tickets to the Vienna Philharmonic's 
concerts at the Musikverein; even the standing-room places go to subscribers. 
Visitors might get lucky and scarf a single seat at show time, but the better 
option is to hear the Philharmonic at the State Opera (where it is the "house 
band," not playing concerts but accompanying the opera). While Vienna is never 
without crowds of visitors, in the coming months the traveler may find music 
more accessible than it is in summer, fall and spring. The Austrian National 
Tourist Office in Los Angeles offers monthly guides to musical events in its 
Vienna Scene magazine; telephone (310) 477-3332. Here's what to look for this 
winter:  
</P>
<P>
 Opera: The State Opera, which traditionally opens in early fall, starts this 
year Dec. 14. The main stage has been under renovation for months, with 
engineers preparing a new hydraulic system. The opening promises much: The 
first night of Richard Strauss' "Elektra" features mezzo-soprano Christa 
Ludwig, in her farewell performances. The second evening, tenor Jose Carreras 
appears in the premiere of a new production of Giordano's "Fedora." For ticket 
information, call from the United States: tel. 011-43-1-51444-2959 or 2960, or 
fax 011-43-1-51444-2969.  
</P>
<P>
 Alternatives for opera lovers: The Volksoper, Vienna's second opera house, 
offers performances of "La Boheme," "Die lustige Witwe" ("The Merry Widow") and 
"Arabian Nights," among others. Information is available at the above number. 
Also, the Vienna Kammeroper specializes in contemporary and historical chamber 
opera, and performs every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday evening; tel. 
011-43-1-513-6072.  
</P>
<P>
 Symphony: On New Year's Day, the Vienna Philharmonic performs its annual 
Johann Strauss concert, conducted this year by Zubin Mehta. Tickets are 
impossible to get legitimately, but visitors may also consider concerts at the 
Konzerthaus (Beethoven's 9th Symphony by the Weiner Symphoniker on Dec. 30 and 
31) and the New Year's Concert of the Wiener Hofburg Orchestra; tel. 
011-43-1-712-1211. Other musical events of note: the Ninth Vienna Mozart 
Festival at the Konzerthaus, now to Dec. 22, and the Haydn Festival at the 
Musikverein, March 5-12.  
</P>
<P>
 Balls: Yes, the balls, where the star is the waltz. The most prestigious is 
the Vienna Opera Ball, a giant all-night party, attended by 4,000-5,000 
ticket-holders, including royalty and high-profile people from all over Europe. 
This year the ball is on Feb. 23 -- bring gowns and tails. Do not despair if 
tickets are gone -- about 300 balls take place in the city between New Year's 
and mid-March, and the public is invited to most of them. There's the 
Philharmonic Ball on Jan. 19, the Physicians' Ball on Jan. 28 and a Magicians' 
Ball for Children on Feb. 26. The Austrian Tourist Office in Los Angeles has 
information.  
</P>
<P>
 Events come and go, but Vienna's musical legacy is permanent. A traveler could 
spend days contemplating the history of music and walking in the footsteps of 
great composers. From the 18th Century -- Haydn, Brahms, Mozart and others -- 
through the waltz and the Strausses, to Arnold Schoenberg and the "New School" 
of Viennese music, one might easily spend a lifetime studying the way music 
intertwines with daily life here.  
</P>
<P>
 A good place to begin is at the end, so to speak: the Central Cemetery. The 
Viennese, it is said, spend an inordinate amount of time reflecting on death, 
and planning for the end. A schone Leiche , or beautiful funeral, is what a 
Viennese saves for: The idea is to achieve the kind of grandeur in death that 
was so elusive during life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Cemetery -- the Zentralfriedhof -- in the 11th District takes up 
an extraordinary 495 acres, but it is only a small section -- Grove 32A, the 
Musiker section -- that is the final resting place of giants. Here is the 
Rodin-esque tombstone of Brahms, with the composer resting his head on his 
hands; the marker to Beethoven, embellished with a golden harp and butterfly; 
the tombs of Johann Strauss and his wife, Adele; the graves of Schubert, Gluck, 
von Suppe, Josef Lanner and Hugo Wolf. It is a touching place.  
</P>
<P>
 There is no grave for Austria's honored composer, Mozart, although there is a 
memorial to him in the Central Cemetery. Mozart died at the age of 37, 
impoverished and alone. There is a statue and plaque in the St. Marx Cemetery 
in the 3rd District over what may be his grave, but no one knows for sure where 
he lies.  
</P>
<P>
 If music is the soul of Vienna, Mozart is the essence of the music. His 
fluency in composition and interpretation are legend, and his work was 
prodigious. So were his homes: He had 13 addresses in Vienna.  
</P>
<P>
 Viewing Milos Forman's film "Amadeus" is good preparation for seeking out 
Mozart in Vienna (even though it was filmed in Prague). The obligatory first 
stop is the Mozart House, or Figarohaus , at Domgasse 5, very close to St. 
Stephen's. In this small apartment, where Mozart spent only three years, he 
composed "Le Nozze di Figaro," 12 quintets, four quartets, three sonatas for 
piano and two for violin, and a fantasy in C minor. Mozart here received Haydn 
and Beethoven as visitors. The reconstructed building is now a seven-room 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a wealth of Mozartiana in Vienna. At Rauhensteingasse 8 is the site 
of Mozart's "death house," his 13th address in Vienna where he wrote "Die 
Zauberflote" ("The Magic Flute") and Requiem and where he died Dec. 5, 1791. 
The avid Mozart lover also should not neglect Schonbrunn Palace, a short subway 
ride from the city center, to visit the concert room where the child prodigy, 
at the age of 6, astonished Empress Maria Theresa with his piano playing.  
</P>
<P>
 Another Vienna giant of music, Franz Schubert, the composer of the Biedermeier 
period, was born in a house at No. 54 Nussdorferstrasse, which now serves as 
the Schubert Museum, restored to its original state. His fans can also visit 
the Dreimadelhaus at Schreyvogelgasse 10 where, legend has it, Schubert paid 
court to three young ladies from the same family. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, Ludwig van Beethoven wandered among 30 or more addresses 
during his years in Vienna -- much like Brahms, Schubert and Mozart. From the 
moment Beethoven arrived at age 22, he presented the city's royalty and its 
patrons with a different dynamic: He was unimpressive physically, uncouth and 
didn't dance in the city of the waltz. Yet when he died at 57, 20,000 Viennese 
turned out for his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pasqualati House at Molker Bastei 8, Beethoven lived from 1804 to 1815. 
The city operates the fourth-floor flat now as a museum where visitors can view 
oil paintings of some of the composer's friends and benefactors, and gaze on a 
piano typical of the kind Beethoven played. 
</P>
<P>
 If you listen closely -- and assume a Viennese imagination -- you may hear the 
master play.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: COAST STARLIGHT; MY BEAUTIFUL ROOMETTE; AMTRAK ROLLS TO SEATTLE 
WITH SCENERY AND STYLE, THOUGH THE BERTHS COULD USE A LITTLE DEBUNKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 My wife, Martha, is a Midwesterner, for whom railroads had always been a 
prosaic means of getting from one place to another. She was dubious when I 
proposed the weekend trip: a ride on the Coast Starlight train from Los Angeles 
to Seattle, with a quick return flight on a jetliner. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a Westerner, for whom any train ride is a rare and romantic adventure. I 
argued enthusiastically that the two-day journey by rail would be fun, taking 
us past some of the most spectacular scenery in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, I won. Sort of. We decided to go, but she got the lower bunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Our journey began when we were dropped off one sunny morning at Los Angeles' 
Union Station, the splendid, 55-year-old Spanish-Mediterranean railway terminal 
restored recently to much of its original glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha travels heavy, and I was staggering up the platform ramp with her 
weekend supply of clothing, books and other treasures when a robust man named 
Greg, who turned out to be our porter, came to my rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping me with the bags, Greg found our car and ushered us inside. Our 
spotlessly clean, stainless steel Amtrak car was a double-decker. There were 
toilets, a shower, baggage racks and several bedrooms on the first floor and 
another dozen or so bedrooms on the top floor. 
</P>
<P>
 After stashing our luggage, Greg led us to the tiny first-floor room -- 6 
1/2-feet long and 3 1/2-feet wide -- that would be our home for the next two 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Human dimensions are important when deciding what kind of accommodations you 
want on the train. Amtrak offers a variety of choices ranging from reclining 
armchairs in a very public coach car to private bedrooms varying in size from 
the minuscule "economy bedroom" with a toilet down the hall to a much larger 
"deluxe bedroom" with its own little bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 If you choose to sit up in public, the trip for two, including your plane 
flight home, will come to about $644 if you avoid the peak seasons, which 
include the Christmas holidays and most of the late spring and summer (when 
it's about $250 more). Add $129 for an ecomony bedroom, and another $139 on top 
of that for a deluxe bedroom. The bedrooms are a relatively good deal because, 
unlike the chair car, the price includes all meals on the train. 
</P>
<P>
 We had compromised on the economy bedroom, which would prove a tight fit for 
one of us at bedtime. As a daytime parlor it was fine -- two comfortably 
upholstered chairs the width of the room, facing one another with plenty of 
legroom between. There were reading lights, niches in which to store things and 
a fold-down table beneath the window that ran the length of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:55 a.m. -- right on time -- the train slithered out of the station and 
gathered speed. Within 45 minutes, the trackside warehouses, topless 
nightclubs, car washes and inflatable backyard pools of the San Fernando Valley 
were behind us, and we were gliding smoothly through the rugged hills and 
fertile farmlands of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The first call for lunch in the dining car next door came at 11:30, about the 
time that the train began its 104-mile run along the oceanfront from the 
Ventura River to Vandenberg Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 Following railroad custom, we were seated at a table for four with a couple we 
had never met. The four of us chatted amiably as the train flashed past Bates 
Beach -- the nude beach near Montecito -- before stopping at Santa Barbara. 
Since our meals were included with our room, Martha and I gorged shamelessly 
throughout the trip, making sure every slice of pie was a la mode. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch, Martha retreated to our room for a nap and I wandered another car 
forward to the lounge car, where conversation soon developed between former 
strangers. Equipped with swivel chairs and serviced by a snack bar and tavern 
on the lower level, the lounge car was an ideal spot from which to view the 
untamed Pacific shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 For 40 unspoiled miles -- from Gaviota, past Point Conception and Point 
Arguello to the rocket-launching gantries at Vandenberg -- we gazed out at 
beaches unreachable by public roads. It was just after we turned back inland -- 
in a lovely, oak-studded valley carpeted with sun-bleached grass -- that our 
train came to an unscheduled halt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hot box," said J. C. Collins, the train's chief of on-board services, 
explaining that one of the axle bearings on the lead locomotive had overheated 
and would have to cool off before we could start again. Everyone took the delay 
in stride, and I asked Collins if passengers were always so well behaved. 
</P>
<P>
 He chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We usually refer to this as the zoo train," he said. "While the other trains 
around the country generally cater to older crowds, this one passes through 
nine major college towns. The other trains barely have a pulse. This one has a 
major heartbeat." 
</P>
<P>
 After a half-hour delay, we got under way once more, but the hot-box problem 
continued and we lagged ever further behind schedule. Finally, near the Salinas 
Valley agricultural town of King City, our train crew admitted defeat and 
radioed ahead for a replacement locomotive. 
</P>
<P>
 It was close to nightfall when we started moving again, and Martha and I 
returned to our room. At our request, Greg converted it into sleeping quarters, 
flattening out the two armchairs and pushing them together to make a lower 
bunk; then pulling down an upper bunk from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha, who was finding train travel a lot more fun than she remembered it, is 
not very big, and her bunk -- 6 1/2 feet long and 2 feet, 4 inches wide -- was 
quite ample, as was her headroom, which permitted her to sit upright while she 
read and gazed out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm larger -- a tad under 6 feet and about 175 pounds. And my overhead bedtime 
slot was smaller, kind of like those on World War II U-boats. My bunk was long 
enough, but it was only 2 feet wide, and felt even narrower. With my left 
shoulder against the wall, my right extended to the metal edge of the bunk. I 
had to either pile my arms atop myself like cordwood or let one dangle, like a 
pendulum. The top-bunk headroom was only about 2 1/2 feet, too low to sit 
upright. No window up there, either. 
</P>
<P>
 But I slept, at least intermittently, while the train passed through Oakland, 
Sacramento and Redding. At 5 a.m., I was ready to get up. I managed to clamber 
down without awakening Martha, but to get my shoes out from under her lower 
bunk, I had to sprawl face down in the aisle outside our room and reach back 
through the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortified with a cup of the coffee that Greg had brewed and left for us, I 
went to the lounge car, where some other early risers and I watched a stunning 
sunrise behind the snow-covered slopes of Mt. Shasta. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the day was spent descending through the magnificent, forested canyons 
of the Cascade Mountains, again along routes largely unreachable by public 
road. At 5:30 p.m. we reached Portland, then crossed the Columbia River and the 
border into the state of Washington. Because we were running more than two 
hours late -- and would reach our destination after most restaurants had closed 
-- Amtrak treated us to an extra dinner. The sun was vanishing into the 
southern reaches of Puget Sound when we passed through Tacoma, and it was after 
10 p.m. when we finally got to Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 We could have caught a late-night flight back to Los Angeles, completing the 
whole trip in less than 48 hours. But we had decided to spend the night in 
Seattle and had booked a spacious, handsomely appointed room at the reasonably 
priced Inn at the Market, a 65-room hotel with European flair overlooking the 
waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Martha checked out some of the shops along 4th Avenue while 
I prowled the fish, flower and vegetable markets at the foot of Pike Street. 
After stuffing ourselves with salmon and crab at one of the agreeable touristy 
seafood restaurants on Pier 59, we settled into a cab for the 20-minute ride to 
SeaTac Airport, and the pleasantly uneventful, 2 1/2-hour flight home

DRINKING IN VIENNA'S OTHER PASSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stephen Williams 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Viennese soul is fed by music, but it's lubricated by coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Viennese go to a coffeehouse for coffee, but that's only part of it. Cafe 
life is set on a foundation of literary history, argument, romance, politics 
and gamesmanship. One may argue that the intellectualism of cafe society 
evaporated with World War II, but one may still sit on a velvet sofa and read 
over a Melange (half coffee, half milk), or eavesdrop on his neighbors over a 
Brauner (with just a little milk) and slice of rich chocolate torte. 
</P>
<P>
 Vienna today is experiencing a mini-Renaissance of its cafes; after the war, 
many were turned into shops or banks, and tradition wafted away on the winds of 
change. Following is a list of cafes, each with a personality and history and 
well worth a stop:  
</P>
<P>
 Central, Herrengasse 14. All who love the Cafe Central should first raise a 
cup in toast to Franz Kolschitzky. In the late 17th Century, Kolschitzky was 
granted permission to open a public coffeehouse as a reward for spying on the 
hated Turks. Some histories report that he baked the first Kipferl , a flaky 
pastry in the shape of a Turkish crescent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central is Vienna's most stunning cafe today and probably its most 
important. Among the guests who gathered to quarrel, flatter, philosophize and 
play chess were Theodor Herzl and Rainer Maria Rilke, Alfred Adler and Arthur 
Schnitzler, and Sigmund Freud and Lev Bronstein, a Russian emigre and socialist 
who liked to play chess. Later in life, Bronstein was known as Leon Trotsky.  
</P>
<P>
 Demel, Kohlmarkt 14. Not a true Kaffeehaus, but perhaps the ultimate 
Konditorei -- where the cakes and pastries come in a close second to the 
coffee. The 200-year-old Viennese institution, a must-stop on every tourist's 
agenda, still serves up some of the best pastries in the city. The Milchrahm 
Strudel -- a rich, souffle-ish concoction of egg and cream -- is a classic, the 
hot chocolate to die for. The service is often indifferent, the dining-room 
furniture uncomfortable, the prices high. But Demel is essential Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawelka, Dorotheergasse 6. As elegant as Demel is, Hawelka is funky. The worn 
tables and chairs, the sagging booths provide comfort these days to the 
pseudo-hip and celeb wanna-bes, and it's positively rowdy compared to the more 
conservative cafes in town. No longer a hangout for the elite and the artistes, 
but the coffee mit Schlag (whipped cream) is terrific and the waiters in their 
black suits are right out of a Sternberg film.  
</P>
<P>
 Schwarzenberg, on the Ring, the boulevard that encircles the center of the 
city, near the Schwarzenbergplatz. Sedate and cozy, the Schwarzenberg draws 
theater- and opera-goers (it's a five-minute walk from the State Opera) and 
provides the perfect perch for people-watching from its outdoor tables. Waiters 
are friendly, the Old World charm practically oozes here, and there's no better 
place for a winter nightcap. 
</P>
<P>
 Pruckl, Stubenring 24. Slightly worn at the edges, the Pruckl has decent food, 
high ceilings and terrific light for reading the daily papers. One of the great 
old cafes of the Ring.  
</P>
<P>
 Landtmann, on Dr. Karl Lueger Ring, next to the Burgtheater. Politicos, 
newspaper people and gadflies combine to make the splendid Landtmann a meeting 
place with an abundance of Gemutlichkeit (coziness). This cafe is one of 
Vienna's most picturesque, and most understated, and the outdoor cafe is packed 
when the weather accommodates. Stephen Williams

HIKING: PENNSYLVANIA: ON HISTORY'S TRAIL AT VALLEY FORGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reading Revolutionary War accounts in the history books gives some 
understanding of the suffering of our Colonial soldiers, but not until you 
visit Valley Forge, Pa., can you fully comprehend the hardship endured by Gen. 
George Washington and his troops during that terrible winter of 1777 to 1778. 
</P>
<P>
 Poorly clothed, ill-fed, wet and cold, 2,000 of the 12,000 soldiers died due 
to sickness and disease. Twelve men crowded into log shelters measuring 14 by 
16 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors went on to become a cohesive fighting force thanks to the moral 
resolve of George Washington and the soldiering skills taught by Prussian 
drillmaster Baron Frederick von Steuben. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley Forge National Historic Park you can view the extensive earthworks 
dug by soldiers to defend their position from the British, a reconstruction of 
Washington's headquarters, the parade ground, artillery (that rangers sometimes 
fire), plus more markers, memorials and monuments than you can count. 
</P>
<P>
 On display at the visitor center are artifacts, personal effects of the 
soldiers, a large collection of weaponry and George Washington's tent. Be sure 
to view the 18-minute film "Valley Forge: A Winter Encampment" that provides a 
dramatization of that fateful winter and helps visitors better appreciate the 
historic park. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some other Eastern historic parks that consist of a single building or 
battlefield, Valley Forge is a good-sized park -- 3,500 acres of rolling hills 
that are mighty easy on the eye. Hiking, cycling, horseback riding and 
picnicking are popular park activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley Forge is ringed with a six-mile-long paved biking and hiking path that 
tours the historic sites, monuments and brigade encampments. It's a pleasant 
enough way to see the sights, but the more secluded nature walk is the trail 
leading along the banks of the Schuylkill River. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuylkill River Trail, honored as a National Recreation Trail for its scenic 
and historic interest, follows the river on the bank opposite the army 
encampment. The pathway offers the beauty of the eastern woods and glimpses of 
deer and other wildlife. Plenty of benches en route offer the opportunity to 
rest and to contemplate the harshness of the soldiers' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Most visitors come to Valley Forge, located 20 miles from Philadelphia, in the 
summer, but the national historic park is open all year. The park service has a 
very active interpretive program with ranger talks and walks that include 
"Native Americans in the Revolution" and "Discipline, Muskets and Bayonets." 
One of the park's biggest events, "The March-in of the Continental Army Into 
Valley Forge," takes place every Dec. 19 to honor the Army's arrival on that 
date in 1777. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-mile-long ranger-led bird walk that departs from nearby Mill Grove 
Sanctuary (John Audubon's home) is a must-do for enthusiastic bird-watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Schuylkill River Trail Where: Valley 
Forge National Historic Park near Philadelphia, Pa. Distance: 6 miles round

VALLEY BRIEFING: THE GOLDEN YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 80 years since Universal Studios' Carl Laemmle said, "I hope I didn't 
make a mistake coming out here," the motion picture industry's migration to the 
Valley has proven successful, growing into the Valley's top industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Moviemaking's first moguls were lured west in the early 1900s by warm weather 
and the Valley's vast and varied terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Movies came to the Valley to stay when Warner Bros. moved to Burbank in the 
1920s. By 1940, Disney had moved to Burbank and film production in the Valley 
rivaled that in Hollywood. The 1930s and '40s were the studios' golden age, a 
time of peak production and attendance. Here's a look at the Valley's three 
largest studios. Warner Bros. Studioes 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Warner Bros. moved to Burbank in 1929, it had established itself 
as a leader in bringing sound to motion pictures. The four brothers -- Harry, 
Albert, Sam, and Jack -- started in the film business in 1903 with a 
nickelodeon, gradually expanding into distribution and production. 
</P>
<P>
 With "The Jazz Singer," they made the first film with partial sound. Despite 
this early jump on competitors, the studio's move to color film was slow and 
its biggest successes remained black-and-white film noir movies. The studio 
gained a reputation as a bare-bones, cost-cutting operation by making movies 
economically and quickly. Directors often produced as many as five features a 
year. The Films 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros. specialized in low-budget, fast-paced gangster sagas, dramas, 
comedies and musicals in the 1930s. Film costs ranged between $200,000 and 
$400,000. "The Public Enemy," for example, starring James Cagney, cost the 
studio $200,000. 06,20,04,08,08,05,04 Types of Films 1935 1945 Action/Adventure

 Universal founder Carl Laemmle, an immigrant clothing manufacturer, opened his 
first nickelodeon in Chicago in 1906. By 1913, Laemmle had three small studios 
in Hollywood and was looking to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Laemmle purchased a 230-acre chicken ranch on the northeastern edge of the 
Cahuenga Pass for $165,000, named it Universal City and opened the studio in 
1915.

<P>
 Equipped for both studio and exterior shooting, the site included a zoo with a 
variety of exotic animals and hundreds of horses and cows. A 300-by-500-foot 
main stage could accommodate up to five productions at once. For 25, visitors 
got a box lunch and, for the first time ever, were able to see movies made. The

 In the 1930s, Universal established itself as the king of horror films. 
Adventure films such as the "Flash Gordon" series were also popular during the 
'30s. Universal produced big-hit movies such as "King of Jazz" ($1.65 million) 
in 1930 as well as less expensive hits such as "Frankenstein" ($250,000) in 
1931. 06,20,04,08,08,05,04 Types of Films 1935 1945 Action/Adventure 9 8 War 0

 Universal turned out a large number of films in the 1920s, but was slow to 
change over to sound. Hard-hit by the Depression, the studio lost money 
throughout the 1930s. Stars such as musical performer Deanna Burbin and comedy 
duo Abbott & Costello helped boost profits.

1920s. But its finances suffered from the Depression in the early '30s and 
recovery was slow. Its profit margin was about $10,000 per picture in 1935.

 In late 1941, Warner Bros. purchased the play "Everybody Comes to Rick's" for 
$20,000. After a title change, rewriting and juggling of lead actor, 
"Casablanca" began filming in May, 1943, without a finished script. Rewriting 
continued through shooting, which was completed in 59 days at a cost of 
$950,000. "Casablanca" was filmed almost entirely on the studio's backlot, 
transformed into French Morocco. The backlot's "French Street" provided the 
setting for the Paris flashback sequence, a setting still used in films. Only 
one scene was filmed off the lot -- the arrival of Maj. Strasser at 
Casablanca's airport was filmed at the old Metropolitan Airport in Van Nuys. 
The concluding airport segment was filmed on Stage One at the studio. Walt 
Disney Studios 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney studio was an influential part of the migration of the motion 
picture industry to Burbank, even though it wasn't considered a major studio 
typical of the golden years. Before moving to Burbank, Disney's Hollywood 
studio produced cartoons and animated characters that became 'star' in their 
own right. 
</P>
<P>
 When the company outgrew its Hollywood site, Walt Disney purchased a 51-acre 
lot in Burbank in 1939, where he built a $1-million studio. The studio 
resembled a campus more than other studios, which had high walls and sound 
stages. Yet it was on that 'campus' that many animation techniques were 
pioneered. Disney highlights and finances

BLINDSIDED / ORANGE COUNTY'S FINANCIAL CRISIS; THE UNTHINKABLE FALL OF THE 
GOLDEN ORANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was clean, wide-open and full of promise. A pristine sprawl of red-tiled 
affluence and sunny self-confidence, embodying everything Los Angeles was not. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time I cruised down the San Diego Freeway in 1983 to visit Orange 
County, a rush of words and images came to mind: Orderly. Focused. Sober. 
</P>
<P>
 You couldn't help but think that anything seemed possible here because it was 
free from the urban baggage and complexities of its neighbor to the north. 
There was plenty of land to be developed, much of it still beautiful, and if 
there were countywide problems, fiscal health was not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 How could it be, in a place so rich, so relentlessly frugal? The notion of 
Orange County filing for bankruptcy and going belly up in the bond market was 
laughable. A nightmare for other communities to ponder, but not the Golden 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second chance for Southern California," a Newport Beach 
businessman told me back then, proudly showing off the marina's glitter and 
sparkle. "We're not going to mess it up. This isn't New York or L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the unthinkable happened. Stung by a $1.5-billion loss in the bond 
market that seemed to increase daily, Orange County officials circled the 
wagons and told the world that, for now at least, they can't pay all their 
bills. Like a rube, the county that prided itself on sturdy, conservative 
values lost its shirt in the Wall Street casino. Overnight, it has become a 
target of nationwide scorn. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to the Orange County I knew, not so long ago? 
</P>
<P>
 Comeuppance is a word we're hearing a lot these days, a feeling that the 
region's fiscal Waterloo is somehow punishment for having had it so good, and 
for so long. You live on the margins, you die on the margins, as they say in 
the bond market. But there are human consequences here: How do you gloat about 
just desserts to parents and children whose schools may be in jeopardy? 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, how do you tell folks who have lived their version of the 
California dream that the wolf is at the door? 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who appreciates Orange County can't help but celebrate its strengths . 
. . and worry about its future. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of "Manhattan," Woody Allen conjures up an old love affair with 
random, vivid memories. It's no different for me when I remember the best of 
Orange County: Empanadas in Santa Ana and pho bo in Little Saigon. Sunrise at 
Huntington Beach with surfers and sea gulls. Pickup basketball games near the 
water in Laguna Beach, and the Christmas bedlam of South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't see these images in news stories about the bankruptcy, and the 
national media are largely to blame. For years, they've reduced the place to 
hollow cliches and institutions. Birthplace of Richard Nixon. Home to the John 
Birch Society. Land of Disney and Farm of Knott's Berry. The real Orange County 
is something else. Somewhere else. Locals have known this for years, rightly 
insisting that they are different than the stereotypes would have you believe. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? Los Angeles big shots seem tired compared to Orange County's 
entrepreneurs. Impatient and creative, they've built a community where money 
breeds success, a middle-class theme park where Mercedeses clog the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland and Anaheim Stadium might draw huge crowds, putting Orange County 
on the map, but the county is also a haven for private moments, a shrine to the 
almost sensual joys of seclusion. Here, people build walls around 
master-planned communities and enjoy the good life undisturbed. Windows open 
onto quiet patios, not the street, and daily life is not public life. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that way from the beginning. When the first rush of residents came 
pouring into Orange County after World War II, there was a brash confidence to 
the place, a beguiling immunity that seemed to hold trouble at arm's length. 
Thousands came here, shedding the past for a piece of the suburban rock. 
</P>
<P>
 They cruised down newly designed freeways, filling up subdivisions and packing 
shopping centers as quickly as they could be built. Fueled by the 1980s 
economic boom, Orange County rocked with good times and steady growth. There 
were steaks on the grill and cappuccinos on the beach. The county was 
prospering even as the recession kicked in, its fiscal health unquestioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Did people see danger signs on the horizon, like a widening income gap between 
rich and poor or a fiscal imbalance between richer cities in the south and 
older towns in the north? They didn't seem to worry much. When reporters dug up 
a raft of problems, like S & L shenanigans and the growth of fraudulent boiler 
room operations, Orange County residents shrugged them off. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there were hidden slums in Garden Grove, ugly gang wars and other 
reminders that social problems could not be ignored forever. But the 
subdivision walls stood tall, keeping the bad news out. Until last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the region's fiscal meltdown is big news on front pages and TV screens 
around the world. It has jolted Orange County's confidence like an 8.7 
aftershock and unleashed a feeding frenzy, especially on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in New York, where I now live, revenge is sweet. The first blast of 
winter this week was no match for the chilly contempt many feel for Orange 
County, and it's not hard to understand why. The Big Apple has long been 
accused of fiscal irresponsibility -- call it the Lourdes of liberal excess -- 
yet now the shoe is on the other foot. And some folks couldn't wait to pounce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County, California, one of the richest, most conservative Republican 
counties in America, woke up yesterday morning more broke and foul-smelling 
than Democratic New York City at its worst," wrote columnist Juan Gonzales in 
the Daily News. Other U.S. municipalities have invested their public funds 
wisely and more cautiously, he noted, "but not smart Orange County. . . . The 
Republicans in California, it seems, could learn from New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Take a deep breath, Orange County. There may be some truth here. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the rebuilding process will be to learn from past mistakes, and New 
York City's near-brush with bankruptcy in the 1970s sparked major reforms to 
guard against runaway, risky investment policies. Just as they did after the 
Los Angeles riots, Gotham officials responded quickly to the Orange County 
debacle this week, insisting that it couldn't happen in their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "New York City does not engage in this practice," said City Controller Alan 
Hevesi, flanked by other big shots. "The investment practices that are at issue 
here are not normal practices in the finance industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, nothing is normal when the nation's fifth-largest county declares 
bankruptcy. History is being written as the crisis unfolds, and if grass-roots 
outrage is any indication, it will be tough for state, county and local 
officials to duck responsibility for the disaster. Heads will certainly roll. 
</P>
<P>
 But when we total up the losses, the story won't just be about money or 
politics. It will be about people and how their lives are changed forever by 
this past week. When I think about the folks who live in Orange County, a rush 
of words and images come to mind: Resourceful. Patient. Resilient. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankrupt is not one of them.

BLINDSIDED / ORANGE COUNTY'S FINANCIAL CRISIS; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE MONEY?;

SAGA OF A FINANCIAL CATASTROPHE UNFOLDS.

<P>
 There was a certain smugness about how Orange County went about the business 
of investing its money. But there always seemed to be good reason to crow. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the first of the terrible days. In the opening hours of the crisis, 
it all seemed like a confusing bad dream, with incomprehensible losses in a 
financial medium that was like Latin to a layman. Derivatives. Things that lost 
money as interest rates went up. It was all so unreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Now those terrible days are beginning their march into weeks, which will 
surely turn into months of agonizing choices and pointed fingers and, of 
course, lawsuits. But those first days will always be the worst, the time when 
the realization struck that Orange County Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. 
Citron had blundered badly. Would the teachers be paid? Would someone be around 
to pick up the trash? Are we really cold, flat broke? 
</P>
<P>
 There are dozens who have been involved in this, the most dramatic and fateful 
event ever to befall Orange County. They talk of sleepless nights and tears, of 
careers and investment portfolios gone up in smoke. Spring 1994 / The Wolf 
Begins to Howl 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN MOORLACH 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidate for county treasurer-tax collector 
</P>
<P>
 Voices from the past now look so prescient, and none was more forceful than 
accountant John Moorlach, Citron's Republican opponent in the last election. In 
discussing his losing campaign, Moorlach now talks like a man who has been 
vindicated. He described in detail how Citron first stalled, then grudgingly 
gave him a copy of the county's investment portfolio in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorlach: "I finally got his portfolio in readable condition on May 2, a month 
before the election. I shopped it around to bond brokers around the country. 
They took all kinds of evening hours to pore over it. They were just flipping 
out. He'd increased his leverage from $4 billion in March of 1993 to $12 
billion in March of 1994. He not only bet that rates would go down, he bet 
really big." 
</P>
<P>
 On May 31, Moorlach, who was destined to lose his election by a large margin 
the following week, sent an eight-page letter to Thomas Riley, chairman of the 
County Board of Supervisors. What was dismissed by the supervisors then now 
seems to have been exactly on the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter: "Every prudent investor chooses safety of principal as the top 
priority. Next comes the need for liquidity. The last priority is achieving 
yields. It's time to get back to basics. Mr. Citron has these priorities 
inversed. He has focused primarily on yields. He has poor liquidity. He has put 
our principal at risk. He is willing to make highly leveraged, highly 
speculative and highly aggressive investments. I am very uncomfortable with 
that and you should be, too." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, few heeded Moorlach's warning. He did, however, help 
convince the city of Costa Mesa, where he lives, to pull most of its funds from 
the county investment pool.

 SANDRA GENIS

<P>
 Former Mayor, City of Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 One who was most concerned was then-Mayor Sandra Genis, who still rues the 
fact that the city was unable to extract all of its money. Still, the city 
managed to withdraw $11 million of the $14 million that was in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Genis: "Maybe if I had just beat my head against the wall a little harder, 
pushed a little more. Maybe when I got real worried last October I should have 
gotten real obnoxious and beat on people. I know how to be pushy. But I was 
trying to be cool, to do this quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to withdraw, we didn't want a public flurry. If there was a run on 
the bank, we didn't want to cause it." 
</P>
<P>
 Others were more trusting. The city of Cypress had a relatively small 
$5.85-million investment and chose to stay with the tried-and-true Citron even 
though interest rates were on the rise.

<P>
 Age: "Citron won that (political race) overwhelmingly and assured everyone 
that everything was fine. I think everyone was comfortable with that after his 
statement in which he reassured everyone that he's been in that office for 16 
years or whatever it is and he's always had a high rate of return." His 
reassurances "eased my fear that there was something wrong there. There was no 
cause for alarm and there was no cause at that point in time to really question 
it." Nov. 10 
</P>
<P>
 'I Did Nothing Wrong' 
</P>
<P>
 WILLIAM G. STEINER 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor William G. Steiner has a notation on his calendar for the 
date of Nov. 10. It says "Ernie Schneider 2:15." It was on that date that the 
county administrative officer notified the supervisors individually that 
outside consultants were being hired to examine the portfolio and its value. 
</P>
<P>
 That briefing, according to sources, came only after Assistant Treasurer 
Matthew Raabe threatened to quit if something was not done to improve the 
portfolio. But even with this official admission that all was not well with the 
county's investments, Steiner said the belief was that Citron could pull the 
proverbial rabbit out of the hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner: "I still had a feeling that Bob Citron had his arms around the 
problem and that he would save the day. Ten years ago, I was a school board 
trustee, a member of the Board of Education in the Orange Unified School 
District. We had really severe financial problems. Citron came to the rescue 
and produced a greater return on the investment. It literally kept us from 
laying off teachers and increasing class size." 
</P>
<P>
 This time, though, there were no miracles. Instead, there was a somber news 
conference called by county officials to announce that the unthinkable was 
happening. On the first day of December, Schneider and Raabe told an 
incredulous group of reporters that Orange County was $1.5 billion in the hole. 
</P>

<P>
 DAVE LOPEZ 
</P>
<P>
 Reporter, KCBS-TV 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference was scheduled for 2 p.m. and Dave Lopez, a longtime 
television reporter for KCBS-TV, was given the assignment of what was billed as 
a somewhat innocuous-sounding discussion of county finances. The assignment 
editors, though, were less than enthused and instead ordered him to Huntington 
Beach for a story about students chewing gum laced with LSD. 
</P>
<P>
 But things quickly began to change as word got around that the news conference 
to discuss finances could be big. Lopez was ordered to the Hall of 
Administration at the last moment, only to find the conference room crowded 
with reporters who are not usually there. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez: "I'd done interviews with Citron before and he was just sitting over 
there all quiet and meek. And I was thinking, something's weird about this, 
really weird. Wall Street reporters were there, all the big news services. 
After listening to Raabe and the other guys, I thought, 'We gotta get Citron to 
comment.' So I said, 'Mr. Citron, a lot of people are blaming you, saying this 
is your fault.' He started to answer and I said, 'No, no, you've got to get 
closer to the mike.' And he says, 'I did nothing wrong. I feel as though I have 
nothing to apologize for.' And then they whisked him off. It was all of nine 
seconds.

 Word began to spread. Maya Decker, president of the Newport-Mesa Federation of 
Teachers, said she got word on her telephone answering machine that there were 
going to be big headlines Friday and that the news would not be good. Her 
school district had $47 million invested in the now-bankrupt pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Decker: "I went to the office in the morning. We take three papers, and I 
looked at all of them. 'Frenzy' was one of the words in a headline. I thought 
they were overplaying it. . . . My feeling was a lot of people were running 
around shouting the sky is falling before having serious time to reflect on 
it."

 DAN MILLER 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana neighbor of Citron 
</P>
<P>
 News of the financial disaster sent county authorities and news organizations 
scurrying while Citron dropped from sight. Citron's Santa Ana neighbor, Dan 
Miller, noticed that all was not as usual in the neighborhood. There seemed to 
be a lot of cars in front of Citron's house. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller: "I didn't talk to him that weekend at all. I didn't see him outside. 
He doesn't usually have a lot of visitors. That was the only inkling I had that 
something was going on until it broke out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was Sunday when they (the media) started coming around. Most of 
the questions were 'Have you seen Bob? Have you talked to him? How is he?' They 
were just coming up asking. Then they'd go away, sit in their car for four or 
five hours, seeing if people are coming and going. I went to talk to Bob and I 
told him, 'I think it would be good to say something. People are saying they're 
concerned about your health.' Friends of his were calling, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner kept to his weekend schedule. He was on his way to a football game 
when it became clear to him that events were veering out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner: "I was in the car and the car phone rang. I was taking guests to the 
Rams game. The CAO (county administrative officer), Ernie Schneider, called. He 
said you have to come. We're being told that the SEC (Securities and Exchange 
Commission) is in the treasurer's office, that they're talking tough as far as 
freezing the investment pool. . . . There's a possibility of civil fraud 
charges against Bob Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Things are going off a cliff.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, Citron signed a resignation letter. It was only one sentence long: 
"After much thought and soul-searching and with much regret, I have decided for 
the benefit of the county of Orange to resign my elected office." Dec. 6 
</P>
<P>
 The Day It All Collapsed 
</P>
<P>
 If matters had seemed swift and tumultuous to that point, they only 
intensified as the drama of the next couple of days unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 MARIAN BERGESON 
</P>
<P>
 State Senator 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, state Sen. Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach, who will take a 
seat on the Board of Supervisors next month, began receiving calls from county 
officials telling her of the resignation. Even with the political cat fight 
being waged by Willie Brown to retain his speakership, she boarded a plane and 
flew to Orange County. One of the ironies was that she had withdrawn her 
endorsement of Moorlach during the campaign, fearing that his claims might 
somehow affect the status of the investment pool.  
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson: "It was a shock, the severity of it. It was inconceivable that this 
could have happened to the county." 
</P>
<P>
 The inconceivable, though, only got worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Dec. 6, will go down as one of the longest days in Orange County 
history. No one knows exactly when it began for Citron and Schneider and the 
county support staff -- or even if they slept at all -- but Steiner's day 
started at 2:55 a.m. with a call from Steven E. Lewis, county 
auditor-controller. The message was terse. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner: "I was told to come down to the Hall of Administration. Urgent. I was 
there in 30 minutes. (Supervisor) Gaddi Vasquez was the first to arrive. Tom 
Riley was second. We were in separate offices on the third floor, and that's 
where some incredible things occurred. We were told that the county would 
potentially default on $1.2 billion in bonds at 11:30 a.m. Tuesday, Pacific 
Standard Time, 2:30 p.m. New York time." 
</P>
<P>
 As Orange County slept unaware, the drama began to unfold at the Hall of 
Administration. The Brown Act, which keeps more than two supervisors from 
meeting together at a time, forced the county staff to race up and down the 
office stairs and deliver their early morning message of doom over and over and 
over again. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 HARRIETT AND IRV WIEDER 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor and her husband 
</P>
<P>
 One message that was not immediately delivered was for Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder. 
</P>
<P>
 As the other supervisors began to mobilize for the emergency meeting, Wieder 
slept on. County Finance Director Eilene Walsh had tried to reach the 
slumbering supervisor but dialed the wrong number. An hour later, a Huntington 
Beach police officer was dispatched to Wieder's home with orders to bring her 
to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 As the officer banged on the door, Wieder and her husband, Irv, panicked. Do 
they let the officer in? Then the phone rang. It was Walsh. Wieder knew the 
news would be bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriett Wieder: "I've been here 16 years, and the only other times (I'd been 
summoned) had been an earthquake and a flood. So this was a major disaster -- a 
10 1/2 on the Richter scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Irv Wieder: "We didn't go into too much discussion. We just started getting 
dressed as fast as we could. I think Harriett was reviewing the upside and the 
downside of what could be the worst, what could be the best, and who does she 
know who could be of help. Should she call the White House? Should she call 
(Sen. Barbara) Boxer? Should she call (Sen. Dianne) Feinstein?" 
</P>
<P>
 Here is the problem that was facing the supervisors: Not only were they 
confronted with their county's financial health going up in flames, but Raabe 
was talking about selling off the portfolio, "the whole damn thing, the whole 
works," Steiner said, in an effort to recoup at least something. That made the 
local officials mighty nervous. And when lawmakers are nervous, they hit the 
phones.

<P>
 PETE WILSON 
</P>
<P>
 Governor of California 
</P>
<P>
 They called the three biggest investors in the investment pool. They called 
the senators. Steiner called the governor. It was 7:30 a.m. Two hours later the 
board began yet another in an interminable string of meetings. And at 9:45, 
Steiner was called away. Pete Wilson was on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner: "Pete Wilson is in San Diego giving a breakfast speech. He's going to 
get on a plane. I explain to him the magnitude of the problem. I ask him: Will 
you please call Arthur Levitt, chairman of the SEC? What I was hoping for was 
the SEC to freeze trading, freeze the pool and prohibit the investment bankers 
from liquidating their positions; $1.2 billion was due in an hour and a half. 
What did Pete Wilson say? 'Oh my God.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: "It was shock . . . and great concern as to what the dimensions of the 
problem would turn out to be."

<P>
 CHRISTOPHER COX 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Representative 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) emerged Tuesday morning 
from the heady atmosphere of a conference room where he had just been elected 
to a leadership role in the new Congress, only to find himself facing a bank of 
television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox: "I walked out . . . fresh from a 148-77 vote and had this note thrust 
into my hands. I said, 'I'm taken aback by the phone message I just received. 
It says Orange County may declare bankruptcy by this afternoon.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The 10:15 a.m. phone message, which had been handed to Cox by a staffer, was 
from James McConnell, the county's Washington lobbyist. "URGENT," it read, 
"Orange County may declare bankruptcy by 1:30 this afternoon. Please call the 
SEC to urge them to get the federal court to freeze the asset pool." 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the news conference, at which he made his comments and thus 
became the first to leak the extraordinary news of the bankruptcy, Cox called 
McConnell to confirm that he had left the message. McConnell, in reply, said he 
had and that he had left similar messages for other members of the delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst of the worst did happen. At 5:01 p.m. Tuesday, Orange County became 
the largest municipality in U.S. history to file for federal bankruptcy 
protection. The decision sent shock waves through Wall Street. The county's 
all-important bond rating, which determines, among other things, at what 
interest rate money may be borrowed, took a dive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TOM RILEY 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman, county supervisors 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the decision, Supervisor Riley insisted the county had done 
the right thing, despite the consequences of their action. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley: "I have taken great pride in talking about a great county in which to 
live, what its credit ratings were, how we did everything better and still the 
cost to live here was not that great. I think we'll get back there. It's going 
to take some time but I think we have people with the will, the staff with the 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 One uncertainty is just where help will come from. The bankruptcy filing was 
made only after last ditch appeals to the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: "We at this point can't say what the state can do. But I doubt that we 
can do more, frankly, than possibly advance payments that might otherwise be 
due to assist their cash flow problem. I am deliberately not raising anybody's 
expectations because I think there is a very limited role that the state can 
play." 
</P>

<P>
 MICHAEL REESE 
</P>
<P>
 Aide to state Treasurer Kathleen Brown 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the crash, Citron and others from his office called state Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown looking for a life preserver from Sacramento. Although state 
officials have no statutory authority to bail out the Orange County fund, Brown 
aide Michael Reese said her office is keeping an hour-by-hour watch on Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese, like Wilson, said the state could do nothing to help Orange County and 
that the treasurer's office knew nothing of the impending collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese: "We asked to see their portfolio and they have yet to deliver it to 
us." Dec. 7

 ROBERT GORE 
</P>
<P>
 Bond trader 
</P>
<P>
 While Citron's high-risk strategies -- aided by some of Wall Street's biggest 
firms -- were no secret on Wall Street, Orange County's rapid descent still 
caught many municipal bond traders by surprise. It was not until the county 
announced the investment pool's $1.5-billion loss that "alarm bells went off 
for everybody," said Robert Gore, a municipal trader at Crowell, Weedon & Co. 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore: "It was like a death in the family. The initial reaction was that 
everybody was scared. There was a kind of panic trading that went on early 
(Wednesday) morning. The market for a lot of municipals just dried up. It 
subsequently rebounded a little bit, but it was still kind of an eerie 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>

 RANDY SMOLIK 
</P>
<P>
 Bond analyst 
</P>
<P>
 But the loss and the county's filing for protection from creditors under 
Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code were not the only shockers for the 
investment community. A big jolt came from one of their own. Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan, appearing before the Joint Economic Committee, said 
there were no plans for a federal fix. To Randy Smolik, a senior analyst at 
Municipal Market Data of Boston, it was as if Greenspan "dropped a bomb." 
</P>
<P>
 Smolik: "Greenspan was just going to let Orange County go down the drain." 
</P>
<P>
 Early Wednesday morning there was action elsewhere as well. Tension had 
reached the breaking point at the county tax collector's office, where clerks 
had been besieged for days by irate taxpayers. 
</P>

 UNNAMED CASHIER

 County tax collector's office 
</P>
<P>
 A cashier, who would not give her name because she feared for her job and her 
safety, watched as a man paid his property taxes, then spotted a picture of 
Citron still on the wall despite his resignation three days earlier. The man 
swore an oath. 
</P>
<P>
 The cashier: "He said, 'If you don't get that f------ picture down, I'm coming 
back with a lynch mob and a gun and take care of this place.' He looked very 
sane to me, very normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Other taxpayers were venting their anger by writing angry messages on their 
tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "You name it. They are writing all kinds of things." Dec. 8 
</P>
<P>
 A Step Toward Recovery 
</P>
<P>
 There is still no normalcy here on California's Gold Coast, formerly land of 
the largest luxury car dealerships and now home to the nation's biggest 
bankruptcy. But the first signal that, perhaps, this crisis could be managed 
came Thursday, when the beleaguered county named former state Treasurer Thomas 
W. Hayes as financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than 24 hours after Hayes said at a briefing that he was "strongly urged 
by Gov. Wilson" to take the job, he had a makeshift office in a former 
conference room at the Hall of Administration and was hard at work at his job. 
On Friday, the sight of Hayes on the job gave great comfort to Supervisor 
Riley, a retired Marine Corps general who served in the Pacific Theater in 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley: "I went over at 7 a.m. He was in his office having coffee. I realized 
he had Marine training. He's here, working. He was talking on the phone when I 
walked in. I was pleased to see he was here. The last several days, I had a 
little better feeling that we're in the right direction. He's here."

BLINDSIDED / ORANGE COUNTY'S FINANCIAL CRISIS; PRELUDE TO THE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Understanding the roots of Orange County's financial crisis requires a review 
of growth in population and services and the shifts in sources of income. In 
the 1980s, county government grew fat, with a prosperous and growing tax base 
and well-heeled population. Between 1980 and 1990, the population grew more 
quickly than that of Los Angeles County. Along with demographic changes came 
changes in affluence in Orange County, as median income remained significantly 
higher than that of its more populous neighbor to the north.

 Critical Financial Shifts 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's growth meant increasing demand for schools, police and 
services. But in the early 1990s, property values had peaked and recession was 
taking its toll. Between 1991 and the current fiscal year, the bulk of county 
general fund revenues shifted dramatically from property taxes to income from 
interest-bearing investments. The increasing dependence on revenue from the 
investment pool set Orange County up for last week's dramatic collapse.

<P>
 ROBERT L. CITRON 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, 69, Orange County's treasurer and tax collector after public 
disclosure that the value of his investment fund had lost at least $1.5 
billion, 20% of its capital. 
</P>
<P>
 A HIGH ROLLER 
</P>
<P>
 His investment policies were earning unusually high returns, attracting 
governmental investors from outside Orange County.In a Times interview in 1988, 
he boasted about making $122,700 for county government through a single 
overnight transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 POLITCAL SUCCESS 
</P>
<P>
 He was first elected county tax collector in 1970, taking office in 1971 and 
immediately applying his personal stamp. 
</P>
<P>
 His only opposition to reelection came early this year from an accountant who 
said Citron's tactics were too risky. Citron pooh-poohed the criticism and won 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
 A PERSONAL TOUCH 
</P>
<P>
 Soon county taxpayers were instructed on their tax bills to make their checks 
out to Citron by name. Tax envelopes bore the maxim "Citron Says: Taxes Paid on 
Time Never Draw Fines." When a county supervisor objected, Citron mockingly 
held a contest for a new jingle, himself suggesting "A diller, a dollar, pay 
your taxes or I'll holler." 
</P>
<P>
 DODGING THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fund's troubles were disclosed, he has remained in seclusion, 
refusing interviews and issuing only a terse denial that any of his actions 
were for the benefit of brokers. STEVE EMMONS

 The Issues: All but three of California's counties elect their treasurers. The 
theory is that an elected treasurer is independent of political influence and 
accountable directly to the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But will Orange County's debacle result in county treasurers who are appointed 
rather than elected? Former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron was 
credited with financial know-how, but do elected officials bring the proper 
expertise to the office? Is their accountability elusive because voters are 
hard-pressed to know the names of their county treasurers, let alone evaluate 
their performance? 
</P>
<P>
 The accountability for Orange County's problems is still being determined. Who 
should have recognized the problems and didn't? Observers expect voters will 
make their determination at the ballot box -- an impact that could extend 
through several layers of government. Dana Reed 
</P>
<P>
 Former Orange County transportation commissioner and a supervisorial 
candidate: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County voters in June had a chance to reject Citron's risky investment 
policies -- but didn't, Reed notes. "The fact of the matter is that this very 
specific problem and situation was the subject of the campaign in June, (John 
J.W.) Moorlach versus Citron. The voters can't say, 'I had nothing to do with 
this.' This was presented to them and it was a very black-and-white issue: Do 
you want a higher interest rate that is risky? Or do you want a more 
conservative, more traditional management of the public funds? And relatively 
few people chose the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now comes the question, why is the treasurer elected in the first place? The 
treasurer of Los Angeles is not elected. The treasurer of Los Angeles is a 
professional money manager who is not looking to please the electorate and

 Pringle suggests considering changing the way a treasurer is selected. "When 
you're dealing with this type of expertise in this day and age, I would 
consider ensuring that the treasurer has a certain knowledge base, a certain 
expertise," he says. "You are not dealing with someone to make political 
decisions, you are dealing with someone to make financial decisions."

 Former Irvine mayor and 1992 Democratic presidential candidate:

 "It's a lot easier to borrow and let future generations pay the bill rather 
than doing the right thing, which sometimes means you have to stand up and say 
we are a high-service community with well-kept streets and neighborhoods and 
all of this costs money," Agran says. "And we have to ask ourselves if we are 
going to pay for it (with higher taxes). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is going to have a powerful, sobering effect on the electorate, 
and I do think there will be great anger vented against those public officials 
who do bear responsibility here -- that means elected officials and appointed 
officials."

 Tom Rogers 
</P>
<P>
 Former supervisorial candidate and community activist: 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers says the Board of Supervisors and other officials must be more open and 
accountable. "When people would go down (to speak to the board), you were 
treated in many cases discourteously, and in a number of cases, rudely. . . . 
They would say, 'All we are going to let you do is have your minute up there.'. 
. . In that kind of environment, you had the makings of this disaster. You had 
this environment in which there was no outside influence. . . . The only way 
they can act this way is if they knew they were not going to be defeated. You 
can't say (to the board), 'If you don't like it, we're going to throw you out 
in a couple years,' because that can't happen. There is no accountability in 
this county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Term limits (will not work) because the same developers would be behind it. . 
. . Full disclosure is what I would go for on campaign literature -- if you 
sent out a flyer, you say, 'This flyer is mailed by citizens for (Supervisor) 
Tom Riley and the major donors are as follows. . . .' And if people want to 
vote for the Irvine Co. or the Mission Viejo Co. stooge, then let them go 
ahead."

 Larry Thomas 
</P>
<P>
 Former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson and former communications director for the 
Irvine Co.: 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this is my own opinion, not the governor or the Irvine Co., but I do 
think a strong case could be made that the position of treasurer never should 
have been and should not be an elected office," Thomas says. "It actually 
isolates the accountability as opposed to focusing it. . . . If there was some 
sophisticated oversight, that would have slowed him (Citron) down. But as long 
as he's elected, I think the treasurer was going to say, 'I answer to the 
people.' It's a strange twist on accountability to voters that is 
counterintuitive." DAVE LESHER

 Here is a sampling of comments from readers who called the newspaper's 
TimesLine number with their suggestions on how to deal with Orange County's 
financial crisis: 
</P>
<P>
 It's more than just a county issue, it's now a national issue, because of the 
effects of the bond market and the stock market. All that Clinton has to do is 
to pressure the Fed to reduce long-term federal interest rates until the crisis 
is taken care of. And furthermore, that would benefit the rest of the country 
in the economic recovery.

shall surely and inevitably move past this financial crisis.

 The current Orange County financial crisis should put an end of all talk of an 
expensive commercial airport at El Toro. Another boondoggle for greedy 
developers. Exactly the kind of project that has brought us to bankruptcy. 
Let's halt the toll roads too and cover the shameful damage to our natural 
surroundings with trees, seeds and wildflowers.

 If there should need to be cuts in spending in Orange County, priorities 
should definitely be put in place. The school system must be protected so that 
teacher salaries are protected; services must be protected: sanitation, fire, 
police and sheriffs. . . . The things that should be expended are wasteful 
programs such as the toll roads. When we're talking about green regarding 
money, we should be talking about green regarding the quality of life in Orange 
County and those toll roads threaten that quality of life.

 The cause for this debacle is the Federal Reserve raising the interest rates 
to supposedly fight inflation. To fight inflation, I'd like to propose instead 
of using interest rates that we index income tax rates quarterly -- up or down 
-- depending upon the economy. This would be more equitable by having all 
citizens fighting inflation, not just the people who are borrowing money and 
bond investors. Rather than the money going to the banks the money would now 
flow to U.S. Treasury to reduce the deficit.

 The Orange County Board of Supervisors ought to resign en masse. I think they

money.

 I'm concerned that we're allowing (former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L.) 
Citron to resign and walk away from this problem when he should be the one 
forced to make it right. He probably is the only gentleman that understands 
what is going on, and should be in there trying to work it out with the county 
at this time. It is ridiculous that we allow him to resign and collect some 
fabulous pension after he's made this mess.

 The Issues: Was Orange County's financial calamity caused by a mechanical 
failure in the structure of government? Or was it pilot error? 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who blame the problem on former Treasurer Robert L. Citron say they 
expect that the government machinery will be overhauled. The only question is 
how substantially. But can the changes prevent such a problem from happening 
again? 
</P>
<P>
 Should there be more oversight of the financial process? Should committees of 
citizens or experts be created to monitor government investments? Or should 
officials simply improve their methods for internal communication?

 Marian Bergeson

<P>
 Former Republican state senator from Newport Beach and Orange County 
supervisor-elect: 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson says there is a need for greater accountability and oversight. "There 
needs to be a special analysis to the Board of Supervisors, some independent 
fiscal expert," she says. "There is an assumption that these are elected 
representatives and they are given a good deal of control of their areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much can be done internally (rather than with state-level corrections). This 
calls for leadership. That leadership will provide whatever avenues are needed. 
. . . I'd like to see Orange County really take a look at becoming a charter 
county," under which the county would write its own charter, allowing it to 
reorganize its governmental structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oversight would have (provided) an earlier alert. After you've had a 
situation like this, it's a great learning experience. Out of this will come a

Grindle notes. "The first thing I am sure that is going to come out of this is 
that they've obviously allowed them too much latitude, they meaning government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've known Bob Citron since the early '70s. Over the years he gained a 
reputation for making tons of money. The Board of Supervisors doesn't have as 
much financial knowledge as Citron does in his little finger -- and rightfully 
so. He made money for the county and he was looked up to in this regard. 
However, the more he succeeded, the more self-righteous and arrogant he became.

know how you legislate against bad judgment. . . . I think it was an individual 
decision that was the problem. Obviously it was a big problem and a lot of 
people got burned on it. But there are lots of decisions made every day about 
investments in California and most of them tend to be good." 
</P>
<P>
 Stenbakken expects that "there will be some reporting requirements that will 
be beefed up. . . . There will be restrictions and reporting requirements and 
prohibited investments when the Legislature is done. But still, there is 
somebody there investing the money . . . and it is a little bit of a 
crapshoot." DAVE LESHER

 The Issues: Orange County's losing bet on high-risk investments is considered 
an anomaly of municipal finance not because others don't use the same 
techniques -- they do -- but because Orange County's wager was so big. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county's fiasco still calls into question how municipalities raise and 
invest their cash, and probably will lead to calls for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Many municipal funds nationwide are stodgily run and conservatively invested 
in low-risk government securities. Nonetheless, should there be limits on 
municipalities' use of derivatives and other exotic financial instruments? 
</P>
<P>
 Should treasurers be required to frequently make public the current value of 
their investments -- what's known as "marking to market" -- even though their 
investments don't mature for years? Mutual funds, for instance, already do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Orange County debacle is partly blamed on the county's inability 
to substantially raise taxes, which led the county to seek bigger returns with 
its high-risk investment strategies. Are there other revenue-raising 
alternatives? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Felix Rohatyn 
</P>
<P>
 Senior partner at the investment firm Lazard Freres & Co. Rohatyn played a key 
role in helping New York City recover from its fiscal crisis in the mid-1970s: 
</P>
<P>
 Rohatyn opposes a ban on municipalities' use of derivatives or financial 
leverage -- the use of borrowing in search of higher returns. But municipal 
treasurers must be more cautious, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're investing taxpayer funds as a matter of normal practice, you want 
to invest those funds, (not) speculate with them," Rohatyn says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohatyn is against municipalities using leverage -- a view that he admits is 
extreme. Lacking a ban, you should "certainly limit the amount of leverage," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds also should regularly mark to market. "If a mutual fund can do that 
every day, I don't see why a municipality using billions of dollars of taxpayer 
money can't do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohatyn also says using high-risk strategies is no substitute for a 
municipality's reluctance to raise taxes, or its voters' reluctance to approve 
new taxes. "If you're so tight with respect to your budgets that you're having 
trouble making ends meet, the last thing you want to do is speculate with the 
funds you do have."

<P>
 George L. Argyros 
</P>
<P>
 a leading Orange County real estate and industrial executive and head of Arnel 
& Affiliates in Costa Mesa: 
</P>
<P>
 Argyros agrees that for any person responsible for public funds, "your primary 
responsibility should be to protect principal and not try to maximize yield. 
The priority should be on making safe investments." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, treasurer-tax collector is "an elected office, and there 
wasn't enough overview. Nor was there an outside, independent board of advisers 
-- call it what you want -- to make sure there were some checks and balances in 
the system." 
</P>
<P>
 But Argyros says he is not a proponent of marking to market each day, or even 
each week. That would create such a focus on short-term changes in the funds' 
values that treasurers would lose sight of a steady, long-term investment plan, 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And using derivatives or other leverage is no way to make up for a lack of tax 
revenue, he says. "All of government has a problem cutting down and making the 
tough decisions. The issue is not to tax more. The issue is to do more with 
what you've got and be more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the cash a municipality does have, "certainly never speculate" with it, 
Argyros says. "That is just uncalled for."

 William E. Straw 
</P>
<P>
 A principal with Stonebridge Partners, an investment banking and financial 
services firm in Brentwood that advises municipal clients: 
</P>
<P>
 Straw opposes banning municipal use of exotic financial techniques because 
there are "some hedging concepts that do make sense for some of these 
treasurers. But they need to be very conservative. Their responsibility is to 
protect (their funds') principal and earn money for their constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal investment pools should be marked to market "if not daily, certainly 
no less than monthly," Straw says. "There should be a public posting of the 
status." In Orange County's case, he says, "it was public information, but it 
really wasn't made public, it wasn't publicized. If they published once a month 
the status of the accounts, at least someone would have the ability to see the 
changes." JAMES F. PELTZ

 The Issues: Southern California's recession and anti-government sentiment have 
pressured local municipalities to cut costs and get more bang for the buck in 
providing police, parks, roads and other services. With the Orange County 
debacle tightening the vise even further, painful cutbacks will have to be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Orange County -- as well as other local governments -- might need 
to capture the efficiency of the most competitive industries in the private 
sector -- by turning over some jobs performed by municipal employees to outside 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 But what tasks can be turned over to the private sector, which services can be 
eliminated, and how should officials go about it?

 Roger W. Johnson 
</P>
<P>
 Administrator of the federal General Services Administration and former chief 
executive of Western Digital Corp. in Irvine: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd consider bringing in a county chief executive officer and top 
professional management. You'd still have an elected Board of Supervisors, but 
you would run the operations of the county on a business basis. I'd also 
probably convene a citizen advisory board, made up of top people who grew that 
county into the great place it is, including academics, people from industry -- 
people who have a vested interest in the county's well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Johnson recommends investigating whether to privatize -- that is, 
turn over to private business -- such jobs as collecting garbage and running 
prisons. "I have long wondered why we even have a county board of education. I 
don't know why those duties can't be divided among the local school districts, 
and give them back control and money, while eliminating what appears to be a 
duplicate layer of overhead."

 Mark P. Petracca 
</P>
<P>
 Political scientist at UC Irvine and editor of The Politics of Interest: 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, if the crisis lasts long enough and if the funds that these 
entities have in the Orange County fund are tied up long enough, everybody's 
going to be in the situation of having to generate additional revenue by either 
lobbying to do something about Proposition 13, or by moving to user fees, or by 
beginning to drastically and selectively cut back on services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Projects will be stopped. Some of the projects under way in this county that 
are good to have but not essential, probably ought to be scrapped. I'm thinking 
in the city of Irvine, for instance, of how we're building underpasses beneath 
railroad tracks. It's a nice thing to do if you have the money to do it, but if 
you don't have the money, you probably can't afford to do it. . . . When you 
talk about the school system, you want to start cutting back on building new 
schools or renovating schools rather than cutting back on the number of 
teachers."

 Christine W. Letts 
</P>
<P>
 Lecturer at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and 
former transportation commissioner and secretary of the family and social 
services administration for Indiana: 
</P>
<P>
 Officials need to discard old notions about what is fair and start looking 
into what governmental tasks can be eliminated, Letts says. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating libraries and parks may hurt poor people more than the rich, "but 
they're not endangering people. . . . When a municipality is really strapped, 
the most important thing is to have essential, safety-related services" such as 
police and fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, Letts says, governmental agencies should be streamlined 
through swift layoffs engineered by key managers. Then, in exploring ways to 
perform continuing tasks more efficiently, managers ought to meet with workers 
and urge them to figure out how they can accomplish the same jobs with fewer 
people. "They'll quickly tell you what was stupid, or redundant or a waste of 
time before. They'll get pretty creative when you tell them that they are 
responsible for the old work, but now there are only half of them doing it."

 Jeffrey I. Chapman 
</P>
<P>
 Public finance economist at USC and co-editor of the annual publication 
California Policy Choices: 
</P>
<P>
 Repealing tax-limiting Proposition 13 would help local governments raise 
needed funds, but that's politically impossible, Chapman says. Given that, 
officials should "do the second-best thing and give the government some 
flexibility in how to spend its money." 
</P>
<P>
 "In an ideal world, what Orange County -- or any county -- ought to do is try 
to figure out how to get rid of so many of these special funds and mandates and 
earmarked revenues, and try to figure out the best way of spending the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1970s, local officials have become "far more constrained in how 
we spend the money, so we may have very expensive fixed rail, and nowhere near 
good enough schools, or nowhere near good enough garbage collection. So, the 
obvious solution is to figure out how to get rid of so much of the earmarking, 
and let the elected decision-makers make some decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman believes there is room to contract out work to private businesses. But 
he opposes consolidation of government agencies, arguing that it generally 
increases costs because some workers' salaries rise while relatively few 
employees are laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, municipal planners and financial officials "need to talk to one another. 
Too many jurisdictions do all their planning and zoning and revise their 
general plan without even thinking about the fiscal implications. And the 
finance people impose charges and fees without worrying about the planning 
implications."

 Peter V. Ueberroth 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County businessman and former commissioner of major league baseball, 
czar of the 1984 Summer Olympics and first head of Rebuild L.A.: 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ueberroth says each of the affected communities will have to come up 
with individual solutions, in general they must "postpone some capital 
improvements and increase productivity no different than any business through a 
recession." Among other things, he says, hiring freezes are likely to be 
imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, Orange County is very well-positioned for future growth. So, 
it's like being in a cycle. They have to substantially slow down the spending 
cycle until they can catch up financially." STUART SILVERSTEIN

 In 1975, the nation's largest city teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. The 
causes of the worst fiscal crisis in New York since the Great Depression were 
cumulative, and the rescue almost two decades ago brought together an 
extraordinary coalition of government officials, banks, union leaders and the 
Wall Street investment community. Much of the machinery, born in the crucible 
of crisis, remains to ensure a cliffhanger like it never happens again. 
</P>
<P>
 An important thing to remember is that New York never got as far as filing for 
bankruptcy, but it came close. What were the lessons learned? For anyone who 
might have been watching, the New York debacle provides a cautionary tale for 
Orange County's high-rolling public financiers. HOW IT HAPPENED 
</P>
<P>
 Known as Fun City, New York had an economy thoughout most of the 1960s that 
outpaced the booming U.S. economy. Amid the wealth, spending was immense and 
financial controls were lax. That set the stage for what happened next: 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1969, a prolonged recession sets in. But as revenues shrink, spending for 
social services continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city increases taxes, but it is a temporary solution. Municipal 
officials begin to rely on short- and long-term financing gimmicks. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city begins to use long-term bond sales, in effect borrowing money to 
fund operating expenditures. Officials also start selling short-term revenue 
anticipation notes. When there isn't enough money to pay back the notes, the 
city rolls them over at ever-higher interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * By 1975, New York needs to borrow $6 billion in short-term debt at 
ever-increasing rates. At the same time, Wall Street sours on the city. One sad 
day, there are simply no bids from the investment banking community to further 
roll over New York's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond rating agencies sharply downgrade the city's paper, effectively 
slamming the door on city financing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frenzy overtakes city government. State and city officials scramble to pay 
workers. Record keeping is so sloppy that no one knows how many employees are 
on they city payroll. One city official finds shoeboxes containing billions of 
dollars' worth of negotiable securities in a closet. 
</P>
<P>
 * The crisis deepens. Then-President Gerald Ford turns down a request for $1.5 
billion in short-term federal loans. CLIMBING OUT OF THE HOLE 
</P>
<P>
 The once wealthy enclave starts living hand to mouth. Here are the steps 
involved in New York's gradual recovery: 
</P>
<P>
 * The state of New York assumes the cost of key functions like the court 
system and some welfare payments. 
</P>
<P>
 * The municipal work force is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 * Just about all capital spending by the city ceases. Badly needed repairs on 
such vital structures as roads and bridges and the subways are suspended -- to 
be resumed many years later as deterioration mounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Short-term debt is rolled over into long-term debt by a newly created 
Municipal Assistance Corp., with payments based on the city's sales tax. The 
city borrows $1.6 billion from union pension funds, and the Administration of 
Democratic President Jimmy Carter -- elected in 1976 -- provides loan 
guarantees. AFTER THE CRISIS 
</P>
<P>
 Fallout from the debacle contines to this day. The most enduring legacy 
remains a series of oversight organizations that still scrutinize city 
finances. Among the safeguards: 
</P>
<P>
 * New York City must update its budget four times a year and issue four-year 
financial plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Financial Control Board, with representatives from the governor, the state 
controller and the city controller plus public members, oversees debt. It 
sounds the alarm when revenue projections are off course. 
</P>
<P>
 * A special New York State deputy controller also guards the city's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't finance yourself out of structural problems. You have to change the 
way the system works."

BLINDSIDED / ORANGE COUNTY'S FINANCIAL CRISIS; ESSAY; NO LONGER RIDING HIGH IN 
THE SADDLE; A ORANGE COUNTY BECAME A COSMOPOLITAN OUTPOST, ITS POLITICAL 
LEADERS STILL TRIED TO RUN IT AS IF IT WERE A FRONTIER TOWN.

<P>
 The critics at home and abroad who have been caterwauling all week about 
bankruptcy and the California Dream do not know Orange County. That's not 
surprising. Many residents and neighbors don't know it either. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the community is to come back after this blow and continue to bloom and 
develop, we all should understand what Orange County is and has become and what 
flaw allowed this disaster to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, an accurate appraisal should start with the big statue of John 
Wayne at Orange County's airport. 
</P>
<P>
 That statue of the Duke, an Orange County resident until his death in 1979, 
says that this is Middletown U.S.A., the representative community of the 
American middle class with a reverence for the Wayne-like virtues of courage 
and reliability. 
</P>
<P>
 But the statue of the actor in one of his cowboy roles also says that Orange 
County often thinks of itself as a frontier Western town and has been governed 
accordingly -- with now-disastrous results. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is neither frontier town nor suburb. Rather, it is a complex of 
31 cities with 2.6 million people, about the size of the Minneapolis or Dallas 
areas but with more cultural activities than either. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a highly sophisticated center of the global information industry, with 
an $80-billion annual output of goods and services. It exports brainpower to 
the world in the form of computers, medical instruments, engineering and 
environmental knowledge; it welcomes companies and investors from Asia and 
Europe and Latin America. In short, it's a thoroughly cosmopolitan place. 
</P>
<P>
 You would never know it from the slipshod way its Board of Supervisors and 
many of its city managers governed public tax money in the Orange County 
investment fund, where 187 cities, school districts and special agency 
investors are right now losing far more than the initial estimates of $1.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can accurately estimate the losses, say bankruptcy law experts, because 
the county's supervisors and counsel have mistakenly allowed Wall Street houses 
to unload the fund's holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Slipshod government is not a one-time mistake in Orange County, but a chronic 
flaw. "This is a place that has always insulated government from the economic 
process," says Spencer Olin, history professor at UC Irvine and co-author with 
UC Irvine professors Rob Kling and Mark Poster of "Postsuburban California: The 
Transformation of Orange County since World War II," a landmark 1991 book the 
authors are updating for paperback publication this very weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping government out of the loop on business matters was part of the process 
of Orange County's rapid growth. It prevented political challenges on land-use 
questions as ranchland was developed into housing subdivisions and industrial 
parks. "Someday they'll build a town here, Kate," was a line in old Western 
movies. Orange County's entrepreneurial developers made that line a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Although private business grew to world-class sophistication along with the 
county's economy, the public sector did not. Instead, supervisors who ran a 
sleepy rural county fell behind the curve as it became a center of advanced 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did the business community -- the big developers such as the Irvine Co.'s 
Donald Bren, or Anthony Moiso of Santa Margarita Co. or Arnel Development's 
George Argyros -- encourage smarter political leadership. World-class industry 
in a small-town setting seemed OK by them. 
</P>
<P>
 But that pattern of genial, inattentive local government came back to bite in 
the investment fund debacle. As the world has learned since the bankruptcy 
filing last Tuesday, no one monitored closely the activities of Treasurer 
Robert L. Citron as he leveraged $7.5 billion in tax money principal with $12 
billion in borrowings to enhance the fund's returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignorance was bliss for local officials because the extra 3% to 4% in interest 
that Orange County earned, compared to state of California or Los Angeles 
County investment funds, brought in an annual kitty of $600 million to $800 
million. That money distributed among fund participants provided a budget 
cushion for many local communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did they need the money? Not to put Turtle Wax on millionaires' 
Mercedeses, despite what critics say, but to reduce crowding in classrooms or 
hire more police or put up extra street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Because truth is, Orange County is a modern urban area with problems, having 
suffered a 32% loss in aerospace jobs in the last five years. Some of its 
people are rich, some are poor, many are immigrants. And most are middle class 
and struggling, like people everywhere, to pay mortgages and orthodontists and 
keep the dream alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy will hurt, probably more than was initially thought last week. 
"I'm shocked that the county and its counsel didn't seek an injunction to 
prevent collateral being sold," said Marc Beilinson, a Los Angeles bankruptcy 
lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, Orange County's amateur political leaders bumble around while its 
highly skilled business leaders fail to come forward to help. And so, 
ironically, Orange County will probably have to seek help from government in 
this crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento may have to step in with emergency aid, or even Washington. Cities 
and school districts with money tied up in the bankrupt fund need emergency 
financing. (Not all may suffer; San Juan Capistrano and some other communities 
never invested tax money with the county fund, reasoning rightly that high 
returns were coming from unacceptable risk.) 
</P>
<P>
 But for the county government and that of most communities, rough times and 
hard choices lie ahead. "Orange County and its cities may be shut out of 
municipal debt markets for years," says the head of a municipal finance 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 With public money harder to come by, choices will have to be made about 
pending developments. If baseball and football stadiums are to be built, 
private investment will have to build them. And local governments cannot be 
generous with tax breaks because they will have other, priority uses for 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Special fees may be imposed -- taxes in euphemism -- to make up for investment 
fund losses. Budget priorities will have to be set rigorously. Schools are 
paramount in today's economy; police and public safety are must expenditures in 
the modern urban setting. Other amenities, even nicer parks, will have to be 
privately financed or gone without. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County from now on will be home to a disciplined California Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 But it need not be a straitened dream. The county's economy is strong and 
involved in the new industries in which information -- as in manufacturing 
processes informed by computers, or medical procedures facilitated by lasers 
and imaging, or, if you like, fast food made possible by computers and 
microwave cooking -- is the real underlying value. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the economy that even now is growing 6% a year -- double the national 
rate -- in sprawling Orange County, which is now a new kind of community more 
akin to other onetime suburbs that are now self-contained economic engines, 
such as Fairfax County, Va., and Broward County, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 A major goal for the next few years must be to raise up a skilled public 
sector for Orange County's new kind of community to match the acumen and flair 
of its private businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Other handicaps, such as the high interest rates the county will have to pay 
on public finance, can be overcome. "Interest rates won't be fundamental to our 
future, as international commerce and high-tech industry are fundamental," says 
Kling of UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The interest rates will be a modulating influence," he adds. They will be a 
rein on Orange County's galloping steed. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, reins are what guide the horse, channel its power. Maybe they should 
change that statue at the airport. Maybe the symbol for the future Orange 
County should be John Wayne the cavalry officer or World War II naval officer, 
the community leader who succeeded John Wayne, the lone cowpoke.

PALM LATITUDES: CLIQUES; A SIMPLEX SOLUTION

 The herpes outbreak in the late '70s threw the country into a frenzy--here was 
a sex-related disease that not only hurt, but it was ugly, incurable and 
stigmatizing. It seemed impossible to imagine anything worse. Now, of course, 
we know better. But herpes is still pretty bad, and it's still very much 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 Though its symptoms are now largely controllable with the antiviral drug 
acyclovir, the stigma remains. For the thousands of Southern Californians 
carrying that little lifetime cellmate, there's a support group, L.A. Help. Its 
meetings, hotline and newsletter, offer comfort to herpes sufferers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a place to come to heal, to realize you're the same person you were 
before, only now you have herpes," says Nancy, the group leaders. "If you act 
like a social leper, you're part of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 At one meeting earlier this year at a United Methodist Church in Westwood, 
participants ranged from newly infected (and weepy) Emily (no real names, 
please), 20, to white-haired Max, 75, who introduced himself with "I jog, I 
swim and I have herpes." More typical is Stan, 45, who contracted the virus in 
the freewheeling '70s while living with three female roommates. But Ingrid's 
story sparks the most cries of recognition: Hew new boyfriend dumped her when 
she told him she had herpes. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the hot herpes issue: How to break the news to your new love. Numerous 
tracts on the front table offer tips on when (not after sex or in a restaurant, 
for example) and why (you can get sued for giving someone herpes.) 
</P>
<P>
 But at L.A. Help, the news is already broken, and by intermission, everyone is 
laughing, joking and flirting. "People come for medical advice, emotional 
support and -- let's get real -- for the dating pool," Nancy says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy, a TV technician, admits that she's at the meeting looking for someone 
cool. But "just having herpes isn't enough," she says. "It's good for about one 
date. If he's a jerk, he's still a jerk." Judy Raphael

 I cringe at slurs about my alma mater. USC is one of the top 10 private 
universities in federal research support. Its faculty members have won 
Guggenheim fellowships, National Science Foundation awards and recently, a 
Nobel Prize. There are nearly 100 National Merit scholars on campus and most 
undergrads come from the top 12% of their high school class. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the slurs continue: University of Second Choice, University of Stupid 
Caucasians and that old perennial, the University of Spoiled Children. What 
makes it worse is that it's no mystery where the SC bashers get their fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 When I recently moved to San Francisco, I contacted the USC alumni club. I 
also contacted the alumni group for the University of Chicago, where I got my 
master's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 First I called the Chicago alumni club. "We have two book clubs. One focuses 
on the classics, and the other mainly on post-structuralist criticism. We also 
have a distinguished faculty lecture series, a theater group . . ." When the 
alumni rep asked what my doctoral field had been, I was ashamed to admit that I 
had left Chicago with only my master's because I couldn't bear the thought of 
six grueling years without California sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I made a call to the USC alumni rep. "We used to organize, you know, like 
lectures and stuff, but no one was really interested," explained Alumni Dude. 
"So now we just do what everyone really wanted to do all along: party. 
Basically, we're just a bunch of Trojans who like to get together and rage." He 
added that they were having a party that night. It was at a local club called 
Bimbo's. 
</P>
<P>
 Alumni Dude, sadly, is not alone in perpetuating the SC stereotypes, but I 
don't let those living caricatures get me down. I wouldn't trade my four years 
at USC for anything. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, the only party I ever got to attend at the University of Chicago 
was a reception in the library. Dana Mitroff

COMMAND PERFORMANCE; JODIE FOSTER THE ACTRESS HAS ENCHANTED US FOR MORE THAN 
TWO DECADES. NOW SHE'S BRINGING HER ICY INTELLIGENCE TO THE BUSINESS OF MOVIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Hilary de Vries, Hilary de Vries' last article for the magazine was on actor 
Gene Hackman. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In our minds, she is the fearless one, a plucky scrapper in something like 30 
films, a hero among the weaker sisters. So it is no surprise when she says with 
a straight face and a child's earnestness: "Fear has no place here." It is a 
bold statement, perhaps even comically so, given the setting -- a recording 
session on a studio sound stage. But that is precisely her intent. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the time to panic," she says, staring at the thicket of flutes 
and violin bows scything the air, bending them, it seems, to her will. "All 
those fear feelings -- will the audience like the film? You can't indulge them 
now," she says, repeating her mantra in the darkened control booth. "This is 
still the time to be creative and fearless." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the chaos and fear-mongering that is Hollywood, Jodie Foster is a voice 
of calm and reason. Indeed, so logical is her mind that she might just as 
easily confide that Newton or Descartes or any other 17th-Century rationalist 
is her role model, rather than any mere actress. She hates weakness, as she 
will readily confess, an attitude supported by her numerous tough girl roles -- 
Sarah Tobias in "The Accused" and Clarice Starling in "The Silence of the 
Lambs," to name just the Oscar-winning performances among her films. After more 
than 25 years in front of a camera, the former child star concedes that acting 
is only possible because the window of vulnerability is so brief. She can only 
perform, she says, because it happens so fast. "They say 'Action!' and you just 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 To her mind, this is less of a mystery than a blessing. She despises the usual 
aura that surrounds stars of her magnitude, "when they treat you like this 
fragile bird." And she is suspicious of her peers, "those women who became 
actors because they are this big box of tears." Science, she wants to believe, 
is the source of her art. "I think," she says coolly, "it's a chemical in the 
brain that you're born with." 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, when she is seeking to redefine her career, moving beyond mere 
stardom to directing, producing and financing her own films, hysteria, any loss 
of control, remains an anathema. She will be a player in the truest sense of 
the word, heading her own company, writing her own chapter of Hollywood 
history. Not since Bette Davis faced off with Jack Warner has an actress 
demanded and earned the power that Foster has wrested for herself. "I never 
wanted to be an actress, I just always was one," she says, "and I have so much 
more to contribute than just being an actress." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the women she has played, Foster strives to be fearless. Maybe even too 
much so. "I have to warn people, my friends, about this -- explain that it's 
not that I feel cold, but I cannot not be cold," she says. "Look, it's 
terrible, I know, but (weakness) really, really bugs me, to the point that if 
there is a wounded bird on the sidewalk, I look at it and I go 'I think I'll 
just kick it.' " 
</P>

 When I first met Jodie Foster in August of 1991, it was a few weeks prior to 
the release of "Little Man Tate." It was the first film that the actress would 
direct, and it was opening the same year that "The Silence of the Lambs" had 
established Foster as a bona fide box office star. (The low-budget thriller 
would gross more than $150 million that year and eventually win Oscars for 
Foster and co-star Anthony Hopkins.) Although Foster was fresh from a Paris 
vacation and clearly enjoying her status as the star of the summer's hit film, 
she was understandably a jangle of nerves about "Little Man Tate." At the time 
she remarked: "This has been a weird time, when you give your film to strangers 
who have opinions about it. And then the marketing people are going like 'We 
want to sell it like this.' And suddenly I'm seeing myself as some financial 
entity, which I hate, because I think it's the best work I've ever done. I'm my 
favorite director." 
</P>
<P>
 To anyone who knows her, that declaration was vintage Foster: the blazing 
self-confidence, the razor-thin patience for being second-guessed, a loathing 
of public exposure -- all of it roiling under a veneer of just-plain folks. But 
her comments also revealed something about the ambitions and reservations of 
the woman who occupies a unique niche in our culture. Not only is Foster 
arguably the most acclaimed actress of her generation, one of the few child 
stars who has leaped the chasm into adult roles, but she is also the only star 
who has ever had a fan's adoration transmogrify into an attempted presidential 
assassination. She has, as she admits "always, always been in the spotlight." 
As she finished the 1991 interview: "I've seen everybody come and go, and all 
the office spaces and the breakfast meeting places change, and I know you have 
to go for longevity. If you cash in, you're history, but if you hang on, your 
time will come back." 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with some measure of expectancy that I approached our second meeting 
this fall. In three years, Foster had become arguably "the most powerful woman 
in Hollywood," as Entertainment Weekly suggested in a cover headline. She is 
the only multiple Oscar-winning actress who is also a bankable star -- and at 
more than $5 million per film is one of the four highest-paid women actors -- 
who has a proven talent for directing and who heads her own independently 
financed production company, Egg Pictures. As one Hollywood producer put it, 
"There isn't another actress who is having the kind of career that Jodie Foster 
is having." 
</P>
<P>
 None of this was obvious, however, during the two days I spent with Foster as 
she wound down the post-production phase of her new film, "Nell," a fictional 
drama about a female wild child that might be best described as a cross between 
"Rain Man" and "The Piano." "Nell" is the first film to carry the Egg Pictures 
banner and is being released as one of the more anticipated, if risky, movies 
this Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the darkened control booth crowded with the rest of the "Nell" brain trust 
-- Renee Missel, one of the film's producers, Stuart Kleinman, a former ICM 
executive and president of Egg Pictures, director Michael Apted and composer 
Mark Isham -- Foster, dressed in a black cashmere sweater and bright red jeans, 
sat in the middle of an enormous sofa and did the following: drank coffee; 
wrote personal notes on cards imprinted JODIE FOSTER; thumbed through a 
handbook supplied by the Division of Motor Vehicles and debated with her 
assistant as to whether she would need to take an actual driving test; planned 
a catered reception; finalized plans for a flight to Paris that night; 
proofread a fax from her attorney; returned several phone calls, and asked 
Kleinman to somehow retrieve a favorite ballpoint pen that had, in the 
confusing aftermath of a recent car accident, made its way to the driver of the 
other car. "I don't want to sound petty," she said, "but it was silver." 
</P>
<P>
 Other than a murmured "That's nice," or her whispered "no fear" speech, Foster 
never once commented, in any boss-like way, on the day's proceedings. 
Remarkable restraint for someone whose company had bankrolled something like 
half the film's $24-million budget. Just when it was beginning to seem that 
observing Hollywood's most powerful woman at work was about as revealing as 
watching a very efficient checker at a Ralph's supermarket, Foster flung 
herself back into the sofa. "Don't you just love this? I hate being alone, and 
making a movie is the least-alone thing I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 On her own -- that is to say without benefit of a powerful director husband 
(like Geena Davis and Renny Harlin) or powerful producer boyfriend (like Barbra 
Streisand and her ex, Jon Peters) or powerful director-producer brother (like 
Penny and Garry Marshall) -- Foster is attempting what few, if any, Hollywood 
actresses have ever accomplished: to become a major player in the film business 
and do so on her own terms. But given the enormous power wielded by major 
stars, it is a surprisingly difficult transition. Her predecessors here are few 
and mostly male. Rob Reiner, Ron Howard, Robert Redford and Clint Eastwood all 
have forged respected second careers as filmmakers. But among actresses, the 
list of proven directors is nearly nonexistent, confined largely to Streisand, 
Penny Marshall and, if history is no barrier, Ida Lupino, the British actress 
and director who worked in Hollywood during the 1950s. Now Foster is preparing 
to join, and perhaps head, their ranks. And she is doing so in the midst, 
rather than the twilight, of a thriving acting career "when she could be, like 
Sharon Stone, just making one big movie after another," as Kleinman puts it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've reached a certain stature where I'm not being controlled by somebody 
else's whims, but being a working actor has nothing to do with celebrity," she 
says evenly. "You get totally patronized when you're acting because people are 
scared to talk to actors." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster sees her move into producing not only as the surest way out of that 
trap but as necessary protection from the pressures that assault women in 
Hollywood. "Women aren't allowed to make the same mistakes as men," she says. 
"Look at somebody like Michael Douglas. How many movies does he get to make 
that earn no money before he gets paid less money? And how long does it take an 
actress? One film that doesn't do well and you're back to square one. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then there is that awkward transition when all the sages decide that 
you're too old to be the love interest. I don't want to feel bad about myself 
when I turn 40, but I'm not going to bang my head against a brick wall and hurt 
my confidence. If I can't play the parts I want to play, then I will direct." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Foster also knows, "for women directors it is 20 times as tough, 
because the process of becoming a director is basically somebody comes into an 
office of strangers, and the guy sitting across from you says, 'I don't know, I 
just like your face, so I think I'll give you $10 million.' How often is a 
woman going to find herself in that position? Never." 
</P>
<P>
 So she formed her own company in 1991, backed now with $100 million from 
PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, the Dutch-owned conglomerate, which has 
increased its involvement in Hollywood recently. Foster has embarked on an 
ambitious production schedule, up to two pictures a year for the next three 
years, and will direct and star in as many or as few as she pleases, wielding 
the power to green-light them herself. As producer Lynda Obst describes 
Foster's position, "there isn't another woman actor or producer with that kind 
of clout." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Foster has judiciously kept herself in play with the major 
studios, accepting major roles in big commercial films like "Sommersby," 
"Maverick," and the upcoming sci-fi thriller "Contact," based on the Carl Sagan 
novel. "Jodie is at the point where she could do almost anything she wants, 
wherever she wants," says Bruce Berman, President of Worldwide Production at 
Warner Brothers, the distributor of "Sommersby," "Maverick" and "Contact." "But 
what is most impressive about her -- apart from her abilities as an actor and 
director -- is how smart she has been about her career." Peter Chernin, CEO of 
20th Century Fox, adds that "Jodie has already had an extraordinary career as 
an actress, but where she will really distinguish herself in the years to come 
is as a filmmaker. She has the temperament for it. She is a real leader." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, those are the kinds of hosannas one might expect from adoring 
studio executives. Indeed, no one would speak for the record about any downside 
to Foster's ambitions. And, clearly, there are risks involved, and few 
guarantees of success when alchemizing an artistic sensibility into business 
acumen. Among some less-partisan observers, there's a wait-and-see attitude. 
"Jodie is clearly taking charge of her career, and she gets a lot of respect 
for that," cautions one Hollywood producer. "But there's a history at work 
here: Many have tried . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And when I ask Foster to assess her place in the Hollywood pantheon, her power 
as it were, she is equally astute. "I think power is the wrong word," she says 
crisply. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be called the ability to protect one's vision? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, being the visionary, yes, but that isn't the same as power. I don't 
want to be a director so people have to listen to me on the telephone. That's 
not interesting to me. It's much more interesting to make a film that I'm proud 
of, that is the greatest movie I can make." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting here just a few weeks shy of her 32nd birthday, Foster is almost 
maddeningly contrary. True, she has always been famously un-starlike -- stories 
about her down-to-earthness are legion -- but for one of the most successful 
women in Hollywood, she carries herself with an almost disingenuous 
unaffectedness, so unassuming that she seems to be living part of her life 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
 She has not inhabited her house, located in the nether reaches of the San 
Fernando Valley, for more than a year, preferring the ease and anonymity of a 
hotel room or a friend's spare room. She all but ignores her $5-million fees. 
"I still put the same amount in my checking account for massages and stuff, so 
it's not like my life has changed." Instead, she has pared her existence to 
those few essentials that fit either in the box she ships from one movie 
location to the next or that she can cram into the black-leather backpack she 
carries over her shoulder. Even this two-day meeting is willfully casual, held 
in the noisy recording studio, a borrowed office and a lounge where Foster 
drops her voice to a whisper so as not to disturb a musician dozing under a 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all her self-effacement, Foster also possesses a palpable steeliness, 
a stare-down quality found in her film roles. In person, that characteristic 
seems at odds with the delicate caliber of her face, which is as fine-boned as 
a porcelain teacup you might cradle in your palm. Spend any time with her and 
it becomes apparent that even the most banal exchange -- where to have lunch, 
whether she can be considered powerful, whether, even, if "The Piano" won an 
Oscar as an original or adapted screenplay -- can devolve into a game of 
chicken played with her steady blue eyes and scrappy mien. It isn't that Foster 
needs to prove that she has the upper hand, although you would be forgiven for 
mistaking it as such; rather it's a way of testing her opponents and herself, 
to determine their mettle. As she coolly greeted me on my second day's visit as 
I battled both a cold and the vestiges of a poison ivy attack: "Oh, here she is 
back again to infect us all." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Hutman, the production designer on "Little Man Tate" and "Nell" and one of 
Foster's oldest friends since their student days at Yale, laughs when I 
describe my encounter with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, Jodie has never lacked for confidence -- or the appearance of 
confidence, but she has spent most of her career trying to stay grounded. It's 
why there are all those stories about her picking up her own dry cleaning and 
taking the bus. But in the past few years, she has come to terms with her fame 
and power, so she is comfortable saying, 'This is me, and I don't need any 
other labels.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But when I ask Foster if she sees any change in herself in the 25 years she 
has been in the public eye, she is a reluctant witness. "I have this thing 
where I don't really think people change. I think you just fulfill the arrows 
that your character was pointing you toward." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, like destiny? 
</P>
<P>
 She pauses and pushes her steel-frame spectacles higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "My whole life has been about being more open, trying anyway. But you're 
vulnerable. I'm not afraid of making movies where I bang my head on a wall, but 
I am desperately afraid of a certain kind of softness," she says, adding almost 
as an afterthought, "on screen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can begin her career in one of two places. Well, three if you count her 
performance as Iris in "Taxi Driver," which earned her her first Oscar 
nomination -- at age 14 -- and where a lot of Hollywood carbon-dates its 
awareness of Foster. But in the actress's own timeline, which reaches back to 
the '60s, to her bare-bottomed Coppertone baby ads and sitcoms like "Mayberry 
RFD," "My Three Sons" and others she'd just as soon forget, the real starting 
point didn't happen until three years ago when "The Silence of the Lambs" and 
"Little Man Tate" just made it into release as the last gasps of the 
about-to-be bankrupt Orion Pictures. That was the year when Foster realized 
that more than money, more than power, more even than fearlessness, she needed 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was Foster unable to collect all her profits from "Silence," but she 
also had to battle in bankruptcy court to get the millions needed to release 
and promote "Tate." Although "Tate" eventually grossed $24 million, a modest 
profit on a film with a budget of only $10 million, Foster realized "that I 
never wanted to be in a studio deal again." So she talked to -- and rejected 
offers from -- virtually every major studio as well as more than a dozen 
smaller film companies. Eventually, Foster decided to lay her Egg at the feet 
of PolyGram, precisely because it was not a studio. "They give people their 
price," as she says, "and then they don't want to hear about it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jodie could have gotten a lot of deals at a lot of places," says Michael 
Kuhn, president of PolyGram Filmed Entertainment. "But she wanted more than the 
usual vanity deal that most actors get. I went with Jodie when I realized she 
was serious about being a producer." 
</P>
<P>
 How serious? On paper, the game plan is ambitious, particularly for someone 
completing her first producing job with "Nell," a co-production with Fox, the 
initial developer of the script. Indeed, it took Foster and company almost two 
years to get this first film on the rails. Now, however, the Egg business seems 
to be picking up. After "Nell," Foster will turn her attention to "Home for the 
Holidays," a family drama starring Holly Hunter and Anne Bancroft that Foster 
will direct starting early next tear. After that? Possibly Neil Jordan 
directing "Jonathan Wild," a 7-year-old script that Foster bought for her 
company after nearly every studio rejected it. "It's kind of poetic and violent 
at the same time," says Kleinman. "Everyone was interested, but no one had the 
guts to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 Which leads to what may be the most pertinent question: Exactly what kind of 
films does Foster want to make now that she is the boss? Although she is known 
for being almost unnervingly fiscally responsible and capable of reading a 
script, a production budget or a multiple-territory distribution plan with 
equal ease, she is also known as one of the more cautious stars around when it 
comes to committing to a film. "I don't want somebody telling me I have to make 
six movies and that one has to be $35 million and one has to be $22 million," 
she says. "That's not making films, that's just feeding a pipeline the way the 
studios do it. If you only make one film every 10 years, that's good." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster is very clear, however, about distinguishing between those films she 
wants to direct and those she wants to act in. "I'm interested in directing 
movies about situations that I've lived, movies that are almost personal essays 
about what I've come to believe in. The films I want to act in are about the 
things I've never lived, the hypothetical situations, the choices I've never 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 What is common to both situations, she adds, is a fascination with ordinary 
human behavior. "I've always wanted my profession to be about connecting with 
the common person, the normal person, the human person, because in some ways 
I've been pushed outside that. I've always not been 'normal.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That sense of normalcy is a big theme for Foster who, even before she was 10, 
was supporting her family -- her mother, Brandy Foster, her brother and two 
older sisters -- with her acting. Before she was 13, she had four films at 
Cannes. She attended Yale, as much for a respite from relentless scrutiny as 
for an education. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her return to acting, she has developed enormous defenses. "I need this 
illusion that the crew is actually my family that cares about me, that knows 
I'm not this crazy woman who goes around screaming in the forest." She also 
wears the same clothes on shoots, along with some piece of jewelry that comes 
to symbolize each of her films. "It's so that you feel like things aren't 
changing too much." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also why Foster spends so much time in France, an affinity that goes 
beyond nostalgia for her high school years spent at L.A.'s prestigious Lycee 
Francais to an appreciation for a collective sense of reserve. "They believe in 
policy, this rule system where they treat each other with a certain respect for 
their privacy," she says. "The French would never invite you to their house. 
They would just say, 'Nice meeting you. Goodby.' They would never say, 'Call me 
sometime.' I like that." 
</P>
<P>
 As her friend Hutman says: boundaries. To the point that Foster for many years 
threatened to walk out of interviews if certain topics were broached: John 
Hinckley Jr.'s assassination attempt on President Reagan that was a bizarre 
homage to her performance in "Taxi Driver," or her other hot-button question -- 
rumors of lesbianism. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she doesn't exactly warm to the discussion, but she is at least willing to 
stay in her chair. "I don't think I ever threatened to walk out of a print 
interview," she says, frowning. "But I recognize that I live in a business 
where I am a dartboard, and I don't really care what people will say. This is 
an American phenomenon, that people think that they interact with a celebrity 
by hearing them talk about pain, so they think they know them. I think that's 
bull- - - -." 
</P>
<P>
 That aloofness is at the root of Foster's identity as an artist. It is why she 
approaches a role from the standpoint of keeping a secret -- "where you're 
thinking something and you don't really want to tell anyone because it's none 
of their business, and you're kind of laughing inside, and so it becomes a 
question of how much peeks out (for the audience to see) and how much doesn't." 
It is why, too, she has adopted an almost Zen-like attitude toward her 
prominence in Hollywood as both an actor and a filmmaker.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not me, but this thing I create," she says. "I know who I am. I go home 
and make coffee and talk to my friends and have my relationships. What is 
objectified is what I put on the screen, but it's not me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is the end of a long two days in the recording studio. Foster is relaxed, 
even energized by the long hours here among her colleagues. There are still 
five hours until her flight to Paris tonight. She might even take in a movie. 
"The River Wild," she says, laughing. "Meryl Streep is the only way I would 
ever go see a Curtis Hanson film." 
</P>
<P>
 There is time for one final observation, a story about her own mother who once 
fended off a nervous breakdown when she was a single parent struggling to raise 
four young children on her own. "Let's just imagine a scenario where your 
parent spends hours in the corner crying," she says quietly. "That is my great 
fear -- to depend on somebody who is slipping away." 
</P>
<P>
 The analogy is unstated but obvious. Foster will head her own company, the way 
her mother headed her family -- fearlessly. She will be strong for herself, for 
other women, for all of us. Even now she is slipping into that role she knows 
better than any other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking off?" she calls to me across the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," she says curling her face into a smile just this side of inscrutable. 
"Call me sometime."

<P>
 Back in the 1970s, when Joseph Boskin, a professor of African American studies 
at Boston University, was researching American humor, he came across the 
following joke: 
</P>
<P>
 "Way down South in slavery times, there was this handsome fella, a muscular 
young slave. . . . One night he found himself stumbling out of bed like a 
sleepwalker. He slid out the door, not waking anybody up, and walked half-naked 
through the cotton field toward the master's house. . . . When he got to the 
big white house, he went straight to the window under the magnolia tree where 
the master's young daughter's room was. The window was just a wee bit open for 
a little fresh air, and this fella opened it the rest of the way and climbed 
straight into that girl's room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, when he climbed in, she woke right up, and she was so scared she 
couldn't talk or scream or anything. He lifted her up in his bare arms kind of 
rough like and took her out to the edge of the cotton field and laid her right 
down in the dirt. She laid there a moment trembling, all helpless and 
everything; and he stood still above her, looking real powerful with the moon 
shining all over his muscles. When he bent down and ripped off her nightgown, 
she asked, real scared, 'Are you going to rape me now?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked her in the eyes then and said, 'I don't know Missy. You tell me. 
It's your dream.' "  
</P>
<P>
 This statement, "It's your dream," has profound resonance for me, leading me 
over the years into the thicket of who we, as Americans of various races and 
ethnicities, dream the other to be. I was born to a Mexican Catholic mother and 
an Anglo Saxon Buddhist father who met in the cultural ferment of Santa Fe in 
the 1940s. My father was largely disowned by his mother for marrying a Mexican, 
so though I am recognizably what the world calls white, my sense of kin and 
culture has always been Latino.  
</P>
<P>
 I was 13 years old and still very much in a child's flux of confusion and 
longing when I first met a black man. After picking wild herbs along a levee, I 
set foot for home with a satchel of leaves and small purple flowers. At the 
spot where the dirt road crossed the railroad tracks stood the coal-black man, 
tall and lanky, carrying a suitcase tied with string. He talked fast while he 
shook my hand, telling me how hungry he was and how obliged he would be if I 
could get him a bite to eat.  
</P>
<P>
 Without thinking much about it, I took him home and made him a perfect 
13-year-old's meal of boiled hot dogs and ketchup on Wonder bread. Before 
eating, he blessed me and the food with a long, clearly memorized prayer in a 
sing-song voice that I found hypnotic. I sat quietly while he ate and made him 
a sandwich for the road. Then he got up and walked toward the highway, and I 
watched him until he disappeared, not knowing how completely this little 
interaction would change my life. 
</P>
<P>
 This stranger I met at the crossroads, who conscripted me into a small act of 
kindness, opened the door to the mysteries and misadventures that would 
dominate my adult life. At first it was simple, crazed wanderlust -- by 15, I 
was the vagabond in the story, offering my own blessings from the crossroads. 
Later, the hunger for the open road was supplanted by the need to meet and 
befriend the other in myself. Early on, dreams became the uncompromising mirror 
through which I could observe my vagrant, changeable and multiple identities. 
Over the past two decades, the black man I met as a kid has returned often to 
visit me in my dreams. He always stands on the edge between the known and the 
unknown. He has a taste for the unconventional, this dream ally, and tends to 
direct me on the path that is most interesting and least likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many people, I was burned to the marrow by the fires the week of the 
Rodney King verdicts. I felt as if my soul was at stake if I didn't find a way 
to respond. I had just finished writing a book about people's dreams of the end 
of the world, collecting dreams spanning several decades from people of 
different countries and examining them closely for underlying patterns. The 
week of those fires, I began to ask questions about dreaming that underlies the 
anguish of race relations in this country. What are the core images and ideas 
that shape our experience of the other? At the deepest psychological level, 
whom do we imagine each other to be? And what may dreams tell us about finding 
our way out of the confusion around us? 
</P>
<P>
 In scanning the clinical literature on racial identity and racism, I 
discovered a couple of gaping holes. Although much literature speaks of the 
symbolism of black personas in dreams, there seems to be an implicit 
presumption that all dreamers are white. The thought that black people might 
also dream about white people is virtually never addressed. The way of the 
world, in which blacks are highly visible yet adamantly unseen, is mirrored in 
psychological research. 
</P>
<P>
 I began to interview friends and friends of friends about their dreams. Some 
people sent me dreams in response to a previous article I'd written on 
interracial dreaming. I also struck up a correspondence with white and black 
prison inmates. In this way, I have collected dozens of dreams of white people 
about black people and black people about white people from a wide range of 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 Sifting through them in a survey that is admittedly unscientific yet 
revealing, I've found significant recurring patterns and surprising parallels. 
Dreams of being shut out from or taken into the perceived domain of the other 
are common for both races. White people sometimes dream of returning to black 
vitality and soulfulness, after a kind of existential exile; black people 
sometimes dream of being excluded from or embraced by white generosity, 
fertility or emotional tranquillity. Members of both races often dream of being 
transformed into the other. But a particular flash point plays itself out 
vividly in the dreams of both: Each frequently dreams the other as the 
transgressor, the violator of boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The black rapist, the insurgent slave, the one who does not know her place, 
the thief in the night -- these images are old and durable, the familiar heart 
of darkness that translates easily into white racism. Less familiar is the 
parallel imagery of terror and pursuit in the dreams of black people. White 
people are often combined with the specter of animals that, in black folk 
legend in the South and in central Africa, devour one's vitality as one sleeps. 
Like the black transgressor, these white tormentors have an old history, which 
can be traced back several hundred years to the initial Congolese contacts with 
the Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
 The following dream was sent to me by a young man, a white Angeleno, 
self-described as ". . . a downwardly mobile Yuppie." He regarded this dream as 
a pivotal moment in a time of great emotional turmoil when he was, with the 
help of a therapist, facing harsh childhood memories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a little cafe near the beach in Venice when this large, sexy black 
woman sat down at a table near me. I started to talk with her about something 
and was being a little flirtatious, trying to impress her with what a sensitive 
guy I was. She took my hand, and we walked to the beach, where she basically 
threw me down on the sand and started kissing me. In the back of my mind, I 
wondered if she'd find me interesting as a sweet and intelligent man or whether 
I should try to make love to her like I figured a black man would. In the 
beginning, I sort of liked her passion, but soon I felt a little hurried and 
eventually completely overwhelmed and scared. I didn't know how to get away 
andfelt humiliated by my fear." 
</P>
<P>
 The tangled web of interrelated motifs in this dream makes it emblematic of 
many whites' dreams of the black transgressor. The rich sexual mythology of 
white sensitivity versus overwhelming black instinctuality -- the white man 
with the brain, the black man with the phallus is a familiar trope. The 
violation of the boundaries that separate public and private is also a common 
theme -- the black as the one who does not act with propriety, bringing 
disorder into an otherwise orderly world. The transgressive sex -- overwhelmed 
in a public place -- is different only in that the transgressor is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The hundred-plus dreams I've received from white people feature twice as many 
black men as black women. It is the black man's phallus, knife, gun, public 
anger -- or the stealth with which he climbs into the window at night -- that 
most frightens white people. But this young man gives some insight into why his 
dream so prominently featured an overwhelming black woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had this dream when I was uncovering memories of incest by my mother when I 
was a young boy," he wrote. "In my therapy, it felt like I was in a life or 
death struggle over who owned my sexuality: My mother or me. This dream was the 
beginning of the end of that struggle. I've noticed a definite change in my 
relationships with black people since then. They've become 'just folks.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Real healing seems to require not self-censorship but self-awareness: 
recognizing that one's fantasies are about oneself, not about "them." Notably, 
the black transgressor is always paired with the "white one who is innocent and 
transgressed upon": the master's nubile daughter, the man overwhelmed on the 
beach by black sexual aggressiveness. But white fear coupled with the fantasy 
of white innocence is lethal. If people unconsciously live out the fantasy of 
white innocence protecting itself from black transgression, whole institutions 
of exclusion -- from jobs, neighborhoods, opportunities -- are inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The following dreams were sent to me by a black man in his early 50s, serving 
time for armed robbery in a New York prison. After some initial suspicions, he 
extended his trust and sent me about two dozen dreams. When he was young, his 
grandmother had encouraged him to pay close attention to his dreams, and, 
consequently, he has volumes of journals documenting an exceptionally rich 
dream life. "One of the high points of being in jail," he wrote, "is you get to 
sleep and dream a lot. One thing the white man and his bull- - - - system can't 
take away from me are my nightly dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 In another letter, he confided, "I hope you can understand I don't have a lot 
of love for white folks, and I find myself killing them in my dreams quite 
often. I really wish that I didn't feel this way." In fact, none of the dreams 
he sent me were about killing white people, but quite a few carried powerful 
images of terror, pursuit, capture and being devoured.  
</P>
<P>
 "I dreamed that I was on a large stage screaming at the top of my voice, and 
there was all these white folks looking up at me, and their eyes seemed to 
merge together into one eye. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Again I dreamed that there was these Chinese, blacks and whites, and the 
blacks was being served to the Chinese and white people as chop suey." 
</P>
<P>
 "These white people was riding around on these giant ants catching me, but I 
would always escape, and they would find me and make the ants bite me on my 
butt and head. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was these big white chickens eating black people up and then spitting 
them back out and eating them over and over. I started to cry because I did not 
want to be eaten. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 It is no doubt possible to look at these dreams from psychological 
perspectives developed in Europe, but I have found that Freud and Jung carry 
numerous assumptions, especially about the separateness of the psyche from 
community and nature, that have no equivalent in traditional African culture. 
So it has been far more fruitful for me to examine the dreams of African 
Americans from the angle of African tradition. Some dream motifs have survived 
not only the passage from Africa to America but also the migration from the 
rural South to the urban centers of the North and West during this century. 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of the African American psyche are in Western Bantu village culture, 
from the estuaries of the Zaire River as far inland as the Zambezi basin in 
central Africa. Western Bantu people -- Kongo, Luba, Lunda, Chewa, Ovimbundu 
and others -- account for perhaps half of the slaves imported to the American 
colonies. Unlike slaves taken from other parts of West Africa, who were 
ethnically diverse, Western Bantu people had mutually comprehensible languages 
and cultural sensibilities. The classical African American culture in the rural 
South is replete with "bantuisms" in language, place names, proverbs, stories, 
traditional medicine -- even the religious imagery of old spirituals.  
</P>
<P>
 The cultural patterns of the Kongo people, and their ways of making sense of 
overwhelming trauma, are representative of other Bantu groups who were sold in 
the slave ports of the American South. The Kongo attribute nightmares to the 
clandestine activity of bandoki , those who grow fat and prosperous by 
capturing and eating their victims' dream souls.  
</P>
<P>
 The Kongo have been in continuous contact with European people since 1483; 
since the early 1600s, one of their ways of understanding white people was to 
presume that they were bandoki. It was brought across the Atlantic with the 
slave trade; indeed, the slave trade itself was almost universally regarded as 
a form of soul-eating. John Thornton, professor of history at Millersville 
University in Pennsylvania, writes in "Africans and Afro-Americans in the 
Atlantic World" that captives in the slave port of Luanda in 1622 despaired 
over leaving their former lives, but they also felt they were victims of "a 
form of witchcraft."  
</P>
<P>
 In Bantu culture, any nightmare is regarded as an assault on the integrity of 
the soul. When one sleeps, the soul travels about and is vulnerable to bandoki. 
Nightmares erode the edge of one's soul, leaving one diminished of life energy. 
In this way, bit by bit, the soul is eaten. To be pursued, to be pinned down by 
malevolent white eyes, to be served as chop suey, to be devoured by enormous 
white chickens or bitten by large ants ridden by white people -- these 
extravagant images of "soul-eating" are particular to this dreamer and similar 
to other dreams I've received from black people.  
</P>
<P>
 Three dreamers, all black women in their late 20s and early 30s, related the 
following dreams. Two of the women are solidly middle-class, the third a 
homeless person. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first dream I recall was really a nightmare. All I can remember is images 
of a cliff, hypodermic needles and a sinister white doctor who pursued me 
throughout the dream, trying to assassinate me. I awoke running from my bed 
screaming 'The doctor's trying to kill me!' I recall being cornered on the 
cliff with the doctor and his hypodermic needle advancing on me. I was about 10 
or 11 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm about to make love with my boyfriend when I look up and see a white man 
standing outside the window, watching us. His face has no expression. We 
continue making love, trying to pretend he's not there. I've had this dream 
three or four times." 
</P>
<P>
 "The police were on a campaign to clean up the streets. They make all the 
black people -- not only homeless people -- walk off the end of Santa Monica 
pier into the ocean. They pull over cars and chase people down alleyways. All 
of the police were white." 
</P>
<P>
 Two basic, often interconnected themes thread through African American 
nightmares about white people. The first is pursuit, escape or capture; the 
second, invasion and the puncturing of boundaries. This second theme plays 
itself out in harsh physical images -- the doctor and his poisonous needles, 
flesh-pecking chickens -- and in the recurring image of the white gaze as a 
sharp edge wielded against the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 The dream of soul eating is populated by dangerous, invasive white eyes. As 
dreams of pursuit are, of course, also dreams of being seen and getting out of 
sight, the two themes are present in the homeless woman's image of the police 
on the streets of Santa Monica. The prisoner's dream of the merging of white 
eyes into a single, vast malevolent eye would likely make a great deal of sense 
to this woman and perhaps also to the woman who dreamed of the stolid white man 
looking through her bedroom window. When this gaze infiltrates even the 
intimate life of a woman and a man, it seems as if there is no place in the 
world where one might be free of it.  
</P>
<P>
 The image of "cleaning up the streets" was described to me without irony or 
interpretation. Bandied around by politicians, it could be one of the primary 
metaphors of the day world that translates into the nighttime dramas of soul 
eating. As long as white peopleunconsciously live out their dreams of blacks as 
the source of disorder, then the white gaze will appear cold and disinfecting 
as well as malevolent to black people. The merciless white eyes seem to be key 
images in the drama of "soul-eating" in America. 
</P>
<P>
 In the traditions of central Africa, protection from bandoki is a communal 
affair. Ancestors, it is said, reincarnate again and again until, refined of 
all human imperfection, they rest in nature, in a kind of stone or the spiral 
of a seashell. Nganga (medicine men) skilled in these matters gather these 
objects, awaken them with traditional invocations and bury them at the edge of 
the village or under the doorway of a house or place them around the neck of 
someone endangered by the envy of others. In other words, the ancestors in one 
form or another protect people from soul eating. The American equivalent of 
these nkisi -- called tobys (a Bantu word), mojo or hands -- was quite common 
in Southern African American culture, and some black Americans still rely on 
these objects to protect themselves and their households. The Bantu 
anthropologist Fu-Kiau Bunseki has found some of them to be almost identical to 
those used in central Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 In a traditional Bantu village, a family member who, like these black 
dreamers, was suffering assault in the night would be of concern to the entire 
clan. He or she would go to an nganga , who would discern the source of the 
trouble. That person would be publicly accused and, ideally, after confessing, 
be forgiven and re-embraced by the community. The nganga would then perform 
appropriate rituals of soul retrieval to reconstitute his patient's sense of 
self.  
</P>
<P>
 The discernment of spirits, the enlivening of a defeated soul and the 
participation of the community in the act of healing have survived the diaspora 
of black people and have been sheltered under the auspices of black churches 
and reinvented in non-Christian forms. These old ways of seeing, healing and 
protection carry tremendous power and intelligence but were designed for a 
situation in which the bandoki were members of one's own community. African 
American folklore and dreams suggest that in addition to the presence of God 
and the support of the sacred community (living and dead), a certain 
psychological agility and native wit are also required to keep the black soul 
intact against everything that might besiege it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This dream was given to me by a 27-year-old friend, a fervent Pentecostal who 
aspires some day to become a minister. "Nelson Mandela was elected leader over 
black affairs in the United States, but an evil white dictator was coming to 
take over. On a hill near my house in Venice, I saw these two white men with 
guns chasing black people. They were somehow connected with this dictator. Even 
though I was at a distance, they saw me and started to chase me. The police 
also got involved. Most of the dream was about getting away from them. It was 
exciting -- it was like I was sonic or something. There were some close calls, 
but they still couldn't catch me." 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of running is so common in black people's dreams about white people 
and such a recurring theme in African American folklore that it must be 
accounted for. Quick on his feet and quick of tongue, Br'er Rabbit and other 
tricksters are probably the most obvious folk tale survivals from Africa. Henry 
Louis Gates, who teaches African American studies at Harvard, uses the stories 
of the Signifyin' Monkey, who dances verbal circles around his literal-minded 
foil, the Lion, to demonstrate how African American literature and street 
culture preserve the soul in a racist society.  
</P>
<P>
 The motif of running and escaping, especially when it is coupled with sheer 
joy, is clearly about keeping the body and soul alive and free when it is 
threatened. For any black stranded in somebody else's dream -- the tangled net 
of "their" agenda, definitions, fantasies -- the person with the quick feet, 
the quick tongue and the quick mind is the one who would lithely slip through 
the net. It is to this end, I think, that the African trickster stories have 
been preserved and retold -- and apparently reinvented in the dream life of 
black Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 A Bantu village in the Congo basin may seem a long way from Compton or 
South-Central, and the psychosexual madness of the master's house may seem a 
long way from the suburbs. But in the dreams that underlie our waking lives, 
these domains, and others, strangely border one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Luther King Jr. often wrote of the ways in which racism mutilates the 
possibilities of both the racist and the victim of racism. The white man with 
racialized fear binding the roots of his sexuality, the black man awaking at 
night in his cell to yet another nightmare of pursuit and capture -- both are 
variations on a theme of lost freedom. The further I delve into these dreams, 
the more I see that there is no underestimating how profoundly and inextricably 
Americans of European and African descent are implicated in each other's 
psyches -- down to the most primal concerns of identity, sexuality, security 
and the sustenance of meaning and community. The naked, inescapable, harsh or 
blessed truth is that we bear the seeds of each other's redemption -- or 
destruction.

THE G-MAN, THE SHRIMP SCAM AND SACRAMENTO'S BIG STING; FBI AGENT JAMES WEDICK'S 
UNDERCOVER OPERATION NETTED 14 PUBLIC OFFICIALS. BUT HAS IT CHANGED THE WAY THE 
STATE LEGISLATURE WORKS?

<P>
 At the prosecution table in a wood-paneled federal courtroom in Sacramento 
sits FBI agent James J. Wedick Jr. His suit and tie are as drab as any 
plainclothes cop's, but there is something that sets him apart: the long brown 
hair, flecked with gray; the salt-and-pepper beard; the half-glasses that give 
him an almost scholarly air. For nearly a decade, through endless stakeouts, a 
failed marriage and bureaucratic hurdles, Wedick, 44, has spearheaded the most 
ambitious political corruption investigation in California history. 
Infiltrating the world of back-room deals and $1,000-a-plate dinners, he and 
his team snared five lawmakers, Sacramento's top lobbyist, a coastal 
commissioner and various aides. So far, they have not lost a case. 
</P>
<P>
 At the defense table is state Sen. Frank C. Hill. From the moment he was 
elected to the Assembly in 1982 at the age of 28, Hill seemed ticketed for 
statewide office. Popular with his colleagues, the Whittier lawmaker was in the 
inner circle of the Assembly Republican leadership, and he regularly lunched 
with the governor. Handsome. Brash. Always smiling. A prodigious fund-raiser. 
But Hill now faces charges that he extorted $2,500 from an undercover agent. 
His political career is in shreds, his legal bills mounting, and each of the 
three counts of extortion, money laundering and conspiracy against him carries 
a maximum prison term of 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the lead-off witness against Hill last May, Wedick tells jurors that 12 
years earlier, a "cooperating witness" told him that $30,000 could buy 
special-interest legislation in California. Wedick was happy to hear it, 
because he realized he had an opportunity to prove that lawmaking in the 
nation's most populous state was for sale. It confirmed his worst suspicions 
that California's reputation for squeaky clean politics was a facade, that it 
was as unsavory as the old Tammany Hall in his native New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was it necessary, the prosecutor asks him, to set up a phony shrimp 
business to ensnare Hill and other legislators? It's the nature of the crime, 
Wedick instructs the jurors. In a bank robbery, the FBI is notified almost 
instantaneously. But political corruption is harder to detect. If a lobbyist 
"bribed a state legislator," he says, "he is not likely to report it to us and 
neither is the legislator." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hill's lawyer takes his turn, he tries to get Wedick to discredit a 
former Hill aide named Karin Watson, who is expected to provide crucial 
testimony. The lawyer presses Wedick to admit that the FBI entrapped Watson by 
plying her with expensive champagne. Wedick concedes that during secretly 
recorded conversations, Watson "sounded like she had a lot to drink." The 
defense attorney shoots back, "Didn't that concern you?" Wedick, an experienced 
witness, turns the question into an opportunity to slam Hill. "My chief concern 
was that I had a criminal violation," he bristles. Watson, he points out, 
"arranged for Frank Hill to co-author a bill for $10,000 long before" she was 
given champagne by an undercover informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 100 miles southwest of the courthouse lies the Federal Prison Camp at 
Dublin. A neatly landscaped flower garden greets visitors to the complex of 
refurbished Army barracks that house the 300 nonviolent, white-collar inmates. 
Assigned four to a room, prisoners can place their own phone calls and spend as 
much as $165 a month at the commissary on such items as typewriter ribbon and 
perfume oils. There's no razor wire or chain link encircling the facility. In 
fact, there's no fence at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp has become a satellite of the state Capitol. On a recent day, former 
Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan, now prisoner 06833-097, scurries up a 
staircase, flashing a smile. A bulletin board lists former Coastal Commissioner 
Mark L. Nathanson -- dubbed "commissioner to the stars" because of the help he 
offered prominent Hollywood figures -- as a member of the prison's Toastmasters 
Club. So is onetime Assembly aide Tyrone Netters. Ex-legislative aide Darryl 
Freeman is also at the camp. Clayton R. Jackson, a hulking former college 
football player who became the Capitol's top lobbyist, waits for a visit from 
state Sen. Nicholas C. Petris.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and the four others at Dublin are among the 12 public officials 
arrested, indicted and convicted in Wedick's undercover operation. They once 
shaped the laws of California. Today, they are cutting weeds, fixing toilets or 
cooking meals, serving an average of four years in prison. Like them, Hill 
advanced his career in a political culture that relies on hefty campaign 
contributions as the currency of political action.  
</P>
<P>
 Wedick breached that system and exposed how fund-raising is interwoven into 
the fabric of lawmaking and can be a form of bribery. His zealotry has made him 
perhaps the most hated man in Sacramento. Defenders of Hill and others targeted 
by the FBI assail Wedick as a rogue agent who abused the powers of the federal 
government. Sacramento lawyer Donald H. Heller, Jackson's attorney, describes 
Wedick as "a very aggressive agent. I think his greatest strength is his 
greatest failing. He's so dogged in his pursuit of truth that anything that 
doesn't fit his view must be a lie." 
</P>
<P>
 But a few lobbyists and reformers voice admiration for Wedick, saying he has 
inspired a long overdue housecleaning and revealed the inherently corrupting 
nature of fund-raising. Perhaps, more than anything else, Wedick's 
investigation has given Californians a disturbing view of how they govern 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Late on a summer evening, James Wedick -- Jimmy to some of his friends -- is 
still at work in a 12-foot-square, windowless room in the FBI's Sacramento 
office. As a special agent, he earns about $80,000 a year, including two hours 
a day of mandatory "overtime," but he works even longer, usually by himself. 
Battered file cabinets, sagging steel shelves and cardboard boxes hem in the 
table that serves as his desk. Wedick's colleagues jokingly call his room "the 
pit" or "the vortex." It seems a suitable home for an agent known for his 
obsessiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 For as long as he can remember, Wedick says, he wanted to be an FBI agent. At 
14, he even wrote the bureau for career guidance. But his request for 
information was mistaken as a job application, triggering a call from a 
recruiter who wanted to sign him up immediately. It took Wedick almost 10 
minutes to straighten out the FBI official, who ended the conversation abruptly 
after promising to send a copy of "The FBI Story." 
</P>
<P>
 Wedick, who was raised in the Bronx, is the son of a New York City Fire 
Department battalion chief. He landed his first FBI job at the age of 20 -- as 
a part-time clerk. He later began working 40 hours a week while pursuing a 
degree at Fordham University. Living on Staten Island at the time, he caught up 
on his sleep on subways and ferries while commuting four hours a day. "That's 
what my father taught me," Wedick says. "It was the work ethic all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 He became an agent at 23, the youngest in his training class. What he liked 
about the job was the action, the rush of apprehending hard-core criminals. "I 
personally never wanted to work white-collar crime and public corruption," he 
says. He was chasing bank robbers and fugitives in the late 1970s in Gary, 
Ind., when a fellow agent, a gregarious Southerner named John E. (Jack) 
Brennan, asked him to help out in an undercover, white-collar crime case. "I 
will only work this one case," Wedick told his friend. The case, code-named 
Operation Fountain Pen, "got bigger and bigger, until it consumed me," he says. 
Wedick hasn't worked bank robbery since. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief target was Phil Kitzer, a Minnesota swindler who specialized in 
selling worthless securities from phantom offshore enterprises with names like 
the First City National Bank of Haiti. (One of Kitzer's claims was that he 
participated in the theft -- by fraud -- of Elvis Presley's private jet.) For 
10 months, an unsuspecting Kitzer flew Brennan and Wedick around the world, 
introducing them to, among others, a New York mobster who once threatened to 
throw the pair out of a hotel window. 
</P>
<P>
 After intense days of posing as a con artist, Brennan would want to leave the 
office and relax with his family. Wedick, on the other hand, would stay until 2 
in the morning. Others who worked with him were struck that he was able to go 
from morning to night without stopping to eat. Wedick agrees that his job is 
"almost like an addiction," leading to the dissolution of his first marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 Operation Fountain Pen ended with the conviction of dozens of con men across 
the country, including Kitzer. It spawned another, more renowned sting 
operation, Abscam, which deployed agents and informants, some disguised as Arab 
royalty, as bait for grifters and -- as it turned out -- members of Congress. 
Wedick had blown his cover by then so he was merely a supporting player in 
Abscam, but the case gave him his first taste of exposing political corruption. 
And he was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau, fearing mob reprisals from Operation Fountain Pen, reassigned him 
to Sacramento in 1978. As he was settling in, Wedick received a tip from Marv 
Levin, then a consultant with a nonprofit agency that issued 
government-guaranteed loans to small businesses. The two had struck up a 
friendship soon after Wedick arrived in Sacramento, sometimes meeting in a 
local park while tending their children. (Wedick's son from his first marriage 
is now a teen-ager; he also has a preschool-aged daughter.) 
</P>
<P>
 Levin, who had done some lobbying, told Wedick of conversations with an 
Assembly aide who claimed that legislation could be bought for a price in the 
state Capitol. Levin, who had been a whistle-blower while working for the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture in Washington, had a sharpened sense of outrage at a 
state government that he regarded as corrupt. Wedick says Levin's news didn't 
surprise him. An FBI probe in the late '70s of the Capitol had ended without 
any convictions. But Wedick realized that if he could persuade Levin to wear a 
hidden recording device -- a wire -- then he might be able to get the proof he 
needed to launch an investigation that would nail corrupt politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, while Wedick worked on a series of high-profile white-collar 
cases, he ruminated about ways to infiltrate the Legislature, sometimes talking 
it over with Brennan, now assigned to Mobile, Ala. While driving by a 
Sacramento fish market specializing in shrimp, the pair concocted the idea of 
setting up a bogus business that would import gourmet shrimp from the Gulf of 
Mexico to a growing market in Northern California. The home office would be 
established in Mobile. The company would need a special-interest measure to 
help it qualify for a loan guaranteed by the state. Undercover operatives would 
then approach lawmakers and their aides for help in moving their bill through 
the system. If the officials were corrupt -- if payoffs were necessary -- the 
FBI would write the checks. All conversations and transactions would be taped 
-- the kind of evidence that juries could not ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at FBI headquarters were intrigued by the scheme, but initially 
turned it down. The federal government had never authorized an operation that 
pushed phony legislation as a way to catch crooked state lawmakers; there was 
also concern that the investigation would be an unwarranted intervention by the 
federal government into state politics. Still, Wedick persisted, arguing that 
an undercover operation was the only way to penetrate a political system that 
has its own code of silence. "From Day One, the bureau was leery about getting 
involved with a state Legislature in this kind of intrusive way," Wedick says.  
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1985, with the help of two assistant U.S. attorneys, David F. Levi 
and George L. O'Connell, Wedick got the go-ahead from the Justice Department 
for the investigation, which included $100,000 for bribes. The project was 
code-named Brispec, for bribery-special interest, but later, when it became 
public, the press dubbed it "shrimpscam." 
</P>
<P>
 So concerned was FBI headquarters over the sting that it gave Wedick and the 
prosecutors only six months to show that they could deliver. During the next 
three years, "(t)here were several times that tempers exploded and we really 
thought at several junctures that the thing was just going to blow up," says 
former Assistant U.S. Atty. John P. Panneton, who prosecuted the first of the 
Brispec cases. "Wedick and his crew would basically have to justify continuing 
the operation and (the Department of Justice) didn't want to pay any more 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Wedick spent months setting up the bogus business, fussing over every detail. 
There were corporate papers to draw up, a checking account to open, stationery 
to print and phony correspondence to generate. Brennan would become John E. 
Gordon, president of Gulf Shrimp Fisheries, Inc. on Airport Boulevard in 
Mobile, and the secretary-treasurer of the corporation would be Gordon's 
invented brother, James J. Gordon -- none other than James J. Wedick. 
</P>
<P>
 As the probe moved fitfully, Wedick relied on his friend Marv Levin. 
Overweight and with a history of heart problems, Levin doesn't look like a spy. 
In fact, he is something of a klutz -- he once failed to change the batteries 
on his FBI-issued pager because he didn't want to waste the government's money. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Tapping into his experience as a lobbyist, Levin helped Wedick craft the bill 
so that it was customized for one company only -- Gulf Shrimp Fisheries. To 
qualify for a low-interest loan, according to the proposal, a company had to 
"import to the State of California low-fat, high-protein foodstuffs that are 
not native to the coast and State of California." Only such businesses in the 
counties of Sacramento or Yolo -- where Gulf Shrimp had its local office -- 
need apply. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative aides who helped maneuver the measure around procedural 
barriers were soon soliciting money for themselves and their bosses' campaigns, 
and agent Brennan was ready to comply. Securing the required approval from 
Washington on short notice, though, proved difficult. Wedick and his Sacramento 
boss, Terry Knowles, recall frantic attempts in August, 1986, to reach FBI 
Director William H. Webster for approval to make $28,000 in payoffs. Calling 
through the night, they were finally able to persuade an assistant director to 
authorize the payment, just hours before the 8 a.m. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Wedick and his team paid out $60,000 in bribes in 1986, and before 
they were done, they would shell out at least $25,000 more. The bill passed, 
but as had been agreed, the FBI tipped off then Gov. George Deukmejian about 
the sting and he vetoed the legislation. Prosecutors thought they had 
accumulated sufficient evidence to indict at least four individuals, including 
one prominent legislator -- Sen. Paul B. Carpenter, a Democrat from Cypress, 
and one of his top aides, John A. Shahabian. 
</P>
<P>
 But no arrests were made so that the probe could remain secret. Authorities 
realized they needed to "flip" one of the insiders they had caught in the act 
and use him to further penetrate the Legislature's corruption. Wedick and 
prosecutors debated who would be likely to cooperate. They settled on 
Shahabian. A chunk of a man with strikingly dark hair and a mustache, he was 
independent-minded with few illusions about the Legislature. He was also a 
devoted father and regularly attended the Armenian Apostolic Church. Most 
important, he was not likely to put loyalty to his boss ahead of his own and 
his family's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Marv Levin was now about to perform his most sensitive undercover job. Levin, 
who in real life was pushing to develop a posh marina in West Sacramento, 
prevailed on Shahabian to join him for an unusual 7 a.m. meeting on Sept. 10, 
1987, with federal fish and game officials, supposedly to iron out differences 
over the Gulf Shrimp Fisheries project. Arriving at a federal office complex in 
suburban Sacramento, Shahabian entered what appeared to be the office of the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, complete with a large seal on the entry door. 
Levin led the legislative aide into an unmarked suite of offices. He vanished 
and Shahabian was met by someone he describes as "a striking woman," who 
flashed an FBI badge and greeted him by name. The agent was Nancy Eddington, 
who had recently been assigned to Wedick's team. (Three years later, Eddington 
and Wedick were married.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shahabian was supposed to think that agents had been working around the clock 
to nail him. To heighten the illusion, agents had not shaved and had 
extinguished dozens of cigarettes in boxes of stale pizza. There were also 
audio and photographic props. An anxious Shahabian faintly could hear secretly 
taped conversations of himself and Levin. Blown-up surveillance photos were 
tacked on the walls, showing him with his children. Another shot showed him 
accepting a sizable campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes, he was taken to the office of the FBI's special agent in 
charge, Terry Knowles. Reciting from a carefully constructed script, Knowles 
told Shahabian, "This is the most important day of your life." Shahabian 
remembers thinking to himself, "It's shaping up to be a pretty bad day." 
</P>
<P>
 After Knowles finished making his pitch, Shahabian was guided into a room, 
where he met Wedick. Shahabian, who was told that he could face a possible 
20-year prison term, decided to talk. "I had nothing but my wits against an 
array of agents and U.S. attorneys," he now says. "Wedick was basically the bad 
cop. It was his job to stay in my face. He's not a friendly guy. Not a 
backslapper or a charmer." 
</P>
<P>
 Shahabian recalls Wedick badgering him to make a commitment, like a prison 
camp commandant pressing a POW to cooperate. Wedick doesn't deny that he was 
blunt and confrontational. "At different times, John would change his story 
from basically admitting it to not admitting it to admitting it." At the end of 
15 hours -- during which he was repeatedly told that he could leave if he 
wanted -- Shahabian agreed to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Wedick's specialty, his niche in the bureau. He is the inquisitor, the 
tough guy who works to "turn" miscreants into willing allies. Typically, once 
they commit, he becomes "a soft guy," their best friend, their confidant and 
protector, for the life of the investigation. Prosecutor O'Connell, now a 
private attorney, describes Wedick's talent "as father confessor, as rabbi with 
all the characters he deals with."  
</P>
<P>
 Shahabian provided testimony that contributed to Carpenter's downfall and 
vital introductions that led to the prosecution of Hill and others. He was 
granted immunity from prosecution. But in the spring of 1993, Shahabian accused 
Wedick and other authorities of "unethical police methods" and "deceit." He 
charges that Wedick distorted transcripts of his secretly recorded 
conversations and deleted key passages. Wedick, who steadfastly has denied any 
improprieties, still wonders why he couldn't befriend Shahabian the same way he 
did other informants. He still gets calls from con man Kitzer. Ex-legislative 
aide Karin Watson hugged Wedick warmly after she was only sentenced to 
probation in exchange for her testimony against Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Shahabian's misgivings, his hundreds of hours of secretly recorded 
conversations with lawmakers and their aides were exactly what the authorities 
needed to prove criminal wrongdoing. Quoting from the tapes, Wedick persuaded a 
federal magistrate to allow a historic 1988 raid on the Capitol offices of 
Frank Hill, then an assemblyman, and three other lawmakers, Assemblyman Pat 
Nolan (R-Glendale), Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) and Assemblywoman Gwen 
Moore (D-Los Angeles). Moore was the only one not prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Jim Wedick. Today's date is July 10th, Wednesday, 1991. The time is 
approximately 7:39 a.m. in the morning. I'm with Alan Robbins. He's going to, 
he's about to meet with Clay Jackson at the El Rancho Hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 With this terse send-off, Wedick directed Robbins, a San Fernando Valley 
Democratic senator, to a breakfast meeting with Jackson, a cigar-chomping, 
6-foot-6, 300-pound attorney. Corporate clients paid Jackson's firm, SRJ 
Jackson, Barish & Associates, more than $2 million a year to represent their 
interests in the state Legislature, making it the highest-grossing lobbying 
firm at the Capitol. Wearing a wire and transmitter, Robbins walked into the 
aging West Sacramento motel for his rendezvous with Jackson. Wedick and two 
prosecutors parked nearby to eavesdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a month earlier during a meeting at the Hyatt Regency hotel, Robbins had 
agreed to cooperate with Wedick. The FBI's suspicions about him were aroused 
during the fight over the 1986 shrimp bill, when an aide to the senator 
solicited a $500 contribution from Gulf Shrimp Fisheries. But Robbins wasn't 
targeted by Wedick until several years later, when a San Diego hotel developer 
charged that the senator had extorted $250,000 from him. What clinched the case 
was Wedick's discovery that Robbins was laundering this and other payoffs, 
directing the money to a stable of girlfriends, including a stripper and a 
former prostitute, on the payroll of a Santa Monica public relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Savvy, intelligent, manipulative, the deeply tanned and well-dressed Robbins 
irritated his colleagues with his brashness almost from the moment he arrived 
in Sacramento in 1973. Robbins, who made millions of dollars as a land 
developer, seemed to always have a hidden agenda. In 1981, his career was 
almost derailed when he faced charges that he had had sex with two 16-year-old 
girls. He was acquitted and his legislative career thrived as he raised huge 
contributions from the insurance industry and other special interests. As a 
champion fund-raiser, Robbins was tolerated by his colleagues, even though he 
was one of the most disliked members of the Legislature. So it came as no 
surprise that he was a target of prosecutors.  
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with overwhelming evidence, Robbins signed on as an enthusiastic 
member of Wedick's team, agreeing to plead guilty and cooperate in exchange for 
a lighter sentence. Over breakfast with Jackson, he would try to get the 
insurance lobbyist to put a price on a worker's compensation bill important to 
his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jackson was about to have his coffee refilled, Robbins asked him for "a 
quantification" of what he was prepared to pay for his help on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean how important it is to the comp people?" Jackson asked a few seconds 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Immense . . .I could probably put something together on this in two days." 
</P>
<P>
 "Such as?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe a quarter?" 
</P>
<P>
 The shorthand phrase -- an offer of a $250,000 bribe -- was what the 
prosecutors needed to convict Jackson, who is now appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's attorney, Donald H. Heller, repeatedly objected to the FBI's use of 
Robbins, an admitted felon, as an undercover operative. The most vocal of the 
defense lawyers in the sting cases, he also attacked FBI tactics that he 
claimed were intended to intimidate witnesses. In a confidential letter to the 
court, Heller contended that Wedick attempted to scare off potential character 
witnesses for Jackson by asking them about his sexual relationships, which were 
unrelated to the charges against him. These questions were "calculated to 
intimidate prospective defense witnesses and smear Mr. Jackson's good name in 
Mr. Jackson's community," Heller complained. As Heller's letter makes clear, 
however, Wedick first got approval for the questions about Jackson's sexual 
behavior from the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by Robbins, the government also built a case against Coastal 
Commissioner Nathanson, a Beverly Hills real estate broker who had helped 
Robbins shake down the San Diego developer. Wedick also turned up evidence that 
Nathanson had sought to extort cash from such Hollywood figures as Sylvester 
Stallone, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Barry Diller for building permits for their 
beachfront homes. Nathanson eventually pleaded guilty to using his office as a 
criminal enterprise and was sentenced to 57 months in prison. Robbins 
originally was sentenced to five years, but because of his cooperation on these 
cases, a judge later cut the term to 24 months. He was released early from 
custody in March. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury takes only eight hours to find Frank Hill guilty of three counts of 
extortion, conspiracy and money laundering. Wedick's record is still perfect: 
14 convictions and no losses. Even before the Hill trial ends in mid-June, the 
FBI flies Wedick and his wife to Washington, D.C., so that he can receive an 
"award for excellence" from director Louis J. Freeh. The citation credits 
Wedick with initiating the Capitol probe and pursuing it "despite initial 
opposition to the plan." It is a surprising acknowledgment of the resistance 
that the probe generated. The trophy, an inscribed circle of leaded glass 
mounted on a wooden base, is the only sign of his achievement in the family 
room of his suburban Sacramento home. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days after the Hill verdict, wearing shorts and a T-shirt, the 
sunburned agent finally seems to have unwound. "Totally amazing" is how he 
describes the outcome, saying that the government never dreamed the operation 
would be as successful as it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Sipping tonic, he ticks off what he sees as the larger repercussions of his 
probe, including the 1990 ballot initiatives that instituted legislative term 
limits and a strict code of ethics that bars honorariums like the one that Hill 
took from an undercover agent. "We clearly got some of the big players down 
here," Wedick says. "But we didn't get them all. There's more of a leeriness if 
someone starts to talk about money and legislation in the same breath." 
</P>
<P>
 While Wedick is proud of such progress, he has no illusions that he has 
transformed the culture of Sacramento. His investigation has certainly not 
curtailed massive fund-raising, especially during the end of the legislative 
session in August, when lawmakers stage dozens of events around the Capitol 
just as they are about to vote on controversial bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedick is especially dismayed that Hill continues to have his defenders and 
that his colleagues were reluctant to expel him from office. Senate Republican 
Leader Ken Maddy, who testified on Hill's behalf, explained to reporters that 
many lawmakers regard Hill as a good friend. Maddy questioned whether Hill 
would have been convicted outside of Sacramento. "I think he was more a victim 
of circumstances and the venue than he is of committing a crime," Maddy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-September, Wedick heads for the federal courthouse for the last act in 
the FBI sting. Hill, who finally resigned in July, is about to be sentenced. 
Wedick's dress is sharper than usual: instead of his usual white shirt, he's 
wearing a blue-striped one he borrowed from his son. 
</P>
<P>
 In the courthouse, Wedick walks past Hill's family and supporters into the 
courtroom of Judge Edward J. Garcia. When Hill and his co-defendant, former 
Democratic Senate aide Terry E. Frost, are called to the bench, the ruddy-faced 
Hill appeals to Garcia for mercy, reiterating his innocence. But throughout the 
proceeding, Garcia makes it clear that he views Hill as a liar. "The jury 
didn't believe him (at the trial)," says Garcia, "nor did I." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, moved by letters of support on Hill's behalf, Garcia sentences the 
former state senator to a relatively light 46 months in prison. Frost receives 
21 months. (Both are now in the Federal Prison Camp near Boron, with appeals 
pending.) In the lobby of the courthouse, tearful friends and relatives comfort 
and embrace Hill. As Faye Hill walks by the agent who dreamed up the sting that 
caught her husband, she snarls, "They'd better hold me back." 
</P>
<P>
 "If Faye Hill thinks I get a kick sending Frank Hill to prison," Wedick says 
later, "I don't." There is some drive in him, however, that makes him want to 
root out wrongdoing, and it won't let him rest. "I just can't give up the 
chase." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, although he won't discuss it, Wedick is pursuing allegations that 
elected officials in Fresno and Clovis sold their votes on land-use issues to 
developers. He has also kept track of ex-Sen. Paul Carpenter, recently 
extradited from Costa Rica, where he fled after his 1993 conviction for mail 
fraud, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 But he hasn't turned away from the Capitol, where he remains a bete noire for 
many of the Old Guard who believe that but for happenstance, they could be 
sitting in a federal prison camp in the place of their former colleagues. 
During the Hill trial, Assembly Republicans threw one of their usual 
fund-raisers at the Hyatt, this one attended by Gov. Pete Wilson. Afterward, 
several lobbyists spotted Wedick in the lobby. Some thought he had come to spy, 
which he denies. They complained to him about the targets of his probe. "They 
were saying, 'You got the wrong guys,' " Wedick recalls. "My reply was, 'There 
are (crooked) guys? Who are they? If you have the information, let's start with 
you.' "

THE BIZ: HIP HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lauren Lipton 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's the difference between house music and acid house music? Are tattoos 
passe? Is it even hip to say "hip"? 
</P>
<P>
 Trivial questions for most people, certainly, but not for producers, directors 
and writers trying to fill theaters.And for those tempted to say, "Who cares of 
kids don't really say, 'This blows chunks'? Who's gonna notice?" Guy Brand, 26, 
above, and Matthew Grim, 28, right, have some advice: The very viewers you're 
trying to attract will notice, and they'll laugh their heads off. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Reality Inc., Grim and Brand's fledgling West L.A. consulting firm. Its 
goal is to set Hollywood straight about anything youth-related -- from music to 
computer hacking to body piercing. They are almost certainly the only 
by-twentysomething-about-twentysomething show-biz consultants in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Grim and Brand, who previously owned a succession of nightclubs, can cite 
endless examples of media cluelessness. Take drugs, for example. "Being in the 
club life we've had friends who OD'ed," says Grim. "If you see what a real 
addict is like, and then you see an addict on '90210,' you're like, 'Oh, my 
God.' They're not even close." 
</P>
<P>
 "Beverly Hills, 90210" may be unrealistic, you could argue, but it's still 
successful. (Brand credits the show's ratings to its campiness.) Not so with 
last year's disappointing "Reality Bites," which "was just such a plethora of 
suckiness," says Grim, who hated the film's portrayal of young people as 
misdirected whiners. 
</P>
<P>
 The guys have worked on a Slayer music video and Gen X-ized scripts for 
several independent producers ("when in doubt, use profanity"). Brand provided 
slang for "Caged Heat 3000," an upcoming Roger Corman gem. "He's great," says 
Aaron Osborne, the director. "I think he's a hipster." 
</P>
<P>
 That, naturally, is the point. "This is basically our life," says Grim. "Why 
not get paid for it?" Lauren Lipton

VALLEY BRIEFING: THE GOLDEN YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 80 years since Universal Studios' Carl Laemmle said, "I hope I didn't 
make a mistake coming out here," the motion picture industry's migration to the 
Valley has proven successful, growing into the Valley's top industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Moviemaking's first moguls were lured west in the early 1900s by warm weather 
and the Valley's vast and varied terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Movies came to the Valley to stay when Warner Bros. moved to Burbank in the 
1920s. By 1940, Disney had moved to Burbank and film production in the Valley 
rivaled that in Hollywood. The 1930s and '40s were the studios' golden age, a 
time of peak production and attendance. Here's a look at the Valley's three 
largest studios. Warner Bros. Studios 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Warner Bros. moved to Burbank in 1929, it had established itself 
as a leader in bringing sound to motion pictures. The four brothers--Harry, 
Albert, Sam, and Jack--started in the film business in 1903 with a nickelodeon, 
gradually expanding into distribution and production. 
</P>
<P>
 With "The Jazz Singer," they made the first film with partial sound. Despite 
this early jump on competitors, the studio's move to color film was slow and 
its biggest successes remained black-and-white film noir movies. The studio 
gained a reputation as a bare-bones, cost-cutting operation by making movies 
economically and quickly. Directors often produced as many as five features a 
year. The Films

 Warner Bros. specialized in low-budget, fast-paced gangster sagas, dramas, 
comedies and musicals in the 1930s. Film costs ranged between $200,000 and 
$400,000. "The Public Enemy," for example, starring James Cagney, cost the 
studio $200,000. 03,18,06,06 Types of Films 1935 1945 Action/Adventure 4 1 War

 Universal founder Carl Laemmle, an immigrant clothing manufacturer, opened his 
first nickelodeon in Chicago in 1906. By 1913, Laemmle had three small studios 
in Hollywood and was looking to expand.

 Laemmle purchased a 230-acre chicken ranch on the northeastern edge of the 
Cahuenga Pass for $165,000, named it Universal City and opened the studio in 
1915.

 Equipped for both studio and exterior shooting, the site included a zoo with a

 In the 1930s, Universal established itself as the king of horror films. 
Adventure films such as the "Flash Gordon" series were also popular during the 
'30s. Universal produced big-hit movies such as "King of Jazz" ($1.65 million) 
in 1930 as well as less expensive hits such as "Frankenstein" ($250,000) in 
1931. 03,18,06,06 Types of Films 1935 1945 Action/Adventure 9 8 War 0 0 Fantasy

 Warner Bros. enjoyed skyrocketing profits from its early talkies in the late 
1920s. But its finances suffered from the Depression in the early '30s and 
recovery was slow. Its profit margin was about $10,000 per picture in 1935.

 In late 1941, Warner Bros. purchased the play "Everybody Comes to Rick's" for 
$20,000. After a title change, rewriting and juggling of lead actor, 
"Casablanca" began filming in May, 1943, without a finished script. Rewriting 
continued through shooting, which was completed in 59 days at a cost of 
$950,000. "Casablanca" was filmed almost entirely on the studio's backlot, 
transformed into French Morocco. The backlot's "French Street" provided the 
setting for the Paris flashback sequence, a setting still used in films. Only 
one scene was filmed off the lot--the arrival of Maj. Strasser at Casablanca's 
airport was filmed at the old Metropolitan Airport in Van Nuys. The concluding 
airport segment was filmed on Stage One at the studio. Walt Disney Studios

 The Disney studio was an influential part of the migration of the motion 
picture industry to Burbank, even though it wasn't considered a major studio 
typical of the golden years. Before moving to Burbank, Disney's Hollywood 
studio produced cartoons and animated characters that became 'star' in their 
own right. 
</P>
<P>
 When the company outgrew its Hollywood site, Walt Disney purchased a 51-acre 
lot in Burbank in 1939, where he built a $1-million studio. The studio 
resembled a campus more than other studios, which had high walls and sound 
stages. Yet it was on that 'campus' that many animation techniques were 
pioneered. Disney highlights and finances

BLINDSIDED / ORANGE COUNTY'S FINANCIAL CRISIS; PRELUDE TO THE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Understanding the roots of Orange County's financial crisis requires a review 
of growth in population and services and the shifts in sources of income. In 
the 1980s, county government grew fat, with a prosperous and growing tax base 
and well-heeled population. Between 1980 and 1990, the population grew more 
quickly than that of Los Angeles County. Along with demographic changes came 
changes in affluence in Orange County, as median income remained significantly 
higher than that of its more populous neighbor to the north.

 Critical Financial Shifts

<P>
 Orange County's growth meant increasing demand for schools, police and 
services. But in the early 1990s, property values had peaked and recession was 
taking its toll. Between 1991 and the current fiscal year, the bulk of county 
general fund revenues shifted dramatically from property taxes to income from 
interest-bearing investments. The increasing dependence on revenue from the 
investment pool set Orange County up for last week's dramatic collapse.

KEEPING THE FAITH

 Your piece on Jim Wallis ("Faith, Hope and Activism," by Howard Kohn, Nov. 6) 
was uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 All my life I have lived in white suburban neighborhoods while my child 
attended predominantly white schools. Then I became starkly aware of the 
separateness of white America and black America. I recently moved to a 
predominantly African American neighborhood. My child now goes to a school 
where there is a mixture of races.

 Jim Wallis and the Sojourners light the way for those of us who have heard the 
wake-up call.

 It was wonderful to read a story about a true man of God who not only talks 
the talk of Jesus Christ but walks the walk as well. I am so tired of 
Christians being stereotyped as a bunch of Bible-thumping fanatics.

 I graduated from an evangelical Christian college where "progressive 
evangelicals" of Jim Wallis' ilk captivated student audiences weekly. I've 
learned that it is very tempting to assume the progressive evangelical's scorn 
for mainstream evangelical culture and conservative politics. 
</P>
<P>
 However, progressive evangelicalism has two fundamental flaws. First, it is a 
subtle type of spiritual pride ("no, we are not tacky and simplistic Christians 
like those conservatives, thank you very much") and, second, it ignores the 
complete message of the Bible. Jesus did not go around preaching a vague type 
of humanitarianism, but insisted on repentance and a radical holiness available 
only through Him. Unfortunately, Wallis and others like him see the systemic 
sins of society clearly enough, but they neglect to communicate Jesus' frequent 
commands for personal repentance from all sins.

 When American Christians employ Wallis' agenda, creating a Christian

will truly see the kingdom of heaven on earth.

 As a Christian Democrat, I now propose a radical solution to the national 
debt. In the Bible, a "jubilee" periodically canceled all debts. Let's declare 
the year 2001 an American Jubilee, and erase the $4-trillion debt.

THE G-MAN, THE SHRIMP SCAM AND SACRAMENTO'S BIG STING; FBI AGENT JAMES WEDICK'S 
UNDERCOVER OPERATION NETTED 14 PUBLIC OFFICIALS. BUT HAS IT CHANGED THE WAY THE 
STATE LEGISLATURE WORKS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the prosecution table in a wood-paneled federal courtroom in Sacramento 
sits FBI agent James J. Wedick Jr. His suit and tie are as drab as any 
plainclothes cop's, but there is something that sets him apart: the long brown 
hair, flecked with gray; the salt-and-pepper beard; the half-glasses that give 
him an almost scholarly air. For nearly a decade, through endless stakeouts, a 
failed marriage and bureaucratic hurdles, Wedick, 44, has spearheaded the most 
ambitious political corruption investigation in California history. 
Infiltrating the world of back-room deals and $1,000-a-plate dinners, he and 
his team snared five lawmakers, Sacramento's top lobbyist, a coastal 
commissioner and various aides. So far, they have not lost a case. 
</P>
<P>
 At the defense table is state Sen. Frank C. Hill. From the moment he was 
elected to the Assembly in 1982 at the age of 28, Hill seemed ticketed for 
statewide office. Popular with his colleagues, the Whittier lawmaker was in the 
inner circle of the Assembly Republican leadership, and he regularly lunched 
with the governor. Handsome. Brash. Always smiling. A prodigious fund-raiser. 
But Hill now faces charges that he extorted $2,500 from an undercover agent. 
His political career is in shreds, his legal bills mounting, and each of the 
three counts of extortion, money laundering and conspiracy against him carries 
a maximum prison term of 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the lead-off witness against Hill last May, Wedick tells jurors that 12 
years earlier, a "cooperating witness" told him that $30,000 could buy 
special-interest legislation in California. Wedick was happy to hear it, 
because he realized he had an opportunity to prove that lawmaking in the 
nation's most populous state was for sale. It confirmed his worst suspicions 
that California's reputation for squeaky clean politics was a facade, that it 
was as unsavory as the old Tammany Hall in his native New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Why was it necessary, the prosecutor asks him, to set up a phony shrimp 
business to ensnare Hill and other legislators? It's the nature of the crime, 
Wedick instructs the jurors. In a bank robbery, the FBI is notified almost 
instantaneously. But political corruption is harder to detect. If a lobbyist 
"bribed a state legislator," he says, "he is not likely to report it to us and 
neither is the legislator." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hill's lawyer takes his turn, he tries to get Wedick to discredit a 
former Hill aide named Karin Watson, who is expected to provide crucial 
testimony. The lawyer presses Wedick to admit that the FBI entrapped Watson by 
plying her with expensive champagne. Wedick concedes that during secretly 
recorded conversations, Watson "sounded like she had a lot to drink." The 
defense attorney shoots back, "Didn't that concern you?" Wedick, an experienced 
witness, turns the question into an opportunity to slam Hill. "My chief concern 
was that I had a criminal violation," he bristles. Watson, he points out, 
"arranged for Frank Hill to co-author a bill for $10,000 long before" she was 
given champagne by an undercover informant. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 100 miles southwest of the courthouse lies the Federal Prison Camp at 
Dublin. A neatly landscaped flower garden greets visitors to the complex of 
refurbished Army barracks that house the 300 nonviolent, white-collar inmates. 
Assigned four to a room, prisoners can place their own phone calls and spend as 
much as $165 a month at the commissary on such items as typewriter ribbon and 
perfume oils. There's no razor wire or chain link encircling the facility. In 
fact, there's no fence at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp has become a satellite of the state Capitol. On a recent day, former 
Assembly Republican Leader Pat Nolan, now prisoner 06833-097, scurries up a 
staircase, flashing a smile. A bulletin board lists former Coastal Commissioner 
Mark L. Nathanson -- dubbed "commissioner to the stars" because of the help he 
offered prominent Hollywood figures -- as a member of the prison's Toastmasters 
Club. So is onetime Assembly aide Tyrone Netters. Ex-legislative aide Darryl 
Freeman is also at the camp. Clayton R. Jackson, a hulking former college 
football player who became the Capitol's top lobbyist, waits for a visit from 
state Sen. Nicholas C. Petris.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and the four others at Dublin are among the 12 public officials 
arrested, indicted and convicted in Wedick's undercover operation. They once 
shaped the laws of California. Today, they are cutting weeds, fixing toilets or 
cooking meals, serving an average of four years in prison. Like them, Hill 
advanced his career in a political culture that relies on hefty campaign 
contributions as the currency of political action.  
</P>
<P>
 Wedick breached that system and exposed how fund-raising is interwoven into 
the fabric of lawmaking and can be a form of bribery. His zealotry has made him 
perhaps the most hated man in Sacramento. Defenders of Hill and others targeted 
by the FBI assail Wedick as a rogue agent who abused the powers of the federal 
government. Sacramento lawyer Donald H. Heller, Jackson's attorney, describes 
Wedick as "a very aggressive agent. I think his greatest strength is his 
greatest failing. He's so dogged in his pursuit of truth that anything that 
doesn't fit his view must be a lie." 
</P>
<P>
 But a few lobbyists and reformers voice admiration for Wedick, saying he has 
inspired a long overdue housecleaning and revealed the inherently corrupting 
nature of fund-raising. Perhaps, more than anything else, Wedick's 
investigation has given Californians a disturbing view of how they govern 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Late on a summer evening, James Wedick -- Jimmy to some of his friends -- is 
still at work in a 12-foot-square, windowless room in the FBI's Sacramento 
office. As a special agent, he earns about $80,000 a year, including two hours 
a day of mandatory "overtime," but he works even longer, usually by himself. 
Battered file cabinets, sagging steel shelves and cardboard boxes hem in the 
table that serves as his desk. Wedick's colleagues jokingly call his room "the 
pit" or "the vortex." It seems a suitable home for an agent known for his 
obsessiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 For as long as he can remember, Wedick says, he wanted to be an FBI agent. At 
14, he even wrote the bureau for career guidance. But his request for 
information was mistaken as a job application, triggering a call from a 
recruiter who wanted to sign him up immediately. It took Wedick almost 10 
minutes to straighten out the FBI official, who ended the conversation abruptly 
after promising to send a copy of "The FBI Story." 
</P>
<P>
 Wedick, who was raised in the Bronx, is the son of a New York City Fire 
Department battalion chief. He landed his first FBI job at the age of 20 -- as 
a part-time clerk. He later began working 40 hours a week while pursuing a 
degree at Fordham University. Living on Staten Island at the time, he caught up 
on his sleep on subways and ferries while commuting four hours a day. "That's 
what my father taught me," Wedick says. "It was the work ethic all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 He became an agent at 23, the youngest in his training class. What he liked 
about the job was the action, the rush of apprehending hard-core criminals. "I 
personally never wanted to work white-collar crime and public corruption," he 
says. He was chasing bank robbers and fugitives in the late 1970s in Gary, 
Ind., when a fellow agent, a gregarious Southerner named John E. (Jack) 
Brennan, asked him to help out in an undercover, white-collar crime case. "I 
will only work this one case," Wedick told his friend. The case, code-named 
Operation Fountain Pen, "got bigger and bigger, until it consumed me," he says. 
Wedick hasn't worked bank robbery since. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief target was Phil Kitzer, a Minnesota swindler who specialized in 
selling worthless securities from phantom offshore enterprises with names like 
the First City National Bank of Haiti. (One of Kitzer's claims was that he 
participated in the theft -- by fraud -- of Elvis Presley's private jet.) For 
10 months, an unsuspecting Kitzer flew Brennan and Wedick around the world, 
introducing them to, among others, a New York mobster who once threatened to 
throw the pair out of a hotel window. 
</P>
<P>
 After intense days of posing as a con artist, Brennan would want to leave the 
office and relax with his family. Wedick, on the other hand, would stay until 2 
in the morning. Others who worked with him were struck that he was able to go 
from morning to night without stopping to eat. Wedick agrees that his job is 
"almost like an addiction," leading to the dissolution of his first marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 Operation Fountain Pen ended with the conviction of dozens of con men across 
the country, including Kitzer. It spawned another, more renowned sting 
operation, Abscam, which deployed agents and informants, some disguised as Arab 
royalty, as bait for grifters and -- as it turned out -- members of Congress. 
Wedick had blown his cover by then so he was merely a supporting player in 
Abscam, but the case gave him his first taste of exposing political corruption. 
And he was hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau, fearing mob reprisals from Operation Fountain Pen, reassigned him 
to Sacramento in 1978. As he was settling in, Wedick received a tip from Marv 
Levin, then a consultant with a nonprofit agency that issued 
government-guaranteed loans to small businesses. The two had struck up a 
friendship soon after Wedick arrived in Sacramento, sometimes meeting in a 
local park while tending their children. (Wedick's son from his first marriage 
is now a teen-ager; he also has a preschool-aged daughter.) 
</P>
<P>
 Levin, who had done some lobbying, told Wedick of conversations with an 
Assembly aide who claimed that legislation could be bought for a price in the 
state Capitol. Levin, who had been a whistle-blower while working for the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture in Washington, had a sharpened sense of outrage at a 
state government that he regarded as corrupt. Wedick says Levin's news didn't 
surprise him. An FBI probe in the late '70s of the Capitol had ended without 
any convictions. But Wedick realized that if he could persuade Levin to wear a 
hidden recording device -- a wire -- then he might be able to get the proof he 
needed to launch an investigation that would nail corrupt politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, while Wedick worked on a series of high-profile white-collar 
cases, he ruminated about ways to infiltrate the Legislature, sometimes talking 
it over with Brennan, now assigned to Mobile, Ala. While driving by a 
Sacramento fish market specializing in shrimp, the pair concocted the idea of 
setting up a bogus business that would import gourmet shrimp from the Gulf of 
Mexico to a growing market in Northern California. The home office would be 
established in Mobile. The company would need a special-interest measure to 
help it qualify for a loan guaranteed by the state. Undercover operatives would 
then approach lawmakers and their aides for help in moving their bill through 
the system. If the officials were corrupt -- if payoffs were necessary -- the 
FBI would write the checks. All conversations and transactions would be taped 
-- the kind of evidence that juries could not ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at FBI headquarters were intrigued by the scheme, but initially 
turned it down. The federal government had never authorized an operation that 
pushed phony legislation as a way to catch crooked state lawmakers; there was 
also concern that the investigation would be an unwarranted intervention by the 
federal government into state politics. Still, Wedick persisted, arguing that 
an undercover operation was the only way to penetrate a political system that 
has its own code of silence. "From Day One, the bureau was leery about getting 
involved with a state Legislature in this kind of intrusive way," Wedick says.  
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1985, with the help of two assistant U.S. attorneys, David F. Levi 
and George L. O'Connell, Wedick got the go-ahead from the Justice Department 
for the investigation, which included $100,000 for bribes. The project was 
code-named Brispec, for bribery-special interest, but later, when it became 
public, the press dubbed it "shrimpscam." 
</P>
<P>
 So concerned was FBI headquarters over the sting that it gave Wedick and the 
prosecutors only six months to show that they could deliver. During the next 
three years, "(t)here were several times that tempers exploded and we really 
thought at several junctures that the thing was just going to blow up," says 
former Assistant U.S. Atty. John P. Panneton, who prosecuted the first of the 
Brispec cases. "Wedick and his crew would basically have to justify continuing 
the operation and (the Department of Justice) didn't want to pay any more 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 Wedick spent months setting up the bogus business, fussing over every detail. 
There were corporate papers to draw up, a checking account to open, stationery 
to print and phony correspondence to generate. Brennan would become John E. 
Gordon, president of Gulf Shrimp Fisheries, Inc. on Airport Boulevard in 
Mobile, and the secretary-treasurer of the corporation would be Gordon's 
invented brother, James J. Gordon -- none other than James J. Wedick. 
</P>
<P>
 As the probe moved fitfully, Wedick relied on his friend Marv Levin. 
Overweight and with a history of heart problems, Levin doesn't look like a spy. 
In fact, he is something of a klutz -- he once failed to change the batteries 
on his FBI-issued pager because he didn't want to waste the government's money. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Tapping into his experience as a lobbyist, Levin helped Wedick craft the bill 
so that it was customized for one company only -- Gulf Shrimp Fisheries. To 
qualify for a low-interest loan, according to the proposal, a company had to 
"import to the State of California low-fat, high-protein foodstuffs that are 
not native to the coast and State of California." Only such businesses in the 
counties of Sacramento or Yolo -- where Gulf Shrimp had its local office -- 
need apply. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislative aides who helped maneuver the measure around procedural 
barriers were soon soliciting money for themselves and their bosses' campaigns, 
and agent Brennan was ready to comply. Securing the required approval from 
Washington on short notice, though, proved difficult. Wedick and his Sacramento 
boss, Terry Knowles, recall frantic attempts in August, 1986, to reach FBI 
Director William H. Webster for approval to make $28,000 in payoffs. Calling 
through the night, they were finally able to persuade an assistant director to 
authorize the payment, just hours before the 8 a.m. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Wedick and his team paid out $60,000 in bribes in 1986, and before 
they were done, they would shell out at least $25,000 more. The bill passed, 
but as had been agreed, the FBI tipped off then Gov. George Deukmejian about 
the sting and he vetoed the legislation. Prosecutors thought they had 
accumulated sufficient evidence to indict at least four individuals, including 
one prominent legislator -- Sen. Paul B. Carpenter, a Democrat from Cypress, 
and one of his top aides, John A. Shahabian. 
</P>
<P>
 But no arrests were made so that the probe could remain secret. Authorities 
realized they needed to "flip" one of the insiders they had caught in the act 
and use him to further penetrate the Legislature's corruption. Wedick and 
prosecutors debated who would be likely to cooperate. They settled on 
Shahabian. A chunk of a man with strikingly dark hair and a mustache, he was 
independent-minded with few illusions about the Legislature. He was also a 
devoted father and regularly attended the Armenian Apostolic Church. Most 
important, he was not likely to put loyalty to his boss ahead of his own and 
his family's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Marv Levin was now about to perform his most sensitive undercover job. Levin, 
who in real life was pushing to develop a posh marina in West Sacramento, 
prevailed on Shahabian to join him for an unusual 7 a.m. meeting on Sept. 10, 
1987, with federal fish and game officials, supposedly to iron out differences 
over the Gulf Shrimp Fisheries project. Arriving at a federal office complex in 
suburban Sacramento, Shahabian entered what appeared to be the office of the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, complete with a large seal on the entry door. 
Levin led the legislative aide into an unmarked suite of offices. He vanished 
and Shahabian was met by someone he describes as "a striking woman," who 
flashed an FBI badge and greeted him by name. The agent was Nancy Eddington, 
who had recently been assigned to Wedick's team. (Three years later, Eddington 
and Wedick were married.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shahabian was supposed to think that agents had been working around the clock 
to nail him. To heighten the illusion, agents had not shaved and had 
extinguished dozens of cigarettes in boxes of stale pizza. There were also 
audio and photographic props. An anxious Shahabian faintly could hear secretly 
taped conversations of himself and Levin. Blown-up surveillance photos were 
tacked on the walls, showing him with his children. Another shot showed him 
accepting a sizable campaign contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes, he was taken to the office of the FBI's special agent in 
charge, Terry Knowles. Reciting from a carefully constructed script, Knowles 
told Shahabian, "This is the most important day of your life." Shahabian 
remembers thinking to himself, "It's shaping up to be a pretty bad day." 
</P>
<P>
 After Knowles finished making his pitch, Shahabian was guided into a room, 
where he met Wedick. Shahabian, who was told that he could face a possible 
20-year prison term, decided to talk. "I had nothing but my wits against an 
array of agents and U.S. attorneys," he now says. "Wedick was basically the bad 
cop. It was his job to stay in my face. He's not a friendly guy. Not a 
backslapper or a charmer." 
</P>
<P>
 Shahabian recalls Wedick badgering him to make a commitment, like a prison 
camp commandant pressing a POW to cooperate. Wedick doesn't deny that he was 
blunt and confrontational. "At different times, John would change his story 
from basically admitting it to not admitting it to admitting it." At the end of 
15 hours -- during which he was repeatedly told that he could leave if he 
wanted -- Shahabian agreed to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Wedick's specialty, his niche in the bureau. He is the inquisitor, the 
tough guy who works to "turn" miscreants into willing allies. Typically, once 
they commit, he becomes "a soft guy," their best friend, their confidant and 
protector, for the life of the investigation. Prosecutor O'Connell, now a 
private attorney, describes Wedick's talent "as father confessor, as rabbi with 
all the characters he deals with."  
</P>
<P>
 Shahabian provided testimony that contributed to Carpenter's downfall and 
vital introductions that led to the prosecution of Hill and others. He was 
granted immunity from prosecution. But in the spring of 1993, Shahabian accused 
Wedick and other authorities of "unethical police methods" and "deceit." He 
charges that Wedick distorted transcripts of his secretly recorded 
conversations and deleted key passages. Wedick, who steadfastly has denied any 
improprieties, still wonders why he couldn't befriend Shahabian the same way he 
did other informants. He still gets calls from con man Kitzer. Ex-legislative 
aide Karin Watson hugged Wedick warmly after she was only sentenced to 
probation in exchange for her testimony against Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Shahabian's misgivings, his hundreds of hours of secretly recorded 
conversations with lawmakers and their aides were exactly what the authorities 
needed to prove criminal wrongdoing. Quoting from the tapes, Wedick persuaded a 
federal magistrate to allow a historic 1988 raid on the Capitol offices of 
Frank Hill, then an assemblyman, and three other lawmakers, Assemblyman Pat 
Nolan (R-Glendale), Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier) and Assemblywoman Gwen 
Moore (D-Los Angeles). Moore was the only one not prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Jim Wedick. Today's date is July 10th, Wednesday, 1991. The time is 
approximately 7:39 a.m. in the morning. I'm with Alan Robbins. He's going to, 
he's about to meet with Clay Jackson at the El Rancho Hotel." 
</P>
<P>
 With this terse send-off, Wedick directed Robbins, a San Fernando Valley 
Democratic senator, to a breakfast meeting with Jackson, a cigar-chomping, 
6-foot-6, 300-pound attorney. Corporate clients paid Jackson's firm, SRJ 
Jackson, Barish & Associates, more than $2 million a year to represent their 
interests in the state Legislature, making it the highest-grossing lobbying 
firm at the Capitol. Wearing a wire and transmitter, Robbins walked into the 
aging West Sacramento motel for his rendezvous with Jackson. Wedick and two 
prosecutors parked nearby to eavesdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a month earlier during a meeting at the Hyatt Regency hotel, Robbins had 
agreed to cooperate with Wedick. The FBI's suspicions about him were aroused 
during the fight over the 1986 shrimp bill, when an aide to the senator 
solicited a $500 contribution from Gulf Shrimp Fisheries. But Robbins wasn't 
targeted by Wedick until several years later, when a San Diego hotel developer 
charged that the senator had extorted $250,000 from him. What clinched the case 
was Wedick's discovery that Robbins was laundering this and other payoffs, 
directing the money to a stable of girlfriends, including a stripper and a 
former prostitute, on the payroll of a Santa Monica public relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Savvy, intelligent, manipulative, the deeply tanned and well-dressed Robbins 
irritated his colleagues with his brashness almost from the moment he arrived 
in Sacramento in 1973. Robbins, who made millions of dollars as a land 
developer, seemed to always have a hidden agenda. In 1981, his career was 
almost derailed when he faced charges that he had had sex with two 16-year-old 
girls. He was acquitted and his legislative career thrived as he raised huge 
contributions from the insurance industry and other special interests. As a 
champion fund-raiser, Robbins was tolerated by his colleagues, even though he 
was one of the most disliked members of the Legislature. So it came as no 
surprise that he was a target of prosecutors.  
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with overwhelming evidence, Robbins signed on as an enthusiastic 
member of Wedick's team, agreeing to plead guilty and cooperate in exchange for 
a lighter sentence. Over breakfast with Jackson, he would try to get the 
insurance lobbyist to put a price on a worker's compensation bill important to 
his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jackson was about to have his coffee refilled, Robbins asked him for "a 
quantification" of what he was prepared to pay for his help on the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean how important it is to the comp people?" Jackson asked a few seconds 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Immense . . .I could probably put something together on this in two days." 
</P>
<P>
 "Such as?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe a quarter?" 
</P>
<P>
 The shorthand phrase -- an offer of a $250,000 bribe -- was what the 
prosecutors needed to convict Jackson, who is now appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's attorney, Donald H. Heller, repeatedly objected to the FBI's use of 
Robbins, an admitted felon, as an undercover operative. The most vocal of the 
defense lawyers in the sting cases, he also attacked FBI tactics that he 
claimed were intended to intimidate witnesses. In a confidential letter to the 
court, Heller contended that Wedick attempted to scare off potential character 
witnesses for Jackson by asking them about his sexual relationships, which were 
unrelated to the charges against him. These questions were "calculated to 
intimidate prospective defense witnesses and smear Mr. Jackson's good name in 
Mr. Jackson's community," Heller complained. As Heller's letter makes clear, 
however, Wedick first got approval for the questions about Jackson's sexual 
behavior from the U.S. attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by Robbins, the government also built a case against Coastal 
Commissioner Nathanson, a Beverly Hills real estate broker who had helped 
Robbins shake down the San Diego developer. Wedick also turned up evidence that 
Nathanson had sought to extort cash from such Hollywood figures as Sylvester 
Stallone, Jeffrey Katzenberg and Barry Diller for building permits for their 
beachfront homes. Nathanson eventually pleaded guilty to using his office as a 
criminal enterprise and was sentenced to 57 months in prison. Robbins 
originally was sentenced to five years, but because of his cooperation on these 
cases, a judge later cut the term to 24 months. He was released early from 
custody in March. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury takes only eight hours to find Frank Hill guilty of three counts of 
extortion, conspiracy and money laundering. Wedick's record is still perfect: 
14 convictions and no losses. Even before the Hill trial ends in mid-June, the 
FBI flies Wedick and his wife to Washington, D.C., so that he can receive an 
"award for excellence" from director Louis J. Freeh. The citation credits 
Wedick with initiating the Capitol probe and pursuing it "despite initial 
opposition to the plan." It is a surprising acknowledgment of the resistance 
that the probe generated. The trophy, an inscribed circle of leaded glass 
mounted on a wooden base, is the only sign of his achievement in the family 
room of his suburban Sacramento home. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days after the Hill verdict, wearing shorts and a T-shirt, the 
sunburned agent finally seems to have unwound. "Totally amazing" is how he 
describes the outcome, saying that the government never dreamed the operation 
would be as successful as it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Sipping tonic, he ticks off what he sees as the larger repercussions of his 
probe, including the 1990 ballot initiatives that instituted legislative term 
limits and a strict code of ethics that bars honorariums like the one that Hill 
took from an undercover agent. "We clearly got some of the big players down 
here," Wedick says. "But we didn't get them all. There's more of a leeriness if 
someone starts to talk about money and legislation in the same breath." 
</P>
<P>
 While Wedick is proud of such progress, he has no illusions that he has 
transformed the culture of Sacramento. His investigation has certainly not 
curtailed massive fund-raising, especially during the end of the legislative 
session in August, when lawmakers stage dozens of events around the Capitol 
just as they are about to vote on controversial bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedick is especially dismayed that Hill continues to have his defenders and 
that his colleagues were reluctant to expel him from office. Senate Republican 
Leader Ken Maddy, who testified on Hill's behalf, explained to reporters that 
many lawmakers regard Hill as a good friend. Maddy questioned whether Hill 
would have been convicted outside of Sacramento. "I think he was more a victim 
of circumstances and the venue than he is of committing a crime," Maddy said. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-September, Wedick heads for the federal courthouse for the last act in 
the FBI sting. Hill, who finally resigned in July, is about to be sentenced. 
Wedick's dress is sharper than usual: instead of his usual white shirt, he's 
wearing a blue-striped one he borrowed from his son. 
</P>
<P>
 In the courthouse, Wedick walks past Hill's family and supporters into the 
courtroom of Judge Edward J. Garcia. When Hill and his co-defendant, former 
Democratic Senate aide Terry E. Frost, are called to the bench, the ruddy-faced 
Hill appeals to Garcia for mercy, reiterating his innocence. But throughout the 
proceeding, Garcia makes it clear that he views Hill as a liar. "The jury 
didn't believe him (at the trial)," says Garcia, "nor did I." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, moved by letters of support on Hill's behalf, Garcia sentences the 
former state senator to a relatively light 46 months in prison. Frost receives 
21 months. (Both are now in the Federal Prison Camp near Boron, with appeals 
pending.) In the lobby of the courthouse, tearful friends and relatives comfort 
and embrace Hill. As Faye Hill walks by the agent who dreamed up the sting that 
caught her husband, she snarls, "They'd better hold me back." 
</P>
<P>
 "If Faye Hill thinks I get a kick sending Frank Hill to prison," Wedick says 
later, "I don't." There is some drive in him, however, that makes him want to 
root out wrongdoing, and it won't let him rest. "I just can't give up the 
chase." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, although he won't discuss it, Wedick is pursuing allegations that 
elected officials in Fresno and Clovis sold their votes on land-use issues to 
developers. He has also kept track of ex-Sen. Paul Carpenter, recently 
extradited from Costa Rica, where he fled after his 1993 conviction for mail 
fraud, obstruction of justice, conspiracy and money-laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 But he hasn't turned away from the Capitol, where he remains a bete noire for 
many of the Old Guard who believe that but for happenstance, they could be 
sitting in a federal prison camp in the place of their former colleagues. 
During the Hill trial, Assembly Republicans threw one of their usual 
fund-raisers at the Hyatt, this one attended by Gov. Pete Wilson. Afterward, 
several lobbyists spotted Wedick in the lobby. Some thought he had come to spy, 
which he denies. They complained to him about the targets of his probe. "They 
were saying, 'You got the wrong guys,' " Wedick recalls. "My reply was, 'There 
are (crooked) guys? Who are they? If you have the information, let's start with 
you.' "
