 JOB DEATHS: What's the No. 1 killer in the California workplace? Toxic gas, 
dangerous machinery? No, the grim answer is violence. . . . A state study 
released two weeks ago shows that more than a third of the 615 job-related 
deaths last year were caused by violence, marking the first time it has 
surpassed transportation accidents as the leading cause of death on the job. . 
. . In Orange County, violence accounted for nine of the 38 occupational deaths 
last year, with transportation accidents blamed in 11.

 KNOCK, KNOCK: In an old-fashioned organizing drive, members of the Hotel and 
Restaurant Employees Local 681 are canvassing neighborhoods in Anaheim, hoping 
to identify potential union members and leaders. The target: large apartment 
complexes in places like the Jeffrey-Lynne area, home to many Latinos who are 
hotel and restaurant workers. . . . "We're trying to be pro-active," says 
organizing director Alberto Mejia-Moreno. "We can't just sit around and wait 
for disgruntled employees to call us." 
</P>
<P>
 OUTREACH: This fall, the Orange County Central Labor Council is asking county 
high schools and libraries to display this poster of Samuel Gompers, the father 
of the U.S. labor movement. . . . The umbrella labor organization "wants to get 
the kids to vote," says council head Bill Fogarty, who adds: "Maybe it'll stir 
some interest in labor unions." With 96,000 rank and file in 105 union locals 
in Orange County, membership has remained flat throughout the '90s.

 LABOR DAY, 1946: What a heady time it was in Orange County. Men discharged 
from the service were re-entering the job market in droves, veterans were 
flocking to schools and colleges, and women -- though accounting for a third of 
the county's unemployed -- were scrambling for openings in laundry and cleaning 
plants, ceramics and electronics. . . . It's all in the county's first analysis 
of the labor force -- compiled in September, 1946. The report noted that citrus 
farms, walnut packing houses and oil fields accounted for half the 42,774 
workers. Today's total agricultural and oil production employment here: just a 
hair over 1%.

 LABOR DAY: One hundred years ago today, the U. S. Congress declared the first 
Monday of September as a federal holiday to honor working people. . . . Several 
states in the union were quicker to give legal status to Labor Day. Oregon was 
the first to do so, in 1887. . . . Barry Hammitt, executive director of the 
union representing Ventura County employees, said of the holiday: "It's a time 
for us to pause and reflect on the things we've accomplished (for American 
workers) and also to re-evaluate the things we need to do." 
</P>
<P>
 HOLY DAY: At sundown today, Jews will gather at synagogues throughout Ventura 
County to wish each other L'Shana Tova, marking the beginning of Rosh Hashana, 
the Jewish New Year 5755. . . . The High Holy Days are a time for 
self-examination and spiritual renewal, said Rabbi Shimon Paskow of Temple Etz 
Chaim in Thousand Oaks. "It's a time when we resolve to do better in our lives 
and to pray for health, happiness and peace." . . . The 10-day holiday 
culminates with Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, beginning at sundown on Sept. 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 WINGING IT: They're all there. Bearcat firefighters, Mitchell bombers, even a 
twin-engine Curtiss C-46 Commando Transport. . . . The vintage World War II 
aircraft are on display through today at Camarillo Airport as part of an open 
house and air show sponsored by the Southern California Wing of the Confederate 
Air Force (B1). . . . Today's show hours are 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 PEST AWARD: There are good bugs, and there are bad bugs. . . . The Fillmore 
Citrus Protective District specializes in getting rid of bad bugs, 
crop-destroying pests that threaten the livelihood of growers. And they do it 
without harmful pesticides. Their secret: rearing good bugs that love to eat 
the bad ones. . . . Recently, the California EPA honored the 72-year-old 
insectarium with a "good bug award." Said manager Monte Carpenter: "I feel real 
good that we are starting to get notice for the work we've done."

STREET SMART: COORDINATED LIGHTS ON COAST HIGHWAY ARE FOILED BY CROWDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As a resident of Laguna Beach, I am well aware of the tremendous number of 
visitors and tourists that come to our wonderful city, especially in the 
summer, and that of the traffic jams this influx will create. But when the 
summer is over we still have horrendous traffic jams, especially during commute 
times. This leads me to two questions. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that the traffic lights on Coast Highway downtown are not 
properly synchronized. Wouldn't traffic flow much smoother if the four or five 
lights downtown were better synchronized to allow traffic to flow easier along 
the road? Once you get past downtown, traffic flows smoothly in either 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, some genius has decided to widen the highway between Corona del Mar 
and Laguna, now providing three and maybe four lanes in some areas to bring 
even more people south into Laguna. Since we can't handle the current traffic 
coming in on the two southbound lanes, how are we going to handle the extra 
traffic? Shouldn't this have been solved before we spent all the money on 
widening the highway? 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Selecky Laguna Beach Over the years, Street Smart has received several 
letters about the congestion on Coast Highway in the heart of Laguna Beach. 
Caltrans officials are aware of it too, but they say signal coordination isn't 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic signals on the highway in Laguna Beach are coordinated from 7 a.m. 
to midnight, but other factors affect traffic flow, said Rose Orem, a 
spokeswoman for Caltrans. A big hindrance is that on average 36,000 cars travel 
this route daily, a volume that frequently exceeds the road's capacity, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is all the drivers wanting to make westbound left turns from 
side streets like Broadway, Ocean and Forest onto the constantly busy 
southbound Coast Highway, Orem said. These streets have traffic signals on the 
highway that are spaced from 264 to 353 feet apart, and that configuration 
allows for only a few cars on the highway to get through between intersections, 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Drivers trying to parallel-park, heavy pedestrian traffic across the busy 
thoroughfare and drivers who sightsee all delay the traffic, Orem said. For 
signal coordination to work, all or most of these congestion factors have to be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The widening you referred to was paid for by the Irvine Co. to mitigate its 
development in that area, Orem said. The state's master plan for the highway 
calls for six lanes for the entire length, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But downtown areas like Laguna Beach would be hard to widen without taking 
away the on-street parking, Orem said. There currently are no plans to widen 
Coast Highway through Laguna Beach, but Caltrans anticipates that when the San 
Joaquin Hills Corridor opens in 1997 there should be substantial relief, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 On North Bristol Street south of John Wayne Airport, the traffic lights at 
Birch and Campus are electronically timed. They are timed, however, exactly 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving Birch on a green light puts you at Campus just in time to hit the red. 
What gives?  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kochendorfer Dana Point Those signal lights have been coordinated to 
accommodate the heaviest traffic demands during certain times of the day, said 
Caltrans' Rose Orem. 
</P>
<P>
 During the morning commute, most traffic is headed south toward the business 
district, so traffic signals are synchronized for a smooth progression through 
the area, Orem said. In the evening, the signals are changed to accommodate 
traffic going north. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are driving against the commuter flow, it is likely that you will 
encounter a red light at Campus, Orem said. It goes to the old dictum that not 
everyone can have a green light.  
</P>
<P>
 Your wait at the red light should not be interminable, though. Each signal 
cycle is 60 seconds long, with a maximum wait of 40 seconds if you hit a red 
light, Orem said. 
</P>
<P>

 The Orange County Transportation Authority will host a transportation fair 
Friday through Sunday in the Center Court of Laguna Hills Mall during regular 
mall hours. Visitors can get information about Orange County's future 
construction on Measure M-funded freeway projects such as the El Toro Y 
reconstruction and see vehicles like OCTA's SuperBus, which holds twice as many 
passengers as other buses.  
</P>
<P>
 The fair also will provide information on current OCTA services, including 
buses, Metrolink commuter trains, public transportation for people with 
disabilities and driver services such as the freeway service patrol and the 
county's call box system.

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I agree that freeway exits in California should be numbered, but no money 
should be spent to number exits until the United States joins the rest of the 
civilized world and converts our highways to the metric system. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, I believe, exits on Interstate 19 between Tucson, Ariz., and 
Nogales, Tex., are numbered by kilometers from the Mexican border northward, 
which has presented no difficulties to the motoring public. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Bass, Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You're absolutely correct: The exit warning signs and distance markers along 
Interstate 19 between Tucson and Nogales use kilometers rather than miles. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bob Christ of the Arizona Department of Transportation, it's been 
that way for more than 20 years, ever since they changed the name of the 
roadway from Highway 89 to Interstate 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of tourism and traffic that comes up from Mexico, where they 
use the metric system," Christ explains. "It's an international highway" -- not 
too different from Interstate 5 here in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The change from miles to kilometers along Interstate 19 initially sparked some 
complaints. "There were a lot of folks confused," Christ said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most motorists have since adjusted. But die-hard opponents of the metric 
system can take solace in the fact that you can still find mileposts to the far 
right of the highway, though the kilometer markers are now more prominent. 
</P>

<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I have come across many intersections that have left-turn arrows, and once 
they go red, no left turns can be made, even if no cars are coming from the 
other direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't the green left-turn arrow turn into a solid green so cars will be 
able to make the left turn when there are no cars coming? It doesn't seem to be 
any more dangerous than at a normal intersection, and at night, when fewer cars 
are on the road, it is frustrating to have to wait for a green left-turn signal 
when it is perfectly safe to make the turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Schryver, Winnetka 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You make a good point, but there is a reason, if not a rhyme, as to why all 
left-turn signals don't give you a second chance to make the turn. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, the concept of letting a left-turn signal melt into a solid 
green is a relatively new one. "That's something that's come on within the last 
10 years," said city traffic engineer Brian Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called a "protective-permissive" signal, because the turn goes from being 
a protected one with a left arrow to an unprotected, but permissible, turn with 
a solid green. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever the city puts in left-turn signals nowadays, engineers try to install 
the protective-permissive variety. But that kind of stoplight is not suitable 
for all intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll never find such a signal at intersections with two left-turn lanes, for 
instance. If left turns were allowed for cars in two lanes on a solid green, 
one car could easily block the visibility of the other driver after both have 
edged out into the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor visibility because of topography (such as a hill or bend in the road), 
high speed of oncoming traffic or a high accident rate at a particular 
intersection will also prompt engineers to rule out unprotected left turns and 
regulate them with an arrow only. 
</P>
<P>
 And you'll rarely find protective-permissive signals for left turns onto 
freeway on-ramps. Those stoplights are regulated by Caltrans, which adheres to 
different standards from the city, Gallagher said.

NURTURING A LOVE AFFAIR FOR VINTAGE PLANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's no pilot, but Joe Peppito of Newbury Park has kept aircraft in the sky 
for more than 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time (the pilots) have a problem, they call me in," the 70-year-old 
retired airline mechanic said Sunday, cleaning his hands after working on the 
malfunctioning tail fin of a 1945 Navy SNJ-4 trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they beat them up like this," he said, pointing to the tail of the 
bright yellow vintage aircraft, "I'm the guy who puts them back together." 
</P>
<P>
 Peppito and other members of the Southern California Wing of the Confederate 
Air Force are hosting the organization's annual open house, a free display of 
World War II-era planes that continues through today at Camarillo Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing exactly what I was doing 50 years ago, working on (these) 
airplanes," Peppito said. "To me, that's a privilege." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds turned out Sunday at the Camarillo Airport for the second day of the 
three-day open house. The show features more than a dozen planes, including the 
China Doll transport plane and a Bearcat fighter, one of a handful remaining in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Music of the big bands of the 1940s played from a stereo as vendors sold 
copies of wartime newspapers, with headlines such as one from the San Francisco 
Call-Bulletin that read, "Yank Naval Victory Grows" from July, 1943, and "2 
Million Yanks Home by Xmas" from September, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, organizers accepted $1 donations for a tour of the China Doll while 
other vendors sold T-shirts, framed photographs and hats with images of the 
aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 All proceeds were to benefit the nonprofit Confederate Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to educate the public on the contribution men and women made 
in fighting World War II," said Steve Barber, a Ventura stockbroker who was 
flying Sunday in a Navy training plane for the public while also practicing for 
the Point Mugu Air Show four weeks from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to remember what they did and the sacrifices they made," said 
Barber, 47, a Vietnam veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 The vintage planes brought back memories for Ed Thomas, 68, who spent much of 
World War II patrolling the North Atlantic, seeking out enemy submarines as a 
nose gunner in a B-24 bomber. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something about flying in a World War II aircraft," he said. "They're 
noisy, they vibrate. You can feel it through your whole body." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a retired financial planner, is another member of the Confederate Air 
Force who spent Sunday answering questions and spinning stories from his war 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are real airplanes," he said fondly. "The planes they're building these 
days are so fast and sophisticated that you're not a pilot, you're a computer 
programmer." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Black of Woodland Hills brought a video camera to record the day for his 
parents. His father was a Navy pilot during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like the old planes," he said, shutting off the recorder for a moment. 
"My mom and dad are from that era, so I thought I'd play the tape for them when 
I get home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the kind of stuff you can only read about nowadays," Black said. "You 
never get to see it anymore, so this is just like a piece of history." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the runway, where civilian private planes took off and landed throughout 
the day, Steve Cohen of Thousand Oaks came to see the famed Bearcat, a plane 
known for its speed and agility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love watching these planes fly," he said, standing a little farther away as 
the Bearcat began its ascent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of a nostalgia thing," said Cohen, the head groundskeeper at the 
Calvary Church in Westlake. "These planes are so well taken care of that 
they're probably safer than any of the ones they make today." 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped for a moment as the silver fighter lifted off only a few dozen 
yards away, unflinching at the deafening noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the loudness," he said. "That's one of the things I like most."

HOUSING PLAN ALTERING CREEK COURSE IS OPPOSED; CAMARILLO: MANY FEAR FLOODING, 
ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE WILL RESULT FROM PARDEE'S PROJECT. BUILDER SAYS HOMEOWNERS 
OBJECT TO LOSING SCENIC VIEWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After building more than 3,000 homes on the east end of Camarillo over the 
last two decades, Ventura County's largest developer has angered scores of 
homeowners with its plan to construct houses on land that now is on the bottom 
of Calleguas Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed development will be possible if Pardee Construction Co. gains 
city, county and federal approval for a $10-million project to change the 
course of a one-mile stretch of the creek in east Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee's plan has sparked concern among nearby residents, who say changing the 
creek's natural course could prove disastrous, bringing floods and permanent 
destruction of scarce environmental resources. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pardee officials say the dispute really is about homeowners who don't want 
to lose their view of the creek. The company defends the plan, saying it 
benefits the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan is to improve the creek, not to realign it, basically," said Willard 
B. Teller, Pardee assistant vice president and manager of the company's Ventura 
County projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The creek project is an outgrowth of Pardee's desire to develop Pitts Ranch on 
the west bank of the Calleguas, in the Mission Oaks section of Camarillo. 
Because the ranch abuts the creek, any development there must include shoring 
up the banks of the adjoining waterway to prevent flooding. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee, which wants to build almost 1,000 single- and multifamily homes on 150 
acres of Pitts Ranch, has designed a $10-million channeling project to narrow 
and deepen Calleguas Creek, and to replace a planned mobile home park with 60 
acres of open space that would include a 20-acre riparian habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The creek alteration also will free up 25 acres of land across the water from 
Pitts Ranch, including 10 acres that are on the creek bottom. Pardee is trying 
to get city approval to build 99 homes on that parcel, with about 40 of them 
constructed on the former creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
 That part of the plan has provoked the ire of some homeowners whose property 
overlooks the creek and who paid extra money for their location when they 
bought their houses from Pardee three to four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is approved, the homeowners' back yards will overlook the rooftops 
of the 99 houses instead of the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may seem a little selfish because this is in our back yard . . . but this 
is one of the few natural areas still in the city of Camarillo," said Lynn 
Abel, who says he paid an extra $20,000 for his luxury home four years ago 
because of its location. "Developers will build everything they own until it's 
all concrete. We're saying, just stop when you go to the creek line . . .. 
Stop. You've had enough." 
</P>
<P>
 That view is echoed by Abel's neighbor, Jerry Frost, who promises to fight the 
Pardee plan "all the way to the end of this project." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a quality-of-life issue that's bigger than profits, and somebody has 
to say, 'That's enough,' " Frost said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is proceeding through two approval processes: The Ventura County 
Flood Control Department has final say on what Pardee does to the creek, and 
the city of Camarillo dictates the fate of the surrounding land. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental studies have yet to be completed on either portion of the 
project, but Camarillo's draft report on rezoning the land next to the creek 
could be ready later this month. Teller said even if the project is approved, 
home construction could not begin before January, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the project say they fear there is nothing they can do to stop it 
because of Pardee's clout in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee has been a major force in Camarillo since 1969, when it bought more 
than 1,000 acres in the city. Since then the company has purchased another 300 
acres. All 3,000 homes in Mission Oaks were built by Pardee, beginning in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "Developer fees have been fueling the size of Camarillo's budget," resident 
Abel said, expressing concern that city officials will be unwilling to kill the 
project. "They have to have a certain number of homes built every year because 
it brings in money." 
</P>
<P>
 As for county flood officials, Abel charged that they want the project to go 
forward because they are getting the creek shored up without using taxpayer 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee's Teller also said the county Flood Control Department wants the 
project to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alex Sheydayi, who oversees the agency, says that is not the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flood protection work really is not needed unless the land is going to be 
developed," Sheydayi said. "If the city is going to allow Pardee to build 
there, then Pardee needs to do something to protect it. But if Pardee doesn't 
build, there's nothing that needs protecting." 
</P>
<P>
 People on both sides of the argument over whether to change the creek are 
claiming environmental motivations. 
</P>
<P>
 Teller said the rechanneling will decrease erosion of the creek bank and 
reduce the sediment that is flowing 12 miles downstream to Mugu Lagoon, an open 
bay near the ocean that geologists say will disappear in 50 years if the 
erosion is not curbed. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that land proposed as a riparian area presently is an eyesore, 
used as a dumping ground for refrigerators and other trash. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Cynthia Leake, vice president of the Ventura County 
Environmental Coalition and an east Camarillo resident, says Pardee is 
destroying the city's quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is being preserved for any future generation," Leake said. "They have 
no right to be able to buy a natural resource and then change it." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost and Abel, whose back yards overlook Calleguas Creek, say red-tail hawks, 
coyotes, possums and other wildlife will be lost if the Pardee plan goes 
through. And they accuse the developer of hiding behind the Mugu Lagoon to 
justify changing the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheydayi says the environmental argument is a smoke screen on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pardee wants to develop land," the flood control official said. "Pardee is 
not doing this out of the goodness of their heart to protect Mugu Lagoon." 
</P>
<P>
 As for opponents of the plan, Sheydayi said many have become environmentally 
minded "because it gives them ammunition to fight something." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the flood control department is the lead government agency overseeing 
the creek project, approval also must be granted by the California Fish and 
Game Department, the U. S. Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Wilson, Fish and Game's environmental specialist for stream-bed 
alterations in Ventura, Santa Barbara and west Los Angeles counties, says 
Pardee's proposed creek project is "relatively sensitive to wildlife issues." 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I can tell on the surface, it doesn't look too bad," Wilson said. 
"It's a fairly sensitive plan, surprisingly enough." 
</P>
<P>
 While opponents to the plan scoff at Pardee's claim that the creek alteration 
will improve the local environment, Wilson and Sheydayi say that appears to be 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The new riparian area -- wild-growth vegetation common to the river bottom -- 
would be bigger than the existing one, Wilson noted. In addition, it will be 
protected from heavy flooding so the vegetation can take root. 
</P>
<P>
 And Pardee will plant vegetation along the sides of the creek instead of 
installing concrete banks, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the creek design is justifiable, the 99 homes should not be built 
next to it, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Many opponents of the Pardee project have expressed concern that the 99 houses 
would be vulnerable to flooding. Teller, however, says the land would be 
elevated 12 to 15 feet to keep it above the anticipated water level during a 
once-in-a-century flood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheydayi also said there should be no problem with building the homes in a 
former creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing extraordinary or unusual," he said. "What's being done here has 
been done many other places." 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Sweatt, administrative manager for Rancho Adolfo Estates, a mobile home 
park just downstream from the proposed project, said that even if the 99 houses 
don't flood, their presence will cause increased creek runoff that could create 
major problems for residents of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the biggest concern is you don't redesign the creek," Sweatt said. "I 
think this park is in for some flooding." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost said he fears the area will soon look like the San Fernando Valley, but 
Camarillo senior planner Robert W. Burrow denies that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the Mission Oaks master plan is the San Fernando Valley by any 
means," Burrow said. "It's just that now they are seeing the completion of the 
Mission Oaks master plan as it was adopted in the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
 Teller said Pardee has been sensitive to the concerns of surrounding 
neighborhoods as it developed its plans. For example, he said, the 60 acres of 
open space that would include the riparian area currently is zoned for a mobile 
home park. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardee is asking Camarillo city officials to change the zoning to open space 
because residents of the nearby Hillcrest neighborhood do not want to look down 
on mobile homes, Teller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Pardee's original idea for the land across from Pitts Ranch was to 
build apartments or condominiums. Because of complaints from the neighborhood 
where Frost and Abel live, Pardee changed it to single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheydayi said if his agency had spearheaded the project, it would not have 
designed such an extensive project because it would not be interested in any 
land reclamation. But he said he does not blame Pardee for what it wants to do.

ELECTIONS / COUNTY RACES; DEMOCRATS, GOP PLOT FALL CAMPAIGN STRATEGIES; 
POLITICS: AT STAKE IN THE BALLOTING ARE FOUR LEGISLATIVE POSTS, TWO 
CONGRESSIONAL SEATS AND HOST OF CITY, SCHOOL AND COUNTYWIDE CONTESTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura County Democrats hold their annual barbecue and political rally in 
Camarillo today, while Republican candidates and supporters plot their own 
campaign strategies and battle plans for the weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Day has traditionally marked the start of the fall political season, a 
time when candidates on both sides of the political field turn up the volume on 
their campaigns, holding fund-raisers, launching voter-registration drives and 
organizing volunteers to lead get-out-the-vote efforts in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates are jockeying for four legislative posts and two congressional 
seats representing Ventura County as well as a host of city, school and 
countywide races. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat and Republican leaders say how well their candidates do in the Nov. 8 
election will depend on a number of factors, ranging from voter turnout -- 
which some fear could be affected by the O.J. Simpson trial -- to the 
performance of both Gov. Pete Wilson and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide initiative Save Our State, which calls for banning health and 
education benefits to illegal immigrants, could also be a factor because it 
elicits such strong emotional reactions from conservatives and liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to bring conservatives out to vote," said Bob Larkin, 
chairman of the Ventura County Republican Central Committee. "And if it does, 
it's going to help Republicans all down the line." 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic leaders and organizers say while the ballot measure may boost 
voter turnout, that does not necessarily mean Republicans will have the 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "If SOS brings out conservatives, it will also bring out liberals," said Vince 
Ruiz, president of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, a 
co-sponsor of the Democratic barbecue today. Besides, said Ruiz, who is helping 
to lead get-out-the-vote efforts in the county, not all traditional Democratic 
voters oppose the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Latinos are as divided on this issue as everybody else," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ruiz said Democrats have their work cut out for them in Ventura County, 
where Republicans have gained a significant lead in voter registration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with Democrats is that we need to get people out to vote," he 
said. "We need to get united more than anything else. We need to spend the off 
years doing what the Republicans do, registering voters and getting organized." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz said proceeds from the Labor Day barbecue will be used to open a united 
Democratic headquarters in downtown Ventura, one that will provide telephones, 
fax machines and volunteers for the party's state and federal candidates. Also, 
he said the Labor Council is planning to launch an aggressive 
voter-registration drive in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats are also hoping the campaigns of gubernatorial candidate Kathleen 
Brown and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-California) will also attract 
Democratic voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Chatman, chairman of Democrats United of Ventura County, said both 
candidates have already spent time campaigning in Ventura County and are 
expected to make return visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County has become an important county for a lot of statewide races," 
Chatman said. "We're growing, so we get a little more attention. We used to be 
the county where the campaign train went through real fast. But now they're 
willing to stop and talk to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Republicans say a historic midterm backlash against the party in 
power will favor GOP candidates. They're also hoping the slight decline in 
Clinton's approval rating and Wilson's proven ability to fight his way back in 
public opinion polls will boost the chances for all Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious the Democrats are doing everything they can to distance 
themselves from the President," said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who 
is seeking his fifth term. "In the eight years I've been in Congress, I've 
never seen more confusion and a lack of leadership than I've seen in the last 
eight months." 
</P>
<P>
 In the November election, Gallegly will face Kevin Ready, a Santa Barbara 
deputy county counsel who has little campaign cash or public name recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gallegly, who won his congressional seat in 1986 after an upset primary 
victory over Tony Hope, said he doesn't take any opponent lightly. "Every race 
is the toughest race of my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates agree that one of the most pressing issues facing the county 
is the possible threat of closing or scaling back the Point Mugu and Port 
Hueneme naval bases as part of the continuing defense cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 With 11 years of military experience in both the Army and Navy, Ready said he 
is better suited to lead the fight to keep the bases open. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting because I've got more military experience than my 
conservative opponent," Ready said. "It's usually the other way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has no military background, Gallegly said he has always enjoyed 
strong support in the military community, noting that the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars named him California legislator of the year in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get that type of endorsement unless you're sensitive to the needs 
of veterans and strongly support the military services in this country," 
Gallegly said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the county's other congressional race, Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland 
Hills) is being challenged by Richard Sybert, a former cabinet-level official 
in Gov. Wilson's Administration who has poured more than $300,000 of his own 
money into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert has run a tough-talking campaign, accusing Beilenson at every 
opportunity of being an "off-the-rack liberal, who is soft on crime, soft on 
immigration . . . and tough on taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 But Beilenson said voters in the 24th Congressional District, which stretches 
from Thousand Oaks to Sherman Oaks, will not be swayed by such campaign 
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go through this every two years," said Beilenson, who handily beat Tom 
McClintock, a former Thousand Oaks assemblyman and dyed-in-the-wool 
conservative, to retain his seat in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson acknowledged that President Clinton's drop in opinion polls would 
not help him this November to win his 10th term in Congress. But he said he did 
not believe it would hurt him either. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience has always been that voters in California are pretty 
independent," he said. "They don't necessarily pull the lever all the way for 
one party or the other. Back in the '80s, people all over the Valley were 
voting for Reagan, and at the same time they were voting for me for Congress. 
So I don't really think it makes a lot of difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat and Republican leaders both covet two open legislative seats that 
represent Ventura, Santa Paula, Ojai and other west Ventura County communities. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 35th Assembly District, Brooks Firestone, a Santa Barbara winery owner 
and a descendant of the founder of Firestone Tires, is competing against 
Democrat Mindy Lorenz, a college professor and former Green Party congressional 
candidate. The seat is available because Assemblyman Jack O'Connell 
(D-Carpinteria) has decided to run for the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican officials say the well-financed Firestone, who narrowly lost his 
first bid for the Assembly seat to O'Connell in 1982, is better prepared this 
time. But Firestone said he is not waging his campaign as a sure thing because 
voter registration in the Assembly district is split almost evenly between 
Democrats and Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Firestone recently distributed a letter to supporters of Lorenz's Democratic 
primary opponent, Bob Ream, in hopes of luring them to his campaign. In the 
letter, Firestone made reference to Lorenz's former affiliation with both the 
Green Party and the Peace and Freedom Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "At best Mindy Lorenz is a political candidate looking for a party and a 
belief," Firestone wrote in the letter. "At worst, she's an opportunist." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz views her political background as an asset, saying it demonstrates her 
willingness to take a stand on issues and her openness to view them with a 
fresh perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think one of the things people like about me is that I have a demonstrated 
record of having the courage of my convictions," she said, adding that Ream had 
no success exploiting her history of switching political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz and her supporters hope voters will be more impressed with her ability 
to overcome personal struggles. Once a single mother living on food stamps, 
Lorenz has managed to earn a doctoral degree and a job as an art history 
teacher at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I really understand the everyday needs of people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state's 18th Senate District, O'Connell faces Steve MacElvaine, a 
cattle rancher and former San Luis Obispo County supervisor for the seat left 
open by retiring Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell has enjoyed bipartisan support for a decade in his 35th Assembly 
District, which encompasses the southern half of the 18th Senate District. 
</P>
<P>
 But MacElvaine said that while O'Connell has done well with voters in his 
Assembly district, he is not well known in the northern half of the district 
that includes MacElvaine's home turf in conservative San Luis Obispo County. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell has captured a wide advantage in campaign cash, amassing more than 
$247,000 for the fall campaign. In contrast, MacElvaine shows only $3,000 in 
his campaign bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, MacElvaine said he will run an aggressive campaign. And he adds 
that O'Connell has spent 12 years in the legislature, and therefore must take 
some of the blame for the economic, education and crime problems facing 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get to be the No. 2 man in the state Assembly and not be part of 
the problem," MacElvaine said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 37th Assembly District, Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard) is seeking 
his second term to represent most of Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Port Hueneme and 
Oxnard. He faces his old nemesis, former Oxnard City Councilwoman Dorothy 
Maron, in the fall election. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats concede that Maron is a long-shot because Takasugi is better known 
and better financed. He has stockpiled nearly $60,000 for the fall campaign, 
contrasted with Maron's reserves of less than $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be hard for her," said Ruiz, of the Labor Council. "Takasugi 
has defeated her for mayor before. And he's in a district that includes 
conservative areas like Thousand Oaks and Camarillo." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills), whose 38th Assembly District 
includes Simi Valley and Fillmore, will face 19-year-old Democratic challenger 
Josh Arce of Chatsworth in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arce has little name recognition or financial support, he said he 
plans to run an aggressive grass-roots campaign against Boland, who is seeking 
her third term. 
</P>
<P>
 Two longtime county politicians are also making bids for statewide office this 
November. State Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) will square off against 
state Controller Gray Davis for lieutenant governor, while former Republican 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock of Thousand Oaks will go up against Los Angeles 
businesswoman Kathleen Connell for state controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, candidates for Ventura County offices have also been busy opening 
campaign offices in recent days, collecting endorsements and rustling up scarce 
campaign dollars for the fall election. 
</P>
<P>
 In one Thousand Oaks-based supervisorial district, longtime Thousand Oaks 
Councilman Frank Schillo is competing against first-time candidate Trudi Loh, 
an attorney. The race is expected to focus on growth and environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In another supervisorial district, this one covering Simi Valley and Moorpark, 
Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery faces Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy 
Mikels. Both candidates are running on their public records and government 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other countywide race on the November ballot is for county 
auditor-controller. Appointed incumbent Thomas O. Mahon is running against 
Oxnard accountant Richard Morrisset. 
</P>
<P>
 Although more than 500 Democrats are expected to attend the barbecue pep rally 
in Camarillo today, Larkin said county Republicans have no special events 
planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working hard all year, so we're going to take the day off," Larkin 
said. "But we'll be ready to kick into overdrive on Tuesday."

LOCAL JEWISH VETERANS LAUNCH A NEW GROUP; THOUSAND OAKS: A CEREMONY AT TEMPLE 
ETZ CHAIM MARKS CREATION OF CONEJO VALLEY CHAPTER. ITS GOAL IS TO OFFER 
SERVICES AND EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It felt like a punch to the gut. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of a new Thousand Oaks group for Jewish war veterans groaned as one of 
them recited a comment that political columnist Patrick Buchanan made just 
before the Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 While some American Jews are beating the drums of war, Buchanan had said, the 
Americans who would die in such a war were "kids with names like McAllister, 
Murphy, Gonzalez and Leroy Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 "It kills me," said Thousand Oaks resident Milt Piller, who served in the Army 
during World War II. "But I actually believe there are people out there who 
think that Jews did not volunteer for the service." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to bring attention to the thousands of Jews who fought and died in 
American uniforms, Piller and 25 other Thousand Oaks residents recently 
unfurled the banner of the Jewish War Veterans for the first time in Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 After a ceremony at Temple Etz Chaim, members of the new Conejo Valley chapter 
of the national nonprofit group, said they were hoping their troop could offer 
services to local veterans and sponsor educational talks for young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we really want to do is impress upon the younger generations that we did 
fight for our country," said Larry Golland, the group's program director. 
</P>
<P>
 Golland said the troop will visit local schools and attend special educational 
events to pass along that message. And, he hopes to join the existing Jewish 
War Veterans post in Ventura at special activities such as last month's Stand 
Down, an annual event to provide services for homeless veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura chapter, which was formed last year and is one of 600 nationwide, 
headed the clothing committee at Stand Down 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Schmidt, the commander of the Ventura post, said his group plans to visit 
hospitalized veterans in Santa Barbara or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Group members in the Conejo Valley said they too will pay hospital visits to 
local veterans, and they plan to begin raising funds for the families of 
veterans who have died. 
</P>
<P>
 The post will also contribute money to the 100,000-member national 
organization, which lobbies Congress on behalf of veterans' interests and runs 
a Jewish veterans' museum in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception in 1896, the group has focused on memorializing Jews who 
served in the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish War Veterans was founded "as a direct result of slander and 
insinuations that Jews had not participated in the (Civil War)," according to a 
written history provided to its members. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the goals listed in the group's constitution: "To preserve the memories 
and records of patriotic service performed by the men and women of our faith." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, the national group has gathered statistics and historical 
information about Jewish involvement in the nation's wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures released by the group indicate that more than 51,000 Jews were listed 
as casualties in World War II and 11,000 died in the conflicts in Europe and 
the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Having that information is particularly important, Golland said, because as 
time passes, memories of war begin to fade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The war was 50 years ago, and a lot of people now either weren't around or 
don't remember what it was like," Golland said. The memories of the war have 
dulled, even for those who were there. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the men stood in the temple last week talking about their hopes for the 
new group, they acknowledged some wounds would never heal. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving Wasserman, who lost his younger brother in combat, talked about his 
first day lining up before his battalion's commanding officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came up to us and said, 'I want you to know all about me. There are three 
things I hate most in this world. Jews, dogs and (blacks), in that order,' " 
Wasserman recalled. "Not surprisingly, I ended up on permanent latrine duty." 
</P>
<P>
 Golland said he can still picture the scene that made his heart drop, as his 
tank battalion rolled through France on the way to Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 He had chosen to ride in a tank because it seemed safe. But as he passed the 
charred steel skeletons of the battalions that came before his, he realized he 
was not safe at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense of security just disappeared when I saw that," Golland said. "I had 
every reason to be frightened." 
</P>
<P>
 Piller, who served under Gen. Douglas MacArthur in the Philippines, said he is 
still haunted by the sight of a Japanese war plane swooping toward his foxhole 
about 50 feet from the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember the plane was so close, I could see the pilot looking out the 
window at us as he flew by," Piller said. "I said to myself, well, I guess this 
is it, I'm going to die. But he ran out of ammunition or something because he 
passed right over us without firing a shot. A few seconds later he was hit and 
his plane went down." 
</P>
<P>
 Every member of the group has a story to tell, a memory that each has been 
unable to shake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Subconsciously," Piller said, "you have certain things in you that you're 
never going to get rid of." 
</P>
<P>
 That is part of the reason he felt that organizing a group of veterans was a 
good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, most of whom are in their 70s, share a bond based on their 
five-decades-old experiences. It is one that will bring the group a sense of 
camaraderie, but members acknowledge it also threatens the group's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Two or three members served in Korea and none served in more recent conflicts, 
Piller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to get some younger people in here, but so far we haven't had 
much luck," Piller said. Members have not yet followed the lead of the national 
organization, which has started a group called Descendants of Jewish War 
Veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be something we want to look into in the future," Piller said. "After 
all, the whole point of this group is to keep the memories alive."

RICHARD MARTIN OF NEWPORT, 'CHITO' OF FILMS, DIES AT 75 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Martin, an insurance broker who as a young man played the comic cowboy 
Chito Rafferty in more than 30 Western serial films for RKO, died Sunday of 
complications from leukemia at Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian. He was 75. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, of Balboa Island, started his show business career as a receptionist 
for MGM making $17.76 a week. His goal was to be a makeup man, but his acting 
career began after one of his friends, on a lark, bet an agent that he couldn't 
get Martin an acting contract. 
</P>
<P>
 A screen test with Fox led indirectly to a contract with RKO at $50 a week and 
a string of bit parts in various A and B films. Martin met his wife, actress 
Elaine Riley, on a film set in Carmel, where a scheduled four-day shoot 
stretched to three weeks because of fog. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin first developed the Irish-Mexican Chito character -- whose full name 
was Chito Jose Gonzales Bustamonte Rafferty -- in the 1943 war film 
"Bombardier." Martin, who had grown up with Latino neighbors in West Hollywood, 
affected an accent for the role. 
</P>
<P>
 Chito was enough of a hit to be included in a Zane Grey series. Martin shot 
two episodes with Robert Mitchum in the starring role before Mitchum got the 
break of his career in the film "G.I. Joe." Martin later was teamed with Tim 
Holt in the last three films of the series, and a longstanding partnership was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were paired in 26 other films including "Guns of Hate," "Brothers in 
the Saddle" and "Dynamite Pass." The movie interiors typically were shot in 
Hollywood before moving on to such locations as Lone Pine, under the shadow of 
the Eastern Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 Chito, handy with his fists and given to malapropisms and an overactive 
libido, was the comic counterpoint to Holt's serious and steadfast cowboy hero 
as the two fought Western injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin left the movie business in 1952 after Howard Hughes decided to end all 
B pictures at RKO, and became an insurance broker. He started his own business, 
Richard Martin Associates, specializing in estate planning and business 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 In later life, he often was surprised at how well Chito was remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to get the recognition for what you did," he said at the Sierra 
Film Festival in Lone Pine two years ago. But more important to him, he said, 
was seeing once again some of the people he worked with in the old days. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin is survived by his wife, Elaine; a sister, Annabelle Armstrong of Los 
Angeles; and a niece, Barbara McElheny, grandnephew, Sean Thomas McElheny, and 
grandniece, Meghan Riley McElheny, all of Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 At Martin's request, there will be no funeral. Burial will be private. 
Donations may be sent to Hoag Memorial Hospital Cancer Center.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SUN SETS TODAY ON ARTS AND CRAFTS SERIES

<P>
 Nine weeks after the Summer by the Sea Arts and Crafts series opened along the 
promenade near the Ventura Pier, organizers, merchants and shoppers are calling 
it a success and hoping it will grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowds have been good," co-organizer Kyndle Lee said at the information 
stand, adding that hundreds of browsers often visited."I think the community 
would look forward to seeing it expand." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said the city plans to repeat the event next summer and beyond, perhaps 
expanding its size through additional recruiting and advertisements in crafts 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer arts and entertainment series along the pier and promenade 
concludes today, with vendors at their booths from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The event 
was designed to attract more weekend activity and tourism to the recently 
restored pier and the beachfront it overlooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Freiberg, 67, a lifetime resident of Ventura, said he enjoys seeing the 
series at the oceanfront. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's unique about this is we have the pier back here and the beach," he 
said, motioning to the active scene behind him. "It makes it very beautiful and 
we have the mountains in the background." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Candace Sczepan, who has spent several weekends at recent shows selling 
special oil-painted photographs: "This weekend I'm really impressed, this is 
the most vendors I've seen." JASON GRANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EVENT RAISES MONEY FOR WOMEN'S GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 30 people pulled on their boots and donned their dancing clothes for a 
Sunday afternoon at a country and Western barbecue to raise money for the 
Ventura County chapter of a women's activist group. 
</P>
<P>
 The barbecue at a Somis ranch was the first fund-raising event for the local 
chapter of Zonta International, an organization whose mission is to improve the 
status of women. 
</P>
<P>
 "This organization is about promoting women's issues and rights in Ventura 
County," said club president Loma Siegel, who is also a member of the Ventura 
County Commission for Women. "We felt this was a good year to start up 
something like this here. It's needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Held at the spacious Somis home of Zonta board member Louann Davis, the event 
was replete with a chuck-wagon barbecue and the live music of the Rhythm 
Rangers, a Ventura County-based country and Western band. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great day for a barbecue and it's a great day to raise funds for what 
I think is a very good cause," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's informal fund-raiser was expected to net the club about $800, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zonta board member Carole Power said the Ventura County chapter was 
established in March and meets monthly at the Tower Club at the Oxnard 
Financial Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Power said the club is oriented toward professional women, but considers all 
applicants interested in furthering the status of women in the county. For more 
information call 648-2600. J.E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 8 ARRESTED IN DRUNK DRIVING CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight Labor Day holiday revelers who got behind the wheel in Ventura County 
were arrested on suspicion of drunk driving during a special 
maximum-enforcement period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Sunday, California 
Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more motorists were being investigated late Sunday for suspicion of 
driving under the influence of alcohol, but those arrests could not be 
immediately confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sunny weather that drew large numbers of people to the area's 
beaches, state lifeguards reported no major rescues or incidents. Likewise, 
local U.S. Coast Guard officials said they were not involved in any major 
rescues in area waters. 
</P>
<P>
 National Weather Service meteorologist Scott Entrekin said that Ventura County 
residents can expect another warm and sunny day today after midmorning low 
clouds burn off. Daytime high temperatures are expected to climb to the mid-70s 
along the coast and higher in the county's inland areas. J.E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: WOMAN ARRESTED IN ATTACK ON EX-FIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 32-year-old Ventura woman was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder 
after she stabbed her former fiance repeatedly in the back because he wanted to 
break up, Ventura police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeannette Smith is accused of stabbing Jeffrey Saur, 41, also of Ventura, 
after she forced Saur to stop the car as they drove east along California 126 
just west of Victoria Avenue about 5 p.m. Saturday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the car stopped, Smith began cutting herself with a knife, then turned 
the weapon on Saur, stabbing him several times in the back, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was treated for her injuries and later released to sheriff's deputies at 
the Ventura County Jail. Saur was listed in fair condition Sunday in the 
intensive care unit at Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Several drivers passing on the highway witnessed the attack, according to 
police. Motorist Matthew Halpert of West Hills was credited by police with 
saving Saur's life when he intervened and prevented Smith from continuing the 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Saur were engaged to be married, but the engagement was broken when 
the relationship began to fail, police said. The couple was in the midst of 
moving possessions when the attack began. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is being held at Ventura County Jail on suspicion of attempted murder in 
lieu of $250,000 bail. She is scheduled to be arraigned in Ventura County 
Municipal Court on Wednesday. JEFF McDONALD

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: TODAY'S TOPIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who would have predicted 40 years ago, when television was first coming into 
American homes, that such mundane products as deodorant and breakfast cereal 
would one day be touted before a national audience by bare-chested men and 
women in skimpy bathing suits? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, these days such commercials rarely raise eyebrows and are among the 
surest sign of the changes in our standards of acceptable behavior. But, are 
they in good taste? And what exactly is good taste when it comes to 
advertising? 
</P>
<P>
 "What is one person's terrible taste is another person's turn on," says Joel 
Hochberg, general manager of the Foote Cone & Belding advertising agency in Los 
Angeles. "What you would do to sell something to somebody older is different 
than what you would do to sell something to a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, sometimes there are lapses," Hochberg adds. "If you go too far 
with certain products, you are going to turn off your audience." 
</P>
<P>
 To some people, in particular Mexican Americans, a recent series of billboards 
for a radio station went too far. The billboards display two young Mexican 
American disc jockeys, "The Baka Boyz," sitting on toilets with their pants 
around their ankles or in other naked situations. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Gripe, Mario Garcia of Canoga Park argues that the billboards are 
not just in poor taste but offensive to an entire community. Yet Nick Vidal, 
the younger of the two brothers who make up "The Baka Boyz" team, believes that 
the ads are simply appealing to a very specific segment of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sorry the billboard offended anyone," says Vidal, who created the ads 
with his brother Eric. "But, we did it because it was fun. I am basically my 
audience and I'm sure our audience would think (the billboards) were fun as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 While Vidal is no marketing expert, he echoes what many of the experts say. 
"We're in a transition period where we're moving toward attempts to communicate 
with smaller audiences," says David Stewart, a USC marketing professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yet the media doesn't isolate," adds Stewart, who is also a consumer 
psychologist. "I might be exposed to something that is in bad taste for me but 
wasn't meant to be. You get leakage into audiences for which the message is not 
really intended." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of that potential leakage, some experts argue that advertisers 
must act responsibly to a larger community when hawking their products, 
especially when minority audiences are involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a myopia here that hurts the entire culture," says Anita Santiago, 
president of Anita Santiago Advertising Inc. in Santa Monica. "When you're 
young, you want to shock people. We all went through that phase. But you've got 
to be smart enough to see it's going to affect an entire culture, especially 
one that's being picked on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's vital to present a positive image of ethnic groups," adds 
Santiago, whose agency specializes in developing advertising for the Latino 
community. "Taste is very hard to define. I think it's a combination of common 
sense and respect and just understanding."

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: CONVERSATION WITH 
JOHN OUTTERBRIDGE; 'THIS IS A CITY THAT HAS NOT REALIZED ITS OWN UNIQUENESS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sculptor JOHN OUTTERBRIDGE left his post as director of the Watts Tower Arts 
Center in 1992 to concentrate on his own assemblage art. But he left behind 
neither community service, nor thoughts about community. Outterbridge, 61, 
often welcomes school children at his studio and residence in South Central Los 
Angeles, where he is working on "Five Pieces with Sticks and Rags," inspired by 
the giant culverts used in Metro subway construction. This fall he and Betye 
Saar, another Los Angeles artist, will represent the United States at the 
Brazil Bienal in Sao Paolo.  
</P>
<P>
 He spoke with KAY MILLS, author of "This Little Light of Mine: The Life of 
Fannie Lou Hamer" (Plume, 1994).  
</P>
<P>
 Question: You're among the judges picking the team to design and build a 
commercial and housing complex at the former Pepperdine University campus at 
81st and Vermont Streets in Los Angeles. The winner hasn't been announced yet, 
but I wonder if you'd speak, as an artist and a person active in the community 
yourself, about what you especially wanted the design to offer the people of 
that area?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I was more interested in hearing from the presenters how that space 
would be used and how they would deal with such a small parcel of land for 
affordable housing and the mixed-use concept. Any team that can effectively use 
space that small has got to have talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important aspect of the design competition was to see it come 
together in such a way that community people could have input themselves. 
People recognized the need for affordable housing, but people were concerned 
about concepts that would stimulate the need for jobs. We see shopping centers 
introduced all the time; the developers come in and carry out the project and 
then they're gone. Many people were interested in a development idea that would 
result in longevity in the way of jobs, in the way of enhancing the economic 
temperament of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were there particular services or shops that people wanted to see in the 
complex?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There are many entrepreneurs, or street vendors, in the area now and some 
of those people discussed needing housing and needing to be accommodated as 
entrepreneurs. People spoke of needing a bank in the area. Since First 
Interstate has motivated the process (of developing the site), people in the 
community might encourage them to do a branch office. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there areas of the city where you think that the art and architecture 
really speak to the community?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, Los Angeles for me has been a very exciting experience. It's so 
untrained and so expansive a piece of metropolitan geography. When I first came 
here in 1963, I had no idea that Los Angeles was as diverse in people and scale 
as it was. Some of the most innovative architectural notions that I've 
experienced in moving around the country are in Southern California, especially 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But I still think that this is a city that has not yet realized its own 
uniqueness. It has a diversity of languages. It has an audacity about it by 
being so closely attached to the fancifulness of Hollywood. When I first came 
to L.A., I thought about how reckless at times the development schemes could be 
when they were bringing down certain well-established cultural landmarks 
without giving them any due consideration. For example, when I first started to 
go to Downtown Los Angeles, I was fascinated with a little transportational 
mode called Angel's Flight (a short cog railway up the hill from Downtown and 
Bunker Hill). When that was brought down, I thought that the City of Angels had 
broken the wings of an angel by breaking down that little transportational 
mode. 
</P>
<P>
 For another example, people from around the world visit Los Angeles and always 
want to visit the Watts Towers. For a long time that site was deserted. Of 
course, it has a very energetic restoration program now. The monument is owned 
by the state of California. It has been elevated to national and international 
prominence, but the caretakership from the city and the state could be much 
more energetic to make sure that the site develops as fast as it can. It has 
been for a long time this region's cultural heritage ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'd like to talk to you about the fate of arts education in the city. What 
do school cuts do to a community's appreciation of its surroundings or its 
artists' work?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think that a society that does not truly understand the importance of the 
arts is a society that has poor regard for its future. In primary education, 
art can be and should be one of the prime motivating factors for young people, 
in that the processes used to teach art are the very processes that nurture the 
individual, the inward individual. 
</P>
<P>
 The act of creativity is the very motion that gets anything worthwhile done. 
We can never lose, I feel, the need to keep art as close to the initial 
education process as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The arts sometimes give language to young people who simply would not have 
language that speaks to life, that speaks to life potentials. Should we 
subtract the arts from our culture, we wouldn't have very much left at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you had one message that you could deliver through this conversation to 
Mayor Riordan on the importance of the arts, what would you say?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I would say to the mayor to be mindful of the importance of the city's 
cultural institutions and to encourage as much support of those institutions as 
can be rendered at this time, because this is one of the most exciting and 
diverse metropolitan areas in the country -- it's vibrant with expression, and 
that expression needs to be shared with all the citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a city also that needs a lot of management; it's a beautiful city but 
it's gotten very, very sloppy about its streets. We have people from many other 
parts of the world who cannot imagine the debris that is piled up in the 
streets and along the curb in this city, and I think that if I was a new mayor, 
I would certainly get on the business community to keep their immediate 
environment at least clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Some consciousness within the city about its own aesthetic presence is a very 
important thing to be nurtured from official city chambers.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MY FIRST REAL JOB; 
'I SEE MYSELF AS AN INDEPENDENT BUSINESSPERSON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By OLLIE ZAD, Assistant media planner at an independent advertising agency in 
Los Angeles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a recent college graduate, my encounter with the "real world" has in many 
ways been bittersweet. I have already been laid off twice -- once before I even 
got to start -- and have spent more time looking for employment than I have 
spent working full-time at any one place. It took me a while to realize that 
the unfortunate reality is that this is the worst job market in 20 years. As if 
that weren't bad enough, my generation has unilaterally been labeled as a lazy, 
whining group of slackers by boomers and media pundits.  
</P>
<P>
 Like most college seniors, the approach of graduation was tinged with 
apprehension as much as elation. I had seen friends who had ventured out into 
the working world spend as long as a year looking for a "real job." 
</P>
<P>
 Something about this just didn't seem right. My perception had always been 
that if you go to college and play your cards right, company recruiters will 
beat a path to your dorm. Maybe that's how things were in the lush decade of 
deficit spending. But these days not only are you pitted against laid-off baby 
boomers who offer more experience but also the perennially unemployed grads 
from the early '90s.  
</P>
<P>
 After scores of interviews and half a dozen second visits to firms, I managed 
to generate three offers. I accepted one from a Boston paper manufacturer. 
Relocation was imminent, but the offer was generous and included a company car, 
yearlong training and many travel opportunities. Pleased that I had landed a 
job with a recognized multinational company, I 
</P>
<P>
 stopped pursuing other opportunities. After my start date was postponed twice, 
I decided to make the most of this unexpected time off and borrowed money for a 
six-week trip to Europe. Upon my return, I was notified that the company had 
gone through extensive restructuring and was laying off 15% of its staff. The 
next day I would have to start all over with cover letters, interviews and 
follow-ups. The mere notion of undertaking the long ineffective process was 
enough to make me go into denial for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Living off the income from my part-time college job -- which ended up laying 
me off as well -- I made the job hunt my top priority, focusing on the 
advertising industry. After four months, I was again able to generate a few 
offers. This time, the salaries weren't encouraging but I felt it was more 
important I take a position for the experience.  
</P>
<P>
 I am now working as an assistant media planner at an independent ad agency. As 
in most career-track positions, I am going through the phase euphemistically 
called "paying your dues." This is the stage where you realize your high-school 
classmate who opted to become a plumber is making at least twice as much as you 
-- not to mention that he/she didn't spend upward of $30,000 to do so. I 
thought a degree meant that you were capable. Maybe that comes after I pass the 
trial by fire or when I simply prove myself worthy of the task. Hopefully by 
then I still will have some of my own standards for making decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The job market I've encountered barely holds more promise that its satirical 
counterpart in the Generation X movie "Reality Bites." As a member of an age 
group who has to come to terms with this grim reality, I have learned that 
there are many trade-offs that you have to make: Do something you like or 
something where can make more money, relocate to get promoted or stay in your 
comfort zone. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen that one can no longer count on an employer to reciprocate many 
years of loyalty. I view myself as an independent businessperson who provides a 
service. To allow yourself to buy into the motivational babble about "being a 
team player" and "all being in it together" is to set yourself up for betrayal. 
In short, if the ship is sinking, make sure you at least have a life jacket on. 
I keep mine nearby.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES; GRIPE; 'MEXICANS 
HAVE SOME SERIOUS CATCHING UP TO DO' IN THE MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARIO GARCIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You may have noticed the billboards all over town for a local radio station. 
"2 fat Mexicanz," they say. And then, "Baka Boyz. Morningz." The accompanying 
pictures vary from the nude "Baka boys" hiding their privates to the two of 
them posing Gidget-style behind a surfboard. The worst one shows them seated on 
toilets, their trousers down around their ankles. One eats from a pizza box on 
his lap. A potato chip bag looms in the foreground in front of the other. 
</P>
<P>
 I am of Mexican heritage and I find the billboards disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe one of the great challenges for Mexican Americans is to achieve a 
positive image, especially in today's business environment. Image may be seen a 
minor issue when compared to illiteracy, poverty and crime. But the problem of 
perception is an important one. We need to collectively assess how we're 
portrayed in the media since it's both a litmus test for societal perceptions 
and a mechanism for creating and sustaining new perceptions. Minorities have 
known this for a long time. That's why they struggled for representation in the 
media. Television was just one of those fronts but it was an important one. 
African Americans led that fight. As a result, blacks on television are now 
common: from television sitcoms to news anchors to superstar athletes touting 
products. A real victory. So where do Latinos stand? I don't watch much 
television but from my perspective we never gained an equal footing. When I 
think of Mexicans on television I think of the comedians Cheech Marin and Paul 
Rodriguez. There's Juan Valdez the coffee bean picker and Rosarita of refried 
bean fame. Sure, there are a few Latinos on the local news but there's nobody 
on the Tom Brokaw's or Barbara Walters' level. If TV is any indicator of the 
perceived status of a group, I submit that Mexicans have some serious catching 
up to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should we care? Because the conspicuous absence of Mexicans coupled with 
the negative portrayal of the few there are signal a reversal of the gains made 
during the Chicano movement of the 1960s. The unionization of the farm workers, 
the establishment of Chicano Studies departments, bilingual education and the 
implementation of affirmative action -- these things weren't free. It took work 
and sacrifice by our parents' generation. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not trying to single out the Baka boys. I'm as guilty as anyone of losing 
touch. My grandmother, born in Mexico, hated to speak English. She felt it was 
a harsh and restrictive language. As a child, I never adequately learned 
Spanish. My grandmother was a complex person and the language barrier between 
us kept me from fully appreciating her intellect. So, what do we do now, paint 
signs and take to the streets? I don't think so. That was a solution for 
another time. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't waste time with this radio station either. If they're willing to 
sponsor such an offensive ad campaign then it's unlikely they'd respond to 
direct protest. Let's find out who their sponsors are and stop buying their 
wares. Follow up with letters to the manufacturers and remind them that we will 
not support a product that flies in the face of our dignity. Take advantage of 
the technology at our disposal. Write the letters on your computers. Send 
copies on floppy disks to your friends. E-mail your brothers, sisters and 
cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 If we don't act, we'll be sending another message -- that the new generation 
of Mexican Americans are satisfied with a grotesque image of ourselves, 
laughing, eating like pigs on toilet seats, willing to endure the stench of the 
putrefaction of our pride.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD; 
LONG BEACH: OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS FOR WOULD-BE ENTREPRENEURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acquiring the knowledge and capital to get a small business started and make 
it successful is difficult, especially for those without much exposure to the 
world of finance. In Long Beach, would-be entrepreneurs can get help from a 
partnership formed by the city and the California affiliate of the national 
American Woman's Economic Development Corp., which was established in 1976 in 
New York to train and counsel women to run their own firms. The Neighborhood 
Entrepreneurial Program uses city and federal funds to provide training and 
support for aspiring business owners who live in disadvantaged areas throughout 
the city. The prgram is free to participants, who must to make a long-term 
commitment to launch a business. Only those who can attend every class during 
the 18-week course are encouraged to apply. Graduates are eligible to 
participate in an ongoing support group and "micro-loan" program designed to 
provide up to $5,000 in start-up capital. HOW THE 2-YEAR-OLD PROGRAM WORKS: 
</P>
<P>
 TARGET NEIGHBORHOODS 
</P>
<P>
 The program seeks out low- and moderate-income, ethnically diverse and 
culturally isolated areas of Long Beach, shown at right. Average family income 
in the four target areas is below $20,000, more than half of the adults speak 
no English and unemployment is more than twice the citywide rate of 9.5%.  
</P>
<P>
 Total population of targeted communities: 45,661 
</P>
<P>
 Population of targeted communities by race and ethnicity: 
</P>
<P>
 Hispanic: 52% 
</P>
<P>
 Asian: 24% 
</P>
<P>
 Black: 14% 
</P>
<P>
 White and other: 10% RECRUITING 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to posting announcements throughout the area, multilingual 
canvassers walk through communities to bring information about the program 
door-to-door. Those interested complete an application that includes brief 
essay questions, obtain a recommendation from a religious or community leader 
and are interviewed by AWED staff. Seventeen residents from the Washington 
School and MacArthur Park neighborhoods were selected for the first class. 
TRAINING 
</P>
<P>
 *Instruct trainess on everything from how to shake hands, make cold sales 
calls and pay taxes to how to establish a good relationship with a banker, 
obtain a business license and write a business plan. (Teachers include area 
entrepeneurs, City of Long Beach staff and AWED employees.) 
</P>
<P>
 *Tutor those who need it in basic math, reading and English-language skills. 
</P>
<P>
 *Those who attend all classes and complete all assignments are eligible for 
AWED's year long "micro-loan" program. SUPPORT 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 17 graduates in the first class, 15 have joined the support group 
offered by AWED that includes ongoing workshops and counseling sessions. Eight 
have secured a total of more than $20,000 in loans. No one has missed a loan 
payment. TO GET INVOLVED: Call (310) 983-3747.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: PLATFORM; WHAT IS 
THE MEANING OF 'COMMUNITY'? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 REV. FISHER J. ROBINSON 
</P>
<P>
 Vicar, African American Catholic Community and African Diaspora, Archdiocese 
of Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 In African American tradition all things are usually done as a community or 
with reference to the community. We have great respect of ancestors or the 
elderly, those who have gone before us, leaders who are role models who keep 
the community together and are looked up to. 
</P>
<P>
 When we speak of the church community, it is made up of many parts -- there 
are many ethnic groups. And one of the things we recognize and appreciate is 
that each group brings an added dimension to the community. They bring their 
traditions, their values. There's something good in each. We seek to 
appreciate, to value and to understand those; to see what similarities there 
are in each. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what we seek in the parish community and also in the greater community; 
and that's based on the Gospel which we are called upon to proclaim, called to 
live. SALAM AL-MARAYATI 
</P>
<P>
 Director, Muslim Public Affairs Council, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Community is basically a group of people who have a common bond. For the 
Muslim community, it's a group with a spiritual connection, the companionship 
they gain from one another and the social and political needs met by coming 
together in their mosques to discuss the pressing issues facing them in 
America.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is as diverse a community as America is diverse. (One problem Muslims 
encounter is that when) one may say something, it is generalized as being a 
statement made by the religion. I think the success of the Muslim community is 
dependent on its ability to relate and interact with the rest of the American 
public, to become a part of American pluralism. JOHN CASTILLO 
</P>
<P>
 Executive director, Southern California Indian Center, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am an Apache. Community is a very important word to our people and the way 
we've lived for hundreds, thousands of years. Traditionally, one of our values 
is cooperation rather than these industrial values of competition. Ours was 
always a community of sharing and assisting one another for the benefit of the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Our community involves our children, our elders, our adults. It's everybody. 
We even look further: all the animals, the air, the rocks. A big value for 
Indian people is respect for Mother Earth and the belief that our mother is 
alive and we can take care of our mother. NANCY HARUYE AU  
</P>
<P>
 Executive director, Assistance League of Southern California Western Region, 
Asian-Pacific Agency, Westchester 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the Asian and Pacific Islander community, it is basically a 
socio-political concept or grouping. Our community is so diverse and so 
dispersed geographically that it's very difficult to identify a geographic 
cluster that would encompass what we would consider our community. I'm a 
third-generation Japanese-American from Hawaii. As a child, we would go to our 
annual summer picnics organized around clans. Even today there are still those 
picnics going on, people from Hiroshima-ken, purely defined by geography in 
terms of Hiroshima prefecture. But there are also clan ties, meaning blood 
ties, too. 
</P>
<P>
 When I'm thrust into a diverse group of people and there are Asians in this 
group, I find myself more in tune with the other Asians although the Asians may 
not necessarily be third-generation Japanese-Americans. So there is something 
more that ties us together, that makes me feel a communal relationship -- sort 
of being able to communicate on a different level. When we talk about Western 
cultures, it's usually taught in terms of the Judeo-Christian values shared 
among that cultural group. With the Asian and Pacific Islander, perhaps there's 
a similar tie because we are Hindu, Buddhist, Confucian. LINDA ALVAREZ 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor/reporter, KCBS-TV, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was born and raised in Los Angeles, have seen it grow and change. I think 
community should be defined as a group who have a common bond or goal. It 
doesn't necessarily mean people who all have the same skin color or speak the 
same language. There's too much diversity within different national and ethnic 
groups to automatically say that is what a community is. People in 
South-Central, in Brentwood, in San Fernando or Tarzana who care about their 
kids getting a good education all have common goals and therefore can be part 
of the same community -- the community of parents, the community of educators 
-- as opposed to a community of blacks or Latinos or Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 Commune means to come together. So often when we hear about communities we 
think of separation. That really hurts the greater community of Los Angeles. 
Many of us just drive the freeways and don't think about how other people live. 
It's more than understanding that East Los Angeles is predominantly Latino or 
that Compton is a changing mixture of Latinos and African Americans. We need to 
get to get off the freeways, get to know people and talk to them. GERALD 
MARGOLIS 
</P>
<P>
 Director, Simon Wiesenthal Center and the Museum of Tolerance, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We all emerge from certain kinds of communities, cleave to certain things, 
belong to certain organizations and define ourselves in different ways. 
Conventionally, we find a kind of common purposeful coherence. With any kind of 
community the attempt is to find a solution to problems.  
</P>
<P>
 We're engaging more and more, especially in Los Angeles, in understanding 
ourselves as a community made of many different kinds of communities. We have a 
maelstrom of interests. The way our country works is sorting out all these 
various interests through our political process. It's almost a moral or social 
imperative for survival. More and more there has to be an appreciation for 
difference and, at the same time, of the unifying factors that bring us 
together now and in the future. We're striving to understand what will create a 
just society, include the rights of the individual and how to avoid the 
harmful, the damaging and the painful.

FALL IN THE LAND OF ENDLESS SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The angle of the sun at 6 o'clock has turned the dust in the air golden, and 
the sentimental soul hungers for the smell of burning leaves. Autumn is coming, 
even to this land of 1 1/2 seasons, a land where, in places, burning leaves is 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Supermarkets greet customers with an Aladdin's treasure of back-to-school 
supplies, even in this city where tens of thousands of children and teachers 
began the academic year July 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Department store aisles beckon with warm fuzzywear and earth tones, even in 
this climate that will find us bare-legged and sleeveless and sweltering well 
into November. 
</P>
<P>
 The nostalgic among us will peek inside the pencil cases, with their sharp 
scent of chiseled wood, the perfectly turned crayon point, the ruler and the 
protractor promising the unlocking of serious mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
 We will thumb through the "trapper keeper" for a quick update on this year's 
crop of cartoon fads and decide that the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers will 
never top Darth Vader and Miss Piggy.  
</P>
<P>
 We will dig out the old letter sweater and make plans for the first home game; 
lucky for us so many high schools play football at night. 
</P>
<P>
 We will prune the impatiens and envision rust-red chrysanthemums in their 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, summer is ending. The Earth is turning ever so slightly away from the 
sun, as it always has, and transplants from northern climes awaken again to 
perhaps distant memory of what that means, adapting our response, as we adapt 
so much else, to the imperfect reality of autumn in L.A.

FIRE BILL -- PAY NOW OR PAY LATER; YES, 'SUPER SCOOPER" COSTS A LOT, BUT A 
KILLER WILDFIRE COSTS MUCH, MUCH MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here we go again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Day weekend officially opens the wildfire season in Southern 
California. According to fire officials, drought conditions and heavy brush 
accumulation this year could make for an autumn as dangerous as the fall of 
1993. That, of course, was the year flames swept through Laguna Beach, 
Altadena, Malibu and other areas, gutting 1,200 homes and racing across 200,000 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the most unwise would sit on their hands after receiving such an ominous 
warning. But what to do? 
</P>
<P>
 A logical place to begin is "After Action," a 38-page report on the 1993 fires 
that lists 95 recommendations. Such reports are prepared routinely by the 
governor's Office of Emergency Planning after declared emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The overriding theme of the study is the need for better interagency 
coordination and communication -- between the federal government and the state 
government and among local firefighting companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The state study also points up the need for continual training and the use of 
modern technology such as satellite mapping communication, cellular phones and 
heavy-lift helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 One piece of equipment conspicuously absent from the report was the CL-415 
"Super Scooper," the amphibious plane that can repeatedly dump 1,600 gallons of 
water on a wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County prudently has committed $250,000 to lease one of the 
aircraft for a month. On the state level, Gov. Pete Wilson steadfastly has 
refused to support a Super Scooper test program at a time when the state is 
ailing financially. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wilson should listen to Richard Andrews, his director of emergency 
services, who now says "the time has come for new tests of the Super Scooper." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews' recommendation is sound. The problem is, recommendations made in the 
wake of a disaster all too often wind up being ignored -- until the next 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson should sign legislation -- now unfortunately stripped of funding -- 
that would allow state testing of the Super Scooper. Of course the bill won't 
mean much without funding: Finding that money should be a top priority for both 
the governor and the Legislature.

SCIENTIFIC CLAIMS: THE COURTS DRIFT IN SEAS OF CONTRADICTION; JUDGES SEEK 
GUIDELINES IN AN ERA OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY AND HIGHLY PAID EXPERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whatever else the O. J. Simpson trial proves, it is likely to show how 
scientific evidence can sometimes be twisted beyond recognition in court. 
Simpson has hired two lawyers who have used DNA typing to free several men 
wrongly convicted of murder, rape or other crimes. Now these lawyers are 
presumably ready to argue that DNA blood tests suggesting Simpson's guilt are 
too unreliable to be used in court. 
</P>
<P>
 With scientific evidence increasingly invading the courts, the time has come 
for both the judiciary and the scientific community to help judges and juries 
reconcile the rules of evidence and proof that distinguish science from law. 
Laymen can no longer be expected to adjudicate between dueling scientific and 
medical experts, whose opinions and interpretations often depend on which side 
is paying them. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is especially chaotic in California, where appellate courts have 
issued conflicting rulings on the criteria for admitting DNA tests and other 
scientific evidence. The state Supreme Court, in a case heard last week, has 
the opportunity now to bring California into line with sensible new federal 
guidelines issued by the U.S. Supreme Court last year that give judges new 
authority to discriminate between good and bad science. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they both seek the truth, law and science go about it very differently. 
The law depends on the adversarial process. That is a poor way to judge 
science, which relies on the careful testing of hypotheses through replicable 
experiment. Under the adversarial system, juries can be persuaded there is 
scientific controversy when there may not be. Also, reality is seldom black or 
white in science; knowledge constantly expands and changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The law has historically lagged behind science, Galileo's ordeal at the hands 
of the Inquisition being only the most obvious example. Fingerprint 
identification was challenged as unreliable earlier this century. In 1946, a 
California court ruled that the comedian Charlie Chaplin had fathered a child 
even though blood typing showed he could not be the father. DNA typing, 
promising even more powerful means of identification, is now under attack. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say science is infallible. The history of science is rife with 
examples of science perverted by political or religious ideology, greed or 
sloppiness. Critics now say a rising tide of what they derisively call "junk 
science" threatens to inundate the courts -- in cases of toxic chemicals and 
other environmental risks, product liability and medical malpractice -- with 
false cause-and-effect conclusions about the risks posed by alleged health 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology and Government found last year 
that such bad science had generally not found its way into trials. But fear and 
uncertainty over the prospect of fighting dubious scientific claims in court 
have certainly influenced business decisions. Makers of silicone breast 
implants recently agreed to a $4.25-billion out-of-court settlement with women 
who allege they were harmed by the devices, even though the scientific evidence 
for this is very equivocal. (A federal judge approved the settlement last 
week.) Similarly, there is little proof that the morning-sickness drug 
Bendectin caused birth defects, and the manufacturer, Merrell Dow 
Pharmaceuticals, has never paid on a claim. Nevertheless it has stopped making 
the drug to avoid further litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately courts often must decide on scientific issues before all the 
laboratory evidence is in. So judges should be prepared to rule on what is good 
science and what is not. Until recently the courts were guided by the outdated 
71-year-old Frye rule, which held that such evidence must be "generally 
accepted" by scientists, an overly rigid standard that often barred 
cutting-edge research from the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In issuing new federal guidelines last year, the U.S. Supreme Court, in a 
Bendectin case, took a big step toward bringing the legal process into 
conformity with scientific method. It ordered federal judges to be gatekeepers 
of scientific evidence, to evaluate such prospective testimony before it is 
given, focusing not on the results of experiments but on the validity of "the 
reasoning or methodology underlying the testimony." That is good advice, but 
judges need help in turning this vague admonition into daily courtroom 
practice.

CUBAN REFUGEE CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In your paper Aug. 26 you quoted the President as follows: "We must not let 
any nation, even a nation as close to us as Cuba . . . control the immigration 
policy of the United States and violate the borders of the United States. We 
have to be firm in this and we will work this through to a successful 
conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that turning our standing immigration policy 180 degrees qualifies 
as Cuba controlling our immigration policy. I think that two things contributed 
to this turnabout: the crisis tone used by the Democrat governor (of Florida) 
and the thought that the internment of Cubans from the Mariel boat lift at Ft. 
Chaffee, Ark., lost the governorship for Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Also very bothersome is the fact that members of a highly trained war machine 
will be used as prison guards. I call them prison guards because, according to 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, the Cubans will be held indefinitely! 
</P>
<P>
 I think that world opinion will view with disdain our actions in this 
internment. 
</P>
<P>

stay home.

<P>
 * As long as we maintain a refuge of any sort at Guantanamo Bay for Cuban 
immigrants, they will continue to risk their lives by crossing the sea. In that 
case, we had better be prepared to house not 60,000, but half the population of 
Cuba. If, instead, those arriving at Guantanamo Bay could be greeted with a bus 
ride back to Havana, perhaps the new immigration policy of the U.S. would be 
taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * There is a simple solution to the Cuban boat people. Pick them up at sea, 
take them to Guantanamo, and march them across the compound right back into 
Castro's Cuba. At $25 a day per internee (a low figure I am sure), to house, 
feed, and clothe 60,000 Cuban internees will cost the American taxpayer around 
$550 million a year. And we will be no closer to a solution than we are now. 
Add to that the cost of our Haitian misadventure, and our righteous dabbling in 
other people's business begins to add up to big money with no positive result 
except to make some of our leaders feel good about themselves.

 * Castro has finally said something that I agree with. It's not his fault that 
the Cuban people are flooding our borders. It's the United States' immigration 
policy. It clearly states, come one, come all and join our welfare program.

<P>
 * It is indeed refreshing to find in The Times an acknowledgment of some of 
the major causes of the present Cuban crisis, among them "the bankrupt decision 
under Dwight D. Eisenhower to support Batista unreservedly through the 
misconceived Bay of Pigs fiasco under John F. Kennedy" (editorial, Aug. 25). It 
is to be hoped that the Clinton Administration reverses the pattern of U.S. 
policy toward Cuba, described in the editorial as "a bipartisan study in lack 
of understanding and creativity." 
</P>
<P>
 For Cuban-Americans like myself, it is essential that the most important 
lesson we have learned through our years in this country as refugees, residents 
and citizens, be now remembered and revisited with more compassion than ever 
before: A democratic society must provide for the free exchange of ideas and 
conflicting ideas and ideals must be debated freely and creatively to reach the 
best possible solution. The Clinton Administration and Cuban Americans who heed 
this lesson will find that a stable and democratic society in Cuba will not 
come as the result of suffering and the violence of hunger and deprivation. 
Dialogue and the free exchange of ideas and peoples will forge the kind of free 
and democratic society that Cuba must and will become. 
</P>
<P>
 I beg those who support imposed suffering to rethink their positions, 
remembering the sad pictures we have seen lately from Russia, the former Soviet 
republics, Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti and many other places where violence and 
violation of basic human rights prevailed or still prevail.

CAR-POOL LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I'm a small business owner who must use the freeway to service clients. 
There is no way that I can car-pool.Why can't I obtain a certificate or license 
to use car-pool lanes? During the gas crunch in the '70s business persons 
requiring the use of their car to survive could obtain a certificate to get gas 
during any day of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Many top government officials use limousines, which means that they can use a 
car-pool lane. If they were an independent business person, they wouldn't get a 
chauffeur and could not use the car-pool lane. In other words, a government 
official that is dependent on our taxes to survive not only has the privilege 
of using our tax dollars to have a driver but can use car-pool lanes as well. 
However, as a taxpaying citizen I cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacationers can use the car-pool lanes during rush hours, yet they could 
easily schedule their travels during other times. Persons going to 
entertainment and shopping centers use the car-pool lanes in a likewise 
fashion. Yet as a hard-working, taxpaying business person that has to travel 
alone, I cannot use the car-pool lane because I don't have someone in my car. 
</P>
<P>
 As I see it, the car-pool lane is only a another form of state-sponsored 
discrimination. It is only another obstacle thrown in the face of someone 
trying to earn a living.

DUBAY ON GAY IDENTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Like William H. DuBay ("Sexuality Is Not Just 'Gay' or 'Straight,' " 
Commentary, Aug. 26), I wish everyone understood that sexuality is more than 
gay and straight, gender more than traditional male and female. And yes, coming 
out can lead to adopting a stigmatized role, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 But DuBay de-emphasizes the fact that it is in the larger society we find the 
primary source of stigmatization and the ultimate reasons why people group 
together around categories and identities. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe DuBay also understates the benefits of coming out. Fifteen years 
ago, Tom, a co-worker and friend, asked me into his office and told me he was 
gay, and wanted friends and colleagues to know. Our relationship didn't change 
-- a comment on us, not on society. But I can'thelp believe that Tom felt 
better and more secure in our friendship than before. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, Tom and I and DuBay live in a world that uses over-simple 
categories. I believe that as more gays and lesbians come out, that will 
diminish. 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLES A. GOLDSMID 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * DuBay's argument about sexuality is as puzzling as it is troubling. At first 
glance he seems to advocate staying in the closet, but in conclusion he seems 
to argue that sexual orientation should become a non-issue. This point is 
correct. Sexual orientation (gay or straight) is not an aspect of an 
individual's existence upon which she or he should be judged. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, DuBay makes another fallacious point which indicates where he 
stands. When he asserts that coming out only helps to "organize more and more 
of one's personality and life around sexual behavior," he is falling prey to 
the incorrect assumption that heterosexuals do not organize their lives around 
sexual behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time DuBay sees a young couple dancing together, holding hands, 
getting married, making a home and raising a family he should bear in mind that 
these too are actions organized around sexual behavior. He should also remember 
that in many states gay men and lesbians can be prosecuted for attempting to do 
the same.

PERSPECTIVES ON THE U.N. POPULATION CONFERENCE; . . . IT'S VOODOO SCIENCE; 
SOMALIA HAS NO SYSTEM FOR REGISTERING BIRTHS, YET THE WORLD BANK LISTS ITS 
POPULATION DOWN TO A 2% MARGIN OF ERROR. 
</P>

Center in Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
 We all know that chemistry grew out of alchemy, just as astronomy developed 
from astrology and medicine from witchcraft. What, one wonders, will grow out 
of "population science?" 
</P>
<P>
 The question is not flip, nor the analogy irrelevant as the International 
Conference on Population and Environment opens in Cairo today. The conference's 
U.N. managers, like the Clinton Administration and private-sector 
population-controllers who dominated pre-Cairo U.S. policy-planning, will 
insist that their prescription for radically expanding coercive state power in 
the name of "population stability" and "sustainable development" is 
scientifically grounded. But given what "population science" does not know 
about the present and cannot tell us about the future, doubts on this score are 
not merely obscurantist. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Population science" cannot predict the growth rate of human populations 
over long periods. Because there is no scientific method for predicting birth 
or death rates with precision, past projections often look ludicrous (one U.N. 
study famously misprojected India's population by 100 million). But population 
projections may become even more difficult in the future. Public-health 
improvements can change mortality rates rapidly, even if countries remain poor. 
Birth rates can drop quickly and sharply, even absent anti-natalist 
governmental policies (as in Japan between 1948 and 1958). 
</P>
<P>
 * "Population science" cannot tell us when (much less how) fertility rates 
will decline, not least because serious scholarship has determined that the 
relationship between lower fertility rates and economic, social and cultural 
conditions is extraordinarily complex. Does fertility decrease as income 
increases? In some cases, yes. But then why does Tadjikistan have both a birth 
rate and a per-capita output rate twice that of Sri Lanka? Yet another myth -- 
that high levels of health correlate with low fertility -- is contradicted by 
the fact that life expectancy in Kenya today (with a fertility rate of 6.5 
births per woman) is about the same as in Germany in the 1920s (fertility rate: 
2.3). 
</P>
<P>
 * The pretense that Harvard demographer Nick Eberstadt calls "false precision" 
helps explain why projections in population studies are so difficult. According 
to Eberstadt, only one-tenth of the Third World's population is covered by 
reliable registration systems for vital statistics. Somalia, for example, never 
had a national census until 1985 and has no system for registering births. Yet 
the World Bank's prestigious World Development Report blithely claims a 2% 
margin of error for its Somali population and birth-rate statistics. Given such 
hard realities, as Eberstadt notes, numbers like these are simply "guesses 
dignified with decimal points." 
</P>
<P>
 * Finally, "population science" has no scientifically precise definition of 
"overpopulation" -- a shibboleth sure to be invoked repeatedly at Cairo. How 
would we know when a society was "overpopulated?" When its "natural increase" 
(birth rate minus death rate) was unusually high? Then the United States 
between 1790 and 1800 had serious overpopulation problems. What about high 
birth rates as a measure of "overpopulation?" That won't work, either: the U.S. 
birthrate in the 1790s was 25 points higher than the latest World Bank 
estimates for India, Indonesia and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Does "population density" -- the ratio of people to land -- define 
"overpopulation" precisely? By that measure, and using 1991 U.N. figures, 
France is more overpopulated than Indonesia, Japan is much more overpopulated 
than India and Singapore (whose government is trying to raise its birth rate) 
is far more overpopulated than Bangladesh. Then what about the "dependency 
ratio": the proportion of people under 15 and over 65 to the "working age" 
population? On that index, Ireland and Nepal are about equally overpopulated 
and the least overpopulated places on Earth are Hong Kong and Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Can "overpopulation" be determined by rates of emigration? Then Mozambique, 
Angola and Cuba are overpopulated today, as East Germany would have been before 
the Berlin Wall went up in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 The images connoted by "overpopulated" -- disease, hunger, overcrowding -- are 
not phantoms. But they describe realities that are more accurately denoted as 
poverty and material deprivation. The Cairo conference might have helped 
alleviate those problems and the human suffering they cause. It seems unlikely 
to do so -- it may even make matters worse -- because its planners are in 
thrall to "population science."  
</P>
<P>
 Which suggests that the policies proposed in its name should be treated 
precisely as we would treat the fantasies of any contemporary astrologer or 
alchemist.

MINOR PARTIES CAN HAVE MAJOR CLOUT; ELECTION: EXIT POLLS IN THE JUNE PARTY 
PRIMARIES SHOW A POSSIBLE 20% DEFECTION FROM BROWN, WILSON IN NOVEMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Howard Stern isn't running for governor of New York after all. The shock 
jock's withdrawal as the Libertarian Party nominee puts an end to news coverage 
of minor party candidates for the 1994 election season. 
</P>
<P>
 That's too bad, because minor parties could determine one of the biggest 
elections of the year, the high-stakes California governor's race. If June 
primary exit polls are to be believed, alternative parties could take as much 
as 20% of the vote from Kathleen Brown and Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Times' exit poll of Democratic primary voters, more than 10% -- 25% of 
John Garamendi supporters and 18% of Tom Hayden supporters -- said they would 
vote for "someone else" in a Brown-Wilson race. Among Republicans, 28% of Ron 
Unz supporters, slightly less than 10% of the voters in that primary, said 
they'd vote for "someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Those opinions could change by November, of course, but primary voters are 
among the most committed party loyalists, especially given June's record low 
turnout, and presumably the least likely to abandon their party's standard 
bearer. A 20% tally for minor parties may be unlikely, but a substantial 
protest vote seems almost inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in particular, could be in trouble. Unz's non-endorsement -- he urged 
supporters to vote for candidates who shared their "principles of lower taxes 
and less government" -- sounded like a plug for the Libertarians. And 
Libertarian candidate Richard Rider is now campaigning for Unz voters, focusing 
on Wilson's record on taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the state's largest minor party, the all-but-invisible American 
Independent Party, is growing rapidly. Since 1992, it has picked up more than 
54,000 registered members -- 9% of total growth in voter registration and about 
three times the increase in Republicans. The party can capture Perotistas with 
its name alone, and for anti-Wilson conservatives, its George Wallace roots 
promise a platform that out-toughs the governor on immigration and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown can't count on minor parties to beat Wilson for her, however. Her exit 
poll losses were even higher than his, and both the Greens and the Peace and 
Freedom Party offer alternatives to her on the left. Since many protest votes 
are decided at the last minute, an attractive ballot label can be enough to woo 
the disaffected. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters, then, shouldn't let their two-party habits blind them. Minor party 
votes have risen sharply in the last few years. Among congressional races with 
an alternative-party option, the minor party vote has gone from less than 1% in 
1986 to 6.5% in 1990 to 9.4% in 1992, according to data collected by Ryan 
Iwasaka for a Claremont McKenna College thesis. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, minor party or independent candidates took more than the spread 
between the Democrat and the Republican in nine 1992 House races, two state 
Senate races and four Assembly races. For the U.S. Senate seat won by Democrat 
Barbara Boxer, candidates from the American Independent, Peace and Freedom and 
Libertarian parties got almost 10% of the vote. Boxer beat Republican Bruce 
Herschensohn by five points. 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Georgia Republican Paul Coverdell won election to the U.S. 
Senate only after a 3% showing by Libertarian Jim Hudson threw the race into a 
runoff. Coverdell courted Libertarian voters and beat Democratic incumbent 
Wyche Fowler by 15,000 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Democratic Hawaii, the Green Party's Linda Martin won 14% of the vote 
against incumbent Sen. Daniel Inouye, who was tarred by sexual-harassment 
charges. And in Ohio, similarly scandal-tarnished Democrat John Glenn, one of 
the "Keating Five," won reelection to the Senate with barely 51% of the vote; 
news reports neglected to mention that 7% went to Martha Grevatt, an 
independent.  
</P>
<P>
 Minor parties provide two kinds of protest votes: anti-scandal, as in Ohio and 
Hawaii, and ideological, as in Georgia. In either case, alternative parties let 
voters express their dissatisfaction with government as usual. Though neither 
Pete Wilson nor Kathleen Brown is tarred by scandal, both definitely represent 
the political Establishment. And both are running name-calling centrist 
campaigns with positions based more on polls than on principles. 
</P>
<P>
 November's, then, could prove the biggest election yet for minor parties in 
California, a state whose culture encourages diversity and self-expression. The 
ballot will have at least four alternative candidates for governor. And though 
none will be a famous shock jock, how they do is a story worth following.

 With all the scary news about overpopulation and the devastating pollution of 
our world, it is good to know that something hopeful is about to happen. 
Representatives from every corner of the Earth are going to meet in Cairo 
beginning today for a United Nations conference on the plight of the Earth, 
with the goal of changing the way we relate to one another and to the Earth. 
The best news is that this conference has a realistic chance of success. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear has big eyes," says an old Russian proverb. Fear sharpens our vision, 
and the governments and the people of the world are scared. It took 10,000 
generations to bring human population to 2.5 billion. It took one generation to 
double that. More than 90% of the increase occurred in the poorest parts of the 
world, making it more likely that the wars of the future will be wars of 
redistribution. The horrors we see in Ethiopia and Rwanda are but a preview of 
the havoc that is to come if we do not change our ways. Most major fisheries 
are diminishing, grain production is declining, top soil is washing like blood 
into the seas and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is a single U.N. conference going to do about all of that? 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 Through several years of preparation for this conference, an international 
consensus has been reached on six points, and the nations of the world are 
poised to take action on all of them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Women must be educated and empowered. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parents must have hope that their children will live.  
</P>
<P>
 * The rich consuming nations like the United States must recognize that their 
consumption patterns make them ecological barbarians, a bigger threat to the 
Earth than the numbers of the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Development must be directed to the abolition of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 * We must control our power to destroy, which is for the first time in history 
greater than the Earth's power to heal itself.  
</P>
<P>
 * We must make contraception and voluntary abortion available to all who wish 
and need them. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some religious objections to abortions, but most religions are 
moving to more openness on this. The Vatican is strongly against all abortions, 
but most Catholic theologians and laity join the international religious 
consensus that abortion may be a moral choice for a woman. Indeed, the world 
religions, which many people in an increasingly secular world see as icebergs 
in the shipping lanes of progress, are rising to face the issues of population, 
overconsumption and gender inequity.  
</P>
<P>
 Reformers in the world's major religions realize that if religions, with all 
their power over human imagination and motivation, do not join the solution, 
they will be a fatal part of the problem. Seemingly unchangeable religions are 
changing in creative ways to help solve the problems of an Earth in terminal 
peril. What makes a religion great is that it can change to meet new problems. 
Religions that do not change appropriately move into the mausoleums of history. 
</P>
<P>
 What will happen in Cairo this week holds promise and comfort for all who 
believe that life on this generous host of an Earth can continue and thrive and 
that future generations of children, Earth's richest treasure, will not be 
betrayed by our excesses.

HOW DO YOU SAY 'CATCH 22' IN SPANISH?; EDUCATION: A CHILD LEARNING ENGLISH MUST 
BE SCHOOLED ONLY IN SPANISH NO MATTER HOW FLUENT SHE SEEMS. THE RULE JUST BEGS 
TO BE BENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By DOUGLAS LASKEN, Douglas Lasken teaches at Ramona Elementary School in 
Hollywood. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I'll call her Irena. She sits with the other 7-year-olds in Ms. Ybarra's 
science group, reading in Spanish about plants. Suddenly she is at my desk, 
holding open a copy of the English science text to the same passage she has 
just read in Spanish. "Listen, Mr. Lasken!" she cries, beaming, and reads 
aloud, without hesitation: "Some plants stop growing in fall. Some plants die 
and others rest. Seeds are carried away by animals." She reads several pages 
without faltering. Irena tells me she taught herself to read English. And yet, 
she will be using only Spanish textbooks, in all subjects, for the next three 
to four years. Remarkable? No. I teach a bilingual second grade for the Los 
Angeles Unified School District, and I have several kids like Irena in my class 
every year. 
</P>
<P>
 A little background: Bilingual education has had strong federal support in 
this country since the 1974 Supreme Court decision of Lau vs. Nichols. The 
Laus, a Chinese-speaking family, brought action against the San Francisco 
School District on behalf of their child, who spoke no English yet was thrust 
into an English-only classroom with no support services. The Supreme Court 
ultimately ruled that the failure to offer special educational services to 
children like Lau was prohibited on two legal grounds: as a violation of the 
student's constitutional right to "equal protection under the law," and as a 
violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The decision was handed over to the 
U.S. Office of Civil Rights, which, through the so-called Lau Remedies, 
specified bilingual education as a vehicle to correct past practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lau Remedies did not prescribe in detail how a bilingual program should be 
run, but court decisions in several states mandated various guidelines for 
school districts to follow. In 1980, the California Legislature passed the 
Bilingual Education Improvement and Reform Act, which required specific 
programs for students designated "limited English proficient," or LEP. In 1987, 
school districts in California were freed to interpret federal mandates as they 
saw fit. In Los Angeles Unified, the Bilingual Master Plan, which governs my 
classroom, was developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because children like Irena were designated LEP in kindergarten, I am unable 
to provide them with textbooks in English. Transition from LEP to an English 
program requires passing the district's CARE (Criteria for Addition of Reading 
in English) test. The CARE test is in Spanish, and is quite difficult. There 
are no figures on districtwide passing rates for the CARE test, but I do not 
see my students beginning to pass this test until they reach fourth or fifth 
grade. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that the district has evolved a kind of cult of the primary 
language. The story is spelled out in the district's "Bilingual Methodology 
Study Guide," which cites numerous studies showing that children who master 
their native languages first master their second better and faster. A seemingly 
innocuous truism, but the guide goes on to decry use of English in the 
classroom: "Excessive use of English in bilingual classrooms tends to lower 
students' achievement in English. Thus, students in bilingual programs do 
better if instruction in their native language is continued through the fifth 
or sixth grade." Further, the guide claims, parents will impede their 
children's mastery of the native language if they speak English at home: 
"Teachers should not encourage minority parents to switch to English in the 
home. Rather, they should encourage them to strongly promote the development of 
the primary language."  
</P>
<P>
 And what about the LEP kids in my class who speak and read English like 
fourth-grader natives? The guide says that we should not be fooled by such 
ephemera. It just means that these students' BICS (basic interpersonal 
communicative skills) have overshadowed their lack of CALP (cognitive academic 
linguistic proficiency). 
</P>
<P>
 Many teachers and administrators have tried to do something about this 
situation. I got my chance last year. In November, the district began its 
"cluster transition" process, in which regions directed from downtown will be 
replaced this school year with "cluster complexes," composed of high schools 
and their "feeder" middle and elementary schools. The complexes are supposed to 
enjoy new autonomies in managing their affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent Sid Thompson urged that all "stakeholders" -- people involved 
in the schools in any way -- work with subcommittees that would prepare 
recommendations for the clusters. I joined the instructional subcommittee and 
managed, without much difficulty, to get this recommendation into the final 
report in February: "Schools should exercise greater flexibility in assessment, 
placement and redesignation of LEP students within guidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the superintendent's instructions to the 27 cluster leaders included 
this charge: "Each cluster leader will be held responsible for increasing the 
number of LEP students redesignated to FEP (fluent English proficiency)." This 
is a hopeful sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is whether the district will permit schools to modify the 
role of the CARE test in making the redesignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Irena beams at me in class as she reads page after page of English.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; PREOCCUPATION WITH TESTING AND GRADES FOSTERS CHEATING; 
CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION IS CORRUPTED WHEN HIGH SCORES ARE THE KEY TO SUCCESS FOR 
STUDENTS AND SCHOOLS. EVEN TEACHERS ARE INCLINED TO ACT DISHONESTLY.

 Nothing children learn about in school is more important than tests and 
grades. In "Insult to Intelligence," Frank Smith, an eminent authority on 
learning and language, reported that graduate students react exactly the same 
way as second-grade students when directed to select and read a worthwhile book 
but told they will not be questioned, tested or graded afterward. Both groups 
object to reading any book without the expectation of the teacher's subsequent 
questioning, testing and grading. 
</P>
<P>
 More serious consequences result because of the public's and the school's 
deep-rooted preoccupation with testing and grading, including widespread 
cheating -- by students and educators alike. Several examples of academic 
dishonesty come immediately to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 During my employment as assistant professor of education at Cal State 
Northridge in 1969, I first became aware of how teachers cheated. I noticed my 
office mate, a tenured professor, duplicating lists of words to distribute to 
his graduate students, all of whom were teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "These are lists of the vocabulary words on the California Test of 
Basic Skills" (the achievement test administered throughout the state's public 
schools at that time). "I give the lists to my students so they can increase 
their students' test scores." 
</P>
<P>
 Working as a full-time professor supervising student teachers at two other 
California state universities, I regularly observed the administration of state 
tests. I vividly recall watching teachers telegraph correct answers. When a 
student showed uncertainty about a particular answer, the teacher usually 
smiled when observing a correct response but grimaced when seeing an incorrect 
one. Students almost always changed their answers when receiving grimaces. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, when improved scores on the California Assessment Program 
(CLAS' predecessor) provided additional state money to schools, administrative 
cheating occurred (although school officials insisted they did nothing 
illegal). 
</P>
<P>
 This practice, which began in the Capistrano Unified School District in 1983, 
spread quickly throughout Orange County schools. During that year, the district 
reported the enrollment of 1,471 11th-graders, but in 1984, it reported only 
1,068 12th-graders. A district administrator told me when I inquired about this 
discrepancy that the 403-student difference resulted because the district had 
redefined senior status to eliminate as many low achievers as possible from 
taking the state test. 
</P>
<P>
 Effortlessly, the district thus significantly increased the average (mean) 
score of its 12th-graders -- and received its unearned reward of tens of 
thousands of extra state dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The current state test, the California Learning Assessment System (CLAS), 
requires teachers to try to teach test content and familiarize students with 
test procedures. Ironically, the more tests that schools administer, the more 
cheating occurs: Teachers spend more and more class time trying to help 
students memorize test content and teaching test-taking strategies, seemingly 
to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, for example, the average CLAS score in mathematics for fourth-, 
eighth- and 10th-graders in Orange County schools was 1, 2 or 3 on a 6-point 
scale. Test scorers concluded that about a third of Orange County students in 
these grades demonstrated little or no mathematical thinking and that about 
half the students scored in the bottom half in reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheating has taken a different form at Brea Olinda High School, whose 
counselors are now under scrutiny by a state auditor for altering approximately 
600 student transcripts last year. 
</P>
<P>
 To improve the grade-point averages (GPA) of graduating seniors, Brea Olinda 
counselors apparently changed low course grades, including F's, to P's (pass), 
changes that eliminated the grades from calculation of averages, thus raising 
GPAs and increasing the students' chances of college acceptance. Counselors 
also purportedly credited students with course work they did not complete. 
</P>
<P>
 The fetish in schools of testing and grading will continue, even though it 
corrupts classroom instruction: Parents, teachers and school administrators 
believe that a school's curriculum should be comprised of traditional subjects 
and of activities including teaching, testing and grading how well students 
acquire facts and skills. And admission criteria used by colleges and 
universities ensure the need for accumulating test data and maintaining grade 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 But schools that rank the importance of tests and grades highly must also cope 
with cheating, which will flourish in one form or another. And in those 
schools, second-graders and 12th-graders will continue to equate education with 
questioning, testing and grading -- and boredom and drudgery.

EDBERG'S HOPES VANISH IN LOSS TO FELLOW SWEDE; U.S. OPEN: FORMER CHAMPION 
THROWN BY WINDY CONDITIONS AND FALLS TO BJORKMAN, 6-4, 6-4, 6-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For 28-year-old Stefan Edberg, winner of six Grand Slam titles in a career 
that seems to be losing steam, the question has been whether he has one last 
one in him. Sunday night at the U.S. Open, the answer was blowing in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeded No. 5 and playing before a full house on the Stadium Court, Edberg was 
hit by a tornado named Jonas Bjorkman, a 22-year-old ranked 71st and a Swedish 
neighbor of Edberg's in the city of Vaxjo, where they frequently practice 
together when they are both home. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant that Edberg's 6-4, 6-4, 6-0 loss not only embarrassed him 
internationally, but meant that he's not even the best on his block. 
</P>
<P>
 Literally and figuratively, Edberg got blown out. Winds that swirled around 
the Stadium and Grandstand sent temperatures dipping into the high 50s and left 
certain players baffled by it. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been a factor in No. 1 Pete Sampras' 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 struggle 
against unheralded Roger Smith of the Bahamas in the afternoon, and it was a 
major factor for Edberg, whose high-toss serve-and-volley game gets badly 
disrupted by such things. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind makes it more difficult," said Edberg, who fell to the ground on a 
volley attempt late in the first set and who shanked a second serve 50 feet 
wide on set point of the second set. "He plays serve and volley, too, but he 
did it a lot better than I did tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather is windy, chilly, and the guy probably had his Christmas tonight. 
He was hitting everything and it was going in." 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg, who will play in a Davis Cup semifinal against the United States in 
Sweden this month and who won the U.S. Open in 1991 and '92, will turn 29 in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the last chance of the year for a Grand Slam, so I'm disappointed," 
he said. "Other tournaments have been OK, but, recently, the Grand Slams have 
been terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 This Grand Slam tournament is left with only six seeded men in the round of 
16. Besides Sampras, who didn't take the lead in his match against Smith until 
a full hour into it, other seeded men playing and winning Sunday were No. 4 
Michael Stich of Germany and No. 14 Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Other advances were made by Karel Novacek of the Czech Republic, who saved 
three match points in the third set of a five-set match; newcomer Joern 
Renzenbrink of Germany, who won in straight sets; doubles specialist Javier 
Frana of Argentina, who made his best Grand Slam advance yet when he won in 
five sets, and Jaime Yzaga of Peru, who took out Cedric Pioline of France, a 
finalist last year, in five sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the women, No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain, No. 5 Kimiko Date of 
Japan and No. 8 Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina all won. Date struggled in three 
sets against Leila Meskhi of the Georgia Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other women's match played Sunday, California Ginger Helgeson of 
Alpine, 25 miles east of San Diego, had Edberg-like problems with the wind in 
her evening test on the Grandstand Court and lost to Wimbledon semifinalist 
Gigi Fernandez, 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "My toss was going everywhere, and I just couldn't find my rhythm," Helgeson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today's featured match will pit Michael Chang against Andre Agassi. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi leads the series, 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Gigi Fernandez, the only other American woman remaining is Zina 
Garrison Jackson, who will play top-seeded Steffi Graf today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded men's doubles team of Byron Black and Jason Stark was upset in 
the third round by Nicklas Kulti and Magnus Larsson of Sweden, 7-5, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 That made it a very difficult day for Black, a former USC star who also lost a 
singles match to Stich.

RAMS WAKE UP AND SHOW BUDDY HOW TO PLAY BALL; PRO FOOTBALL: LYGHT'S 74-YARD 
FUMBLE RETURN KEYS DEFENSE, 14-12 VICTORY, BEFORE SMALLEST ANAHEIM CROWD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 That's correct, for those looking ahead, Super Bowl XXIX will be played on 
Jan. 29 at Joe Robbie Stadium, and a Ram spokesman said the team's present 
season-ticket holders will have first crack at seeing the game in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 All things are possible: The Rams are 1-0, alone in first place in the NFC 
West Division after a 14-12 victory over Arizona, and Cardinal Coach Buddy Ryan 
can take his ball and go home. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 32,969, the smallest for a Ram game at Anaheim Stadium, watched Los 
Angeles score its first victory in a season opener since 1989 -- and first in 
an opener at home since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what, that's what you call a booster shot," Ram wide receiver 
Jessie Hester said. "No one counted on us winning this ballgame, and now 
hopefully people will underestimate our capabilities 15 more times." 
</P>
<P>
 After playing possum in four consecutive losses during the exhibition season, 
the Rams bullied Ryan's team and then refused to falter when fatigue threatened 
to swipe their glory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, if we play Buddy 16 times a year we could be undefeated," said Joe 
Vitt, Ram assistant head coach. "Buddy Ryan doesn't put a chill in any of us. 
He doesn't play; he stands on the sideline with his arms crossed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, Houston's defensive coordinator a year ago and the architect of Buddy 
Ball, had irritated the Rams by making disparaging remarks about the team after 
the Oilers' 28-13 loss to Jim Everett & Co. last season. Vitt didn't forget, 
and issued a challenge to the Rams' defensive unit this week: Make Buddy eat 
his words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish he had played," Vitt said. "It would be like playing against 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have deep-seated feelings against anybody who criticizes another man's 
football team. I have deep-seated feelings about a man who has nothing to do 
with winning and losing. Football players win football games, and the guys in 
that locker room deserve the credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Vitt's feud appeared to fuel a Ram defense that was forced to stay on the 
field for 76 plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked to me like they were dying, and we wouldn't kill them," Ryan said. 
"It wasn't like we were playing the Dallas Cowboys out there today." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys and Rams, however, are presently even on the season, and was there 
ever a doubt? 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people put a lot of stock in the preseason, yeah, that's great," Ram 
cornerback Todd Lyght said. "But they don't count, and if you noticed, we made 
a statement today. A lot of people had counted us out, but we answered the 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght, who had been victimized repeatedly during the exhibition season, caught 
a Joe Kelly-forced fumble in the air and ran 74 yards to give the Rams a 7-0 
lead in the first quarter. Lyght's fumble return was the longest in Ram 
history, topping Jack Dwyer's 54-yard return on Nov. 22, 1952, against the San 
Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe just blew that guy (Larry Centers) up," Lyght said. "And I was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals, while afforded a variety of opportunities to take control of 
the game, could not contend with the Rams' ever-changing defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram defensive coordinator George Dyer, who opened the game with a series of 
blitzes after Jerome Bettis' fumble on the first offensive play had given 
Arizona prime field position, remained one step ahead of scrambling quarterback 
Steve Beuerlein. Dyer used one less defensive lineman and one more linebacker, 
then he used an additional cornerback, and the Cardinals were going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona settled for a 37-yard Greg Davis field goal in the second quarter, and 
then went to Davis again for a 34-yard kick, but at halftime, the Rams remained 
ahead, 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had defended 51 snaps by halftime," Vitt said. "We made no adjustments at 
the half. Every coach on the staff was hydrating their players, giving them 
fluids and making sure they weren't cramping. 
</P>
<P>
 "To play the way they did in the second half then was unbelievable. George 
Dyer just called a great game. We kept them off balance. . . . It was like a 
line change in hockey. We had players coming in and out, and one time had to 
take a timeout just to see who was healthy and who wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 An interception by newcomer Marquez Pope gave the offense possession early in 
the third quarter, and a 39-yard pass interference penalty on Cardinal 
cornerback Aeneas Williams put the Rams in position to score. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first half we were flat ugly on offense -- I was ugly," said quarterback 
Chris Miller, who completed six of 16 passes for 131 yards in his Ram debut. 
"We kept fighting, and in the second half we hit some big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 On second and 17 at the Arizona 23-yard line after Pope's interception, Miller 
beat the Cardinal blitz and found Hester for a 22-yard gain. Bettis went the 
final yard -- with a favorable ruling from the sideline official -- for the 
touchdown, and the Rams had a 14-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals kept punching, and in their only sustained drive of the day, 
they went 81 yards in a dozen plays, with Beuerlein completing a three-yard 
touchdown pass to Centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone in the stands, including the Melonheads, knew the Cardinals were 
going to try the new two-point conversion, but Arizona struggled to get a play 
in, reacted in haste, and Beuerlein's pass missed tight end Terry Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals took possession three more times in the fourth quarter. Their 
first try ended with rookie Keith Lyle's interception, and their second with a 
punt following Ricky Proehl's drop of a sure 58-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 A third attempt to score also ended with a punt, coming with less than three 
minutes to play, and giving the Cardinals their last chance to steal victory. 
The ball hit Ram returner Johnny Bailey in the facemask, and if these were the 
Rams of a year ago, the opposition would have recovered at the Rams' 44-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Bailey, however, recovered for the Rams and the Cardinals never got 
their hands on the ball again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say what you want," Coach Chuck Knox said, "but the fact is we won the 
football game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will all enjoy this win, but to be honest, our defense won that game for 
us. They were out there a long time and they never gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just tickled to death that these players and these coaches got the 
satisfaction of winning the football game. We're not saying we're a great 
football team, but it will make things a lot easier as we prepare for Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Rams opened the season 2-0 was in 1989, when they went on to 
finish one game shy of making it to the Super Bowl.

SAMPRAS SUBDUES QUALIFIER; U.S. OPEN: TOP-SEEDED PLAYER DEFEATS SMITH, 4-6, 
6-2, 6-4, 6-3, BEFORE RIPPING CONDITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Annoyed by an off-kilter court, perplexed by a swirling wind, and teased by an 
inspired qualifier slicing, dicing and pureeing him silly, Pete Sampras had a 
day he'd like to forget at the U.S. Open on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he lost. Sampras is so much better than everyone else, he turns heads 
when he drops a set. 
</P>
<P>
 He rarely loses his cool about anything, but on this day even the vagaries of 
the net cord threw Sampras off. It got so frustrating for the defending 
champion and top-seeded player that at one point he bent down to measure the 
net with his racket. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Smith of the Bahamas, ranked No. 187, had just hit a baseline shot that 
clipped the net and flopped over. Sampras darted in to scoop it up, only to see 
the ball hit the net cord again and fall back on his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras finally asserted himself after losing a set for the first time in the 
tournament, but never had it easy in a 4-6, 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 victory over the 
second qualifier he's played in three matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras ripped the condition of the stadium court, saying it wasn't level near 
the baseline and was making balls skid in that area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the biggest tournament in the United States, and they should have 
level courts," Sampras said. "It kind of sucks." 
</P>
<P>
 But he didn't use the courts as an excuse for his mediocre performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started, I didn't have the timing," Sampras said. "I felt a bit 
sluggish. I managed to get through somehow. He serves pretty well, and I had a 
hard time with that. It was a good match to get through. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first bad match I've played in a Slam in a while. He has a pretty 
good serve and he massages the ball well. He has that chip backhand that comes 
back low. I didn't know what was coming. It took me a while to get used to his 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who had to win three matches to qualify for the tournament and then won 
two more matches, fought back from 5-0 in the fourth set, serving at up to 122 
m.p.h. and mixing up speeds with a slice backhand that died in the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want it to end," Smith said. "It was a great experience. It was a 
great feeling, a great week, I love it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Until that match, the crowd ignored singles most of the day and got into 
doubles. Not just any doubles, but the Jensen brothers, the most entertaining 
show in tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 When the final volley caromed off Luke Jensen's arm, ending his frolic with 
brother Murphy in doubles, the fun escaped. There will be close matches, upsets 
and surprises, but nothing like these two. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans packed the grandstand for the Jensens two hours early, waiting patiently 
through Kimiko Date's 6-2, 6-7 (7-5), 7-5 victory over Leila Meskhi and 
virtually ignoring the first two matches in the stadium, Michael Stich's 7-6 
(7-5), 6-2, 6-1 victory over Byron Black and Gabriela Sabatini's 6-2, 6-1 
victory against Elena Likhovsteva. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Jensens hadn't lost so quickly, 6-1, 6-2, to Patrick McEnroe and Jared 
Palmer, the fans would have stayed in the grandstand instead of shifting over 
to the stadium to watch Sampras and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 In other matches, No. 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario defeated Ann Grossman, 6-2, 
6-0; unseeded Cedric Pioline, a finalist last year, lost to Jaime Yzaga, 1-6, 
7-5, 7-5, 6-1, 6-4; and No. 14 Yevgeny Kafelnikov defeated Carlos Costa, 6-3, 
6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 On a day when fans were torn between tennis and the opening day of the NFL 
season on pocket televisions and radios, the Jensens brought their unique brand 
of merriment -- backed up by a quality of play that earned them the French Open 
doubles title last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans sighed with disappointment when they departed, still smiling, in their 
long blue shirts with big white stars, an orange bandana atop Luke's head, his 
hair down to the middle of his back, a blue sock on one foot, a red one on the 
other, Murphy looking goofy and happy with his white cap backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the only guys with any color in here," said an usher who had to 
search hard to find seats for McEnroe's parents. "McEnroe and Palmer played the 
other night and nobody watched." 
</P>
<P>
 "Use 'The Force,' " a fan called down to Luke near the end, and he responded 
by laughing with the crowd, winning the point and waving to the fan in thanks. 
The Force wasn't enough to save the Jensens, but they showed how tennis can be 
fun, win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't deny the fact that they are entertaining," McEnroe said. "The 
players admit that is good for tennis. Why not? We got a packed grandstand out 
there for a third-round doubles match. It is great. We were happy to go out 
there and play in front of a lot of people, and we were also really happy that 
we showed who the best team was. That is the bottom line."

SWITZER ENJOYS A MOMENT TOO AS DALLAS WINS; PRO FOOTBALL: COWBOYS ROLL OVER 
STEELERS, 26-9, IN COACH'S NFL DEBUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a day the dark clouds around Barry Switzer finally broke, there were plenty 
of people with whom the bellicose coach of the Dallas Cowboys could have 
compared himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Knute Rockne. Tom Landry. Jimmy Johnson? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he chose a pot-bellied fan who stormed the Three Rivers Stadium field 
in the fourth period Sunday, halting play and eluding policemen for several 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned to Joe (Avezzano, an assistant) and said, 'You know, that guy's 
enjoying the moment,' " Switzer said. "And I thought, that's me. Just standing 
there, enjoying the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 After his Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers, 26-9, on Sunday, Switzer 
allowed himself another subtle observation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is bigger than Texas and Oklahoma," he gushed. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so he is not your usual coach. The Cowboys reminded everybody Sunday that 
they are not your usual team. 
</P>
<P>
 After an off-season rife with distracting controversies and changes, facing 
questions about everything from their defense to their heart, the two-time 
defending Super Bowl champions met a worthy contender on their own turf . . . 
and whipped them into West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had lost this game, everybody was out there waiting to tear our heads 
off," said Cowboy owner Jerry Jones, both excitement and relief evident in his 
rising voice. "I feel funny saying this about a first game . . . but we needed 
this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer also felt it. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were saying that this game was bigger to me than it would have been to 
Jimmy (former Cowboy coach Johnson)," Switzer said. "Well, they were right. I 
really wanted to win this." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the players felt it. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us had some doubts in our mind," safety Darren Woodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He paused, smiled, and added, "But I guess today erased all those doubts." 
</P>
<P>
 And set a record of sorts for Switzer, making him the first Cowboy coach -- 
there have only been three -- to win his debut. Landry didn't do it. Johnson 
didn't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 It helped that the Cowboys gained more than three times as many yards as the 
Steelers, 442-126. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys had the ball for eight drives before running out the clock at the 
end of the game. They scored on six. 
</P>
<P>
 And that maligned defense? It held the Steelers to 30 yards in the first half 
and finished with nine sacks, the most by the Cowboys in nearly seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now , pleaded Emmitt Smith, who gained 171 yards and scored on a two-yard 
touchdown dive, will everyone please stop leaving us for dead?  
</P>
<P>
 "You guys right now are looking at us like we're diseased or something," Smith 
said to the assembled media. "If you guys just leave us alone and quit looking 
for the nit-picking things and trying to tear us apart, we'll be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Those people looking for stumbles from Switzer -- only most of the 
football-watching nation -- were mostly disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the right thing before the game, challenging the defense to overcome 
the idea that it was gutted with the off-season losses of Ken Norton Jr., 
Jimmie Jones and Tony Casillas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He talked about how the defense doesn't ever get any respect . . . he got us 
going," said defensive end Charles Haley, who had four sacks, the most by a 
Cowboy in nearly seven years and equaling his total of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 And Switzer said the right thing at halftime, with the Cowboys leading, 16-3, 
after outgaining the Steelers, 231 yards to 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Said about one sentence," Woodson said. "Said, 'Go out there and keep playing 
good.' That was it." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the game ended, the longtime Oklahoma coach had not once used the 
Wishbone. He even allowed quarterback Troy Aikman to pass, and was rewarded 
with a 21-of-32 performance for 245 yards and a touchdown, with one 
interception of a deflection. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so during most of the sideline strategy sessions, Switzer was standing 
five yards from the huddle. 
</P>
<P>
 He did make the first important call, the one that everyone would have used to 
compare him to Johnson. On a fourth-and-one play from the Steeler 41 at the 
start of the second quarter, he went for the first down. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
 And just like on Jimmy's two Super Bowl champions, Smith responded with a 
three-yard run for a first down, keeping alive a drive that ended in one of 
rookie Chris Boniol's four field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right call," owner Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Switzer: "Shoot, I've made tougher calls just cutting people this week." 
</P>
<P>
 The best calls, as usual, were the ones that gave the ball to Smith, who is 
aiming for his fourth consecutive rushing title. 
</P>
<P>
 Awakening a shaky offense that incurred three offsides penalties in its first 
two drives, Smith began the third drive with a 46-yard run over all-pro tackle 
Erik Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys finished that drive with a two-yard touchdown pass that broke 
their doldrums while illustrating the best of the Cowboy resiliency. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman lofted a pass to the right side of the end zone just as he was leveled 
by Kevin Greene. Daryl Johnston, not nicknamed "Moose" for his footwork, made a 
leaping catch that ended in a somersault. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave the Cowboys a 13-3 lead. The rest of the game was mostly comprised 
of Neil O'Donnell, the rattled Steeler quarterback, running out of bounds for 
lost yards. 
</P>
<P>
 None of which was new to Switzer, he claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew about all this," he said. "Heck, I sat on my couch and watched the 
Cowboys for five years."

MORNING BRIEFING: CHRISTIE SAYS LEWIS IS RUNNING ON EMPTY -- BUT REMAINS FULL 
OF IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Said Britain's Linford Christie, responding to criticism by Carl Lewis that he 
is not the world's best sprinter, since Leroy Burrell lowered the 100-meter 
world record to 9.85 seconds: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lewis is an empty vessel, and an empty vessel always makes the most noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Christie: He also told Track & Field News that he prefers to train in 
Australia during the winter because, "The great thing about Australia is that 
there are no Americans there." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the NCAA Division 1-AA record for interceptions in a 
season? 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic jam: Joe Montana compares standing in a passing pocket during a game 
to making a left-hand turn in heavy traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you've ever been stuck in the median and it's not very wide, and you feel 
cars whizzing by, and you know if you move in one direction or the other you'll 
get hit -- that's about the same thing," Montana told John Paul Newport in 
Men's Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Montana: Paul Hackett, offensive coordinator of the Kansas City Chiefs, 
says Montana has a near-photographic memory.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I put a game plan in, within 20 minutes Joe's got 70% of it memorized," 
Hackett said. "The next day, he's basically got it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking point: Appropriate penalty for Javelin Guidry, a UCLA freshman 
defensive back: spearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Leave him alone: USC's Dong Koo, a sophomore offensive guard, holds a second 
degree black belt in taekwondo. He turned down an offer to become a sumo 
wrestler in South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimate plan: Hal Kopp, 85, is believed to be the nation's oldest college 
football coach. A special assistant at Rhode Island, Kopp says that when he 
dies, he wants his ashes sprinkled at RI's football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp reasons that during a game against intrastate rival Brown, a Brown runner 
might stumble and fall while heading for a sure touchdown. Said Kopp: "People 
will say, 'Kopp got him.' I never liked Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Selling point: A newspaper advertisement promoting Pittsburgh's opener against 
Texas last Saturday:  
</P>
<P>
 "No strike, no holdouts, no $$ contracts -- just football." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Dean Cain of Princeton in 1987 with 12. Cain is better known 
for his role as Superman in the television series, "Lois and Clark." 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Feller, on his statue in Jacobs Field: "I 
like it. It's 10 feet tall, weighs 1,500 pounds and is home to every pigeon in 
Cleveland." MAL FLORENCE

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shame on all of us who never thought the Rams would be in undisputed 
possession of first place in the NFC West so late in the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was a gutsy performance by the defense, which was on the field for 65 of 
the first 87 plays from scrimmage on a hot day, but made enough important plays 
to limit the Arizona Cardinals to 12 points and to score or set up 14 points. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan obviously is in need of a new offensive coordinator. I understand 
that Kevin Gilbride of Houston is available. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Among Los Angeles' big-play makers was aggressive rookie safety Keith Lyle, 
who intercepted a Steve Beuerlein pass in the fourth quarter. Lyle, who was 
selected on the third round from Virginia, is the son of former Chicago Bears 
cornerback Garry Lyle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing that can be said about quarterback Chris Miller's Ram debut is 
that he didn't panic amid difficult circumstances. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There was a traffic jam near Anaheim Stadium two hours before kickoff -- for 
Disneyland. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 32,969 was the smallest for a non-strike Ram home game since 1963 
when 29,295 saw them lose to the Washington Redskins at the Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, this must have been a major event in St. Louis, considering that is 
where the Cardinals came from and where the Rams might be going. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The teams might still be playing if a two-point conversion attempt by Arizona 
had been successful late in the third quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The star of Fox's pregame NFL show Sunday was Howie Long, who wasn't shy about 
offering his opinions. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills made Long look good by losing to the New York Jets in Buffalo after 
he said they definitely wouldn't make another visit to the Super Bowl this 
season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first time since 1988 that UCLA and USC both won their opening 
games. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The $60 million in improvements made the earthquake-damaged Coliseum look 
like, well, the old Coliseum. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hard hats off to the construction crew. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was that the message board, reportedly the biggest in football, 
didn't work in the first half of the USC-Washington game and gave only the most 
basic information in the second half. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Delon Washington is Mr. Outside and sophomore Shawn Walters Mr. 
Inside of the new and improved Trojan running game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The temptation would be to move the 225-pound Walters to fullback, but look 
for John Robinson to continue to alternate the tailbacks.Walters softens 
opponents and Washington outraces them. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Walters from Arlington and Washington from Dallas might form the best 
all-Texas tailback twosome in college since Eric Dickerson and Craig James of 
SMU. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's best advice on opening day was from his mother, who said, "Enjoy 
yourself." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Robinson promised, these are more physical Trojans and they were able to 
overpower the Huskies in the fourth quarter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, UCLA would like to forget its fourth quarter against Tennessee. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The Vols, who trailed, 18-0, before going on a 23-7 spurt, might have lulled 
the Bruins to sleep. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee's offensive strategy was curious. Starting quarterback Jerry 
Colquitt went down in the first quarter, and the Vols' strength was supposed to 
be their running attack. But they ran only four more times than they passed and 
it wasn't just a matter of playing catch-up in the second half. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, ABC's choice as UCLA player of the game was a wide receiver. 
However, it was Kevin Jordan, not J.J. Stokes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The important thing was that the Bruins won a close game at the Rose Bowl 
after losing by two, one, six, and five points there last season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds for both local games Saturday on a Labor Day weekend were larger than 
anticipated -- 55,169 for UCLA-Tennessee and 54,538 for USC-Washington. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Score: Colorado 48, Northeast Louisiana 13. Time of possession: Northeast 
Louisiana 35:19, Colorado 24:41. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A coach to watch is Fred Goldsmith of Duke. He was national coach of the year 
at Rice in 1992 and made his Duke debut Saturday with a 49-16 victory over 
Maryland. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised New Mexico State held Florida to 70 points. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, whatever happened to baseball?

PRO FOOTBALL; MARINO NO ACHILLES' HEEL IN LEADING THE DOLPHINS PAST PATRIOTS; 
AFC: QUARTERBACK THROWS FIVE TOUCHDOWN PASSES AS MIAMI RALLIES TO DEFEAT NEW 
ENGLAND, 39-35. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Marino's healing leg looked fine, and his arm was never better. 
</P>
<P>
 The Miami Dolphin quarterback made a stunning return in his comeback from a 
ruptured Achilles' tendon, throwing for 473 yards and five touchdowns Sunday to 
rally his team past New England, 39-35. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good to get back out there and play in front of a crowd," Marino 
said. "You don't want to win like that, because it kind of stops your heart to 
have to worry with one or two minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved OK. It doesn't feel like it did in the past, but it's good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Marino's performance gave him a career total of 303 touchdown passes. The only 
other NFL player to reach the 300 milestone was Fran Tarkenton, who threw 342 
touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino topped 400 yards passing for the 11th time, extending his NFL record. 
His 473 yards are the second most in team history and the 13th in league 
history.  
</P>
<P>
 Marino, who missed the final 11 games of 1993 with the most serious injury of 
his career, completed 23 of 42 passes with one interception on a deflected 
pass. His yardage total was the second-highest of his 12-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino, who has thrown five or more touchdown passes six times, silenced 
skeptics who suggested he wasn't ready to start the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to prove anything to anybody," he said. "I've been playing the 
game for 12 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Miami Coach Don Shula: "Dan is back. All week I've never seen him more 
intense than he's been this week. This game probably meant as much as any he 
has played in for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 A sellout crowd of 69,613 roared as the Dolphins avenged a loss to New England 
that eliminated them from playoff contention in the final game of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference today was they had Marino back," Patriot quarterback Drew 
Bledsoe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami receiver Irving Fryar also had a huge day, catching five passes for 211 
yards and three touchdowns, including the game-winner, a 35-yard play on 
fourth-and-five with about three minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe threw four touchdown passes for the Patriots. He completed 32 of 51 
passes for 421 yards with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's that old NFL brand of football -- just nine touchdown passes," Shula 
said. "Fortunately, we had five and they had four." 
</P>
<P>
 Fryar beat cornerback Rod Smith down the sideline for the winning score. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Marino) did a real good job," Patriot cornerback Maurice Hurst said. "He 
came out and threw the ball very well. We didn't play well in the secondary, 
especially late in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots' last chance ended when they lost the ball on downs at midfield 
with 12 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Fryar also caught touchdown passes of 54 and 50 yards, the latter on a 
flea-flicker. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino's other scoring passes covered 64 yards to Mark Ingram and 26 yards to 
Keith Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Crittenden gave New England a 35-32 lead when he made a spectacular, 
diving catch of Bledsoe's 23-yard pass with 10 minutes remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe also threw touchdowns of two and 62 yards to Ben Coates and five yards 
to Michael Timpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Kirby scored a vital two-point conversion on a dive play, trimming New 
England's biggest lead of the game to 21-18 in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was important for us," Shula said. "Because at the end of the ballgame 
it made for a situation where they had to go for a touchdown instead of a field 
goal to tie it."

PRO FOOTBALL; FAULK LIFTS COLTS IN IMPRESSIVE DEBUT, 45-21; AFC: ROOKIE RUSHES 
FOR 143 YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS AS INDIANAPOLIS EASILY DEFEATS ERROR-PRONE 
HOUSTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Marshall Faulk rushed for 143 yards and three touchdowns in his debut as the 
Indianapolis Colts, with 13 new starters, surprised the error-plagued Houston 
Oilers, 45-21, on Sunday. Houston had its 11-game regular-season winning streak 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want respect," Faulk said. "As a team, we want respect from everyone we 
play. We're not going to lay down and roll over for anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 All six Indianapolis touchdowns were scored by players who had joined the 
Colts since the end of last season, when they were 4-12. The Colts scored after 
each of three Houston turnovers and set a team record for most points in a 
season-opening game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts led, 42-0, when Faulk, the second pick overall in the draft, went to 
the sideline late in the third quarter. Faulk, who carried 23 times, scored on 
runs of one, two and 11 yards. His longest run was 52 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't pay attention to the score," he said. "As long as they kept me in 
there, I was going to do my job. Sometimes you look at the score and get a 
tendency to relax, and I didn't want to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The butterflies weren't there today. I knew what I had to do. It felt great 
getting into the open field. But it's not the long runs that really got us to 
win this game. It's the constant first downs, the banging for five and 10 yards 
and getting in on third and one and getting the first downs. That's what got us 
to win this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Faulk's one-yard run 12:56 into the game marked the first time in 23 games 
that Indianapolis' offense scored in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Tony Bennett, a free agent from Green Bay, returned a fumble a 
Colt-record 75 yards for a touchdown and Chicago Bear castoff Jim Harbaugh 
passed for two touchdowns to Floyd Turner, a free agent from New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play Houston Oilers football. Everybody was playing for the Colts 
instead of for the Houston Oilers," cornerback Cris Dishman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great back. I give him his credentials," he said of Faulk. "But I 
don't think he faced the true Houston Oilers defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston got its only touchdowns on fourth-quarter passes of two yards to Pat 
Carter and 16 and 15 yards to Haywood Jeffires from Bucky Richardson, who 
replaced Cody Carlson in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson left the game because of an injured left shoulder, and doctors 
determined he suffered a second-degree shoulder separation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cody took a heck of a lick. At this point, his shoulder's banged up pretty 
good," Houston Coach Jack Pardee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson, the full-time starter since Warren Moon's trade to the Minnesota 
Vikings in the off-season, was sacked by Tony McCoy for a 20-yard loss and a 
fumble, and Bennett scooped up the ball on the run and raced 75 yards for the 
second touchdown of his career and a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It broke the former Colt record for a fumble return of 64 yards by Stan White 
against Buffalo in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The 28 points in the second quarter tied a Colts record for points in one 
period set most recently against Kansas City in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulk had his 52-yard run midway through the third quarter, then scored his 
third touchdown four plays later and reluctantly sat out the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I would have loved to have played the whole game, but it didn't 
work out that way." Faulk said.

 Ram Review 
</P>
<P>
 First Quarter: The pageantry of opening day, sky divers, balloons and 
first-round pick Wayne Gandy always knew one day he would be sitting on the 
bench for an NFL game . . . Phoenix brings 600-plus fans, thus outnumbering Ram 
fans two-to-one . . . Elapsed time of national anthem is 1 minute 26 seconds -- 
18 seconds shy of equaling Rams' longest offensive drive . . . Keith Loneker 
starts with Jackie Slater and you thought you'd seen it all when Lisa Marie 
Presley and Michael Jackson got together . . . Jerome Bettis offers 
touching-fumbling tribute to recuperating Cleveland Gary . . . Ram defense 
tough, Jimmie Jones penetrates, Joe Kelly forces fumble, Todd Lyght goes 74 
yards for TD and Gandy is permitted off bench to join celebration . . . Rams 7, 
Cardinals 0. 
</P>
<P>
 Second Quarter: Fifteen minutes into season and Chris Miller is still standing 
. . . Twenty-nine minutes into season and Rams are still looking for their 
initial first down . . . Defensive end Brad Ottis is spotted on field; do Rams 
realize this game counts? Lyght gets beat in end zone, recovers to knock down 
pass, and good thing Steve Beuerlein couldn't hit Pacific if standing on edge 
of Santa Monica Pier . . . Five minutes until halftime when Chinese Acrobats 
perform and Gandy wants to know if he can watch? Rams get first down with 28 
seconds left in half because Eric Swann steps offside; ball will be on display 
in Orange County Hall of Fame . . . Rams 7, Cardinals 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Third Quarter: Bettis starts quarter averaging 2.6 yards a carry, and at this 
rate he will have to carry the ball 769 times to reach 2,000 yards . . . 
Marquez Pope interception leads to Bettis TD and Chuck Knox is asking for raise 
instead of expecting pink slip . . . Rookie Toby Wright has more hits in debut 
than Bruce Willis has in whole career . . . Rams are going to win, Rams are 
going to win, and Georgia Frontiere is seen kissing Forrest Gump on the cheek . 
. . Arizona scores, fails on two-point conversion and so that's Buddy Ball . . 
. Flipper Anderson goes deep, makes circus catch and somewhere in New Orleans 
on Sunday night Jim Everett was talking to himself.Rams 14, Cardinals 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth Quarter: Search party dispatched to locate tight end Troy Drayton . . . 
David Rocker gets a sack, yeah sure, and Madonna enters the convent, Don King 
takes a vow of silence . . . Keith Lyle has an interception, Robert Young 
applies pressure and it's like the media has been saying all along: These guys 
are really good . . . Johnny Bailey tries to catch a punt with his facemask, 
Ricky Proehl has Steve Israel beat deep for game-winning touchdown, Chris 
Miller stumbles and fumbles, Cards don't take advantage and later Leigh 
Steinberg takes credit for Saving the Rams . . . Bettis game of keepaway drops 
Ram magic number to 15 to secure playoff berth. Rams 14, Cardinals 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Game Summary: One more win and Neon Deion is asking for chance to jump on Ram 
bandwagon . . . One more win and it's showdown Sunday, baby, in Anaheim Stadium 
with the 49ers . . . Two more wins in a row and the league orders an 
investigation . . . Crowd of 32,969 is all-time Anaheim low on big day, but 
folks probably misunderstood -- next year's opener will be in Baltimore. T.J.

PRO FOOTBALL; BRONCOS, ELWAY DROP THE BALL; AFC: DENVER BLOWS A 24-6 LEAD 
AGAINST SAN DIEGO, THEN LOSES WHEN QUARTERBACK FUMBLES IN THE FINAL MINUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Diego Chargers and Denver Broncos staged a shootout Sunday that had 
just about everything. San Diego won, 37-34, as Stan Humphries threw three 
touchdown passes and linebacker Junior Seau recovered a bizarre fumble by John 
Elway in the waning seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego turned two interceptions into touchdowns, including safety Stanley 
Richard's 99-yard return for a score on the final play of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, with Denver threatening at the Charger 3-yard line late in the game, 
Elway rolled to his right and attempted to pass. But the ball slipped out of 
his hand and Seau plucked the fumble out of the air at the 8 with 35 seconds 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the ball twirling in the air," Seau said, "and I couldn't believe it 
was up there, coming from a guy who usually doesn't make those mistakes. Elway 
is the best at the two-minute drill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were walking the fence, but we came out a winner this time." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1-yard scoring run by Natrone Means, which capped a grueling 19-play, 
89-yard drive that consumed more than 10 minutes of the final period, was the 
clinching score. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, who also had three touchdown passes, drove Denver into scoring 
position, helped by offside and personal-foul penalties against San Diego. But 
on second-and-goal, Seau iced the win. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, whose 36 completions set a club record, said his critical fumble came 
when he had Anthony Miller "wide open in the end zone. I just lost it. It 
slipped out of my hand. I couldn't believe he caught it. The interception at 
the end of the first half wasn't bizarre. It was just plain stupid on my part." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard's 99-yard return capped a 21-point San Diego flurry that lifted the 
Chargers to a 27-24 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos appeared on the verge of a rout after Elway's second touchdown 
pass had given them a 24-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver was driving for an apparent score in the closing seconds of the first 
half, reaching the Charger 5 when Elway's pass was picked off by Richard near 
the goal line. Escorted by a phalanx of blockers, he scored easily as time 
expired in the half. Ronnie Harmon's run on the two-point conversion made it 
27-24. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronco Coach Wade Phillips called Richard's interception "a 14-point swing. 
I've never seen a team get a 100-yard interception on the last play of the 
half. Obviously, we made too many mistakes. When you have a 100-yard 
interception return and you lose the ball on the 4-yard line with a fumble, you 
pay the price."

PRO FOOTBALL; MONTANA, ALLEN PROPEL CHIEFS; INTERCONFERENCE: THEY LEAD KANSAS 
CITY TO A 30-17 VICTORY AND RUIN EVERETT'S DEBUT WITH SAINTS.

<P>
 You can put that retirement party on hold for at least another week. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Montana continued his excellence in the Superdome and Marcus Allen showed 
he is as elusive as ever as the Chiefs beat the Saints, 30-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana passed for 315 yards and two touchdowns, dismantling New Orleans' 
defense, which included 40 different looks for Montana, none of which gave him 
any trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 36th 300-yard passing game for Montana, who completed 24 of 33 
passes for two touchdowns without an interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, starting his 14th season, had 82 yards in 17 carries and a touchdown. 
He also caught three passes for 16 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe and Marcus are both great players in their own right," Kansas City Chiefs 
Coach Joe Schottenheimer said. "But they also have the ability to raise people 
around them to another level." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana, 38, and Allen, 34, wasted no time displaying the value of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City dominated the first half, with two touchdowns and a field goal on 
its first three possessions. The Chiefs had the ball for 18 minutes 16 seconds, 
out-rushed New Orleans 86 yards to 16, and held a passing advantage of 131-95. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Chiefs' victory Sunday, Montana is 9-0 against New Orleans in the 
Superdome -- 10-0 overall, including his Super Bowl victory in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Allen: "I don't buy the theory that once you get to a certain age, it's 
downhill."  
</P>
<P>
 Former Ram starter Jim Everett, making his first regular-season appearance 
with the Saints, completed 26 of 37 passes for 325 yards, two touchdowns and 
two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 21st time that Everett has thrown for 300 yards in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 On their first possession, Montana drove the Chiefs 80 yards on 15 plays, with 
Allen rushing for 45 yards on six carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive included a 13-yard gain by Allen on fourth down, and 26 yards 
passing by Montana, including an 11-yard touchdown to Willie Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second touchdown drive, Allen was stopped twice for no gain on the 
1-yard line, then waltzed in two plays later to make it 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints' young secondary, with seven players lining up as first-time 
starters or in new positions, was easy pickings for Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't stop the pass. We didn't stop the run. We didn't do any of the 
things we should have done," said Saint linebacker Sam Mills. "It was 
disappointing, but I think we're better than this and we'll be better."

PRO FOOTBALL; SEAHAWKS RUSH PAST REDSKINS; INTERCONFERENCE: WARREN GAINS 100 
YARDS WITH TWO TOUCHDOWNS AS SEATTLE DEFEATS WASHINGTON, 28-7.

<P>
 Tom Flores gained his 100th victory Sunday. Norv Turner is still waiting for 
his first. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Mirer's passing, the running and receiving of Chris Warren and a bunch of 
mistakes by Washington helped the Seattle Seahawks defeat the Redskins, 28-7, 
at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will remember this victory for a long time," said Flores, in his third 
season as Seattle coach after nine years with the Raiders. "I am very proud of 
my guys and happy for them. It's nice (to get the 100th victory). It's hard to 
explain without getting too emotional." 
</P>
<P>
 Mirer completed 17 of 28 passes for 183 yards and one touchdown, leading 
scoring drives of 12, 53 and 45 yards. Warren rushed for 100 yards and scored 
two touchdowns. It was Warren's seventh 100-yard game. He also caught three 
passes for 42 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts ruined Turner's first regular-season appearance as Washington 
coach. He came to the Redskins after spending three years as offensive 
coordinator with the Dallas Cowboys and helping them win Super Bowl 
championships the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins moved 82 yards behind John Friesz after the opening kickoff, 
scoring on a 27-yard pass play to Desmond Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 But Washington's sloppy play soon began. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Mitchell fumbled a punt return and Terry Wooden recovered on the 
Washington 12-yard line. Warren scored on the next play to tie the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins were moving the ball well on their fourth drive, but then Wooden 
turned the game in Seattle's favor with an interception he returned 69 yards 
for a score. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner kept his promise to play rookie quarterback Heath Shuler for part of 
the game, sending him in for two possessions late in the second quarter, but 
Shuler was sacked twice.

PRO FOOTBALL; MEGGETT TAKES THE LEAD IN GIANTS' 28-23 VICTORY; NFC: HE SCORES 
ONCE RUSHING, ONCE ON A PUNT RETURN, AND RECOVERS A FUMBLE TO SET UP ANOTHER 
TOUCHDOWN IN NEW YORK'S VICTORY OVER THE EAGLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dave Meggett did just about everything Sunday, and in the process, he might 
have made himself the new leader of the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe there was no need for the Giants to look for a replacement for Phil 
Simms and Lawrence Taylor, after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Meggett returned a punt 68 yards for a touchdown, ran 26 for another and 
recovered a fumble to set up another as the Giants capitalized on early errors 
to open the post Taylor-Simms era with a 28-23 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Meggett said his play on the field will decide whether he replaces Simms and 
Taylor in a leadership role. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just say, 'I want to be a leader,' " said Meggett, a six-year 
veteran. "You just have to perform and do some of the positive things so that 
the guys will want to look up to you as a player. I'm not going to put the 
added pressure on myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The key for New York was a 21-3 first-half spurt that featured Meggett's 
recovery, his punt return and a 51-yard scoring pass from Dave Brown to Chris 
Calloway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a lot to ourselves, especially in the first half," Eagle Coach Rich 
Kotite said. "It's hard to overcome 21 points of self-inflicted wounds." 
</P>
<P>
 It was equally hard to overcome the bitterness of salary cuts forced on six 
Eagles on Monday, although Kotite said they "had absolutely nothing to do with 
the loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor in the Eagles' loss was their inability to fluster Brown in his 
first start as Simms' replacement as Giant quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sacked twice and hit numerous times, he completed 10 of 20 passes for 
171 yards with one interception.  
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles, who trailed by 11 points at halftime, never got closer than the 
final margin when Randall Cunningham, who completed 20 of 39 passes for 344 
yards, connected with Calvin Williams on a 10-yard touchdown pass play with 
1:17 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham also passed to Mark Bavaro on a three-yard scoring play and Eddie 
Murray kicked three field goals, but the Eagles (8-8 in 1993) had trouble 
against the Giants' new 4-3 defense, which had struggled in exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants sacked Cunningham five times. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a great way to start the season," said Giant Coach Dan Reeves, who led 
the team to an 11-5 record and a wild-card playoff berth last season. "We know 
how important it was to start the season on the right foot."

 Bruce Coslet was known as a gambling coach whose moves often backfired. Pete 
Carroll apparently isn't afraid to gamble, either -- and he fared far better 
than his predecessor Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Carroll only one try to do what Coslet needed three years to 
accomplish: a victory over the Buffalo Bills. In his head coaching debut, 
Carroll went for a touchdown on fourth-and-goal from the one-yard line, and 
Richie Anderson delivered for him, boosting the Jets to a 23-3 victory over 
Buffalo.

 "I think it's an indication that Pete has great confidence in our offensive 
line and our running backs," quarterback Boomer Esiason said. "That was a gutsy 
call. If we don't make it, it's kind of a momentum swing. If you score points 
there, it's definitely a strike against Buffalo." 
</P>
<P>
 In their four consecutive AFC championship years, Buffalo lost only twice in 
16 September games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had games like this, even in our good seasons," Buffalo Coach Marv Levy 
said. "I hope this is just the same thing cropping up earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Esiason completed 14 of 28 passes for 214 yards and Johnny Johnson gained 75 
yards and a touchdown on 25 carries for the Jets. Jim Kelly threw two 
interceptions and completed 20 of 35 passes for 177 yards. Thurman Thomas 
gained only five yards in seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly left the stadium with a bruised right hand. He also said he hurt his 
throwing shoulder when he was tackled and fell on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sorest thing right now is my pride," he said, "knowing that we're a lot 
better team than we showed today." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills' first possession was an easy march to the Jets' 11-yard line before 
Thomas was stopped on third-and-2. Levy took the easy way out, and Steve 
Christie's 27-yard field goal made it 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets answered with a 70-yard drive, converting three third downs before 
landing a first-and-goal at the 1. After three unsuccessful attempts to punch 
it in, the rookie coach had his first big decision, and the break between 
quarters to mull it over. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll went for it, and Anderson scored his first NFL touchdown for a 7-3 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew that on the road touchdowns were so important, and it's hard to beat 
these guys with field goals," Carroll said. "It was a long way for them to go 
if we don't make it. It worked out right." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the second period, Johnny Mitchell caught a third-and-10 pass, 
bounced off one tackler and ran down the left sideline before Matt Darby pushed 
him out at the 9. On the next play, Johnson went through the middle to make it 
14-3 with 1:36 left in the half.

 Erik Kramer likes his view from the field a lot better than the one he used to 
have from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, it showed. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first opening-day game appearance, Kramer threw two touchdown passes to 
tight end Chris Gedney, including a 37-yard pass play with 5:35 left, and the 
Chicago Bears beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
 In his years with the Lions, Kramer was a frustrated third-stringer even 
though he led the Lions to the NFC Central title in two of the last three 
seasons. With the Bears, he's the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "He coaches us in the huddle and lets us know what is going on with the 
defense rather than just callings plays," Gedney said after catching the first 
two touchdown passes of his career. "He tells us what a defensive back might do 
on certain plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer completed 18 of 25 passes for 212 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears scored on their first possession, bogged down in the middle of the 
game but were able to put the Buccaneers away with Kramer's late scoring pass 
to Gedney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened in the past," said Kramer, who was signed away 
from Detroit as a free agent for a three-year, $8.1 million deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try to keep people off balance. I don't know if we got too 
predictable or what in the second half."

PRO FOOTBALL; LIONS' HANSON LEAVES THE FALCONS IN PAIN, 31-28; NFC: DETROIT 
KICKER INJURES LEG EARLIER IN GAME, BUT COMES BACK TO MAKE THE WINNING 37-YARD 
FIELD GOAL IN OVERTIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a game made for heroes, and several answered the call. The biggest of 
all was a kicker with a cramp in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hanson, in obvious pain, kicked a 37-yard field goal to lift the Detroit 
Lions to a 31-28 overtime victory over Atlanta, spoiling the coaching debut of 
the Falcons' June Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm no hero," Hanson said Sunday. "These guys play hurt all the time. I'm 
just glad I was able to help out." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Spielman, the Lions' emotional leader, thought the play on which Hanson 
was injured was bigger than his winning field goal. He got hurt tackling Alton 
Montgomery on the kickoff following the touchdown that tied the game with 30 
seconds left in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to squib the kick. We didn't want to give them a chance to return 
it," said Hanson, who normally buries his kickoffs in the end zone. "But when 
he turned upfield, I was there and I had to hit him. His knee came down on my 
shin. It was just a freak thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps as a result of Hanson's tackle, Atlanta's Norm Johnson was forced to 
try a 52-yard field goal on the final play of regulation. It was wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, trainers worked furiously on Hanson's calf along the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just amazed," he said. "I'd like to see (the field goal) again on film, 
just to see what it looked like." 
</P>
<P>
 There might have been other heroes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Atlanta's Jeff George, in charge of the Falcons' run-and-shoot offense for 
the first time, completed 29 of 37 passes for 281 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Falcons' Andre Rison had personal bests with 14 catches for 193 yards 
and two touchdowns. The yardage tied a team record, the catches fell one shy. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Detroit's Scott Mitchell completed 15 of 30 passes for 173 yards, with 
three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions tied the score, 28-28, on a 15-yard pass play from Mitchell to 
Anthony Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery rambled 37 yards with the ensuing kickoff before Hanson brought him 
down at the Atlanta 44. Two passes to Rison put the Falcons on the Detroit 34 
with one second remaining, and Johnson missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's defense forced the Falcons to punt after three plays in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurts a lot now, but this team will bounce back," Rison said. "We go into 
games trying to win, instead of trying not to lose. That's a total difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We play the Rams next week. And I'm guaranteeing a win. You can put that out 
all over the country, I'm guaranteeing we'll win the game."

PRO FOOTBALL; EARLY RETURNS COMFORTING FOR BROWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Relief, not celebration, was all around the Browns' locker room Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That game was all we thought it would be when we came down here," Cleveland 
Coach Bill Belichick said of the blowout-turned-squeaker."The Bengals never 
gave up and had a chance at the end. We feel real fortunate to come out of here 
on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe coaches are supposed to say that after every game, but Belichick's words 
rang true as the Browns hung on for a 28-20 victory over the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That takes the pressure off," Cleveland's Eric Metcalf said of the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns avoided their worst-case scenario: A loss that would revive bitter 
feelings from last season, when Belichick incurred the fans' wrath by elevating 
quarterback Vinny Testaverde and cutting Bernie Kosar. 
</P>
<P>
 But rookie Antonio Langham and the Browns' special teams got Belichick the big 
start heneeded.  
</P>
<P>
 Randy Baldwin returned a kickoff 85 yards, and Metcalf set a club record with 
a 92-yard punt return less than three minutes later to spark the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 No NFL team had returned a kickoff and punt for a touchdown in the same game 
since Detroit in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Browns' first punt-and-kickoff touchdown game since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 Testaverde completed 14 of 24 passes for 149 yards, with one touchdown and two 
interceptions.

CHARGERS RALLY FOR 37-34 VICTORY; AFC: TRAILING, 24-6, THREE TOUCHDOWN PASSES 
BY HUMPHRIES AND A 99-YARD INTERCEPTION RETURN BY RICHARD LEADS SAN DIEGO OVER 
DENVER. 
</P>

<P>
 Stan Humphries threw three touchdown passes and linebacker Junior Seau 
recovered a bizarre fumble by John Elway in the waning seconds, preserving the 
San Diego Chargers' wild 37-34 victory over the Denver Broncos on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego defense converted two interceptions into touchdowns, including 
safety Stanley Richard's 99-yard return on the final play of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, with Denver threatening at the Chargers' three-yard line, Elway 
rolled to his right and attempted to pass. But the ball slipped out his grip 
and Seau plucked the fumble out of the air at the eight with 35 seconds to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 A one-yard scoring run by Natrone Means, which capped a grueling 19-play, 
89-yard drive that consumed more than 10 minutes of the final period, was the 
the clinching score. Humphries' 25-yard pass to Alfred Pupunu was a key play on 
the drive, and Means scored with 4:01 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Elway, who had three touchdown passes, drove Denver into scoring position, 
helped by offside and personal-foul penalties against San Diego. But on 
second-and-goal from the 3, Seau iced the win. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard's 99-yard return capped a 21-point San Diego flurry that lifted the 
Chargers to a 27-24 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos appeared on the verge of a rout after Elway's second touchdown 
pass had given them a 24-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver capitalized on a shanked punt and a fumbled kickoff return en route to 
an early 17-0 lead. Elway's 50-yard pass to Mike Pritchard produced a 7-0 lead, 
and Leonard Russell's 22-yard run made it 14-0. After the fumbled kickoff 
return, Jason Elam kicked a 25-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego responded with an 82-yard drive, capped by Humphries' 22-yard 
touchdown pass play to Pupunu in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 But Elway's eight-yard scoring pass to Glyn Milburn gave Denver a 24-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Two minutes later, the Chargers scored as Humphries connected with Shawn 
Jefferson on a 47-yard pass play. On the next play from scrimmage, Darren 
Carrington picked off Elway's pass at the Denver 40, and Humphries hooked up 
with Mark Seay on a 29-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver was driving in the closing seconds of the half, reaching the Chargers' 
5 when Elway's pass was picked off by Richard at the 1. Escorted by a phalanx 
of blockers, he scored easily as time expired in the half. Ronnie Harmon's run 
on the two-point conversion gave San Diego a 27-24 lead.

DEL MAR; IT'S JUST LIKE OLD TIMES AS NAVARONE WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you liked the 1992 Del Mar Handicap, you would have loved Sunday's 1994 Del 
Mar Handicap. The owner was the same. The trainer was the same. The jockey was 
the same. The tactics were the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the winning horse, Navarone, was the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The jockey, Pat Valenzuela, let his horse control what was basically a race 
without pace, picked up speed a little bit, then had enough left to hold off 
onrushing Approach the Bench at the wire. Navarone won by a nose and paid 
$12.60. 
</P>
<P>
 The big money on this $250,000 race for older horses over 1 3/8 miles on the 
turf was on the Mike Sloan-entry of Grand Flotilla and Sir Mark Sykes. Grand 
Flotilla was thought to be the horse to beat but finished fifth. His stablemate 
rallied for third, two lengths behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran well," said Jenine Sahadi, Grand Flotilla's trainer, "but there wasn't 
any pace and he was too far back to make up the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 The race unfolded perfectly for Navarone, who followed the 1992 Del Mar 
Handicap victory with a first in the Oak Tree Invitational at Santa Anita, then 
battled injury and illness for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Rash, the trainer who brought him through this troubled period, and his 
owner, R.E. Hibbert, were happy merely to see him back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had any doubts he'd come back," Rash said. "I'm lucky I work for the 
Hibberts because they allow me to do what's right. On his day, Navarone can run 
with the good horses and today he proved it. That was one of the toughest Del 
Mar Handicaps in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Rash felt good in the paddock, as Navarone stood calmly while being saddled. 
The race unfolded with Navarone, Regency and Daros on the lead. Navarone 
gradually pulled away until he had to contend with Approach the Bench and Corey 
Nakatani at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a flashback to '92," Valenzuela said, "when I opened up with him on the 
turn and won it in the clear. I saw myself doing it again. When Corey's horse 
came up on me, he (Navarone) stuck his neck out and tried harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Rash laughed about having complained to the racing secretary about the impost 
Navarone had to carry, only one pound less than his last stakes start. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that yelling," he said, "probably doesn't look too good now." 
</P>
<P>
 However, that one pound might have given him the nose he needed to relive 
1992. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Trainer Brian Mayberry has hit a bad patch. 
</P>
<P>
 It started Thursday when the California Horse Racing Board suspended Mayberry 
for 30 days because a tranquilizing drug had been found in the urine of a horse 
he saddled at Hollywood Park. He termed it a "vet's mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Saturday, one of his horses, Ramblin Guy, veered left out of the 
first post position in the sixth race and barreled over the rail in an ugly 
mishap that sent jockey Eddie Delahoussaye flying. Delahoussaye suffered no 
serious injuries, but is off his mounts indefinitely because of soreness. 
Ramblin Guy, a 3-year-old, had to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "What other people do to me means nothing," Mayberry said Sunday, "but having 
that horse killed means everything. He was a wonderful horse and that was a 
terrible thing to happen. He was a high-class horse I thought would develop 
into a quality sprinter. The only thing I'm happy about is that Eddie wasn't 
hurt any more seriously than he was." 
</P>
<P>
 What of the suspension, which is supposed to begin Tuesday? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very ill-versed when it comes to matters of law and jurisprudence," 
Mayberry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My attorney will handle it with an injunction and hearing. As far as I'm 
concerned, it's just some little people trying to be big people." 
</P>
<P>
 He indicated it would be business as usual with him until he heard otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been drawn and quartered yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Today's Del Mar Derby, a $300,000 race for 3-year-olds over 1 1/8 miles on the 
turf, is wide open. A case can be made for every entry in the 10-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning line favorite, at 7-2, is Eagle Eyed, based on his performance in 
the Grade II Arlington Classic. Next, at 9-2, is Unfinished Symph, winner of 
the Cinema Handicap at Hollywood Park but second to Marvin's Faith, a 10-1 shot 
in this field, in the La Jolla Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Derby also features the likes of Powis Castle, a horse who ran, without 
success, in the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness; Rapan, fourth in his only 
stakes start but hoping today's distance is right for his style; and Bluegrass 
Prince, an import from England who arrived on Friday. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gary Baze, another jockey injured Saturday, will be sidelined for four weeks 
because of broken ribs. He was thrown and kicked as he left the paddock on 
Oklahoma Morn before the second race.

SWIMMING / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS; FOR CHINESE, IT'S TURTLE SOUP AND A BIT MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When swimming's World Championships begin today, the soup du jour is expected 
to be turtle. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as China's famous track coach, Ma Junren, has credited that concoction 
with assisting in the training of his women athletes, expect his nautical 
counterpart, Chen Yun Peng, to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, expect coaches from other countries to suggest that the Chinese women 
are taking something more illicit with their soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years after returning to international competition in 1984 during the Los 
Angeles Olympics, the Chinese women won three gold medals and one silver at 
Seoul. In the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, they improved to four golds 
and five silvers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they got serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the top 25 times in the 13 events that are contested in the Olympics, 325 
in all, the Chinese had 101 last year. That was compared to 28 the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe the Chinese women could win as many as eight gold medals before 
the swimming championships end next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches for the U.S. men and women, Jon Urbanchek of Michigan and Richard 
Quick of Stanford, will be surprised if their teams win that many golds 
combined. They list contenders as Janet Evans in the 400- and 800-meter 
freestyles, Allison Wagner in both individual medley races, Jeff Rouse in the 
100 backstroke and Tom Dolan and Eric Namesnik in the 400 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Chen Lixia and Yu Zhuocheng maintained China's dominance in diving. 
</P>
<P>
 After Chen had produced a masterful series of dives to lead a Chinese 1-2 
finish in the women's 1-meter springboard, Yu's final dive, an inward 3 1/2 
somersault, earned the gold medal ahead of Russia's Dmitry Sautin in the 
3-meter springboard.

SALSA OFFENSE ADDS STRENGTH, DEFEATS TORONTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although many areas of the Salsa occupied Coach Rick Davis' thoughts entering 
the season, offense did not encroach on his time. 
</P>
<P>
 No need for concern there, Davis believed, not with star midfielder Paulinho 
-- league MVP and scoring champion -- and speedy forward Paul Wright, second in 
the league in scoring, back to terrorize goalkeepers. As the season progressed, 
however, Davis wondered when his high-scoring tandem would get rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they're in form now, and Davis believes the duo might have added a 
member Sunday in a 4-0 American Professional Soccer League victory over the 
Toronto Rockets at Titan Stadium in front of 5,112. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you score four goals, you can't be dissatisfied with much," Davis said. 
"This was just an outstanding (offensive) performance. With the way our offense 
has been playing, nobody wants to play the Salsa right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Not after two consecutive home games in which the Salsa outscored the 
opposition, 9-1. The Salsa routed Ft. Lauderdale, 5-1, at Titan Stadium last 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa (9-7), second in the APSL to Seattle (10-5), received its usual 
standout play from Paulinho and Wright against Toronto, but it was midfielder 
Yari Allnut who provided the spark in this victory. Allnut, a reserve who has 
battled injuries this season, scored two goals in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just felt really good to get out there," Allnut said. "All I did was 
hustle, the team set the tone." 
</P>
<P>
 Allnut, a talented midfielder acquired in the off-season, was supposed to 
combine with Wright and Paulinho to create a powerful scoring trio. A hamstring 
tear in his left leg prevented the plan from materializing -- until Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yari is an important player for us," Davis said. "I really didn't expect him 
to do this because he hasn't played a lot, but we knew he could do this. When 
he gets going, he can put the ball in the net. He was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yari came in and did a heck of a job," Wright said. "We all knew about Yari, 
but now he showed everyone. With how well our offense is going, no one will 
(want to) play us with Yari out there, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto (4-11) is sixth in the seven-team APSL. The Rockets appeared 
overmatched from the opening kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright gave the Salsa a 1-0 halftime lead when he beat Toronto goalkeeper 
Patrick Onstad on a penalty kick in the 27th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Again No. 2 in the league scoring race to Paulinho, Wright was awarded the 
penalty kick when Rocket defender Dino Lopez tackled him in the Toronto box, 
about 12 yards in front of Onstad. Wright is tied with two players at 19 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Allnut's first goal, in the 76th minute, gave the Salsa a 2-0 lead. In the 
82nd minute, Paulinho scored his league-leading 10th goal. Paulinho tops the 
APSL with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Allnut and Paulinho combined on the game's final goal. Paulinho made an 
excellent crossing pass to Allnut, who scored in the 87th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa goalkeeper Mike Littman continued his strong play, recording his fourth 
shutout of the season. Still, he'll take those big scores whenever he can get 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased with the way the guys have been knocking the ball around," 
Littman said. "We've been putting the balls in goal at home, now we have to do 
it on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis no longer worries about either offense or defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can win games 5-1 and we can win games 1-0," Davis said. "That's what 
we've wanted."

ANN CONWAY: REINVENTING THE WHEELS; LIMO EXTERIORS ARE KEEPING DOWN WITH THE 
TIMES, BUT PERKS STILL ABOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Step with Henry Snyder into a converted Lincoln Town Car and you're in for 
more than a limo ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Foil-wrapped chocolates? Fresh berries? Iced pink Champagne? Coffee in a China 
cup? They're all part of the tour perks that Snyder -- general manager of 
Getaway Limousine Services in Orange -- has dreamed up for clients. 
</P>
<P>
 And you thought limos had no place in the dressed-down '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 With the society-set gearing up for a season of nonstop charity galas, 
land-yachts are as popular as ever. "People still like to travel in style," 
says Snyder, who has snagged some of the county's top corporate and social 
accounts -- The Walt Disney Co., the Mighty Ducks, Tiffany & Co., and George 
Argyros, to name a few. "But now limos are less showy, more understated." 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the velour-lined white "prom cars" that are stretched to a city block. 
In are leather-lined black town cars and sedans -- or specialty cars such as 
Getaway's ivory and ebony 1934 Rolls Royce -- that whisper instead of shout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Class is coming back," Snyder says. "In the '80s, everything was flash and 
glitz. We're heading into a more elegant time." 
</P>
<P>
 And getting more for our money. 
</P>
<P>
 For $60 per hour, which includes tax and gratuity, Snyder arrives 15 minutes 
early, presents you with his calling card, and helps you into a leather 
interior so deluxe you feel like you're sitting inside a Judith Leiber handbag. 
</P>
<P>
 Tap a button and a color TV swivels out of a hidden compartment. Tap another 
and exactly 1 1/2 ounces of your complimentary beverage of choice cascades into 
a crystal tumbler. 
</P>
<P>
 As the limo clicks along the diamond lane, you have some pressing decisions to 
make: Should the opaque privacy divider be down and the etched window divider 
up? The sun roof closed? The ceiling-hidden vanity mirror open? 
</P>
<P>
 You want to dish? Drop Brooke Shields' name. Snyder is her godfather, drove 
her to an Orange County charity gala last spring. (Yes, it's still on between 
Shields and Agassi. And yes, Brooke is one of the nicest women alive.) 
</P>
<P>
 Or the name of the beloved Jackie O. She knew Snyder when he had the boutique 
at the famous Kenneth hair salon in New York in the '60s. ("She had such 
taste," he says, softly). 
</P>
<P>
 It's "special treatment" that keeps clients coming back, Snyder says. "We've 
developed everything from special request forms (so Snyder will know if it's 
espresso or cappuccino a client wants, muffins or croissants, alcohol or soft 
drinks) to out-of-county tours to Bel-Air and the Temecula wine country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge for the limousine company of the '90s is to make people feel 
special. It's an indifferent world out there." 
</P>
<P>

 Culinary art to benefit CHOC: Fresh off the fax is the menu for the Oct. 18 
"Culinary Event of the Century" benefit for Children's Hospital of Orange 
County featuring chef Paul Bocuse at the Four Seasons Hotel in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Four Seasons and the House of Mumm Champagne, the menu will 
feature a first course of pheasant consomme with lentil and wild mushrooms 
followed by baby lobster salad with chive sauce, roasted veal chop with goose 
liver and truffle and a dessert of sabayon with figs and berries. All courses 
will be accompanied by vintage champagnes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bocuse -- acclaimed in culinary circles as one of the world's great chefs -- 
will be joined by the hotel's executive chef, Michel Pieton. Tickets are $150 
per person. Call 714-760-4920 for reservations.

 Beatrice Wood honored: Centenarian ceramist Beatrice Wood of Ojai will be 
honored in Laguna Beach on Nov. 11 by the Archives of American Art, a division 
of the Smithsonian Institution. The gala dinner event will be at the Surf and 
Sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have just sent a telegram to heaven to keep me alive through Nov. 11," 
Wood, 101, wrote art collector Gerald Buck of Mission Viejo in May. (Buck, an 
archives trustee, is helping mastermind the affair.) 
</P>
<P>
 Among the celebs on the invitation list are Michael and Diandra Douglas (she 
helped produce the documentary, "Beatrice Wood: Mama of Dada" that was 
premiered on Wood's 100th birthday last year), Jack Nicholson and Lily Tomlin 
-- all avid collectors of the master ceramist's lustrous art (a Wood bud vase 
goes for about $500, a 12-piece tea service for $25,000). 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a wonderful, spicy lady," says Electa Anderson, an event coordinator. 
Wood will receive the prestigious "Esteemed Living American Artist Award" from 
the archives, whose West Coast offices are at the Huntington Library in 
Pasadena. Last year's winner was David Hockney. For information, call (714) 
492-7087.

JACK SMITH: IN PRAISE OF FRIENDS, FINE FOOD, GOOD TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We drove up to Arrowhead a weekend ago to celebrate, among other things, my 
birthday. We were guests at the beautiful home of Steve and Nona Baer. Their 
other guests were Dick and June Turpin. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes about two hours, I believe, to drive from Los Angeles to Arrowhead. 
Finding a house in Arrowhead is something else. It took us about four hours, 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife was driving, which was not the only reason we were late, but it 
helped. She had two sheets of handwritten directions, taken over the phone. We 
stopped at a roadside cafe for lunch. Someone phoned the Baers and returned to 
the car to say, "It's only five minutes from here." 
</P>
<P>
 We thereupon started out on a two-hour search for the Baers' home. We stopped 
at a gas station and a post office for directions, both sets of which misled 
us. My wife gave me her directions and asked me to read them. Her handwriting 
was unreadable. She snatched the paper out of my hand and started reading while 
driving, which made me very nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a man at a gas station told us to go down the road exactly six miles 
and we would come to our turnoff. My wife checked her speedometer and started 
out. When we had gone six miles, there was no sign of the road. I pointed this 
out. She said, "Trust me." At 14 miles we found out we had taken a wrong turn.  
</P>
<P>
 I think the problem was that nobody would listen to me. We finally found the 
house more by chance than anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the Baers had laid in some vodka, and my wife made me a fix, 
which eased the tension. After a fine dinner prepared by our hostess, we 
settled into comfortable chairs to spend the evening in amiable talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Being all rather more than 50 years old, we naturally talked mostly about the 
President's health-care bill and our various medical experiences. Dick told a 
horrifying story about having his gall bladder sucked out through a tube. I 
tried to top it with a detailed description of my bypass operation and its 
aftermath of hallucination, but it was no contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were all in our 30s," I said, "would we be talking about our 
operations?" Not likely. 
</P>
<P>
 After debating the pros and cons of Medicare and other health plans, we segued 
into recollections of our various courtships, complete with cute meets and 
anguished turns. The Turpins and my wife and I were the products of blind 
dates, we confessed. It was altogether a most congenial conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 A barking dog kept my wife awake part of the night, but I had been trying a 
new pair of hearing aids, without much success, and didn't hear a thing -- 
perhaps because I had taken them out. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning Nona made pancakes, and then the women went into town to shop 
while we men watched the Raiders-Houston Oilers game on television. It was a 
thrilling one, with the Raiders winning on a two-point conversion in the final 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening at dinner, my friends toasted me with champagne and also toasted 
Steve, whose birthday was only two days away. That evening we talked about our 
children and grandchildren and, peripherally, politics.  
</P>
<P>
 It's curious that there we were, in the mountains, surrounded by towering 
pines, with the lake nearby, but we didn't go water-skiing or even walk through 
the woods. We ate, drank and talked. Now that's what I call being civilized. 
</P>
<P>
 It's impossible these days to have a conversation without discussing O.J. 
Simpson, but we dismissed the subject with only a few speculations, most of us 
agreeing that he would never be convicted.  
</P>
<P>
 At one point someone asked, "Would you vote for Clinton?" Obviously she meant 
would we vote for him if the election were that day. I don't remember that 
there were any definite answers; we all started off in different directions.  
</P>
<P>
 My thought was, yes, I would vote for Clinton. He is an intelligent, 
courageous man trying to do an almost impossible job under unrelenting attack. 
As for his alleged sexual peccadilloes, they were no worse than Thomas 
Jefferson's. Of course, the air was pretty thin up there. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't start back until after lunch Sunday. As we started off down the 
mountain, over the Rim of the World highway, my wife was at the wheel again. 
This time we had no trouble finding our way and were home in little more than 
two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 That night my wife and I watched a sex and violence movie, "Fatal Attraction," 
on television, about a happily married man who is seduced by a female demon. We 
were home again and back in our element. 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, I'd vote for Hillary, if it came to that.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; SLY AND OBLIQUE TALE TACKLES LOVE AND LOSS WITH HUMOR; IN 
SEARCH OF SNOW: A NOVEL BY LUIS ALBERTO URREA ; HARPERCOLLINS $20, 258 PAGES

 "Years ago," the prologue begins; barely two pages later, in typography that 
eliminates the indentation at the beginning of the paragraph, it ends: "McGurk 
and Bobo knew there wouldn't be a siren for hours." It's meant to draw you in. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Search of Snow" by Luis Alberto Urrea is the story of Mike McGurk; of his 
love and his loss and, you guessed it, his coming of age. The main action takes 
place in rural Arizona in the mid '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike and his dad, Turk, have been wandering around the Southwest since the kid 
was a little guy; Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, finally Arizona. Turk -- nee 
Wallace, but he won't own up to a name like that -- has a shaved head and a 
gunfighter mustache, a set of mechanic's skills, and a good ol' boy attitude. 
Besides his exaggerated code of manliness, all he's got is his boy, who very 
often seems just that, even though he's 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Turk periodically engages in illegal bare-knuckle fights, for the cash and his 
greater macho glory. They've been at their current gas station for a while, out 
in the middle of nowhere, mortgaged to the eyeballs. Mike finds himself 
wondering why the hell he's doing what he's doing, hating the desert and 
sporadically wishing his father were dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a paragraph enumerating the father's impressive list of failures, 
the chapter ends by saying: "In a family with no word for love, Mike couldn't 
easily explain why he had chosen to stay. But without him there, his father 
wouldn't have survived a week." All Mike knows is that some day he wants to see 
snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Turk's brother, Gideon, stops by; he's a successful Long Island doctor, 
ferrying his nubile, almost 20-year-old daughter, Lily, out to California to 
college. As different from Mike in age and temperament -- she's a college 
hipster -- as could be, they fall for each other. When she splits, the rest of 
the book is set in motion.  
</P>
<P>
 Turk decides to fight Ramses Castro, who is not only less than half Turk's 
age, but the demented grandson of his old Apache buddy, Delbert Sneezy. (Ramses 
once stripped and tied young Mike to a stake in the desert, when they were 
boys.) Warned by several people not to take on Ramses, Turk fights anyway and 
gets absolutely creamed. Turk goes down at the first punch and can't even 
remember what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobo Garcia, an ex-wrestler, offers the necessary counterpoint. (He was hired 
at the gas station by Turk the very same night.) Referred to as "21 the day he 
was born," Bobo is as wise as Mike is naive. He starts work at the Texaco and 
becomes friendly with Mike.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the fight with Ramses, Turk is still not right. A couple of weeks go by 
and the old man starts to unravel. He and his boy get drunk; they listen to 
records together. Turk does his best to reach out. Then he dies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike goes on a kind of grief rampage. He takes off across the desert drinking 
and imagining prehistoric oceans. Eventually he winds up at an Apache bar and 
is about to get whomped by Ramses Castro when Bobo saves him. 
</P>
<P>
 The two friends go to Turk's funeral, which is a sweet little comic 
masterpiece in itself: "It was a boneyard off the highway. Cowboys had been 
buried there, and their miserable little headstones were made out of cement, 
with crosses drawn in them with wet fingers and names scrawled around the 
designs. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 And lurking nearby? Ramses Castro, who by this point begins to seem like the 
reappearing coyote of Native American lore, the trickster character. 
</P>
<P>
 After the old man is deposited in the ground, they set off for Bobo's 
hometown, of McQueen, Ariz. There they find Bobo's aged mother and father, 
caged birds, dogs, a pair of grown-up twin girls and six little girls. This is 
in addition to grape arbors, gardens, voluminous amounts of food and love. Mike 
is convinced he's gone to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing lasts forever. After planning to give all his money to the 
Garcias, things start to go awry. One of the twins, it turns out, is pregnant 
by the son of the manager of the town's company store. The guy has just skipped 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobo and Mike, in a comic set piece that goes far beyond itself and involves 
the company store, a tow truck, a car belonging to the local sheriff and, of 
course, Ramses Castro, bring the action full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 They return it to the prologue that begins the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Urrea's first novel has the slender cast of a fable. It's more a question of 
control. The structure itself links the prologue to the end of the novel; it 
also leaves the last scene to, who else, Ramses Castro. Sly and oblique, this 
is a very, very funny book.

ZIMBABWE ONE OF FAMILY PLANNING'S SUCCESS STORIES; AFRICA: GOVERNMENT PROGRAM 
HAS CUT BIRTHRATE. SOON, ECONOMIC GROWTH MAY OUTPACE POPULATION GROWTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bathed in the smoke of a cooking fire inside a thatch-topped hut, Maureen Dick 
chatted softly in Shona as she carefully positioned her stethoscope and checked 
her patient's blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 After a moment, she smiled. All was well. She reached into her bulging green 
satchel and handed over a month's supply of birth control pills. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Mayata thanked her warmly. At 34, she has six children and wants no 
more. "It's difficult to look after them," she said. "The cost of living goes 
up each day." 
</P>
<P>
 Such scenes, once rare in rural Zimbabwe, are now common. The reason? Eight 
hundred women like Maureen Dick, and a handful of men, pedal bicycles into the 
far corners of the country each day, going from village to village and hut to 
hut to provide contraceptives and advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither dogs, lightning (a major cause of death here), flat tires nor wild 
animals (another occasional threat) stay these couriers from their appointed 
rounds. They reach an estimated 70% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 And their impact has been dramatic. Ten years ago, Zimbabwe had one of the 
fastest-growing populations in sub-Saharan Africa, the region with the world's 
fastest-growing population. Today, the nation of 11 million people boasts a 
declining birthrate and an expanding use of modern contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is Zimbabwe alone. Population experts say that family-planning programs 
are taking hold in a growing number of sub-Saharan African countries despite a 
grim regional backdrop of civil war, poverty, famine and the virtual collapse 
of nation-states in Zaire, Somalia and Liberia. 
</P>
<P>
 Countries such as Zimbabwe, Kenya, Botswana and Ghana, however, have all 
achieved varying degrees of population control. In the most promising places, 
like Zimbabwe, economic growth may soon outpace population growth. Ultimately, 
that may mean improved living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 That promise contrasts sharply with Nigeria, which has 95 million people. With 
an annual growth rate of more than 3.1% -- enough to double the population in 
about two decades -- Nigeria is in the midst of a relentless baby boom that is 
exacerbating myriad social and political woes at a time when the economy has 
been battered by shrinking oil revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the continent's few family-planning success stories will be in 
the spotlight when world attention turns to Cairo this week for the landmark 
International Conference on Population and Development. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Zimbabwe's program is far from perfect. The average family now has 
5.4 children, but that's down from 6.7. And while the growth rate is believed 
to have fallen sharply, it averaged about 3% in the 1980s. More than half the 
population is under 18. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. Alex Zinanga, executive director of the Zimbabwe Family Planning 
Council, is optimistic. He said the most recent countrywide study, in 1988, 
showed that 43% of reproductive-age women used contraceptives. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's far higher than for the rest of Africa," he said. He expects a survey 
now under way to find even higher contraceptive use. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, Zimbabwe had a head start. It has a relatively high literacy 
rate, especially for women; good roads and communications, and a large, 
urbanized middle class. Religious opposition has not been a major factor. 
</P>
<P>
 But as elsewhere in Africa, Zimbabwe's black leaders were highly suspicious of 
Western-style family-planning programs after they won independence in 1980 from 
the white-minority regime that ran the country, formerly known as Rhodesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked at it as genocide, as a way of controlling the black population," 
Zinanga said. "The government was very much against it at first." 
</P>
<P>
 But President Robert Mugabe quickly realized he could not achieve his 
socialist aims if population growth was unchecked. Ironically, he since has 
dumped many of his discredited socialist policies but has kept the 
family-planning program. And the government support has been key. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicycle brigade of community workers, for example, is trained and paid by 
the government. And the government buys its own oral contraceptives rather than 
relying on foreign donors. The program also is listed as a line item in the 
national budget rather than being a stepchild of another department. 
</P>
<P>
 Official policy includes other inducements as well. Parents get tax deductions 
only for the first four children, for example. And women who work for the 
government are given time off to breast-feed only the first four children. 
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS crisis has added to the urgency. Zimbabwe has been hit hard by the 
epidemic, and the family-planning program now includes a "male motivation" 
campaign to persuade men to use condoms and husbands to limit their families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's recognized that reproductive decisions here are made by men," said 
Roxana Rogers, family-planning administrator for the U.S. Agency for 
International Development in Harare, the capital. "So if you just target your 
campaign at women, which is the natural tendency, you're missing the 
decision-makers." 
</P>
<P>
 Religion has not affected the program. Only about 10% of the population is 
Roman Catholic, and far fewer are Muslim. Pope John Paul II visited in 1989, 
but Zinanga -- who, like Mugabe, is Catholic -- said his visit had no impact on 
the family-planning program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Religion is not something people are crazy about," he said. "There's a lot of 
Catholics, after church, they go and get their tubes tied or pick up their 
pills." 
</P>
<P>
 Local Catholic leaders hope to change that. They issued a letter to clergy 
last week denouncing the Cairo conference as an "assault on the integrity of 
the family" and demanding that the government fight "corrosive foreign 
influences and ideologies." 
</P>
<P>
 But Father Oskar Wermter, spokesman for the Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops' 
Conference, concedes that he's fighting a losing battle. Birth control "has 
been largely accepted by large parts of the population," he said. "I must be 
honest. It is very controversial even here within the church." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, out at the dusty village of Nyamadzawo, 30 miles east of Harare, 
government family-planning videos are shown at St. Mary's, the local church. 
And one of the regular parishioners, Patricia Piroro, a 31-year-old mother of 
four, is also one of Dick's regular family-planning clients. 
</P>
<P>
 On a warm and sunny afternoon last week, Piroro walked home, moving slowly and 
gracefully down the rutted road with a pail of water on her head and a child on 
her hip, to be greeted by Dick, who smiled and murmured a greeting. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, the examination was inside the kitchen, a traditional round house 
with mud-brick walls and a thatched roof. A brilliant shaft of light pierced 
the tiny window, and black cooking pots perched atop a fire in the center of 
the floor. The two women sat side by side on maize bags spread on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 After Dick had checked her patient's blood pressure, they talked about whether 
Piroro should switch from oral contraceptives to Norplant implants or Depo 
Provera injections at a nearby clinic. Because her family income is less than 
$50 a month, she qualifies for free contraceptives; others pay a token sum of 
15 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroro said she still wasn't sure. But clutching her youngest child, a toddler 
with a torn shirt and runny nose, she announced a far more basic decision. "I 
think four children is enough," she said simply.

EX-CONVICTS STUCK IN JERICHO ARE POWDER KEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The painful process of peacemaking between Israelis and Palestinians has taken 
a bizarre and potentially dangerous twist in this tiny test-case site for 
Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Since June, Israel has dumped in Jericho about 520 Palestinians released from 
its prisons. The ex-convicts have been ordered to stay in Jericho until either 
their sentences expire or Palestinian self-rule is extended to the rest of the 
West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The move has, in effect, turned Jericho, a hardscrabble town of 16,000, into a 
giant halfway house. The town, struggling to provide everyday services for 
permanent residents, offers meager shelter and very little else to the men, 
some of whom were serving life sentences for killing suspected Palestinian 
collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is possible that even more released prisoners -- there are still about 
5,500 in Israeli jails, according to the Israeli army -- will be brought to 
Jericho in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "That prospect is open," confirmed Saeb Erekat, municipal affairs minister for 
the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the prisoners became so embittered by their living conditions that 
they recently issued a statement threatening to rebel against both the 
Palestinian Authority and the Israelis and to kill Israelis driving through 
Jericho unless the Palestinian Authority improves their conditions and offers 
them vocational training. Saturday night, about 300 released prisoners briefly 
blocked the main road leading from Jerusalem through Jericho, the road used by 
many Israelis traveling from Jerusalem to northern Israel. The former prisoners 
reportedly burned tires and chanted slogans, demanding that they be allowed to 
return to their homes. No one was injured during the demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 The dumping of hardened criminals in their midst not only has angered local 
residents but has outraged Palestinians across the political spectrum, who 
accuse Israel of reneging on promises to free prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis never give any confidence-building measures without making it 
backfire on us," said Erekat, who is headquartered in Jericho. "We want the 
prisoners released, but we don't want them put in a town like Jericho, which 
lacks any infrastructure to handle them." 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the disputed issues between Israel and the Palestinians, the fate of 
prisoners is the most sensitive one, charged with emotion on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 For Palestinians, the release of prisoners is considered an essential step 
toward ending the state of war between the two peoples and getting on with 
building peace. Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, 
struggling to show skeptical Palestinians in the territories that his deal with 
Israel is yielding concrete results, is pushing hard for Israel to release all 
prisoners, from all factions, regardless of the crimes they have committed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's government treats the prisoners as a 
security threat, a political embarrassment and a source of leverage in other 
negotiations with Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Releasing the prisoners to Jericho seemed to offer a reasonable solution for 
the domestic political problem Rabin faced in releasing thousands of convicts. 
They would be released but would not be allowed back to their homes in the West 
Bank, where thousands of Jewish settlers live. And they would become the 
responsibility of the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israel, torn between the need to demonstrate goodwill and the difficulty in 
releasing prisoners, some of whom were previously extremely dangerous people, 
chose a sort of middle road," wrote Gideon Levy, a commentator for the Hebrew 
newspaper Haaretz. Levy called the release to Jericho "Israel's distorted way 
of showing goodwill." 
</P>
<P>
 "The gesture was not perceived as a (goodwill) gesture," Levy wrote. "And in 
its place a new abscess is spreading, the abscess of those locked up in 
Jericho." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Rabin increased the tension when he told his Cabinet that the 
government would not discuss the release of more prisoners until Arafat agreed 
to grant amnesty to Palestinians who had collaborated with Israel during its 
27-year occupation. Since the PLO took over Jericho and the Gaza Strip, about 
12 suspected collaborators have been murdered in the West Bank in areas outside 
the PLO's control. But the government insists that Arafat could stop the 
killings if he wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 The prisoners are also leverage for the Israelis as they try to pressure 
Arafat into cracking down on Hamas, the militant Islamic organization that 
continues to challenge Arafat's authority in Gaza and Jericho and to carry out 
lethal attacks on Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Israelis have also put other conditions on the continued release of 
prisoners that infuriate Palestinians. They refuse to let out those who will 
not sign a pledge to renounce violence. They release members of Fatah, the 
largest PLO faction, while holding back members of rival organizations. They 
refuse to release any Palestinians convicted of killing Jewish Israelis, 
although they do release Palestinians who have killed suspected Palestinian 
collaborators. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is the situation of our brothers," said Abdel Nasser 
Seiraffi, 30, a Palestinian released to Jericho on Aug. 19 after serving 10 
years of a 15-year sentence for the attempted murder of a suspected 
collaborator. "All of them should be released and have full freedom, not like 
us. This is not full freedom. The life here is not different from the prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Seiraffi sat on one of six bunk beds that crowd the room he says he shares 
with as many as 10 other former prisoners each night. The unfinished YMCA 
building that has become home for 200 of the released prisoners is organized 
much the way prison was for them, with men sharing rooms and forming committees 
to clean common areas and to lobby the authority for better conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Seiraffi disavows those who threatened to kill if their conditions are not 
improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ask only to solve our problem in a human way," he said. "We said that the 
pressure will one day cause an explosion; we did not say how we will react when 
that explosion occurs." 
</P>
<P>
 Seiraffi and other former prisoners said they are far less interested in 
receiving vocational training than in being allowed to go home to their 
families in the West Bank.

 "What do I feel, living here? I feel nothing, there is no feeling anymore," 
said Rashid Kanaher, 20, who served three years of a six-year sentence for 
trying to stab an Israeli soldier. "This is just a big prison. We are away from 
our families still, away from our homes." 
</P>
<P>
 The released prisoners say they received 1,500 Israeli shekels, or about $500, 
from the Palestinian Authority upon their release as "welcome" money and are 
supposed to receive monthly stipends of about $265 from the authority as long 
as they are trapped in Jericho. But few of the men seemed to believe that the 
authority, with its serious budget deficit, will be able to make good on that 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs, Seiraffi and others said, are almost impossible for them to come by in 
Jericho, where unemployment among residents is already high. And so they spend 
their days in their rooms, hiding from the town's sweltering summer heat, 
talking, playing cards and waiting for visits from family members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel our life is not stable, and we can't concentrate on anything serious, 
on reading books or trying to educate ourselves as we did in prison. The most 
we can do here is read a newspaper. We feel like we are living in exile here," 
Seiraffi said.

CONTROVERSIAL BUSINESSMAN LINKED TO REP. TUCKER CASE; INQUIRY: PROMOTER WITH 
CHECKERED PAST SPARKED BRIBERY PROBE, SOURCES SAY. COMPTON LEADER HAS DENIED 
CHARGES. 
</P>

<P>
 John Macardican came to Compton with lofty promises. The sleek incinerator he 
wanted to build would transform garbage to energy, put Compton on the cutting 
edge of waste technology and create jobs for a city in dire need of an economic 
boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the San Gabriel Valley businessman prompted a federal probe resulting 
in the indictment of a congressman and an investigation of Compton officials, 
according to sources. It was Macardican, the sources said, who turned in Rep. 
Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton). 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, the popular young hero of a politically prominent Compton family, 
allegedly solicited and received $30,000 in bribes and demanded another 
$250,000 to support the waste-to-energy proposal while serving as the city's 
mayor. He has proclaimed his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Macardican, 56, a private man with a mixed record of business success, was no 
newcomer to Compton. Some there now wonder why, in light of his checkered 
financial past, city officials considered doing business with him. Around town 
he is known somewhat derisively as the man who once wanted to place a revolving 
restaurant atop an earlier trash facility he promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, he and about a dozen associates were sued for allegedly bilking the 
state out of $7.4 million in bonds used to finance a Compton garbage facility 
that went bankrupt. Macardican had to pay a $130,000 judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other lawsuits, including one by a former attorney seeking $250,000 
in unpaid legal fees and another by a posh hotel that claimed Macardican failed 
to pay $12,900 for his daughter's wedding reception. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of the lawsuits against him, any government institution or body that 
did a check on him would realize that he was not a reliable person to do 
business with," said attorney Richard S. E. Johns, who sued Macardican on 
behalf of the California Pollution Control Financing Authority for his role in 
the bond debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, at Tucker's urging, the Compton City Council granted Macardican 
an exclusive negotiating agreement in July, 1992, to develop an ambitious 
facility of the type that experts say had long been proven unworkable. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more than one strong advocate for the waste-to-energy project in 
Compton. Some now wonder about the sudden appearance -- and disappearance -- of 
a man who called himself Stan Bailey, and who curried the favor of local 
officials while claiming to work for Macardican. There is speculation that 
Bailey was working undercover for the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Macardican, who has apparently done well with some of his businesses, was 
president of Compton Energy Systems Inc. when he approached Compton officials 
in December, 1989, with the idea of reviving a waste-to-energy project he had 
first proposed in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker allegedly solicited the first of seven bribes from Macardican's company 
in June, 1991, according to a federal indictment returned in August. Tucker is 
also accused of failing to report the money on his federal income tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials have declined to discuss details of the investigation that 
led to the indictment. Macardican did not respond to numerous phone calls and 
visits to his home and business over a three-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with the case said it was the result of a two-year undercover 
investigation run out of the FBI's Long Beach office after Macardican 
complained that Compton officials were soliciting bribes from him. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources, the FBI sent an undercover agent to pose as a 
representative of Macardican's company. The agent, accompanied by company 
officials, held numerous meetings with Tucker and other Compton officials, 
offering them the bribes they demanded, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have acquired campaign records of seven current and former elected 
officials who held office during the period the alleged bribes took place, 
according to a copy of a federal subpoena obtained by The Times. They are 
Tucker, City Clerk Charles Davis, Mayor Omar Bradley, Councilwoman Jane D. 
Robbins and former council members Patricia Moore, Bernice Woods and Maxcy D. 
Filer. 
</P>
<P>
 The council debated Macardican's project during a contentious meeting July 28, 
1992, three days before Tucker allegedly received the final bribe. Community 
activists complained that the issue had been placed on the agenda without prior 
public discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 3-2, with Tucker, Moore and Robbins arguing that the project 
would bring jobs to the city and help reduce the need for landfills. Tucker, 
who introduced the proposal, declined to be interviewed. Moore and Robbins said 
they relied heavily on the advice of city staff, adding that had they known of 
Macardican's checkered business history they would have reconsidered. 
</P>
<P>
 The only staff document was a five-paragraph statement written by City Manager 
Howard Caldwell supporting the agreement. Caldwell did not respond to numerous 
phone calls over a two-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts say the kind of project Macardican promoted had already become a 
thing of the past because of tougher pollution standards and public opposition 
to incinerators. "The door pretty much closed on those type facilities (in 
Southern California) by the mid-'80s," said Barclay Hudson, a consultant who 
teaches a UCLA extension course on solid waste management. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, however, the vote mattered little. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 11 -- the day that Tucker was indicted -- the man who sources say 
turned in the congressman formally withdrew his application. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hand-delivered letter to Compton's planning department, Macardican 
offered no explanation. He simply asked to end "all related proceedings, 
effective immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Macardican is described by former associates and others as smart, 
self-confident and often brash. Some say his aggressive style has sometimes 
gotten him in trouble. He has operated several waste-related enterprises that 
are no longer in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say he tries to protect himself by hiding his assets. "Nothing is in 
his name," attorney Johns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Property records show that his sprawling ranch-style estate in an exclusive 
Arcadia neighborhood is listed in his mother's name, and another expensive 
house in Arcadia is owned by his wife, Joyce. A third home, a seaside condo in 
a gated Laguna Beach neighborhood, is owned by one of his businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 His principal business, Commercial Waste Paper Co. in South El Monte, was 
incorporated in 1952. Associates say that Macardican took over the company from 
his father and that he became interested in waste-to-energy conversion in the 
early 1980s after reading about it in a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his dealings in Compton date back to July, 1979, when he and nine 
other businessmen formed Solid Waste Transporters Inc., few people in town are 
able, or willing, to recall much about him. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Macardican and the others received $7.4 million in low-interest bonds 
from the state Pollution Control Financing Authority to buy and operate a 
facility where garbage was dumped and separated for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the lending agreement, Macardican and his partners were to pay back the 
loan with revenue earned from charging trash haulers to leave their refuse at 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1984, the corporation filed for bankruptcy and defaulted on the loan 
-- the only default on publicly held bonds in the 21-year history of the 
authority. In the 1985 federal lawsuit, attorneys alleged that Macardican and 
his partners never intended to pay back the loan and conspired from the 
beginning to pocket the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "They saw the state as a trough that they could feed from," said Johns, who 
claims that Macardican and the others made off with $30,000 to $50,000 apiece. 
"They sat around in meetings and repeatedly agreed that they were not going to 
honor those guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
 But one of Macardican's former attorneys called him a "white knight" who tried 
to keep the corporation afloat against overwhelming odds. The business was the 
victim of overly optimistic economic projections, said Kevin Stapleton, who 
represented Macardican in an unrelated case in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has collected about $6.6 million from the defendants and expects to 
receive the balance this month. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time Solid Waste Transporters was going under in 1984, Macardican faced 
a public outcry in Compton against his first waste-to-energy incinerator 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents were upset that the incinerator was to be built next to a 
residential neighborhood. But, a decade later, it is the restaurant proposal 
that they remember most. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we laughed so hard the walls almost shook," recalled Compton 
resident William Coleman, 69, who helped lead the fight against the proposal. 
"Then, as the idea sank in, people were angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Another opponent, ex-council member Filer, helped vote down that project in 
1984 when he was a member of the City Council. So he was surprised when 
Macardican showed up at his law office in September, 1991, asking him to be his 
lawyer in five civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on cloud nine," recalled Filer, who at the time had only recently 
passed the bar. "I could see the money coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 But he was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 After persuading the Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena to settle for 
$2,000 of the $12,900 it had sought, and saving Macardican another $40,000 by 
settling a lease dispute, Filer said Macardican still owes him $5,000 in legal 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Filer suspects that Macardican approached him to win favor with his son, who 
was then a member of the Compton school board. Macardican was interested in 
property owned by the school district as a possible site for his incinerator. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged debt owed Filer is small change compared to that claimed by 
another former Macardican attorney, Thomas L. Wilson. He filed a lawsuit in 
Orange County Superior Court demanding $250,000 in unpaid legal fees. The case 
is to be heard in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Although much controversy remains about Macardican in Compton, even more 
intrigue surrounds the man who called himself Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Those familiar with Bailey mention him in hushed tones and insist on 
anonymity. Some are convinced that the tall, well-dressed man who suddenly 
appeared in the spring of 1991 claiming to represent Macardican was really a 
federal agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among those ambivalent about Tucker's innocence, there is suspicion that 
Bailey was part of a sting operation aimed at black officials -- something that 
federal prosecutors have vehemently denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Steven G. Madyson declined to discuss Bailey, saying he 
could neither confirm nor deny the identity of anyone presumably associated 
with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey presented himself as a consultant from Las Vegas who had worked with 
Macardican previously and who had been asked by Macardican to help win support 
for the Compton trash facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "He appeared out of nowhere," said one former Compton official. "None of us 
had ever heard of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say he diligently cultivated good relations with officials, dropping 
off red roses and candy at City Hall, attending community dinners and donating 
turkeys and canned hams to a city-sponsored program for needy families. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1991, sources say, a large number of Compton movers and shakers 
attended a gala reception at what was believed to be Bailey's spacious 
oceanfront penthouse in Long Beach. According to some who were there, the guest 
list included Macardican, then-Councilwoman Moore, City Clerk Davis and 
then-council candidate Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Sanders, the widow of former Compton city treasurer Wesley Sanders, 
recalls the lavish party for a special reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Having attended with her husband and Bradley, Sanders said she viewed Bailey 
with suspicion from the moment he approached her husband at the party 
"pretending to be a long-lost cousin." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had never heard of him and yet he was rattling off names of relatives we 
hadn't seen in years," recalled Sanders, who was running for the City Council 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 As they were about to leave, she said, Bailey reached into his coat pocket and 
pulled out two sealed envelopes. He gave one to her and another to Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the car, she said, she opened her envelope and found $200 in cash. 
Bradley then opened his envelope and found $100. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Wait a minute! You can't take that. You don't even know who this guy is,' " 
she recalled her husband saying. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said they circled the block, and while she and Bradley stayed in the 
car, her husband went back inside and returned the money, asking for bank 
checks that could be properly reported on campaign forms. State law prohibits 
individual cash contributions of more than $99. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bradley did not refute Sanders' account, he declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Bailey) made up some excuse about not having his checkbook or something," 
Sanders said. "We had nothing more to do with him after that. In fact, my 
husband called (soon-to-be elected Mayor) Walter (Tucker III) to warn him to 
stay clear of the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey was active in community affairs until the summer of 1993. "Then," said 
one source, "he just sort of disappeared." 
</P>

U.S. BLACKS SEEK A PART OF THEIR HISTORY IN BRAZIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorney Ray Williams heard about it from the shoeshine man in his Newark, 
N.J., office building. 
</P>
<P>
 Laureen Greene, marketing director for a New York City college, had seen a 
small ad in Upscale, a monthly magazine aimed at African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanya Stewart, project manager for the Chicago Housing Authority, got the word 
from her boss. 
</P>
<P>
 So, unlike most first-time tourists to Brazil, each bypassed the famous 
beaches of Rio de Janeiro, the restaurants and night life of Sao Paulo and the 
northeastern resorts of Recife and Fortaleza and came to Salvador, a city 
rarely mentioned in the United States as a vacation destination. 
</P>
<P>
 They came in search of a lot more than a good time. They were looking for part 
of their history, their culture and a sense of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the year is over, about 5,000 African Americans will have made a 
similar sojourn to this city of 2 million for exactly those reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly, Salvador, Brazil's first capital, the entry point for millions of 
African slaves during the 16th and 17th centuries and a city steeped in 
Afro-Brazilian culture and history, has become a cultural Mecca for many 
African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of black people coming here from America has really been 
increasing," said reception manager Helvecio Alves at Hotel da Bahia, checking 
in still more African Americans just two days after nearly 200 had left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, our culture is originally from Africa -- the food, the religion, the 
rhythm of the music. They come for that. Of all the tourists, nobody seems to 
enjoy it as much as they do. They always say they are coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Sipho Bellinger of Lexington, Mass., and Nailah Randall of Pasadena were two 
who returned this year. They met here two years ago, married a year later and 
celebrated their first anniversary by returning to Cachoeira, a nearby village 
where they first encountered each other while at an annual Afro-Brazilian 
commemorative ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador and the surrounding state of Bahia are known to vacationers for the 
same attractions that bring tourists to many other parts of Brazil. "Ah, 
Bahia," said Maria Amelia Santana, a librarian at the U.S. Consulate in Rio de 
Janeiro. "Beautiful beaches and beautiful women." 
</P>
<P>
 But while those are the lures for thousands of Germans, Italians, Spanish and 
French who make up the preponderance of Salvador's tourist trade, they are not 
what brings African Americans to this coastal city. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely through word of mouth, they have heard about Boa Morte (the Good 
Death), an annual religious ceremony and festival commemorating members of a 
women's organization that since slavery has struggled to preserve the culture; 
or capoeira , a martial-arts form that Colonial-era slaves disguised as a 
ritualistic, acrobatic dance; or candomble , the distinctly Brazilian religion 
that combines Catholicism and the deities of Nigeria and Angola. 
</P>
<P>
 Or they know of Pelourinho, a Salvadoran neighborhood that is the cultural 
heartbeat of the country for African Brazilians, or of the variety of food and 
dress similar to those in Angola and other parts of western Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bahia is the common denominator for people of African descent," said James 
Lee, a Rockefeller Foundation scholar and lecturer who has lived in Brazil off 
and on for 19 years. "All of them can come to Bahia and find something that is 
reminiscent of their own culture." 
</P>
<P>
 That is what brought James Wright, a Boeing technical instructor originally 
from Georgia but now living in Saudi Arabia, to Salvador with his wife, Lillie. 
They attended a jazz festival here. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we only came because it was in Bahia," he said. "There are jazz festivals 
all over Europe which are closer and cheaper to get to, but we wanted to 
experience the culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Adams, director of resident programs for the Chicago Housing Authority 
and Tanya Stewart's boss, was officially there for an Afro-Brazilian women's 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I really came for the Boa Morte festival," she said. "This is my third 
time here, and I'm thoroughly intrigued with the sisters of the Boa Morte. I'm 
also very interested in the black diaspora. They have more cultural survival 
here than anywhere in the diaspora. You might see some traces in other places, 
but mostly our cultural memory was wiped out." 
</P>
<P>
 Aldon Morris, a sociology professor at Northwestern University, was there as 
part of his studies of black political movements, "but I came here precisely 
because I had heard about Bahia." 
</P>
<P>
 He brought his wife, Kim, a social worker in Chicago's Cook County Jail, and 
their two children. "I've never been to Africa, but when I walk down the 
streets, see the clothes, the shops, the food, the art, I feel like I'm in 
Africa here," Kim Morris said. "And the people just seem to embrace us like 
we're one. That's what I'd expect in Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not what usually happens when African Americans travel to Africa, 
according to some who have visited there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, Africans tend to look down on African Americans," said Egerton 
Bullock, 34, a former Wall Street bond trader who spent three months in Bahia. 
"I was in the Ivory Coast for a month, and many (there) would rather not deal 
with African Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Many African Americans have had similar experiences in Africa, and they have 
recounted them to others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think African Americans are received here better here than on the 
continent," said Williams, the attorney whose Brazilian shoeshine man advised 
him to make the trip. "We have more in common. 
</P>
<P>
 "We share a slave history and, even more important, I think there's more of an 
effort to preserve the culture. I picked up a lot of history that I just didn't 
realize. Walking down the streets, I could just imagine the people coming off 
the slave ships. The culture and tradition that's here is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 The African American connection to Bahia was formed in earnest nearly 20 years 
ago. In 1976, LINKS Inc., an organization of African American women, held a 
conference in Salvador. Two years later, academics from the Atlanta University 
Center organized a gathering that brought a diverse group of 500 to Bahia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We brought down all kinds of people -- artists, filmmakers, historians, 
politicians, sociologists," Samella Lewis, an art historian, retired Scripps 
College professor and one of the key figures at that conference, said from her 
Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to take people who could advance the culture in terms of bring 
information back to African Americans. We thought it was important to go there, 
since Brazil has the largest black population outside of Nigeria and the 
cultural center of that black population is Bahia." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest and most recent push came in 1988, when the National Conference of 
Artists, a coalition of black painters, sculptors, art historians and 
photographers, held a convention in Bahia to commemorate the 100th anniversary 
of Brazil's abolition of slavery. 
</P>
<P>
 "That put a lot of artists who had been looking at Africa in touch here, and 
they began to see how much African retention is here," said Paul Goodnight, a 
Boston painter. "They went back to the United States and began spreading that 
message." 
</P>
<P>
 Bahians have also reached out to embrace African Americans. During last year's 
Carnival, the raucous pre-Lenten celebration, samba schools in Bahia chose as 
the theme for their celebration the African American fight for freedom and 
adorned their costumes with pictures of Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey, Martin Luther 
King Jr. and Fannie Lou Hamer. 
</P>
<P>
 What many African Americans are beginning to realize, Lee said, is that the 
black cultural experience in this hemisphere is as vital and important as the 
cultures in Africa and that Bahia is a linchpin between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bahia is the only real sense of where the culture from Africa landed and 
became a New World culture. After nearly 500 years, people are beginning to 
learn that there's a culture here in the New World that's important. . . ," Lee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they are beginning to realize that there are certain things that are 
unique and special and only could have come out of our experiences here. . . . 
And if you want to explore the two, Bahia is the place."

RESCUE OF BOY, 2, PLAYED LIKE THRILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By K. CONNIE KANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After living an episode worthy of an international espionage thriller, the 
Arcadia woman who was reunited with her 2-year-old son said Sunday that the 
bold rescue mission "was the scariest thing" she had ever gone through. 
</P>
<P>
 Wired with microphones and tape recorders, Michelle Al-Nasseri, 23, had waited 
at London's Heathrow Airport while Scotland Yard agents and former Green Berets 
coaxed her son from her estranged husband's arms, minutes after the man's plane 
had landed. 
</P>
<P>
 Monitored by agents -- some of whom she had hired -- and waiting for her Iraqi 
husband to arrive from Jordan on Friday afternoon, Michelle Al-Nasseri said, 
she felt like a character in a suspense film. 
</P>
<P>
 "During those fleeting moments when I could think, I felt like I was watching 
a movie of someone else," the paralegal said by telephone from London. "I had 
never imagined something like this happening to me." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she had her son back, six weeks after he was taken, her husband 
was in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitham Khalid Al-Nasseri, 33, who had taken their son to Iraq without her 
knowledge July 21, had been lured to London by a ruse: phone calls and her 
assurances that she still loved him and was ready to reconcile. 
</P>
<P>
 Al-Nasseri, who was being held Sunday in an undisclosed British jail without 
bail, was to be arraigned in London today. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Al-Nasseri and their son, Laith Adam, are expected to return to Los 
Angeles on Tuesday, ending a nightmare that began six weeks ago, when the 
father said he was taking Laith camping in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Al-Nasseri ultimately helped to put together a rescue mission that 
involved the former Green Berets commandos, Scotland Yard, the U.S. Embassy in 
London, the FBI, Arcadia police and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours after she realized that her husband had cleared out his condo and 
run off with their son, she called Arcadia police. Although the police notified 
the FBI, Michelle Al-Nasseri said it took dozens of phone calls to get action. 
</P>
<P>
 She asked the Los Angeles County district attorney's office to extradite her 
husband. But she said she was told that the chances were slim because Iraq has 
no diplomatic relations with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote letters to California's two U.S. senators, Los Angeles Mayor Richard 
Riordan, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Sen. Boxer responded, she said, and just days after Boxer's office 
contacted the district attorney's office, things started to move. 
</P>
<P>
 She was granted sole custody, giving her the legal standing to try to get her 
son back. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her elder sister hired Corporate Training Unlimited, an 
international security organization in North Carolina operated by former Green 
Berets. The group protects corporate executives working in perilous parts of 
the world and has also undertaken international child custody rescues. 
</P>
<P>
 The security team hatched a plan to get the boy and his father to London. On 
Sept. 1, Michelle Al-Nasseri arrived in London, accompanied by Judy Feeney, 
who, with her husband, founded the Green Beret security firm. 
</P>
<P>
 They were met by Scotland Yard officials and a representative of the American 
Embassy and briefed. By the next day, after another briefing, the anxious 
mother was wired with two tape recorders and escorted to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Jordan, a former Green Beret commando made sure that her husband 
and son had boarded their plane. 
</P>
<P>
 As the surveillance team watched, Michelle Al-Nasseri waited for her husband 
-- shaking so hard that she could not grip her coffee cup -- at the meeting 
place that they had arranged: the American Airlines lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after the plane landed, the husband and son were escorted to a private 
room, where the agents showed the toddler something to reassure him: a photo of 
his favorite cousin, and a familiar toy -- a Power Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking out of the private room with his toy and photo, he was smiling, his 
mother said. His first words as she hugged him were, "I want to go see 
Michael," the cousin in the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Al-Nasseri said she was thankful that she didn't have to face her 
husband. But she said she is saddened that their love had to end this way. 
</P>
<P>
 They met five years ago, when she was 18 and a waitress at Sizzler's in 
Alhambra, and he was a civil engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just out of Temple City High School, she wanted to travel and see the world. 
But Al-Nasseri, who was almost 10 years her senior, wooed her assiduously. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so debonair and so romantic," she said Sunday. "And he was 
persistent." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, she moved in with him, over her family's objections. Eighteen 
months later, their son was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Their life together was stormy. Al-Nasseri, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was 
critical of American society and its values and often talked about returning to 
Iraq. But his wife did not want to leave, nor could she agree to take their son 
from his comfortable life to war-torn Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 She thought that marriage might improve things, so she prevailed upon him to 
marry her 18 months ago. But things went from bad to worse. In May, she filed 
for divorce, and moved in with her widowed mother in Arcadia, while he remained 
in their Pasadena condo. 
</P>
<P>
 They shared custody of the boy, so when her husband said that he was taking 
the boy camping in Santa Barbara for a weekend in July, she thought nothing of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Al-Nasseri said she has spent more than $15,000 so far to recover her 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that two weeks ago, just days after taking out a $15,000 loan, she 
was fired from the Arcadia law firm where she worked for losing so much work 
time -- time she spent on finding her son. 
</P>
<P>
 But she isn't discouraged, she said. "I have my son, and I have the support of 
my family and friends, who have guided me thus far," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite everything, she had no regrets about the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my son to show for it," she said. "This little boy in front of me is 
so beautiful. I don't hate my husband. I just hate what he did."

HOPES WANE FOR STALLED CUBA TALKS; MIGRATION: A THIRD DAY OF NEGOTIATIONS FAILS 
TO BRING PROGRESS IN THE REFUGEE CRISIS. U.S. NEGOTIATOR POINTS TO 'SUBSTANTIAL 
GAPS' BETWEEN THE TWO NATIONS.

<P>
 A sense of possible failure engulfed the U.S.-Cuban talks Sunday as the 
Clinton Administration acknowledged that the negotiations could end without 
agreement on a formula to stop the streams of Cuban rafters intent on finding 
refuge in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 After a third day of talks ended without a settlement, State Department 
spokesman David Johnson, in a carefully worded statement cleared by his 
superiors in Washington, said: "There are substantial gaps between us, and I 
would caution against any premature speculation that an agreement will be 
reached." 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides, who have been negotiating alternately in the offices of their 
missions to the United Nations, will meet again today in the Cuban mission in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson did not detail the nature of the gaps between the two sides, but the 
United States has offered to grant more than 20,000 legal visas to Cubans every 
year if President Fidel Castro's police stop the embarrassing exodus of 
refugees toward the United States. The Cuban negotiators evidently want more 
visas than that -- some unofficial reports put the number higher than 100,000 
-- and they may also be holding out for concessions on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. negotiators, led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Michael Skol, 
presented their proposal in writing to the Cubans on Friday. After 
consultations with Havana on Saturday, the Cuban negotiators, led by Ricardo 
Alarcon, the president of the National Assembly and a former foreign minister, 
presented their reply and counterproposals in writing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban response clearly disappointed the Americans, and three hours of 
talks at the U.S. mission -- including separate conferences of the two 
delegations to hone their positions -- failed to close the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have throughout the negotiations, scores of demonstrators gathered 
Sunday on the sidewalk outside the U.S. mission, located across the street from 
U.N. headquarters. Security was tight, but the protest was peaceful as 
demonstrators chanted insults about Castro and his negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon has continually insisted that it is impossible to solve the problem of 
unauthorized Cuban emigration without discussing the trade embargo imposed by 
the United States 32 years ago. But he has also said that if the United States 
refuses to discuss anything but emigration, Cuba is prepared to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakup of the talks without an agreement would force President Clinton to 
search again for a way to stem the tide of Cuban refugees. In hopes of doing so 
last month, he reversed longstanding U.S. policy and refused to allow the 
rafters automatic asylum in the United States. Instead, Clinton ordered U.S. 
vessels to pick up the refugees and detain them in camps at the U.S. naval base 
at Guantanamo Bay, on the eastern tip of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now more than 15,000 Cubans in these camps, located alongside other 
detention camps housing thousands of Haitian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has received some limited relief from the government of Panama, which 
gave permission Sunday for up to 10,000 Cuban boat people to stay on portions 
of U.S. bases along the Panama Canal. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. military personnel are building four tent cities for the refugees who, 
according to Panamanian Foreign Minister Gabriel Lewis Galindo, will be allowed 
to stay in Panama for no more than six months. A U.S. official said the first 
Cuban refugees are expected sometime after the middle of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Radio Marti, the station operated by the U.S. government, broadcast 
warnings urging Cubans not to attempt the dangerous flight by raft into the 
Florida Straits. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people have lost their lives at sea, drowning in the treacherous 
currents, risking attack by sharks," the station's warnings said. "It is a 
death sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cubans were not leaving at the earlier pace of more than 2,000 a day, 
the exodus was substantial. The U.S. Coast Guard, which picked up 850 Cuban 
refugees on Saturday, had pulled 1,069 rafters out of the sea by Sunday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Two boats attempting to smuggle more than 60 Cubans into the United States 
were intercepted late Saturday night by the Coast Guard. Five Cuban Americans 
living in southern Florida were arrested and will be turned over to the U.S. 
Border Patrol, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 One group of 22 Cubans managed Saturday to slip through the Coast Guard's 
patrolling web of 41 cutters and 30 aircraft. They used a compass to navigate a 
homemade 20-foot fishing boat to Dry Tortugas, a tiny island national park 68 
miles west of Key West. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafters who reach the United States are sent to a camp at Port Isabel, Tex., 
where they can apply for residency. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cairo, where he had traveled for an international population conference, 
Vice President Al Gore discounted a military solution to the dilemma. Asked why 
the Clinton Administration was threatening an invasion of Haiti but not Cuba, 
he replied that they represent a "very different set of circumstances, 
historically different . . . apples and oranges." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also told interviewers on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" that the 
Administration wants a change in government in Cuba and that Castro has a worse 
record on human rights than the military leaders of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 On another program, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson joined other critics in 
calling on Clinton to take steps to loosen the trade embargo against Cuba.

PRESIDENT WHO? DEMOCRATS SHUN CAMPAIGN HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hey, Democratic candidate, do you want President Clinton or Vice President Al 
Gore to come campaign for you this fall? 
</P>
<P>
 "Only if they're coming to endorse my opponent," said freshman Democratic Rep. 
Don Johnson of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't intend to ask President Clinton to come out here," said Wyoming 
Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathy Karpan. "Why be cute about it? Of 
course he's a liability." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather kiss (Republican congressional candidate) Zach Wamp on the lips at 
noon in front of the courthouse than have to campaign with Clinton right now," 
said a Tennessee Democratic Party leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House appears to have gotten the message. In preparing its strategy 
for this fall's midterm elections, the President's political advisers have 
decided that he will respect the wishes of candidates in many parts of the 
country and stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 Sensitive to the possibility that Clinton's low poll ratings could hurt 
Democratic congressional candidates, advisers say Clinton's chief role between 
now and Nov. 8 will be to employ his proven fund-raising skills in selected 
states while articulating a broad vision of the party's principles and its 
direction for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, the President will also be trying to put some distance between 
himself and his own Administration, seeking a platform above the bloody 
legislative trenches where he has waged so many battles over crime, health care 
and the budget. He plans to spend the next two months looking forward, not 
back, asking Americans to think about where their nation might go rather than 
about the zigzag course it has just completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, he will attempt to reprise the "new Democrat" who campaigned on 
pledges to reduce the size of government, reform the way Congress operates, end 
the current welfare system and break the shackles of partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy is a recognition that while the party in power traditionally 
loses some congressional seats in a midterm election, this year is shaping up 
as an opportunity for a major daylight heist by the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Coelho, the new de facto head of the Democratic Party, concedes that 
Democrats will likely lose 18 to 22 seats in the House, potentially giving the 
GOP a larger presence in the lower chamber than at any time since Dwight D. 
Eisenhower was President. Coelho expects the Democrats to lose at least three 
seats in the Senate, although a net loss of seven Senate seats -- giving 
Republicans a majority there -- is not implausible. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic leaders insist that this fall's elections are not a referendum on 
Clinton and the Democratic agenda, but rather a collection of discrete local 
races. While they concede that Clinton may be a liability in some parts of the 
country -- the South, Southwest, the Plains and the Mountain states are 
considered virtual "no-fly" zones for the President -- he remains a big draw in 
the Northeast and the West, particularly in California. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP leaders are doing all they can, however, to portray the anticipated 
results of the elections as a vote of no confidence in Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best political environment for Republicans I have ever seen, and 
the reason is Bill Clinton and his policies," said Republican National 
Committee Chairman Haley Barbour. "He has reminded people of what they like 
about the Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the chilly climate, what's a President to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Political analyst Stuart Rothenberg said that Clinton ought to confine his 
participation in the campaigns to fund-raising efforts. "If I were Dave McCurdy 
(a conservative Democratic congressman running for Senate in Oklahoma), I'd buy 
Clinton a one-way ticket to Boston and have him stay up there until November." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican pollster Frank Luntz agrees. "If I were a Democratic candidate, I 
would invite the President in for a candlelight fund-raiser -- after all the 
local news deadlines -- and make it too dark for photographers and just light 
enough for donors to sign their checks. Then I'd get him out of town fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Clinton's own pollster, Stanley B. Greenberg, is advising Democratic 
candidates nationwide to emphasize their independence and downplay their ties 
to Clinton and the national Democratic Party. If they are attacked for their 
votes for Clinton programs, Greenberg advised in a memo that surfaced last 
month, they should respond: "I didn't do it for him. I did it for you. " 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic National Committee Chairman David Wilhelm warns that candidates 
who turn their back on the President and the party's accomplishments risk 
making a difficult situation worse. Wilhelm argues that the Democrats have a 
solid record to run on and a fat target in Republican obstructionism to run 
against. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Democrats run defensive, reactive campaigns and allow Republicans to 
define who they are and who we are, then we're going to be in trouble," Wilhelm 
said this week. "But if Democrats seize the agenda, there is so much positive 
to talk about, and that works in any district in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 California, with its critical Senate and gubernatorial races, will be the 
White House's priority this fall, according to political aides. The national 
Democratic Party is pouring $1 million into the state for voter registration 
and get-out-the-vote efforts, the most it has ever spent in a single state in a 
non-presidential election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will headline a Kathleen Brown fund-raiser in Los Angeles on Sept. 18 
and probably will visit the state again before the Nov. 8 election. He has 
appeared twice on behalf of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is in a close reelection 
fight with Republican Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to be in San 
Francisco and San Diego Thursday and Friday on behalf of Brown while Gore will 
be campaigning for Feinstein on Sept. 23 in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also is expected to make appearances in New York to support the 
reelection bid of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and in Pennsylvania to try to bolster 
Sen. Harris Wofford, a stalwart supporter of Clinton on health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm and White House aides said Clinton will appear locally as well as on a 
national stage to trumpet the accomplishments of his first two years in office, 
take credit for a robust economy and offer a broad vision of where he intends 
to lead the country in his remaining time in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House is preparing a series of speeches -- beginning Friday at a 
Baptist convention in New Orleans -- for Clinton to review his record and lay 
out the themes that will undergird the rest of his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The speeches will attempt to detach Clinton from Congress and from specific 
legislation. He will talk about universal health care as a national imperative, 
not a Clinton policy initiative. He will talk about crime as a national shame, 
not as a piece of Democrat-engineered legislation. He will talk about values, 
about community, about caring, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 Centrist Democrats have been encouraging Clinton to take a more 
confrontational stance toward Congress and seek to rise above the partisan 
political "static" that so confuses and infuriates voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Al From, head of the moderate Democratic Leadership Council, wrote a long memo 
to Clinton last month urging him to return to his centrist roots and renew his 
pledges to the "forgotten middle class." 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally what I suggested is that he has to reframe the debates in a new 
context, to get out of the partisan straitjacket that has dominated us since 
1981," From said in an interview. "What happened to him in the past two years 
was that instead of reframing the challenges for the 1990s, he has been taking 
the Democratic side in the partisan battles of the 1980s." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbour dismisses efforts by Clinton to reclaim the political center and rise 
above the fray with appeals on values. He says they ring hollow coming from a 
man who campaigns from the middle but governs from the left, who speaks of a 
return to old-fashioned values but who never lived them. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the political season looks like a fairly dismal time for Democrats. 
Still, loyalists say Clinton and simple good fortune have given them a 
defensible record and a growing economy to run on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is foolish for Democrats to cut and run from their President," said Paul 
Begala, a White House political consultant. "One, people want their President 
to succeed. Number two, Clinton stands for change. That is a good thing in a 
country where 62% voted for change in the last presidential election. Three, 
nobody likes a coward. And four, this race is going to be run on their own 
merits; you have to stand and deliver on your own, just like every election."

COLUMN ONE; LABOR WARS HIT HOME IN DECATUR; CAUGHT IN THE CROSS-FIRE OF THREE 
MAJOR DISPUTES, THE ILLINOIS PRAIRIE CITY IS AN UNWITTING SYMBOL, SOME SAY 
VICTIM, OF THE GLOBAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN BIG BUSINESS AND BIG UNIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On this city's northeast side, where strip shopping centers give way to 
smokestacks and cornfields, 22nd Street is the demarcation line for a global 
battle on three fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 It's where 4,000 workers -- 7% of the local work force -- have set up picket 
lines to protest their treatment by three multinational employers: one 
Japanese, one British and one American. 
</P>
<P>
 On this 100th anniversary of Labor Day, Decatur -- a farming and manufacturing 
center that calls itself the "Pride of the Prairie" -- stands as unwitting 
symbol, and some say victim, of the long and evolving struggle between big 
business and big labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are on strike against Peoria-based Caterpillar Inc. and Japanese-owned 
Bridgestone/Firestone Inc., while their soul mates at A.E. Staley Manufacturing 
Co. -- a home-grown concern bought several years ago by the British 
conglomerate Tate & Lyle -- have been locked out for 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a triple jolt this central Illinois town of 90,000 people -- just now 
recovering from the '80s downsizing and the last recession -- doesn't need, and 
the international economic forces at work have triggered some predictable 
xenophobia: Picket signs bash both the British and the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 The angry pickets and mass demonstrations may seem a throwback in an era of 
reputedly weak unionism. And the actual disputes today are less about wages 
than about workplace changes that corporations argue must be made to make 
Decatur's products competitive in today's tough global markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But labor is making a stand in Decatur. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our solidarity against theirs," said Larry Solomon, president of United 
Auto Workers Local 751, which struck Caterpillar in June. "If we fall here, you 
will feel the waves to California and beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 And although Decatur has a long labor history and a memory of bitter strikes, 
the current struggle is creating greater community discord than most residents 
can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growing polarization," said Mayor Eric Brechnitz. "This is an epic 
struggle in which both sides are dug in and we are suffering as a result." 
</P>
<P>
 The confluence of labor strife in Decatur is largely happenstance, local 
officials say. Two of the disputes are nationwide actions, and this happens to 
be the only U.S. city with both a Caterpillar and Bridgestone/Firestone plant. 
</P>
<P>
 But labor experts say that what is unfolding in Decatur represents a microcosm 
of the bigger drama being played out by labor and management on a global scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may be a coincidence you have three major strikes involving three 
multinational companies in the same town," said Michael LeRoy, labor professor 
at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "But there are synergies 
developing between these disputes." 
</P>
<P>
 The overlapping labor actions have driven union solidarity to unusual lengths. 
The confluence of interests was displayed at a recent coalition meeting of 
about 25 members of the auto, rubber and paper workers union, as well as 
transportation and teachers union officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Such meetings, rare in the past, are held weekly. There is talk about media 
coverage. There is talk about fund raising and helping families make ends meet. 
And there is talk about court injunctions, demonstrations and political action. 
</P>
<P>
 A UAW bargainer outlines a plan to change Decatur's form of government. He 
proposes a petition drive to replace the City Council with aldermen, hoping it 
would be easier to elect officials from districts more sympathetic to labor. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a collaboration instigated in part by Ray Rogers, a jeans-wearing, 
charismatic labor strategist from New York who is blamed by some local 
officials for the strident tone of the disputes. Hired by the Staley union 
local, he is a controversial figure in labor circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mainstream union leaders complain that Rogers uses labor disputes to push 
a social-reform agenda. But he has helped to galvanize workers here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the workers to understand that they have more tools in their 
arsenal," Rogers said. Staley 
</P>
<P>
 When Tate & Lyle acquired Staley in 1988 for $1.5 billion, the international 
sugar conglomerate was buying a Decatur institution. Augustus Eugene Staley, an 
evangelist and merchant, founded the company in 1906 to turn the corn produced 
by nearby farms into starch and syrup. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's plant just northeast of downtown grew into a huge industrial 
complex, a maze of 100 buildings spread over 450 acres and connected by pipes 
and tanks that cook and process tons of corn a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The paternalistic Staley was proud of the work he provided Decatur and in 1929 
built a monument to his success -- a 14-story headquarters made of Indiana 
limestone topped with a gold-crowned dome. It was dubbed the "castle in the 
cornfields." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the castle is under siege. Members of the United Paperworkers 
International Union, Local 7837, have been picketing since June, 1993, when 
Staley's new owners locked them out. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor dispute was touched off the previous year when Staley proposed a 
radical new contract with major work-rule changes. The company wanted to 
implement rotating 12-hour shifts, cut health care benefits and ultimately 
eliminate two-thirds of the 760-member work force. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Decatur facility is profitable, Staley officials said the changes 
were needed to make the plant as efficient as its other U.S. factories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't asking for anything that is not standard in the industry," said J. 
Patrick Mahon, Staley's executive vice president. "This isn't about wages but 
about having a plant that is competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 When the union balked, Staley unilaterally imposed its contract. The union 
retaliated with a "work-to-rule" strategy inside the plant, scrapping 
labor-management teamwork efforts and slowing production. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1993, the union held a one-day strike over alleged plant safety 
violations. A week later, the company locked the workers out, citing vandalism 
of equipment and products. 
</P>
<P>
 Staley quickly hired about 300 temporary replacement workers. The plant has 
been operating with non-union workers and supervisors. The company says 
production, safety and quality are at all-time highs. 
</P>
<P>
 The lockout has hit the union members hard. The local provides them just $60 a 
week; if they take another job or collect unemployment they get nothing. About 
100 workers have left town or taken permanent jobs elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see the strain in people's faces," said Local 7837 President David 
Watts. "There are lots of divorces. People are losing homes and cars." 
</P>
<P>
 George Austin, 47, was divorced and began drinking heavily in the wake of the 
strike. He occasionally mows lawns to make a few dollars and collects food 
stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been the worst year of my life," Austin said, sitting on the picket 
line outside Staley's main entrance. "I thought my job was rock solid. It's 
disheartening." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite 60 meetings between the union and company since 1992, there has been 
no progress in the talks. Caterpillar 
</P>
<P>
 At the Caterpillar plant, about 1,800 workers walked out in June when the 
United Auto Workers called the second nationwide strike in three years against 
the world's largest maker of earthmoving equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The new strike is a vestige of the previous one, an especially bitter 
five-month walkout in which the outcome was widely perceived as a big setback 
for the UAW and organized labor. Caterpillar insisted on a cheaper labor 
agreement than the industry-standard pact signed at Deere & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike ended when Caterpillar threatened to permanently replace the union 
members with other workers. Since then, the UAW has filed about 100 charges of 
unfair labor practices against the company. Those charges became the basis for 
the new strike against 12 plants in three states. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar has continued to operate its plants with supervisors, some new 
hires and union members who have crossed the picket lines. But the Decatur 
plant has had fewer workers cross the line than any other Caterpillar plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress failed to pass a bill this summer that would ban the use of permanent 
replacements, and the threat of being permanently replaced still hangs over the 
Caterpillar workers, most of whom are in their 40s and 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar continues to advertise for new workers and is waging a major 
public relations campaign. One local television spot features a replacement 
worker who talks glowingly about the need for labor-management teamwork and 
global competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar says its main competitor isn't Deere -- which has a much narrower 
product line and is not a major exporter -- but Komatsu Ltd. Therefore, it must 
bring its costs in line with foreign competitors like Komatsu, said Cat 
spokesman Terry Thorntenson. 
</P>
<P>
 But the UAW's Solomon said: "They are trying to make union a dirty word." 
Bridgestone/Firestone 
</P>
<P>
 On the picket line outside the Bridgestone/Firestone plant, members of United 
Rubber Workers Local 713 wave to passing drivers who honk their horns in 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 12, the URW struck five Bridgestone/Firestone facilities when the 
union refused to accept a contract that proposed significant changes in work 
rules and cutbacks in benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The URW has also struck facilities operated by Sumitomo Corp., Yokohama Rubber 
Co. and Pirelli in the United States. But the strike against 
Bridgestone/Firestone, the world's leading tire producer, is the biggest and 
potentially most damaging. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes against a company that has boasted of good labor-management 
relations. After it purchased Firestone in 1989 for $2.6 billion, relations 
were so good that the company didn't resist the URW's organization of two new 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an irony here that a Japanese company world-renowned for model 
labor-management relations is involved in a hardball confrontational dispute 
with an American union," said Harley Shaiken, a visiting labor professor at UC 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's sudden aggressiveness is not lost on the striking workers. A 
sign posted outside the aging, red-brick factory reads: "1941, Japan Attacks 
Pearl Harbor; July 12, 1994, Bridgestone/Firestone Attacks American Workers." 
</P>
<P>
 As in the Caterpillar strike, a major issue is pattern bargaining, the 
establishment of similar labor agreements across whole industries. The URW 
wanted Bridgestone/Firestone to sign a contract similar to one negotiated with 
Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. But Bridgestone/Firestone claims that its U.S. 
plants are less efficient than its competitors' and wants a contract to help it 
narrow the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Goodyear-type settlement would severely damage our competitive position," 
said Charles Ramsey, Bridgestone/Firestone vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 But the union said the offer -- asking for 12-hour rotating shifts, health 
care co-payments, and reduced vacation time and overtime -- is unacceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no end to what they are trying to take away," said URW Local 713 
President Roger Gates, who represents 1,270 striking workers. 
</P>
<P>
 For Decatur, the labor strife has been about as welcome as a prairie tornado. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is just recovering from the devastation of the '80s, when recession 
and foreign competition racked the Rust Belt and Decatur lost a third of its 
factory jobs and nearly 10% of its population. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend has reversed itself in recent years as the city has attracted new 
light-manufacturing and high-tech industry. Still, the area's jobless rate 
stands at about 7.5%, compared with less than 6% for all of Illinois. And city 
officials fear that the labor strife will curb business expansion and dissuade 
other companies from moving here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a negative which could impact our ability to attract new business to the 
community," said Richard Lutovsky, president of the Decatur Metro Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants say the disputes -- carving a weekly payroll of up to $3 million out 
of the economy -- have also begun to hurt businesses. "Purchases of big-ticket 
items are being put on hold," said Ed Markgraf, manager of the local Sears 
store. "I'm cutting back inventory for the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the opening of the Decatur Celebration, an annual summer festival, was 
disrupted when striking workers repeatedly interrupted a speech by the mayor, a 
stockbroker whom union members regard as anti-union. Brechnitz also complains 
that the city's police department has been stretched thin by the labor actions. 
</P>
<P>
 While many residents are sympathetic to the workers, others are perplexed that 
they would risk jobs that pay $17 an hour, among the area's highest wages. 
"Some wives don't understand why their husbands are out there," Markgraf said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tensions are visible in the billboards and picket signs -- some planted in 
residential lawns -- placed throughout town. In mid-July, about 120 union 
workers, carrying U.S. flags and wearing red T-shirts, demonstrated in a staid, 
upper-middle-class neighborhood where many Staley executives live. 
</P>
<P>
 A demonstration at Staley in early June resulted in the arrest of 47 union 
supporters, including a local minister. At another rally, police sprayed the 
crowd with pepper gas to maintain control. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are more demonstrations to come. At last week's joint meeting of 
leaders from the three unions, they huddled with Rogers and George Lakey, an 
expert in civil disobedience tactics. The union members talked of their 
concerns about being arrested in peaceful demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials worry about what the unions may have up their sleeve for Labor 
Day. The unions have said only that they plan to march en masse in red shirts 
down Main Street to the statue of Abraham Lincoln outside the county 
courthouse. But given the militancy of recent demonstrations, uneasiness is 
understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a chemistry for disorder to get out of hand here," said LeRoy.

LOCKHEED PLANS LEAVE STAFF, CITY SHELLSHOCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Conversations in the cafeteria at Lockheed Corp.'s headquarters were quieter, 
less jocular last week as employees considered where they would be working next 
year, if they will be working at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually there are more people," said Brenda Forman, the company's director of 
marketing policy, as she looked around the sunny dining room at the few full 
tables. "Maybe they're out for a drink with their friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed and Martin Marietta Corp. announced a week ago that they would merge, 
creating a defense-industry behemoth with $23 billion in annual sales. The 
combined Lockheed Martin will be based in Bethesda, Md., Martin Marietta's 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 As the top executives await government antitrust approval and the Calabasas 
community braces for the departure, the 250 mid-level managers and their 
support staff consider their fate. These are the well-heeled members of the 
work force; they wait not with picket signs and angry news conferences but with 
controlled trepidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know whether I'll have a job or not," Forman said. "If you stack up 
what the cold, hard facts are, you can get pretty scared. But the cold, hard 
facts don't always tell the whole story." 
</P>
<P>
 The story for the employees and the community they will leave behind began on 
Aug. 30, when Lockheed Chairman Daniel M. Tellep wrote a letter to the 
employees saying the company would leave Calabasas and some of its jobs when 
Lockheed relocates. To be sure, many of the employees had already heard the 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot guarantee to each of you that you can retain your job," Tellep 
wrote. "Our commitment is to be open in communicating with you, and our 
objective is to be fair and equitable with people whose jobs may be 
eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 What the chairman also said, in subsequent memos and conferences, is that 
roughly half of the management-level jobs will come from each company. Support 
staff, he has said, could come from the Maryland area "simply because of 
logistical considerations." A small satellite group will remain in the area, 
but at a new site. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobs that are secure are the 10 executive positions at the very top, with 
Tellep at the helm. The rest are up for grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 When the employees talk about Maryland, they do so guardedly. First, there is 
the worry about getting the invitation to stay on; then there is the worry 
about whether to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles A. Lileikis, who is in charge of purchasing for the Calabasas 
facility, said he looked up weather statistics for Maryland when he heard about 
the news. Forty-five inches a year of rain, he reported to the lunch table, 
winter highs of 33 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Bethesda is going to compare to what we have here," he said. 
"You look out and you have the trees, the sunshine. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," he added, "we'll go if we get asked." 
</P>
<P>
 Some will not be asked. Judy Lubin, an administrative secretary and a single 
mother supporting two children, ages 19 and 22, said she is anticipating being 
out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm at a level where they can replace me and my skills anyplace across the 
nation," she said. "Frankly, now I feel abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Lockheed employees are nervous about what may be in store for each of 
them individually, some Calabasas business people are disheartened about what 
is certain -- that a population of well-paid workers is leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lockheed headquarters is non-polluting, it keeps a low profile, it 
contributes to the city's tax base, and best of all, opens its wallet when 
asked by various needy community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really sad, because they are not just financial benefactors, but they 
have been involved personally in the community," said Arlene Bernholtz, 
executive assistant of the Calabasas Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Reinike, Lockheed's community relations manager, was a president of 
the Calabasas Chamber of Commerce in 1988 and still sits on the board. She is 
also one of the founders of the Old Town/Calabasas Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinike has seen to it that Lockheed helps sponsor local fairs and 
fund-raisers, and helps influence local advisory boards that seek to preserve a 
quiet, small-town Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 The hallway outside the cafeteria is hung with testaments to Lockheed's local 
role. The L.A. chapter of the Black MBA Assn. honored the company for its 
efforts, as did Cal Lutheran University, the Ventura County NAACP and the local 
branch of the United Way, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, for example, Lockheed contributed more than $3.5 million to arts, 
civic and education programs in California -- dollars that charity groups fear 
will head east with the corporation. In addition, Lileikis said the firm spends 
almost $5 million annually in Southern California for headquarters operations. 
Those dollars are spent on everything from cafeteria food to landscaping, from 
printing services to pens and paper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eighty percent of it comes from local suppliers," Lileikis said. "It will be 
done locally over there for the most part. It's all going to move." 
</P>
<P>
 California has already suffered its biggest Lockheed convulsions. During World 
War II the corporation employed 90,000 in Burbank, where it has no presence 
now. Just four years ago, it announced it would move 9,500 Burbank jobs to 
Marietta, Ga., and eliminate the balance of 4,500 Burbank jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 20,000 Lockheed jobs left in California, including 3,000 at Palmdale's 
"Skunk Works" facility, the 250 corporate jobs heading out might seem a paltry 
concern -- this is no replay of the dark days two years ago when General Motors 
closed its Van Nuys plant, putting 2,600 people out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not inconsequential to merchants in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Just down the street from the four-story brick building, Danny Javaherian 
heard the news about the impending move and decided he had made a bad 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Javaherian has spent many mornings and afternoons over the past 7 1/2 years 
ferrying Lockheed employees to and from work after leaving their cars to be 
serviced at his Calabasas Unocal 76 gas station. They were loyal customers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, he bought new gas pumps. All the shiny new machines take credit 
and ATM cards right at the service island, he noted proudly, saving the 
customer the trip to the window. Now he thinks that upgrade might not have been 
such a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a lot of business for us," he said, shaking his head. "It's sad. It 
hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Country Inn at Calabasas, the sales manager said, is likely to see a 10% 
drop in business. The hotel, less than a mile from the headquarters, has housed 
Lockheed employees from around the country as well as people in town to do 
business with the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $20,000 in utility taxes the city will lose, said Calabasas 
City Manager Charles Cate, it will also miss the $200,000 in bed taxes that the 
inn generated from Lockheed business. 
</P>
<P>
 The headmaster at the private Calabasas Viewpoint School, Bob Dworkoski, said 
his school has enrolled Lockheed children in the past and will miss the 
potential students of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Bryman, manager of the Cosmos Grill and Rotisserie, said he does not worry 
so much about a drop in business as about the community's declining spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Others tried put the departure into perspective. Lileikis, the Lockheed 
purchasing director, said he has tried to be realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something like this would happen eventually," he said matter-of-factly. "You 
do something about your business base and consolidate or we would die out 
anyway." 
</P>

AT 25, INTERNET READIES MOVE INTO FREE MARKET; TECHNOLOGY: QUASI-PUBLIC 
COMPUTER NETWORK TO BE PRIVATIZED. SOME ARE LEERY, OTHERS SEE OPPORTUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 25 years, from its founding by the Defense Department as a tool for the 
scientific elite to its recent astounding growth like some ferocious strain of 
fiber-optic ivy, the amorphous computer network known as the Internet has been 
anchored financially and technologically by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 'Net celebrates its silver anniversary this month, the National Science 
Foundation -- which has been spending upward of $10 million a year 
administering the central "backbone" of the Internet -- is preparing to 
relinquish the world's closest thing to an information highway to the vagaries 
of the free market. 
</P>
<P>
 Many longtime users believe the move is crucial to the growth of the network. 
People can still find and exchange an enormous amount of data and chat cheaply 
over thousands of miles, but the Internet is becoming strained by the influx of 
the curious and the commercial into what was once the preserve of researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 But others fear that pieces of the Internet could split apart as profit 
replaces sharing as the motive linking it all together. As the network of 
networks becomes central to commerce and begins to touch the lives of ordinary 
citizens, the stakes in its responsible operation have grown exponentially. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be like the Copernican revolution, when people suddenly 
realized the universe did not have a center," said Bill Washburn, who heads a 
consortium of smaller networks that is one of many entities hoping to profit 
from the new Internet order. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Internet is anarchy, it's a form of chaos, and with the disappearance of 
the NSF network, that chaotic quality will become more immediate and more 
evident to a lot of people who have been able to ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome, the quasi-public network has arrived at a watershed as 
it begins the first stages of official privatization. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an immense change affecting millions of people and tens of thousands 
of individual networks," says National Science Foundation networking chief 
Stephen Wolff, who has spearheaded the move. "But the marketplace is there now, 
and there's no point in having the federal government competing with the 
private sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the foundation's withdrawal is in one sense symbolic, since the 
network has been de facto open to businesses for years. More than half of the 
Internet's rapid growth this year is accounted for by commercial traffic, much 
of which technically conflicts with the agency's rule that it be used for 
research only. 
</P>
<P>
 This "acceptable use" policy, as it is known, had become something of a 
conundrum for the foundation -- essentially unenforceable, it nonetheless 
impeded the network's growth by making some firms leery of joining it. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the investment in the network's infrastructure by dozens of private 
companies like Cerfnet and Netcom -- go-betweens that link customers to the 
Internet for a fee -- far outweighs the government's contribution. And as the 
market for providing business and consumer Internet access expanded, there was 
pressure on the government to make way for private enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the members of Washburn's group, the Commercial Internet 
Exchange, have a standard agreement to exchange traffic with one another 
without using the science foundation backbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, much of what drives the demand for access are the resources and the 
promise of connection with others around the globe made possible by the 
foundation's core network. There are 3 million computers and 38,000 networks on 
the Internet. The nerve center knows the name and address of every one of them, 
and how to route a packet of data between any two. And now it is dissolving 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's plan, set in motion over a year ago, is just beginning to 
take effect. By the end of this year, if all goes well, each of the 400 billion 
bytes of data that flow daily over the foundation's high-speed fiber pathway 
(each byte is equal to roughly one letter of the alphabet) will have found 
another, privately owned route to its destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Now telephone companies and firms that run regional data networks linking 
customers to the Internet are rushing to capture the business created by the 
government's abdication. It promises to be a competitive free-for-all. 
</P>
<P>
 But if all 20 million Internet users -- a population that is increasing at a 
rate of nearly 20% a month -- are to continue to be able to exchange electronic 
mail, then all those private carriers, including direct competitors like 
Sprint, AT&T and MCI, must forge exchange agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the National Science Foundation is helping to fund several neutral 
switching points -- informally referred to as "demilitarized zones" where data 
are handed off between networks -- no one is compelled to connect to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're private businesses -- it's up to them to decide what they want to do. 
Nothing is guaranteed," says Jon Postel, a USC professor who participated in 
the birth of the network in 1969 as a graduate student and is working with the 
National Science Foundation to oversee the transition. "Everybody knows they 
have to do it, but no one wants to commit yet." 
</P>
<P>
 William Schrader, president of Performance Systems International, a large 
Internet service provider in Reston, Va., for example, says he may choose not 
to connect to the government-sponsored switches because of concerns over the 
security and privacy of his customers' data. Instead, he might forge his own 
private links with other carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad the government is finally getting out of our business," Schrader 
says. "And I would like there to be no bifurcation of the Internet -- but there 
is that risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Such talk strikes fear in the heart of someone like Bill Emery, a professor of 
aerospace engineering at the University of Colorado, who relies daily on his 
Internet connection to send and receive data from weather satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't live without my connections, and I'm afraid during some of the 
uncertainties when other people are doing the wiring I won't be able to get 
it," Emery says. "I don't think the Internet is going to go away, but we're 
going to live through some pain, and it's not going to be this sort of 
fundamental right that it's been in the past. Things are going to cost more." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for the academic world, long addicted to e-mail and the ability to 
search faraway databases without leaving campus, the change will probably mean 
an end to what for most has been unlimited free on-line access. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, says Wolff, is part of the point: "The whole idea is to reduce the 
network to the status of the telephone. The Internet is one of the costs of 
doing business, and universities will provide for it the same way they provide 
for desks and chairs and roses in front of the president's house." 
</P>
<P>
 The costs are hard to predict. University connection costs, subsidized by the 
government, range between $20,000 and $50,000 a year, and the National Science 
Foundation estimates that costs will rise only a few thousand dollars at a 
school like UCLA in a heavily populated area. But at Colorado, there have been 
estimates that the service could cost an additional $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Users who have piggybacked on the government's backbone service may also see 
connection costs rise. Rural areas and small businesses that must purchase 
their own connections would probably be hit the hardest. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the biggest concern among Internet users is that the telephone 
companies and other firms that take over the networks will find a way to start 
charging for data by the packet, in much the same way they charge for normal 
phone calls by the minute. More than anything, that would discourage 
exploration and end cheap access to communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is that we're looking at a multitude of options for the long 
term," says Robert Collet, networking director at Sprint, which counts among 
its data network customers several large corporations and the Philippines. 
"Right now we're in the world of flat monthly rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff allows for the possibility that somewhere down the line, regulation may 
be necessary. But he says the price pinch, if there is one, will not hit 
academics immediately. For the next three years, the National Science 
Foundation will continue to partially subsidize several of the regional 
networks that connect universities and research institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the research community is counting on a plan to resurrect the past 
with a smaller, more exclusive network boasting superior high-speed technology. 
It will initially be reserved for the research elite represented by the 
nation's National Science Foundation-funded supercomputing centers. 
</P>
<P>
 If, in the end, the whole point of the Internet is how it connects people 
rather than computers and fiber, then the biggest changes may come as its new 
underpinnings reshape the network's traditionally homogenous sociology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're evolving past being one organism," said Jim Pepin, executive director 
of computing services at USC. "The Internet has become weighted down by its own 
weight. Now there's a whole set of new social dynamics."

CANDIDATES START STRETCH RUN IN PIVOTAL ELECTION; POLITICS: INTENSE MARATHON

 For Pete Wilson and Kathleen Brown, for Dianne Feinstein and Mike Huffington, 
California's general election campaign began the day after the June 7 primary 
with a nonstop barrage of biting television commercials, vituperative faxes and 
lots of bus rides. 
</P>
<P>
 But Labor Day is the traditional beginning of the campaign for most voters, 
and this year it triggers a final 63-day stretch leading to the Nov. 8 election 
that could have far-reaching consequences for California and a direct impact on 
President Clinton's prospects for reelection in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Already intense, the TV ads, attacks and speechmaking will be stepped up even 
more. 
</P>

 "Most people can only take about two full months of politics," said Larry 
Sabato, a University of Virginia political analyst, "so Labor Day is the 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of reasons to see 1994 as a watershed election year in 
California. Consider the stakes: 
</P>
<P>
 * The nation's most intensely watched governor's race pits incumbent 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson and Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown. The 
winner will emerge as a national political star and could play a huge role in 
the Presidential elections two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 * A pivotal U.S. Senate race will test the ability of a neophyte California 
congressman, who recently moved here from Texas, to parlay his massive personal 
wealth into a U.S. Senate seat over a seasoned female political pro. 
</P>
<P>
 * Proposition 187, the so-called "Save Our State" measure designed to deny 
state benefits to illegal immigrants, is triggering an emotional debate about 
California's historic reliance on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 With national health care on hold in Congress, the ballot proposal for a 
comprehensive state-run insurance system contained in Proposition 186 also 
could become an intense focus of debate. 
</P>
<P>
 * A lineup of candidates, unknown to most voters, are running for statewide 
offices below the level of governor, establishing the next generation of 
California political leadership. Other than Wilson, only one incumbent is 
seeking reelection to the office that he now holds, Republican Atty. Gen. Dan 
Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 * California will fill 52 congressional seats and elect all 80 members of the 
state Assembly and half of the 40-member Senate. For many state lawmakers, this 
is the last year that they can seek reelection under the term limits initiative 
passed in 1990. This year and 1996 will provide unprecedented turnover in the 
Legislature's makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful emotions unlocked by Proposition 187, the measure on illegal 
immigration, may wash over many of the other races and is sure to trigger a 
clash between Wilson and Brown before long. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, Wilson has blamed the flow of illegal immigrants from 
Mexico with costing the state billions of dollars for such services as 
emergency health care and schooling. Illegal immigration teams with crime as 
Wilson's top issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has not yet formally endorsed Proposition 187, but Dan Schnur, his 
campaign press secretary, said, "We believe that both the 'three-strikes' 
initiative and the SOS initiative are going to be very helpful to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Such issues often motivate conservative Republicans to go to the polls and 
they probably would cast their ballots for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown opposes Proposition 187, primarily because it would deny public 
schooling to illegal immigrant children. The Brown campaign is prepared to 
counterattack with Wilson's record as a U.S. senator, when he sponsored 
legislation to allow non-citizens to work on farms in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immigration is an important issue," a Brown strategist said, but compared to 
crime, it is "much less significant and decisive an issue in the context of our 
campaign, ultimately." 
</P>
<P>
 One big question this year is just how much politics people will take when 
they have the option of becoming absorbed in the judicial drama of the decade 
in the O.J. Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson trial is scheduled to start Sept. 26 and probably will run through 
Election Day. Political managers were concerned that the trial would drain 
television news coverage that might otherwise be devoted to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller suggested to Simpson trial Judge Lance 
A. Ito that he suspend the trial Nov. 7 and 8 so that prospective voters, in a 
sense, could be encouraged to briefly pay attention to the campaign and turn 
out to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The June primary drew a record-low 38% of California's registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito rejected Miller's proposal. But this past week Santa Cruz County election 
officials proposed opening the polls on the Saturday and Sunday before the 
election to give people a greater opportunity to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The big prize at stake this year, of course, is the governorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is the first-term state treasurer who is seeking to become the third 
member of her family to be elected California's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brown election, along with the return of U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein to 
Washington for a full term, would put women in the state's top three political 
jobs: governor and both U.S. Senate seats. The third is Sen. Barbara Boxer, 
whose term runs through 1998. All are Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson win would make him something of a national GOP hero. He would have 
resuscitated himself from virtual political extinction, coming back from the 
worst job performance ratings of any modern California governor, to win 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wilson would have done so over a telegenic female candidate with family 
tradition, Westside political glamour and a prodigious ability to raise 
campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say a victory would propel Wilson into the running for the 1996 
Republican presidential nomination, or make him a logical vice presidential 
running mate. But Wilson has insisted that he is not interested in seeking 
national office. 
</P>
<P>
 And the likely election of a Democrat as lieutenant governor would make it 
difficult for Wilson to walk away from Sacramento and hand the governorship 
over to the Democrats, most experts believe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate contest, Feinstein once was considered a walkaway winner over 
Rep. Mike Huffington of Santa Barbara, who has spent more than $10 million of 
his own fortune attempting to seize the seat. The Senate race is being watched 
across the country, Sabato said, in part because it conceivably could determine 
which party will control the Senate in the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But also, he said, "The Huffington model is either going to become the wave of 
the future or crash on the beach, one way or the other. Is this race going to 
prove that money is the be-all and end-all?" 
</P>
<P>
 The first major independent opinion polls of the fall season won't be out 
until later this month, but most California political analysts believe that the 
governor's race is a virtual tossup going into the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 That in itself is a dramatic showing for Wilson. A year ago, he trailed Brown 
by as much as 20 percentage points in the polls and was being treated almost 
like a lame duck. Brown was being hailed by the national media as a virtual 
sure winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein clung to a small lead in the last polls after months of Huffington 
television ads. Experts now expect a close race to the end because of 
Huffington's ability to pay for TV ads virtually anytime he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabato said the outcome of the governor's contest could have a major impact on 
the 1996 presidential race. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton must win California to win reelection. Sabato said, "He'll rise or 
fall on the basis of his own performance, but having a governor in your party 
in California can add several percentage points to your ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 "The stakes are very high there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other ballot measures that will get attention are Proposition 184, the 
"three strikes" initiative to provide tougher sentencing for repeat felons, and 
Proposition 188, a tobacco industry-sponsored measure to preempt existing local 
no-smoking ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 In the contests for statewide offices below governor, state Controller Gray 
Davis is the one Democrat given heavy odds for victory in his quest for the 
lieutenant governorship, being relinquished by retiring Democrat Leo T. 
McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, chief of staff in the Administration of Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown 
Jr. and a former assemblyman, is far better known and better financed than his 
Republican opponent, state Sen. Cathie Wright of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 On the GOP side, Atty. Gen. Lungren is regarded as the favorite to win a 
second term over Democratic Assemblyman Tom Umberg of Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the summer polls indicate that most voters have little knowledge of 
the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The other statewide posts at stake: 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer (incumbent Brown is running for governor): Former Democratic state 
party chairman Phil Angelides of Sacramento versus Matt Fong, Republican member 
of the State Board of Equalization and son of former Secretary of State March 
Fong Eu, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State (March Fong Eu resigned for an ambassadorial appointment): 
Acting Secretary of State Tony Miller, a Democrat and California's first openly 
gay candidate for statewide office, versus Assemblyman Bill Jones, a Republican 
from Fresno, author of the "three strikes" sentencing legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Controller (incumbent Davis is running for lieutenant governor): Kathleen 
Connell, a Los Angeles businesswoman, onetime aide to former Los Angeles Mayor 
Tom Bradley and a Democrat, versus former Assemblyman Tom McClintock, a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner (incumbent John Garamendi gave up the post to 
unsuccessfully seek the Democratic nomination for governor): State Sen. Art 
Torres, a Los Angeles Democrat, versus Assemblyman Charles W. Quackenbush, a 
San Jose Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 State superintendent of public instruction (the office has been vacant since 
Bill Honig resigned): Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin of Fremont versus Maureen 
DiMarco, Gov. Wilson's education secretary. The office is nonpartisan, but both 
candidates are registered Democrats.

NEW HOME FOR THE NEW YEAR; JEWISH CONGREGATION THAT SHARED QUARTERS WITH 
CHRISTIAN CHURCH GETS ITS OWN TEMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a trek rich with biblical imagery, about 100 members of a Jewish 
congregation marched five miles Sunday to their new synagogue in Irvine, a walk 
that also brought to a close the congregation's unusual 16-year marriage with a 
Presbyterian parish in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, members of Congregation Shir Ha-Ma'alot took 
turns carrying three 15-pound scrolls containing the Torah -- the first five 
books of the Bible -- at the end of an emotional farewell to the St. Mark 
Presbyterian Church congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1978, the two houses of worship had shared a sanctuary as part of a 
novel venture in religious tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 The church on Mar Vista Drive had no permanent religious symbols. The ark 
containing the sacred Torah scrolls moved on wheels, and a cross was mounted on 
the back for when it was turned around for Sunday services. A favorite story at 
the church tells of a former pastor's daughter who once pointed to Rabbi 
Bernard King and exclaimed: "That's my rabbi!" 
</P>
<P>
 "We've left a very holy place to go to a very holy place," King said Sunday. 
"I'm overwhelmed with the emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's move into a former health club -- whose racquetball courts will be 
turned into classrooms -- was spurred by the Jewish congregation's need for a 
preschool to attract young families, and to shore up sagging membership. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time that the quarter-century-old congregation will have its 
own home. The temple shared buildings with two different Christian churches in 
Orange County for nine years before joining with St. Mark to build the 
sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 Synagogue leaders say the move to Irvine was a natural one, for that city is 
quickly becoming a center for a growing number of Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irvine is the fastest-growing Jewish population in Orange County. More and 
more of our membership is coming from Irvine," said Rabbi King as he and 
members of the 250-family congregation hiked to the new synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation talked about getting its own home about four years ago, and 
began searching in earnest in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Though officials and members of both churches warmly described their longtime 
joint arrangement as a success, the strains of sharing the same sanctuary and 
classrooms became too much. The joint preschool was nondenominational, and 
arranging Jewish classes on Sundays clashed with church services and Sunday 
school for the Presbyterian congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like two families sharing a house," said the Rev. Gary Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said he is not sure what effect the temple's departure might have on 
parishioners who were drawn to the church by the idea of having Jews and 
Christians under the same roof, even if they did gather on different days of 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very large part of our identity," Collins said. "We have no idea if 
more folks would come, or fewer." 
</P>
<P>
 The new quarters have room for a sanctuary, a preschool and recreation. 
Officials are already organizing a temple basketball league to make use of the 
court already in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who had promoted the idea of sharing quarters to emphasize worshipers 
over the buildings that house them, acknowledged feeling sadness even as he led 
his flock to a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
 But the overall mood along the hike was buoyant. Parents pushed strollers 
along the bike path, and children pulled wagons. King and others joked about 
parting the San Diego Creek channel's slow-moving waters in the style of Moses. 
Lloyd Sellinger, who had led the search committee, worried about the temple's 
sluggish air-conditioning system and then suggested a joke T-shirt celebrating 
a steamy Rosh Hashanah. The Jewish New Year begins at sundown Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we won't have as beautiful a sanctuary, but at least it will be our 
own, " said Sellinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheers erupted as the sweat-flecked group approached the front doors of the 
boxy gray building at the edge of the Rancho San Joaquin Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 King offered a blessing and affixed next to the door the traditional mezuza , 
a rolled parchment in a case containing a prayer to remind Jews of their 
obligation to God. Inside, the Torah scrolls were placed inside the ark -- now 
without its cross -- and the congregation stood and sang a brief prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellinger still wasn't satisfied with the air conditioning, but he looked 
content to stand back while the others explored their new temple. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it," he said quietly. "We did it."

NEWS ANALYSIS; LUNGREN GAMBLED, LOST IN GAMING PANEL VOTE; TO GAIN BACKING, THE 
ATTORNEY GENERAL AGREED TO LET DEMOCRATS NAME TWO OF THE FIVE MEMBERS. THE MOVE 
ANGERED GOV. WILSON, WHO LOBBIED FOR DEFEAT OF THE PROPOSED COMMISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Legislature's failure last week to approve a comprehensive gambling 
control bill represents a setback for Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren at the hands of 
his fellow Republican, Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 If Lungren had prevailed, he would have enhanced his November reelection 
campaign by touting the creation of a five-member commission to control 
California's booming card room industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, in the protracted, high-level negotiations that went to the final 
hours of the just-concluded legislative session, Lungren agreed to a key 
concession that pleased Democrats but alienated Wilson, and in the process put 
him in the unusual political company of liberal Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica). 
</P>
<P>
 In stitching together a compromise, Lungren's representatives agreed to go 
along with demands to give Assembly Speaker Willie Brown and the Senate Rules 
Committee two of the commission's appointments. Wilson objected to the 
power-sharing deal, steadfastly holding out for authority to appoint all 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dispute over appointments was not the only reason the delicately 
balanced compromise fell apart in the whirlwind of the final day of the 
session. In the end, Brown, whose antagonism toward Lungren was an undercurrent 
throughout the negotiations, assailed the attorney general in an unusual public 
rebuke. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the reasons for the bill's failure were policy objections raised by 
Brown and Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward); an unwillingness 
to pass a bill that might seem like an expansion of gambling, and a suspicion 
that the bill was laden with special provisions, both for a proposed Downtown 
Los Angeles card club and existing card club operators. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would have set up a Nevada-style commission with tough 
conflict-of-interest restrictions to license the state's 265 card clubs, where 
$7.5 billion is wagered annually. It also would have created a division in 
Lungren's office to investigate card club applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which attracted wide early support despite steady sniping from 
Brown and Lockyer, became bogged down in the details. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that the governor's office didn't enter the negotiations until 
the eleventh hour and then it was to say they were . . . drawing their line in 
the sand" on appointments, said Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood), a 
key participant in the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the governor to have closed the door on him (Lungren) couldn't have 
brought the attorney general and the governor any closer," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, who also was part of the 
negotiations, said Lungren may have been so focused on creating a gambling 
commission that he misread Wilson's determination to name all five members to 
such a powerful policy-making panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Lungren) also has to consider the governor's thoughts about this issue, 
particularly when we're in the same party," Maddy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren conceded that he had agreed with Wilson about the makeup of the 
commission. But Lungren spokesman Dave Puglia later said the attorney general 
couldn't give Wilson everything he wanted and still win approval in the 
Democratic-controlled Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Several sources close to the behind-the-scenes talks suggested that Lungren 
believed Wilson would have signed the measure had it reached his desk. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear what Wilson would have done. But intense lobbying on 
Wilson's behalf prompted the Senate Rules Committee late last Tuesday to 
deadlock 2 to 2 on the issue of appointments, keeping the bill from reaching 
the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from Maddy and the Administration, Republican Sens. Robert 
Beverly of Long Beach and William Craven of Oceanside opposed the bill, while 
Democrats Lockyer and Ruben Ayala of Chino favored it. The committee's fifth 
member, Nicholas Petris (D-Oakland), declined to vote, saying he needed more 
time to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Administration's view, the commission would have been an arm of the 
executive branch and as such, Wilson should have the right to name all five 
members, subject to Senate confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no compromise to be had here," said Sean Walsh, Wilson's press 
secretary. "It's the governor's privilege to appoint these individuals and the 
governor can hold them directly accountable and responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Lungren blamed legislative leaders for killing the 
compromise proposal crafted with Hayden's help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without any formal opposition . . . this proposal failed because the 
leadership of the California Legislature refused to allow the elected 
representatives of the people to vote," Lungren said. "It died in the dark 
without any accountability." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the victors this time around was Brown, who repeatedly assailed the 
measure, in part because of a variety of concessions, including one allowing 
Hollywood Park to operate its own card room. Earlier this year, Brown helped 
derail another version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 While the behind-the-scene debate was intense, the acrimony triggered by the 
issue was rarely publicly displayed. But late last Wednesday, with the Assembly 
close to adjournment, Brown lashed out at Lungren, interrupting an otherwise 
mundane talk in which the Speaker thanked Assembly staffers for a good year's 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown vehemently condemned Lungren for having sent an investigator to 
determine whether illegal gambling took place at Brown's annual "bash" held 
last Tuesday at a Sacramento hotel and which attracted many lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, denying anything improper, accused Lungren of harassing him because of 
his opposition to the gaming bill. Complained Brown, in end-of-session 
hyperbole: "I guess it was last done in Nazi Germany." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Brown, Lungren said his office was checking on reports from 
several party-goers about illegal gambling devices at the party, especially 
slot machines, and that the outcome was still pending. Lungren said he did not 
order the inquiry made by his office, and learned of it only afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the bitterness may be that much is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "What everybody is building for," said Maddy, "is the potential that this 
thing is going to explode one of these days and we'll get full-scale casinos." 
</P>
<P>
 So, even though the issue is dead for now, that's why all sides expect a new 
wave of gaming bills to be pushed next year in the Legislature.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: THE PERILS OF GIVING PUBLIC WHAT IT WANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was the year voters got what they asked for from the Legislature. And it 
brings to mind the old adage about being careful what you ask for because you 
might get it. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians likely will be paying the price well into the next century 
because in 1994 they tended to intimidate groveling politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 This might seem ironical and incongruous, given the Capitol's pre-1993 history 
of gridlock and frequently ignoring voters. But these days officeholders are 
running scared. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a delicate balancing act at play here. On the one hand, this is what 
democracy is about. The citizens elect representatives to reflect their views 
in government, to do their bidding. On the other hand, they also elect them to 
lead, to analyze complex details and make informed decisions on legislative 
options that puzzle most people. 
</P>
<P>
 The public may have shown common sense in asking for certain things. But in 
the politicians' haste to please, they sometimes acted with little thought -- 
and no courage -- in the delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters didn't get everything they asked for, of course. Election year politics 
interfered with some desires, such as education reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the mega-issues -- crime, taxes and spending -- the Legislature and the 
governor scurried to follow the electorate, marching lock step in the direction 
they perceived it to be heading. 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much reflection on where they'd all wind up. And it will be years 
before anybody really knows. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Three strikes and you're out" is the classic example. It's a compelling 
concept with a catchy name. Combine that with the gripping kidnap-murder of a 
12-year-old, Polly Klaas, and you've got a political stampede. No legislative 
leader was about to stand in the way. Not only Gov. Pete Wilson, but Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown endorsed it. 
</P>
<P>
 As the "three strikes" initiative headed toward the November ballot -- with 
polls showing overwhelming public support -- legislators stumbled all over 
themselves to enact an identical bill. Never mind that Polly's father, Marc 
Klaas, and many district attorneys preferred another, less costly version -- 
one that committed to life imprisonment only felons whose third strike was 
violent. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the enacted law, any third felony -- for example, shoplifting -- will 
send the culprit to prison for 25 years to life if his first two strikes were 
serious. So we'll be housing septuagenarian snack thieves at $25,000 per year. 
The Department of Corrections estimates that the new law will require the state 
to build 20 additional prisons by the turn of the century and spend $2 billion 
a year to operate them. The construction cost is estimated at $21 billion over 
30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters asked for a "three strikes" law and they got the most expensive 
version. They also ultimately got a ton of other tough sentencing acts. Many 
may be long overdue, but they'll add billions to prison costs and Californians 
will pay. If taxes aren't raised, other programs will suffer, including 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But voters -- the polls reminded politicians -- also oppose higher taxes and 
bigger spending. Except don't cut back on schools or universities, don't close 
any more parks or libraries, and be sure to take care of the poor who need 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if you're a cautious politician getting mixed signals from the electorate 
while facing a $7-billion budget deficit, what do you do? You don't raise 
taxes. You don't cut programs. You borrow the $7 billion. That's the least 
painful solution for politicians and the public. But it will cost $500 million 
in interest and only delay the reckoning. 
</P>
<P>
 People aren't always easy to read. A big earthquake hits and they tell 
pollsters that their least favorite way of paying for repairs is to borrow 
through bonds. They'd much rather raise the sales tax temporarily, maybe even 
the gas tax, and finance repairs on a cash basis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor and Republicans don't believe it; there'll be no tax hike 
this election year. They push through a proposed $2-billion bond issue, which 
the voters promptly reject -- along with bonds for school construction and 
university facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento gets the message. The voters are demanding no more bonds. (Annual 
bond interest already is $2.2 billion.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature obliges on the final night of the 1994 session by killing all 
its new bond proposals for the November election -- $2 billion for schools, 
$100 million for libraries and $1.1 billion to build prisons for those 
three-strike felons. 
</P>
<P>
 California, however, still must build new schools and prisons. How? The voters 
in November will elect a new team of representatives to figure it all out. And 
in 1995, a non-election year, the politicians hopefully will be more courageous 
and contemplative.

MOTORIZED SKI RIDER, 51, KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 51-year-old Glendora man riding a motorized water ski died Sunday after an 
apparent accident at Castaic Lake Recreation Area that may have been caused by 
another person on a similar vehicle who fled after the crash, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie Ronald Ellis was found floating in the water about 10:15 a.m. by a 
friend who accompanied him to the lake, said Steve Henrickson, a supervisor at 
the county-run state park. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis was alive when he was found but died en route to Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita, said Deputy Brian Jones of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first watercraft fatality of the season at the park and the third 
since the recreational facility opened in 1972. In 1992, a Foster City woman 
died when she was accidentally hit by a motorized water ski driven by her 
boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said homicide detectives suspect that Ellis collided with another rider 
in the upper part of the lake. That area -- about a mile long, half a mile wide 
and 200 to 300 feet deep -- was roped off for the exclusive use of motorized 
ski riders in 1987 because of safety concerns, Henrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said that the incident is still under investigation and that detectives 
are looking for another vehicle that may have been damaged in a crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrickson said Ellis, a silver-haired man who weighed about 250 pounds, could 
have died from causes other than a crash because he saw no serious wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no visible wounds on him whatsoever," Henrickson said. "We all 
think we know things conclusively by the evidence in hand and it turns out to 
be totally wrong. I think when they finish with an autopsy it will reveal a 
lot."

UNIONISTS SET OFF BOMB NEAR SINN FEIN OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A car bomb exploded Sunday evening outside an office belonging to Sinn Fein, 
the political wing of the IRA, in the Roman Catholic Falls Road area of 
Belfast, and a Protestant extremist group took responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said no one was injured in the explosion, which could be heard across 
town and which blew out nearby windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlawed Protestant extremist Ulster Volunteer Force said it was 
responsible for the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinn Fein denounced the bombing as an attempt to provoke the IRA into breaking 
a cease-fire announced last week. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first bomb attack since Irish Republican Army guerrillas, 
campaigning to oust Britain from Northern Ireland, announced the cease-fire 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, another outlawed Protestant group, the Ulster Freedom Fighters, 
shot a Catholic man to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say both groups are stepping up attacks and could be targeting 
Catholics to assure supporters they will not endorse any British government 
concessions to the IRA.

GORE CITES PEACEFUL PATH FOR HAITI CHIEFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Haiti's military regime still has time to avoid an invasion by relinquishing 
power on its own, Vice President Al Gore said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Invasion is "not inevitable if the illegal dictators in Haiti decide to comply 
with the world community's wishes and demands embodied in the United Nations 
resolution . . . and leave of their own accord," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore appeared to be softening a statement last week by Deputy Defense 
Secretary John M. Deutch that about 10,000 U.S. soldiers would be sent to 
Haiti, either to remove the military rulers or restore order if they left 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch did not say when that might happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said the junta is "going to leave one way or another" because the United 
Nations has demanded it and the United States has an interest in seeing 
democracy restored there and limiting the flow of Haitian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Administration has long held out the prospect of military 
intervention if the junta does not restore elected President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, ousted three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking Sunday from the world population conference in Cairo, Gore was asked 
on NBC's "Meet the Press" what would justify the loss of American lives if the 
United States sent troops Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haiti is right in our neighborhood, right in our back yard, so to speak, and 
we now have a Western Hemisphere . . . in which every country with the 
exception of Haiti and Cuba has a freely elected democratic government, and 
that is important to us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when there is a free, democratic election and the people choose their 
leaders and there is an illegal takeover where democracy is hijacked and 
expelled, that's important to us, especially when we're swamped with refugees 
as a result." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson, long an advocate of stronger action in Haiti, welcomed 
plans to send soldiers there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mr. Clinton has the right idea about Haiti," Jackson said Sunday on 
CBS' "Face the Nation." "He needs to implement it quickly, because the longer 
he delays and waits, the more innocent people die." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a senior member of Congress said Saturday that secret activities 
are under way that may be able to avert a U.S. invasion of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) said the United States is close to military 
intervention in Haiti "unless we can have a dramatic diplomatic initiative . . 
. or perhaps some opening that might come through some of the secret activities 
that are going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't be specific about that, but there are some activities," Hamilton, the 
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on CNN's "Newsmaker 
Saturday" program.

ENVIRONMENT; GREAT PREDATOR OF THE SEA FINDS ITSELF A VICTIM OF PREDATION; 
DESPITE FEDERAL CONTROLS ON OVERFISHING, SHARKS IN THE ATLANTIC ARE UNDER 
THREAT. SCIENTISTS URGE PLACING SOME SPECIES ON THE ENDANGERED LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years after the imposition of strict federal quotas on shark fishing and a 
ban on the related practice of "finning," there is little evidence that the 
depleted population of large coastal sharks in the Atlantic Ocean is recovering 
from years of overfishing. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many scientists say that the threat to the ocean's most fearsome 
fish, including the great white shark of "Jaws" fame, is so severe that some 
species should now be listed as endangered and given the same type of global 
protections that apply to whales and dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the commercial market for sharks is the Asian demand for fins, used in 
a soup believed to act as a sexual stimulant. Florida-based brokers pay up to 
$24 a pound for top-grade shark fins. That price makes finning -- cutting off 
the shark's dorsal fin and dumping the wounded animal in the sea to die -- 
highly profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 But a growing U.S. taste for shark meat has also helped spawn a directed 
fishery so vast and efficient that some prized species of large coastal sharks 
could be wiped out, scientists warn. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the waves, the disappearance of the marine world's top predator would 
ripple down the food chain, triggering catastrophic fluctuations in entire 
populations of stingrays, octopuses, bait fish, lobsters, sea birds and even 
mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think most people understand what happens when you drastically reduce 
an apex predator population from the environment," said shark expert Steve 
Branstetter, who notes that the numbers of some heavily fished shark species 
have declined by as much as 75% in the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no good examples in the marine world. But we know that on land, if 
you remove coyotes or wolves from the environment, you see rabbit populations 
go wild. They eat all the vegetation, then the deer population crashes and you 
have cycles of rise and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst part is that I don't think anybody cares," said Branstetter, a 
biologist with the Gulf and South Atlantic Fisheries Development Foundation in 
Tampa, Fla. "To many people, a good shark is a dead shark." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, 19 years after the movie "Jaws" reduced an age-old human fear to a 
two-hour horror story, shark hunting remains popular as sport and rite of 
passage. Photographs of beaming fishermen standing next to dead makos and 
hammerheads are still a sports page cliche. 
</P>
<P>
 But recreational fishing is no longer the chief threat to large coastal 
sharks. The U.S. commercial catch of sharks topped 15 million pounds in 1994, 
producing a harvest valued at $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year a shark-management plan drawn up by the National Marine Fisheries 
Service set quotas for 39 species of shark found in the Atlantic, the Gulf of 
Mexico and the Caribbean, and banned the practice of finning. When this year's 
quota of 3,060 metric tons was met Aug. 10, the commercial season closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1995 quota is supposed to rise to 3,800 metric tons. However, two Marine 
Fisheries Service advisory committees, alarmed by the sharks' slow recovery 
rate, have recommended that next year's quota be held at the 1994 level. The 
U.S. Commerce Department is expected to approve the lower limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we overestimated the potential for the stock to recover," Branstetter 
said. "It's going to take a decade or more even to get sharks back to the level 
of 1986, when they were already reduced from 1970s levels by as much as 50%." 
</P>
<P>
 (There is no quota on sharks caught in the Pacific Ocean, although a 1994 
California law prohibits the taking of great white sharks without a permit from 
the state Department of Fish and Game.) 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. shark catch began to grow exponentially in the early 1980s, first 
behind a burgeoning recreational interest fueled by a post-"Jaws" mystique of 
sharks as the grizzlies of the deep and a glut of big-money tournaments. But by 
the late 1980s, when consumers began discovering shark meat as table fare and 
as the Asian market for fins continued to build, the commercial catch on 
longlines and in gill nets far outstripped the recreational take. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, the total commercial shark catch on the East Coast was 135 tons. Ten 
years later the total was 7,122 tons, an increase of more than 5,000%. 
</P>
<P>
 While several states and a few other countries have passed laws to regulate 
shark fishing, some scientists favor global actions to protect shark species 
that are in decline. That issue is expected to be taken up in November when 
representatives of more than 120 nations meet at the Convention on 
International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora in Ft. Lauderdale, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 International laws protecting sharks are still years away, scientists say. But 
according to Sonja Fordham of the Center for Marine Conservation in Washington, 
"it's definitely time for international management. Because of their slow 
growth rate, late maturity and small number of young, sharks cannot withstand 
intense fishing pressure. When that happens, the populations just collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that sharks -- sleek, efficient predators that have ruled the 
world's oceans for 400 million years -- could themselves be the victims of 
predation is difficult for many to accept. Sharks do occasionally bite people 
-- an average of 23 shark attacks in U.S. waters, mostly off Florida, are 
reported each year -- and some commercial fishermen say that they catch as many 
sharks as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Rusty Hudson, who brokers shark fins for a Hong Kong dealer from his home in 
Port Orange, Fla., says government bureaucrats use inaccurate catch data and 
are "playing politics with science" to keep quotas too low. 
</P>
<P>
 But most commercial fishermen and scientists agree: Shark stocks have 
plummeted in recent years. In Chesapeake Bay, studies by the Virginia Institute 
of Marine Science show that numbers of sandbar sharks, a large-finned species 
that accounts for the bulk of the East Coast commercial catch, have declined by 
as much as 80% over the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Institute biologist John A. Musick says declines in populations of 
dusky sharks, another commercially valuable species, are similar. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Sander, 37, who operates the 40-foot commercial boat Marsea out of 
Daytona Beach, Fla., also has noticed. A few hours and several miles off 
Florida's east coast, Sander and his crew throw out 600 baited hooks on 
longlines that can stretch over eight miles of ocean floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to catch 40 to 50 sharks a night," he said. "Now it might be eight or 
10. There has been a definite decline." 
</P>
<P>
 To enable independent fishermen like Sander to compete with bigger commercial 
fleets, a 4,000-pound "trip limit" was imposed this year, meaning that every 
boat must return to the dock when that quota is met. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sander sees the day approaching when each fisherman, in addition to the 
federal license now required, will also be issued an individual seasonal quota 
on sharks. "As restrictive as that is, it's probably the only way to get a 
handle on the overfishing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since sharks reproduce slowly -- at a rate of only 2% annually -- more 
restrictions are likely. Fordham is lobbying the Marine Fisheries Service to 
ban fishing in known shark pupping grounds during the months of April, May and 
June. She said she favors drastically reducing the number of shark-fishing 
licenses issued, a figure that now exceeds 1,500. A shark-management plan for 
the Pacific has also been discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The management plan we have now is a start, but it's not strong enough," she 
said. "Sharks are extremely vulnerable, and a sustainable fishery may not be 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least people are looking at the big picture now. People see that footage 
on the Discovery Channel of sharks being finned and they are appalled. I'd like 
to think that the tide is turning."

TRIAL REOPENING OF HEBRON MOSQUE REPORTEDLY SET FOR OCTOBER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hebron mosque where a Jewish settler massacred about 30 Palestinians in 
February will reopen on Oct. 12 for 10 days to test new security arrangements, 
Israeli radio stations said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The army could not confirm the exact date but said the chief of its central 
command, Maj. Gen. Ilan Biran, told a parliamentary committee that toured the 
Cave of the Patriarchs that he plans to open the shrine toward the end of 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrine, holy to Muslims and Jews, has been closed since U.S.-born Baruch 
Goldstein opened fire on Arab worshipers Feb. 25. Survivors beat him to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli military authorities have installed closed-circuit television cameras 
and metal detectors to try to tighten security at the site in the heart of the 
West Bank city of Hebron, a flash point of Arab-Israeli tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestine Liberation Organization has said plans to split the worshiping 
area in two, effectively barring Arabs from the tomb of the biblical patriarch 
Abraham, would desecrate the holy site. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli radio stations said the Oct. 12 opening date was disclosed by Biran in 
a briefing to members of Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish settlers and right-wing legislators had pressed the army unsuccessfully 
to open the prayer halls for the Jewish New Year, which starts tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the radio reports, Biran told the committee that the shrine will 
remain open for 10 days to test the new security measures. A decision will then 
be made toward the end of October on whether to open the site permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Arab gunmen in a moving car shot and killed one Israeli soldier and 
wounded two others in the Palestinian self-rule area of the Gaza Strip, the 
Israeli army said. 
</P>
<P>
 The army said the gunmen fired from a passing car at the soldiers on foot 
patrol at Morag junction near Rafah in the south of Gaza. The location is near 
Jewish settlements and one of the spots Israeli soldiers patrol under a May 4 
accord setting up self-rule in Gaza and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 The attackers escaped toward Khan Yunis in the self-rule area, the army said. 
There was no immediate comment from Palestinian police. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said witnesses had told him that 
the vehicle used for the attack was seen escaping toward Jewish settlements, 
not Khan Yunis. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack came hours after two Jews were stabbed in the back and wounded in 
Arab East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 An Israeli police spokesman said the Jews were attacked near the Damascus Gate 
to the walled Old City. Their condition was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli security chiefs had warned the public to be on the alert for guerrilla 
attacks ahead of the Jewish New Year holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Sunday, an Israeli army lieutenant appeared in court on suspicion of 
helping anti-Arab Jewish militants obtain weapons, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's army radio later said two others were arrested in the case. Police, 
citing a court order they said was issued later in the day barring publication 
of details of the case, would not comment on that report.

WESTERN ENVOYS TO GLOBAL POPULATION MEETING PUSH COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As delegates gathered amid tight security for today's opening of a U.N. 
conference on world population, U.S. and European envoys attempted Sunday to 
defuse Vatican and Islamic objections to a draft plan that deals with abortion 
and other sensitive issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Compromise proposals being circulated centered on controversial language 
dealing with definitions of "reproductive rights" and the family; sex education 
and family-planning services for teen-agers, and abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 These issues, while constituting less than 10% of the U.N. draft, have emerged 
as the major stumbling block to consensus at the International Conference on 
Population and Development, which is aimed at forging a strategy to stabilize 
population at a level considered environmentally sustainable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outstanding questions are important, but they should not be allowed to 
overshadow the great progress we have made," said Nafis Sadik, executive 
director of the U.N. Population Fund and secretary general of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In private meetings this weekend, U.S. officials urged nonaligned nations to 
accept compromise language drafted over the summer by the European Union, 
participants said. U.S. officials expressed optimism that the proposal would 
emerge as the vehicle for breaking the logjam because it enjoys support from a 
broad spectrum of countries, ranging from socially conservative Ireland to the 
liberal Scandinavian nations. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, advocates of the compromise acknowledged they still must 
overcome stiff resistance from the Vatican and Islamic countries, where 
religious authorities have criticized the document as condoning homosexuality 
and extramarital sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Egypt is said to be seeking support from Iran in removing language that many 
Islamic leaders see as condoning homosexuality, in particular a sentence urging 
an end to discrimination against "other unions" besides traditional marriage. 
Caribbean nations sought to include the phrase to cover common-law marriages, 
which are a tradition in those countries, according to a member of the U.S. 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most controversial passages, on reproductive health, has been 
attacked by conservative Catholics and Islamists as advocating a universal 
right to abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise seeks to preempt that criticism by stating that policy on 
reproductive matters "is the sovereign right of each nation, consistent with 
the national laws and in conformity with international human-rights standards."

SOMALIA CLASHES KILL 17 AS LEVEL OF VIOLENCE RISES

<P>
 At least 17 people were killed and an unknown number wounded in clashes 
between rival clans in Somalia, which is fast slipping back into violence and 
anarchy, U.N. officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman and a child caught in cross-fire were among 10 dead in the 
southwestern town of Baidoa on Friday.Fighting broke out when members of one 
group tried to hijack a truck belonging to another, a U.N. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the southern port of Kismayu on Saturday, seven members of one clan were 
killed when members of another tried to steal a truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday at Marka, 60 miles south of Mogadishu, bandits raided a school, 
detonated an explosive device and stole money and equipment. U.N. officials 
said the raid was apparently an attempt by Muslim fanatics to destroy the 
school, which is administered by Italian Christian missionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 After recent attacks on U.N. personnel, U.N. troops have been withdrawn from 
some outposts and moved into more secure garrisons. The Security Council has 
said its operation in Somalia will be reviewed if the warlords do not make 
progress toward forming a government by the end of this month.

 The bees attacked Johnson and then stung his 59-year-old son about 500 times 
as he tried to help his father. Both were in stable condition Sunday at a 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer and the emergency rescue worker were treated at the hospital and 
released, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson disturbed the bees when he bumped the wall of a building next door. 
The hive was between the frame and paneling. 
</P>
<P>
 Beekeepers estimated that 75,000 bees were in the hive.

FEAR OF MORE KILLING HAUNTS RWANDA; AFRICA: AFTER BETRAYAL BY NEIGHBORS, 
SURVIVORS WONDER IF THEY DARE TO TRUST PROMISE OF PEACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Some of Maharaliel Nyagahima's neighbors, people he had sold beer and lent 
money to for years, came one evening to kill him and his wife. He paid them off 
with three cases of bottled banana beer and survived. 
</P>
<P>
 What now? 
</P>
<P>
 The 38-year-old Rwandan sat Sunday afternoon in the sole, creaky armchair in 
his humble hillside cabin, his wife, Stephanie, by his side, and held his 
stubble-covered chin in his hands as he thought about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Can he, the son of a Hutu father and a Tutsi mother, ever again trust the 
other villagers whose homes dot the banana groves here? What turned some of his 
neighbors against families they had known for years? 
</P>
<P>
 To save his Tutsi wife from the bloodthirsty mob that rampaged with clubs and 
machetes last spring, Nyagahima had to hide her in the brush-fringed hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it all happen again? And next time, would they be as lucky? 
</P>
<P>
 "What I know is that my father-in-law is dead and my two brothers-in-law," 
Nyagahima said. "I am afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear, sorrow and perplexity in this Kitarama prefecture village in a small 
way are those of all Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 As the year began, 400 people, mostly small-scale farmers, lived in Karehe. 
</P>
<P>
 Now villagers reckon there are only 150 people left. A quarter of the original 
population was Tutsi, but almost all have been murdered. Fifteen extended 
families of Hutus, including some who took part in the pogrom, have fled to 
Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Rows of thatched huts have been reduced to a no-man's-land of ashes, scrap and 
broken water jars. A human skeleton, its teeth shining hideously white, lies on 
its back near the roadside. It has been there for months, people say. No one 
can say who the dead person was. 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, villagers say, 200 Hutus from the youth wing of the former 
government's political party rolled into the village from Kigali, the capital. 
Along with some local officials and some village Hutus, they compiled a list of 
people to be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The village mayor, a Hutu from the ruling party named Sixbert Ndayambaje, 
approved the list, villagers said. And the thugs from Kigali, joined by some 
villagers, began going from home to home, pulling people outside and killing 
them with repeated chops from machetes or blows from clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nyagahima's 36-year-old wife was marked for death because she is a Tutsi. But 
also marked was Suleiman Rukera, a Hutu who owns a tiny market stall with a 
corrugated roof, where he tries to sell door hinges, cigarettes and the odd 
bicycle tire. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they saw you had a bit of a fortune, they tried to kill you to get your 
money," the merchant said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was then earning $1 a day. To save himself, Rukera, 48, hid in the homes of 
other Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 The enigma of the genocide that swept Rwanda is why and how it happened so 
fast. For their part, ethnographers note the traditional differences between 
the Hutus, who make up 85% of the population, and Tutsis, who, before their 
blood began flowing in a tidal wave, accounted for almost all of the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall and slim, the Tutsis migrated to Central Africa with their cattle from 
the Nile region long ago. Although a minority, they came to rule the short, 
stocky Hutus, a farming people of Bantu origin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tutsis provided protection in return for a share of the crops. Even into 
this century, one's ethnic background was still deemed so important that it was 
noted on Rwandan identity cards. 
</P>
<P>
 In Karehe, people don't blame historical grudges for the massacres. They blame 
their country's former, mostly Hutu leaders. It may be a way of washing away 
guilt for having done nothing to halt the butchery. Or it may be a way of 
pinning hopes on the mostly Tutsi leaders who are now in charge of Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, the Hutus lived together with the Tutsis in peace," Rukera said. "A 
Tutsi looked for a Hutu wife; a Hutu looked for a Tutsi wife. All these events 
happened because of the authorities. They divided people to get power or to 
keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 Party workers loyal to President Juvenal Habyarimana visited the town to whip 
up hatred among Hutus even before Habyarimana was killed in an April 6 plane 
crash, villagers remember. But it was the shooting down of Habyarimana's plane 
that started the butchery. 
</P>
<P>
 "They called the people together. They put up barriers. They said: 'We have 
just one enemy. And we know who he is,' " Ebaniste Musabeyezu, 37, said of the 
rallies held by Habyarimana's party workers here to summon up anti-Tutsi 
hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the president's death, the killing began. The trucks from Kigali 
were accompanied by some of the village Hutus. "Night after night, they came," 
Nyagahima said with a shudder. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiding out on the terraced slopes, Nyagahima's wife was in despair. "I knew I 
was going to die because everyone else who hid was found and killed," she said 
softly. 
</P>
<P>
 The extortion money her husband paid to the Hutus may have saved them both. 
One night he gave the killers about $30. A second time, it was about $60. The 
third and final time, the beer vendor handed over the three cases of banana 
beer. For some reason, the killers never came back. 
</P>
<P>
 "God saved me," Nyagahima said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his family fled on foot in June when Rwandan government troops, driven 
out of Kigali by the mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front, reached Karehe. In 
an unsuccessful bid to halt the rebel advance, government soldiers raked the 
village with mortar fire, killing at least 17 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying only a mattress, Nyagahima, his wife, their four sons and daughter 
walked for two weeks over Rwanda's hilly countryside to Ruhengeri prefecture. 
There they ran into more men from the rebel forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us, 'Go home, there will be peace,' " Nyagahima said. By July, the 
Rwandan Patriotic Front had driven the government forces out and taken power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Front promised peace. Does Nyagahima think the new government of "national 
unity" can deliver in a country where so much blood has been shed? 
</P>
<P>
 The beer seller doesn't know. His wife is more confident. "People who took 
part in the massacres are afraid of the RPF," she said. To her, that's a 
reassuring sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, she said, the people of Karehe have begun to talk to each other, to 
question what happened -- and to wonder why. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor appointed by the new government has warned relatives of the slain 
against seeking vengeance. But like the grinning skeleton across the road from 
the market, death and the past still haunt Karehe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday afternoon, a man wearing a dirty white baseball cap marked "Panama Jack 
Beach Club" grabbed a machete and started to hack away at a lamb carcass at the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Guakavinay chopped and chopped, swinging his arms ever higher as he tried 
to cut through thick bone. 
</P>
<P>
 The villagers eyed each other and then laughed. It was obvious what the 
chop-chop of the butcher's machete had made them think of.

 A burglar broke into the home of Israel's police chief, Assaf Hefetz, and made 
away with cash and a camera, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police declined to say whether Hefetz was at home when the thief climbed in 
through a window on Friday night, but they said some family members were in the 
house and discovered the break-in Saturday morning.

IN QUIET KEY WEST THEY SING, YES, WE HAVE NO FLOTILLAS; TOURISM: ON A HOLIDAY 
WEEKEND, HOTEL ROOMS ARE VACANT AND CHARTER BOATS BOB AT THE DOCKS. TRAVELERS 
APPARENTLY FEAR CUBAN RAFTERS ARE WASHING ASHORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On what is traditionally one of the busiest weekends of the year in the 
Florida Keys, hotel vacancy signs are lit, some charter boat captains are 
idling at the dock and luxury cruise ships are preparing for the unscheduled 
stops they may be making at sea to pick up non-paying passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ragtag fleet of rafts continues streaming across the Florida Straits, 
the Cuban refugee exodus is raising economic havoc with Labor Day holiday 
tourism here. "Travel agents from Minneapolis have called to ask if the streets 
are safe. Even people in Miami have phoned to ask about health concerns," said 
Andy Newman, a spokesman for the Monroe County Tourist Development Council. "We 
haven't seen anything like this since after Hurricane Andrew." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, almost no Cuban refugees have landed in the Keys since Aug. 20, when 
the Clinton Administration ordered the Coast Guard to interdict the rafters at 
sea and shuttle them to a detention camp at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo 
Bay, Cuba. More than 20,000 Cubans are now being held there in a massive tent 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the dangerous migration of those fleeing economic hard times in 
Cuba continues, the trend is down. By Sunday evening, 1,069 Cuban rafters had 
been picked up between Cuba and the Keys since midnight Saturday. Last week, 
rescues were running at an average of 2,500 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the declining number of rafters, and the talks in New York between 
U.S. and Cuban officials trying to solve the crisis, the damage to the image of 
the Florida Keys -- where a third of the 65,000 residents make a living from 
tourism -- has been done. "What are people supposed to think when they see 
national news reporters on television doing their stand-ups from here, talking 
about the flood of refugees?" Newman asked. 
</P>
<P>
 A sample of advance bookings for the 8,500 hotel rooms in the Keys showed 
business down by 15% to 35% of normal, Newman said. "We were seriously 
hurting," he said. ". . . Traditionally we sell out for Labor Day weekend, the 
last official summer holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, the tourism council spent $28,000 on advertisements in six 
Florida newspapers and a computer message to 75,000 travel agents. The 
newspaper ad showed the famous picture of President Harry S. Truman holding up 
the erroneous headline "Dewey Defeats Truman" and went on to point out that 
reports of the Keys being awash with refugees were equally incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the advertising campaign may help boost the fall tourist season, 
only a few thousand walk-ins will save this three-day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In Key West, the Marriott Casa Marina, with more than 300 rooms, was only 87% 
booked by late Saturday. In Islamorada, Days Inn front desk clerk Pat Hajzer 
said 30% of the rooms were vacant at noon Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "People call and ask, 'What's happening down there?' " said Faye M. Bailey, 
assistant general manager of Marina del Mar resort in Key Largo. "The general 
perception is that we have rafts floating up on beaches and immigrants running 
through our streets. The misperceptions are incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the image problem, Bailey added, reports last week about a 
tropical wave of low pressure moving through the Florida Straits were 
misinterpreted by many potential visitors to mean hurricane. "We had a few 
thunderstorms," Bailey said. "That's normal." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first few weeks of August, before the beefed-up armada of U.S. 
military ships began to intercept most Florida-bound rafters, some Cubans 
refugees did make it to shore. And those who only came close were often met by 
U.S. fishing boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Powell, captain of the Chief, said he recently rescued five raft-loads of 
Cubans in one day. "The Coast Guard planes would circle us three times, and 
we'd have to follow them to a raft," he said. Powell said he would secure the 
raft alongside the Chief, offer the Cubans water and food and then stand by for 
two hours or more until a Coast Guard vessel arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his clients, paying up to $600 for a full day's charter, were usually 
understanding. But the interruptions were not good for business. "I've had two 
cancellations this week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the increased Coast Guard presence, Powell said he is more likely 
to encounter empty rafts from which the refugees have already been rescued. And 
ironically, he said, those empty rafts improve fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dolphin and wahoo stay under them in the shade," he said. "So we go right 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Coast Guard attempts to burn or sink rafts after saving their 
occupants, so many makeshift vessels survive as flotsam in the Florida Straits 
and the Gulf Stream that they have become a hazard to navigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A national boat owners association, BOAT/US, last week issued a warning to 
members to watch out for the rafts, some of which are made of 55-gallon steel 
drums. In Dade County, a debris removal firm has been hired to salvage the 
rafts, which are washing up along southern Florida beaches and various 
uninhabited islands. 
</P>
<P>
 The captains of cruise ships, especially those that ply the Miami-Key 
West-Cozumel, Mexico, route, have also been alerted to rafts, both occupied and 
abandoned. By law, any U.S. boater must render assistance to people in distress 
at sea. That means that some Cuban rafters take a cruise to Mexico before being 
handed over to the Coast Guard.

CLINTON GETS LITTLE CREDIT FOR ECONOMIC TURNAROUND; POLICY: ADVISERS BEMOAN 
NEGATIVE MEDIA COVERAGE OF PRESIDENT. THEY SAY HE'S RESPONSIBLE FOR JOB GROWTH, 
DEFICIT REDUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich is frustrated, and doesn't mind letting off a 
little steam when asked why he thinks his boss isn't getting credit for the 
nation's job-rich recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich can't understand why President Clinton's approval ratings are sinking 
even while he presides over a robust turnaround that has generated 4.1 million 
jobs since January, 1993. What's more, on his second Labor Day in office, the 
President is ahead of the pace needed to live up to his promise of generating 8 
million jobs in his four-year term; that growth has come at a time when 
inflation remains under control and the federal budget deficit is plunging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why isn't he getting credit? You tell me," Reich demands, adding, "The 
negative press coverage of the President has been at the heart of it." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Clinton Administration, the failure of good employment and economic 
data to provide a political tonic for Clinton remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 All summer, as the Administration has struggled with other nagging problems, 
White House officials have repeatedly been frustrated by their inability to 
emphasize the positive and get the public to recognize the President for his 
economic accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Clinton policy-makers are beginning to echo the complaints of 
their predecessors in the George Bush White House about media coverage of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Overshadowed is another factor that some analysts outside the Administration 
suggest may loom larger: the deep-seated structural problems that are 
generating a feeling of insecurity among some Americans, and that can't be 
dispelled by less than two years' worth of positive data. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a jarring disconnect between media coverage and the very 
fine performance that we are seeing from the U.S. economy," complains Laura 
D'Andrea Tyson, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers. "I could go down 
the list of all the statistics that people normally look at. . . . I could put 
the numbers from the Clinton years side by side with the statistics from the 
Bush Administration, and I think a class of Econ 101 students would all agree 
by any objective measure that our performance has been far better." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has gotten less credit than might be expected. While presidents only 
influence the economy on the margins, they still usually receive either credit 
or blame for its overall performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In Clinton's case, while the economic trends have generally been good during 
his term, 60% of network television stories about the economy have been 
negative, a study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is true that Clinton hasn't gotten credit for the economy in the 
media," said Robert Lichter, director of the center. "And that translates into 
the public's perception of Clinton's handling of the economy. One of the big 
changes I think we've seen in the last 10 years is that the media-generated 
perception of the economy is beginning to have a much bigger impact on people's 
perception of conditions than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even Tyson acknowledges that there may be more to it than just bad press. 
The larger economic trends that are squeezing some industries and types of jobs 
have left many unconvinced that the White House has improved their own personal 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 While the recovery has generated millions of jobs during the past 19 months, 
there remains a continuing decline in wages and in the overall American 
standard of living. Coupled with the psychological impact of large corporate 
layoffs on Americans' sense of job security, those trends seem to have 
generated anxiety that is stubbornly resistant to the medicinal balm of the 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great that we have job growth and unemployment is dropping, but we 
haven't done anything as a country to address our long-term problems," said 
Lawrence Mishel, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington 
and author of the just-published "The State of Working America." 
</P>
<P>
 "And so the middle-class squeeze that Bill Clinton railed against and made an 
issue in the 1992 campaign is still going on. People are still working more for 
less. And on that score Clinton hasn't delivered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mishel documented, for example, that U.S. wages, adjusted for inflation, have 
stagnated despite the recovery. Between 1989 and 1993, median real wages fell 
2.6%; there has been only a little improvement since. "In the summer of 1994, 
we are just starting to return to the levels for family income that we saw 
before the recession in 1989," Mishel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson agrees and says that the long-term decline in living standards has taken 
two decades to build up -- and that it can't be reversed in one or two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at median family income over a long period of time, you see that 
median compensation has shown very little growth over the last two decades, 
which means that half of Americans have seen stagnation or decline in incomes, 
and that leads to greater anxiety," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The causes of stagnant wages are buried deep in the engine that drives growth 
-- U.S. productivity. While American companies and workers have seen their 
productivity level rise from its 1980s lows, it still has not returned to the 
level of the 1960s. Ultimately, living standards are linked to the nation's 
ability to turn out high-quality products at low prices -- a good definition of 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 The income gap between highly educated workers and unskilled laborers is also 
continuing to widen under Clinton, increasing the sense among Americans that 
the benefits of the recovery are not being equally shared. The top 25% of 
American families accounted for 51.3% of total national income in 1992, up from 
48.2% in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich acknowledges that this trend has not slowed since Clinton's team took 
over, and it has played a role in creating what he terms a new "anxious class" 
of Americans. "The notion that we're creating a bounty of bad jobs is a myth. 
Most new jobs are good jobs. The problem is that the jobs that remain for 
workers without skills or with the wrong skills are becoming grimmer and 
grimmer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's worse for the Administration is that the best economic news may 
already be in the past for Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board's five interest rate hikes this year finally seem to 
be reining in the recovery. And economists fear that Friday's report of a 
slowdown in job growth in August could be a sign that Clinton will have a hard 
time matching the performance of his first two years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mishel said he has told Tyson and other Administration policy-makers to stop 
worrying about the broad macroeconomic measures and begin figuring out how to 
repair frayed American living standards. 
</P>
<P>
 That, of course, is a tall order. The Administration's training, 
apprenticeship and education initiatives are seen as a good start toward 
reducing long-term unemployment, but budget constraints and Clinton's 
commitment to deficit reduction make it unlikely he will ever be able to spend 
much more to spur job growth.

IRKED S. CAROLINA CITY AWASH IN CONFEDERATE FLAGS

<P>
 Hundreds of Confederate battle flags snapped in the breeze of this coastal 
resort Sunday, a fierce answer to an NAACP demand that the rebel banner be 
removed from the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 The flags of all sizes adorned cars and were waved by children and adults at a 
rally that drew about 400 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've given them everything they wanted. Now they want our flag," William G. 
Carter, president of the state chapter of the Council of Conservative Citizens, 
told the cheering, all-white crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was the state campaign manager for David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan 
member who ran for president in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People said Saturday that it 
would hold off imposing an economic boycott on the state to force the flag's 
removal at least until the state Supreme Court rules on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 South Carolina is the only state to fly the rebel banner -- a blue X with 
white stars on a red background -- above its Capitol. Georgia and Mississippi 
include the flag's design on their state flags. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders honor the flag as a tribute to Southern culture and history. 
Opponents say it is a blatant symbol of slavery and bigotry.

 A windblown beach umbrella smacked Gov. Thomas R. Carper in the head, opening 
a gash that needed 14 stitches.

<P>
 The umbrella, yanked from the sand by strong winds, went hurtling along the 
shore Friday, grazing the neck of Carper's 4-year-old son, Benjamin, before 
hitting the governor on his forehead.

 Sunbathers went to help Carper, as did beach patrol members, who applied a

MIKE PENNER: TEAM STUMBLES UPON WINNING PROMOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sunday afternoon, somewhat earlier than expected, the Rams moved. 
</P>
<P>
 They twitched. They stirred. They showed a heartbeat and a blip of brain 
activity and a will to do something -- do anything -- besides mope around the 
homestead for another four wasted months, waiting for the vans to come and cart 
them away. 
</P>
<P>
 You've heard and read about the various potential destinations. Baltimore. St. 
Louis. Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever mentioned first place, which is where the Rams incredibly sit 
today -- in sole possession, at least for the last remaining hours before the 
49ers kick off -- for the first time since October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams won their season opener Sunday, another franchise first since 1989. 
They did so by beating the Arizona Cardinals and Buddy Ryan, 14-12, in the kind 
of performance that might not win them many new fans, but could go a ways 
toward luring back the old ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fans are going to come back and support us," insisted Ram tailback Jerome 
Bettis, whose historic game-winning touchdown plunge wasn't witnessed by many, 
just 32,969, barely more than the recently skinned Pigskin Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been losing, but our fans have got to come back to us. They've got to 
come back to us, so we can pull this thing off." 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping the Rams in Anaheim is the thing, last-ditch and desperate as it may 
be. Stranger things have happened, no doubt, although one fails to come to mind 
at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's a chance, even one in 10,000, it begins here, on the floor and in 
the stands of Anaheim Stadium, where the Rams and their fans have disappointed 
one another for so long. The credibility chasm between this team and Orange 
County wasn't created overnight. There's only one way to bridge it, to abridge 
it, and if you don't know the word for it, Bettis will spot you the first 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a W," he said. "That's the bottom line. We needed a W, and we got it." 
</P>
<P>
 Win. What a concept. For the first time on an opening Sunday this decade the 
Rams tried it, and their jaws dropped at the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans standing on their feet, shouting and begging for hand slaps instead of 
dumping their beer on the Rams as they jog through the north tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans standing on their feet after the sound of the final gun, instead of 
cruising the diamond lane on the southbound 55. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a rare glimpse of life on the other side, and for the Rams, free again 
to leave the field without their helmets buckled up, it felt good. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Knox, unprompted, began shaking writers' hands as he walked out of his 
postgame news conference. His voice was shaking and his eyes were moist. 
</P>
<P>
 For Knox, this was the equivalent of ripping off his shirt, throwing his shoes 
into the whirlpool and turning cartwheels in the trainer's room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm more excited about this one than I've been in a long time," Knox said, 
which was obvious. "There's been a lot to overcome around here and those guys 
in there did it. That's why I'm so proud of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox, much like his team, has been rumored to be out the door any minute. Win 
or else is not the predicament facing him. Win and even that might not be 
enough is closer to the point. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams relocate, the thinking goes, they are going to want to start anew, 
beginning from the top on down. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was big for Chuck," said Chris Miller, the Rams' new quarterback. 
"Definitely big for Chuck. He came in here after the game with a lot of 
excitement. He was very animated." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach and staunch Knox disciple, bristled, 
however, at this line of conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck's been there before," Vitt said. "It's not like this is the first win 
Chuck has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chuck is going to make the Hall of Fame a lot quicker than Buddy Ryan is. 
I've been with Chuck 11 years and every program he's had, he's turned around." 
</P>
<P>
 And the "Chuck's Last Stand" headlines? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's headlines in this town," Vitt snapped. "People around the league and 
our players know that Chuck has done it everywhere he's ever been. This is the 
best talent level he's had here in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the 28 coaches in this league, he's still the best, in my opinion, to 
work for." 
</P>
<P>
 And so what if this victory parade teetered on an overthrown two-point 
conversion attempt by Cardinal quarterback Steve Beuerlein . . . and a certain 
touchdown bomb that trickled through the hands of Cardinal wide receiver Ricky 
Proehl . . . and a Cardinal punt with three minutes left that was fumbled by 
one Bailey, Johnny, and fortuitously recovered by another, Robert? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's football," Knox said. "You coach long enough, you're going to see 
plays like that. Some go for you, some go against you. The bottom line is, we 
won the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who completed just six of 16 passes in his Ram debut, yet left the 
field laughing and flipping the football end over end with his right hand, put 
it more colorfully: 
</P>
<P>
 "That wasn't the prettiest thing in the world. That wasn't a Rembrandt. But 
burn that S.O.B. We won the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of Ram fans saw it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they'll tell a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this is the first step on the road to recovering the Orange County Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat Buddy Day, followed in two weeks by Bring A Buddy Day.

MIKE DOWNEY: CONSIDERING THE FOE, RAMS WERE A SAFE BET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Rams win! Rams win! Rams win! In an NFL season opener between St. Louis past 
and St. Louis future, the winners were the mighty lame ducks from Anaheim, 
14-12, over outspoken Buddy Ryan and his out-chokin' Arizona Cardinals. Put 
that on your Fox network and smoke it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a bright red star on his shirt front and an expression as sad as 
Pagliacci's, poor old Buddy was so stupefied by the defeat that he moaned, "It 
wasn't like we were playing the Dallas Cowboys." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, go punch a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Ryan's hopefuls performed Sunday, they might not have outplayed the 
Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders. The Cardinals were everything you ever wanted in an 
opponent, and less. Anybody who ever got down on the Rams must obviously have 
forgotten the Cardinals' team motto: "You Think YOUR Team Is Bad." Here was the 
one team in football that could make the Rams look like the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 How 'bout them Rams, Bud? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care enough about the Rams to make any statements about them," Ryan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a no-comment out of Buddy, which is tantamount to getting a no-comment 
out of Don King, surely was the ultimate proof that the Rams had had the last 
laugh. The Rams are in first place and nyah, nyah, you're not. This is one of 
those natural phenomena that you only see once in a great while, like a comet 
crashing into Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the "crowd" was 32,969 people without a life. OK, so the only good run 
a Ram made all day was Todd Lyght high-stepping backward into the end zone like 
a crazed drum major. OK, so quarterback Chris Miller didn't exactly light up 
the sky with his six completed passes in 60 minutes of football. The Rams are 
in first place and Buddy Ryan is in a worse place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning," began this very famous head coach who has all of 43 NFL victories, 
"is the name of the game. The bottom line is that we need to finish the plays, 
and we didn't. Our defense didn't turn the ball over and our offense didn't 
score. The referees had us so scared that we were afraid to make a play on 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Say what? 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense played the whole game and didn't even turn the damn ball over. 
That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Wow, we've heard of players being groggy after games, but this is ridiculous. 
Not only did Arizona's defense force a turnover, it forced one on the game's 
first play. It forced a Ram turnover 15 seconds into the game. Buddy might want 
to look into that memory course on TV plugged by Danny Bonaduce. 
</P>
<P>
 Further comment from the Budmeister? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's one: 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked to me like they (the Rams) were dying and we wouldn't kill them." 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy, the trouble is, the Cardinals couldn't kill a roach with a can of Raid. 
Never could. When the going gets tough, the Cardinals don't. Steve Beuerlein 
lofted a pass that led Ricky Proehl like one of those halftime-show guys leads 
a dog with a Frisbee. Put it right on Ricky's fingertips. Rams leading, 14-12, 
but there goes the ballgame. Except the Cardinals couldn't touch it with a 
10-foot Proehl. 
</P>
<P>
 Beuerlein blamed Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't put the onus on other people," said the Cardinal quarterback, one 
of several pro gridders who knows what an onus is. "The bottom line is, I 
didn't play the way I need to play. All of us need to get better, starting with 
myself. We dug ourselves in a hole, and, as Buddy said, we can either pick up 
our skirt and pack it in, or come back next week and play better." 
</P>
<P>
 Say what? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ricky makes that play, maybe we win," Beuerlein continued. "But we had our 
chances. Look at the passes I didn't make. I don't know how many hook patterns 
I bounced in the dirt. Two to Gary Clark and one to Randall Hill at the least. 
You could go down the list." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, some other time. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Buddy will probably go down the list at practice. He should be a 
million laughs. Probably mention how the Cardinals lost to a team that got nine 
first downs. Probably point out that the Cardinals lost to a team that rushed 
for 50 yards -- 52 by Jerome Bettis and minus-two by everybody who isn't Jerome 
Bettis. Probably, oh, you know, point out to the Cardinals that they should 
have slaughtered these Not the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame to lose a game like that," Buddy said, jowls a-drooping. "A game 
we probably should have won. A game I know we should have won." 
</P>
<P>
 That's ridiculous. Why would anybody expect the Rams to lose to a team like 
that?

COULD THIS BE A SUPER BOWL IN SEPTEMBER?; PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDERS AND 49ERS, BOTH 
VASTLY IMPROVED, PLAY TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Never mind the experts. Ignore the predictions. Don't worry about the 
newspapers and magazines and network specials and talk shows and old coaches 
and new commentators who are projecting great things for the Raiders and the 
San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one time when the guessing games aren't necessary. The game will take 
precedence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first 60 minutes of the first Monday night game of this five-month 
season, we should have a pretty good idea of the clubs' strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders and 49ers play at Candlestick Park in what some are saying could 
be a Super Bowl preview. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it tough plunging into the deep water? 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "We are going to play them 
sooner or later. We might as well get started." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as San Francisco Coach George Seifert put it: "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 These teams made a spirited Super Bowl run last season only to be turned away 
by the eventual finalists. Both clubs spent  
</P>
<P>
 a busy off-season making personnel moves to fill the holes that caused them to 
fall short. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders bolstered their running game, 26th in the 28-team league a year 
ago, with the acquisition of fullback Tom Rathman, tailback Harvey Williams and 
offensive lineman Kevin Gogan. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams will open tonight's game on the sideline, unable to bump tailback Ty 
Montgomery out of the starting lineup. But Montgomery, a converted receiver who 
has yet to demonstrate durability or the ability to break tackles, figures to 
share the job with Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 On defense, the Raiders have replaced the retired Howie Long and the departed 
Greg Townsend with the unretired Scott Davis and the untamed Anthony Smith, who 
finally will get a chance to show what he can do as a starter after collecting 
36 sacks over the past three season as a situation player. 
</P>
<P>
 The most pressure will be on second-year man Greg Biekert, who gets his first 
start at middle linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Think San Francisco quarterback Steve Young will notice? 
</P>
<P>
 There are many new faces for the 49ers on defense, an area in which the team 
wound up eighth in the NFC and 15th overall a year ago. The 49ers were spoiled 
by their offense, which was first in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 So owner Eddie DeBartolo pulled out his checkbook and enticed linebackers Ken 
Norton Jr. from the Dallas Cowboys, Rickey Jackson from the New Orleans Saints 
and Gary Plummer from the San Diego Chargers, and defensive lineman Richard 
Dent from the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 If the money hadn't run out, DeBartolo might also have gotten defensive back 
Deion Sanders. That thought alone might have created more support for the 
salary cap around the league than anything Players Assn. head Gene Upshaw has 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy mixing these different players from their different systems and 
coming up with cohesiveness and chemistry. But Seifert isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain amount of excitement to it," he said. "We're fortunate that 
the fellows that we did bring in are all pros from the standpoint that they 
understand the dynamics of professional football. . . . They're not going to 
come here and try to revolutionize things and show everybody here how to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 On offense, Seifert doesn't have to worry about chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 When all else fails, Young to Jerry Rice rarely does, just as Joe Montana to 
Jerry Rice rarely did in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Young has had the highest quarterback rating in the league in each of his 
three full seasons, the only one to achieve that distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rice, with 15 touchdown catches in 16 games last season, needs one more to 
tie Walter Payton, who scored 125 touchdowns in his career, and two more to 
equal Jim Brown's NFL record of 126. 
</P>
<P>
 Those credentials, however, won't impress the Raiders. Rice has never caught a 
touchdown pass against them. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 49ers have failed to score a touchdown in their last two meetings with 
the Raiders, both losses. The Raiders won, 12-6, in 1991 and won, 9-3, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of that will mean much tonight. There are a lot of new faces on both 
teams with new hope for a new season. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody's going to be real disappointed. Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders deactivated running back Calvin Jones, defensive lineman Willie 
Broughton, linebacker James Folston and offensive lineman Rich Stephens to 
reach the 49-man limit. Jones, a rookie, didn't figure to play much behind Ty 
Montgomery and Harvey Williams. Broughton (elbow) and Folston (ankle) are 
injured. The Raiders must deactivate three more players today. . . . San 
Francisco fullback Marc Logan is questionable because of a groin injury. . . . 
The Raiders have beaten the 49ers in five of their seven meetings. The last San 
Francisco victory was by a 34-10 score at the Coliseum in 1985. . . . The 
Raiders are 2-1 against the 49ers at Candlestick Park. RAIDERS

 There was a grand show Sunday in the Grandstand. For once, this court came 
with jesters. 
</P>
<P>
 Their names are Murphy and Luke, the Jensen brothers of tennis fame or 
notoriety, depending upon whom you talk to. They are fun and funny, independent 
and irreverent. And they are loved by the fans who pay the salaries of the 
officials who barely tolerate them. At a time when the entertainment value of 
the game is being questioned everywhere, tennis appears to need the Jensen 
brothers, even if tennis doesn't appear to be happy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jensen brothers play doubles, sometimes quite well. They won the French 
Open last year, much to the disgust of much of the tennis establishment, and 
their road show plays weekly wherever the tour stops. That can be quite jarring 
to a sport that remains, for the most part, white shirts and whispers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to play 52 weeks," Luke said Sunday at the U.S. Open. "We are 
going to have our own tournament the week of Christmas so that we can set a 
record, 52 straight weeks. We'll play ice tennis and we'll win, because we 
won't melt the ice on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Brother Murphy: "Ice, that's our best surface." 
</P>
<P>
 Luke: "It's tough for the other team to get the balls out of the snowbanks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jensen brothers will go anywhere, talk to anybody, do benefits and clinics 
with 10 minutes' notice, and sign autographs till the pens run dry. They are so 
bizarre, they even like reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Their Grandstand match drew a packed house of 5,000. For perspective, it must 
be remembered that this was third-round doubles; normally, that goes on Court 
22, even a week into the tournament. Perry-Budge versus Tilden-Vines wouldn't 
have drawn like that, and people actually liked tennis back then. 
</P>
<P>
 More perspective: The Jensens were facing the team of Palmer-McEnroe, and the 
quietest player on the court was named McEnroe. In this case, however, the 
McEnroe was Patrick, brother of the last player before the Jensens who excited 
the general public about tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 McEnroe and Jared Palmer were seeded seventh, Murphy and Luke unseeded. 
McEnroe and Palmer won, 6-1, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 When the match ended, McEnroe and Palmer sat in the chairs courtside and 
busily packed their bags. Murphy and Luke, responding to squeals from all 
corners of the Grandstand, worked the crowd, signing and signing. It's not that 
they didn't care about "getting smoked," as they later termed it. It's just 
that this pair has a keen sense that the show must go on, win or lose. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a show it is. It's Agassi's rock 'n' roll tennis, times two; MTV with 
rackets. Other players get Grand Slams, the Jensens get groupies. 
</P>
<P>
 They dress alike, but sartorial splendor it is not. Sunday, it was 
white-with-red-stripes Tour de France caps turned backward, gray shirts with 
white stars and red thigh warmers under matching gray shorts. After the first 
game, Luke changed from the cap to a bright orange bandana. 
</P>
<P>
 In the news conference afterward, veteran tennis reporter Bud Collins asked 
the Jensens: "Just how many costumes do you have?" To which Murphy replied: 
"Not as many as Elton John." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the wardrobes comes a show. Luke serves, and sometimes plays, with 
both hands. Often, he will hit a first serve righty and a second serve lefty. 
To his friends, he is dual-hand Luke. 
</P>
<P>
 Have you ever served a double fault, one left and one right, he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did it today," he said. "Do it all the time. I've cranked 'em, shanked 'em. . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 Luke served four times and never held. In his first service game, he served 
right-handed six times and left-handed five. In his last service, at 2-5 of the 
second set, he served right-handed 11 times, left-handed twice. He even had a 
foot fault in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might be really effective," McEnroe joked afterward, "if he could make his 
toss and then decide which hand he's going to hit it with." 
</P>
<P>
 In Luke's defense, it is not that easy serving with different hands while 
leading the crowd in cheers, falling flat on your back after missed shots, 
high-fiving the fans in the front row or imploring the heavens, arms extended 
skyward, to get you out of tight spots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jensens are the Lakers of tennis. When they play, it is Showtime. Their 
opponents, no matter how good they are or how much they resist it, always end 
up being the Washington Generals playing the Harlem Globetrotters. That, of 
course, can't help but bring some bad feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say that many guys didn't come up to us and say, 'Hey you guys, win 
this match,' " said McEnroe, who speculated that while most of the fans were 
rooting for the Jensens, most of the other players were rooting for him and 
Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But yeah, I think they are good for tennis," McEnroe continued. "You get a 
packed house out there for a third-round doubles match; it is great." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jensens played at USC in the late 1980s, so it comes easy for them to 
express their excitement, over things like a packed Grandstand, in Southern 
California-speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like, it is truly awesome," Luke said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the answer is serious, mature and to the point when they are asked what 
advice they'd give to the U.S. Tennis Assn. on improving the popularity of the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could be here all night," Luke said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just keep putting us on TV," Murphy said.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL; FLORIDA'S 70 POINTS AREN'T ENOUGH AS NEBRASKA NO. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<P>
 Florida won its opener by 49 points but it wasn't enough to keep the Gators on 
top of the Associated Press college football poll Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska, which had the weekend off after beating West Virginia, 31-0, in the 
Kickoff Classic on Aug. 28, replaced Florida as the No. 1 team despite the 
Gators' 70-21 rout of New Mexico State Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers, who were No. 4 in the preseason poll before moving up to No. 
2 last week, edged the Gators by three points in the nationwide media poll. 
They received 23 first-place votes and 1,465 points to 15 first-place votes and 
1,462 points for Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first No. 1 AP ranking for Nebraska since late 1987, when it was on 
top for one week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers also replaced the Gators as No. 1 in the USA Today-CNN 
coaches' poll. Florida was second, Florida State third. 
</P>
<P>
 The change didn't seem to bother Gator Coach Steve Spurrier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nebraska was very impressive in their victory," Spurrier said. "I think all 
the coaches saw that game last Sunday, and no one saw us play. Probably the 
feeling around the country is that the Gators ran it up on New Mexico State 
instead of getting all our points in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame was third in the AP poll, followed in the top 10 by Florida State, 
Miami, Michigan, Colorado, Penn State, Arizona and Wisconsin. Alabama was 11th 
and Auburn 12th, followed by UCLA and USC in 13th and 14th. SATURDAY'S LATE 
GAME 
</P>
<P>
 Brigham Young 13, Hawaii 12 -- Running back Jamaal Willis completed an 18-yard 
pass to Mike Johnston, setting up his one-yard scoring dive in the fourth 
quarter Saturday night that gave the Cougars a 13-12 Western Athletic 
Conference victory in Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis was the game's leading rusher with 71 yards in 14 carries.

 NOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle-Washington game drew a crowd of 56,454, the Redskins' 206th 
consecutive sellout at RFK Stadium, the longest streak in the NFL. . . . 
Seattle, winless in season openers since 1988, is now 5-14 in such games. . . . 
It marked the first time in franchise history the Redskins entered a season 
with a quarterback who had not thrown a pass in a Washington uniform. . . . The 
Chiefs' victory over the Saints gave Joe Montana a 15-2 record in games he has 
started against New Orleans. He is 10-0 in the Superdome, 8-0 while with the 
49ers. He also had a victory against Denver in the Super Bowl after the 1989 
season. . . . Kansas City's touchdown on its first series marked the third 
consecutive opener a New Orleans opponent scored on its first drive. . . . 
Marcus Allen's one-yard touchdown for Kansas City in the second quarter was his 
92nd rushing touchdown, fourth-best in history. It also was his 114th career 
touchdown, fifth-best in history. . . . Morten Andersen's 48-yard field goal in 
the second quarter marked the 159th consecutive game in which the Saints' 
kicker has scored at least one point, extending the second longest streak in 
history and longest among active players. . . . The Bengals had never given up 
a punt and kickoff return for a touchdown in the same game until Sunday against 
Cleveland. . . . Coach Dave Shula fell to 8-25 at the start of his third 
season. The Bengals have lost their last nine AFC Central games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Faulk became only the third rookie in Colts' history to rush for 100 
yards in his first game, joining Alan Ameche and Randy McMillan. . . . Ernest 
Givins became Houston's career leader in receiving yards with 65 on three 
receptions, all in the first half. Givins has 7,478 yards, one more than Drew 
Hill. . . . Center Bruce Matthews tied Gregg Bingham and Mike Munchak for 
second place on the Oilers' career list of seasons played, starting his 12th. 
Elvin Bethea holds the club record of 16. . . . The Bears scored three 
offensive touchdowns for the first time since getting four against the 
Buccaneers last year in the third week. . . . The Minnesota Vikings lost for 
only the fourth time in 17 games against NFC Central rivals during Coach Dennis 
Green's tenure. . . . The Packers' Sterling Sharpe extended his team record to 
88 games in which he has caught at least one pass. . . . Redskin receiver Henry 
Ellard became the 12th player in history to catch 600 passes, on a reception in 
the last play of the third quarter. . . . Dave Meggett needs just 231 more punt 
return yards to move past Emlen Tunnell in first place on the Giants' career 
punt return yardage list. . . . Rodney Hampton now needs just 20 yards to move 
past Ron Johnson (3,732) into third place on the Giants' career rushing list. . 
. . The Cowboys haven't yielded a first-half touchdown in their last six 
regular-season games dating to a 16-14 Thanksgiving Day loss to Miami. They 
have permitted only 17 touchdowns in their last 16 regular-season games. FEW 
CONVERTS TO NEW RULE 
</P>
<P>
 NFL coaches, given a chance to wheel and deal, looked at the new two-point 
conversion and decided -- surprise! -- to play it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Only nine of 70 touchdowns resulted in two-point tries during afternoon games. 
Of the nine attempts, four were successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland holder Tom Tupa became the first player to score under the new rule, 
running in after a fake kick. Miami's Terry Kirby also ran in from the 2-yard 
line and Houston's Bucky Richardson passed to Pat Carter for the other 
successful conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers, Arizona and Pittsburgh failed on two-point passes. 
</P>
<P>
 In exhibition games, coaches were much more willing to take advantage of the 
new option. Of the 251 touchdowns, there were 65 two-point tries (26%). Teams 
were successful on 26 (40%) of their two-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first season the NFL has permitted two-point tries. The old AFL 
allowed them, as do current college rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirby scored on a dive play, pulling Miami within 21-18 midway through the 
third quarter. The Dolphins wound up beating New England, 39-35. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two-point conversion was important because it put the Patriots in 
position where they had to go for a touchdown at the end," Miami coach Don 
Shula said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Belichick, Cleveland's usually conservative coach, surprised Cincinnati 
with a two-pointer that made it 11-0 late in the first quarter. The Browns 
lined up to kick, but Tupa, a reserve quarterback, ran through a big hole on 
the left side. Cleveland won, 28-20. BACK (SOB) IN NEW YORK.... 
</P>
<P>
 While Fox showed off its new NFL cast, CBS, which had televised NFL games 
since 1956, aired paid programming from 12-12:30 p.m., then began 5 1/2 hours 
of U.S. Open tennis coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 At the National Tennis Center, CBS Sports veteran Pat O'Brien opened the 
tennis coverage like this: "In an environment where all channels look the same, 
we offer an alternative. Welcome to OUR pre-game show." 
</P>
<P>
 In the background was a monitor tuned in to Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 A sanguine O'Brien said CBS realizes what has been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we the headline of the day?" he said. "Absolutely not. It's the first day 
of football. With no baseball and people dying to get involved with their 
teams, that's the headline." WELCOME BACK, WE GUESS 
</P>
<P>
 Sterling (No Comment) Sharpe, who walked out on the Green Bay Packers the day 
before their opener but returned the same day -- reportedly after he was 
promised a $7 million bonus next season -- caught a 14-yard touchdown pass in 
the Packers' 16-10 victory over the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates were happy to see him, in a way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said something he probably didn't like, but he went out and played his head 
off," said Packers quarterback Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Mike Holmgren: "Say what you want to, these types of things are 
distracting. I applaud the players for playing as well as they did through 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe, as usual, had no comment. WE'RE STILL WITH YOU, NORV 
</P>
<P>
 Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke, whose impatience is legendary, fired Coach 
Richie Petitbon after one season and replaced him with Cowboys' offensive 
coordinator Norv Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's offense, looking anything but coordinated, wilted Sunday in a 28-7 
loss at home to the Seahawks. Starting quarterback John Friesz was intercepted 
twice. No. 1 pick Heath Shuler was sacked twice in his first two possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Seahawk Coach Tom Flores: "Washington is going through what we were going 
through the past few years." THERE'S A NEW MARSHALL IN TOWN 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Marshall Faulk, NFL superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 In his pro debut, the former San Diego State ace rushed for 143 yards and 
three touchdowns for the Colts. He'd have done more but Coach Ted Marchibroda 
took him out midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The butterflies weren't there today," said Faulk. "I knew what I had to do. 
The offensive line told me what to do. They told me, you can run the ball in 
this league. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt great getting into the open field. But it's not the long runs that 
really got us to win this game. It's the constant first downs, the banging for 
five and 10 yards and getting in on third-and-one and getting the first downs. 
That's what got us to win this game." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Oilers Coach Jack Pardee: "He was a great player today. He's going to 
have a great career if some catastrophe doesn't happen. He can run the ball, he 
has great vision, great speed and does it all. We couldn't tackle him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts won, 45-21. All six Indianapolis touchdowns were scored by players 
who had joined the team since the end of last season when it went 4-12. THAT'S 
THE TRICK 
</P>
<P>
 NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the league is considering a new method of 
solving the difficult problem of realignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Pull the new divisions out of a hat. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not another Fox promotion. He actually said this. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would take two or three plans that were all approved by 21 owners, and 
then draw one at random," Tagliabue said before the Steelers-Cowboys game. 
"That way, it would be equal risk and benefit for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue, who said a resolution on expansion-forced realignment would 
probably not take place in late September as once hoped, noted that there was 
precedent for such a blind draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Rozelle did the same thing in 1969, the last time there was 
realignment," Tagliabue said. "As long as each of the two or three plans was 
approved by the owners, everybody would have a chance to benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue's other alternative is to drop the Charlotte Hornets into the AFC 
Central and Jacksonville Jaguars into the NFC West, as those are the two 
conferences with just four teams. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he might still pursue that alternative as a last resort. INJURY REPORT 
</P>
<P>
 Oiler quarterback Cody Carlson, starting his first game after the departure of 
Warren Moon, suffered a second-degree separation of his left shoulder and left 
the game in the third quarter. . . . Redskin safety Keith Taylor suffered a 
third-degree tear of his right Achilles' tendon on a non-contact play in the 
fourth quarter and will be out for the season. Taylor was scheduled to undergo 
surgery at Arlington Hospital on Sunday night. QUOTEWORTHY 
</P>
<P>
 Saints lineman Frank Warren after the Chiefs' Joe Montana passed for 315 yards 
and ran his Superdome record to 10-0: "The guy is unbelievable. He hasn't lost 
a thing. He comes here and waves his magic wand around and we all fall down. 
It's unbelievable, except it keeps happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Simms' replacement, Giant quarterback Dave Brown, after beating the 
Eagles, 28-23: "I have a lot more respect for Phil having gone through it for 
15 years here. I might have aged 30 years in this game here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons' Andre Rison, after a 31-28 overtime loss to the Lions: "We play 
the Rams next week. And I'm guaranteeing a win. You can put that out all over 
the country, I'm guaranteeing we'll win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Lion Jason Hanson, who kicked a game-winning 37-yard field goal in overtime 
after injuring his leg making a tackle: "I couldn't feel a thing. It was all a 
blur. I even missed the net on the sideline when I tried a practice kick." HOW

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: BRADSHAW RIDES TO FORE IN FOX'S GRAND OPENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wow, was that a rip-roaring opening or what? 
</P>
<P>
 To signify the start of the NFL on Fox, Terry Bradshaw, decked out in Cowboy 
duds, came riding in on a horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "New frontier, same game," proclaimed Cowboy Terry. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's first one-hour pregame show Sunday got off to a brilliant start, thanks 
to Bradshaw and segment producer Andrew Becker, who came up with the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 It became clear from the start that Bradshaw is the star of this show, and it 
was soon apparent that he also has a strong supporting cast. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Howie Long was smooth, although once he had to look down to check his 
notes. His Buddy Ryan feature was the day's best, and his comment that the 
Buffalo Bills won't be back in the Super Bowl because they "are at the end of 
their talent cycle" was one of the day's strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 The other rookie, Jimmy Johnson, should work out fine. His playbook segment on 
the Steelers' defensive options against Cowboy receivers was a highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Host James Brown was upbeat and nearly flawless. 
</P>
<P>
 No F for Fox on Day 1. Overall, the pregame deserved about a B+. 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the downside: The puff piece entertainment reporter Lonnie Lardner did 
on Troy Aikman was sickeningly syrupy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lardner said things like, "There isn't a bigger star in the Lone Star State 
than Troy Aikman, and he can't for the life of him figure out why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, Lonnie, he can probably figure it out. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was this: "Could a woman stop you from playing football?" 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about a stupid question. 
</P>
<P>
 Lardner finished off her segment by gushing that Aikman "exudes sincerity, 
honesty and integrity, just like our man James Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of Brown, at 9:43 he told viewers that "most of you will not be going 
out to a game, but some of you will be back here." He then said, "We thank you 
very much for joining us." 
</P>
<P>
 It was confusing if you weren't paying close attention, since it sounded as if 
the show was over. In Los Angeles, it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 And this brings up a very sore point. Here, we went from the debut of Fox's 
pregame show to professional wrestling. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox lost its audience because of that old antiquated NFL rule that does not 
allow a network to televise a doubleheader in a market in which a game is 
taking place. And since the Rams were home, that was the case Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 So L.A. was deprived of the Philadelphia-New York Giant game. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd think that since Rupert Murdoch is paying the NFL $1.58 billion, he 
might be able to use his influence to get rid of this ridiculous rule. He'd be 
a hero if he could. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Fox's game coverage, which finally got under way at 1 p.m. with the 
Cowboys and Steelers, we've mentioned before our feeling about the 
score-and-time-remaining graphic. It's a good idea, just take it down during 
live action. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't go up Sunday until there was 2:43 left in the first quarter. But 
that was because of computer problems. It normally will go up after the first 
series or two. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fox's last exhibition telecast, in Chicago, it didn't go up until the 
second half, but that was because Fox had problems synchronizing its clock with 
the stadium clock at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
 One area Fox needs to improve is giving updates from other games. It could 
take a lesson from NBC here. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main thing is, Fox was off and running Sunday, and without any major 
glitches. And there are a few people at the network breathing a little easier 
today.

LYGHT, THE DEFENSE SPOIL RYAN'S DEBUT; FOOTBALL: CORNERBACK'S 74-YARD FUMBLE 
RETURN IS ONE OF SEVERAL BIG PLAYS MADE BY UNIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram cornerback Todd Lyght figured he had this opportunity coming, so he 
climbed on his soap box, made sure the microphones were live and actually 
talked about life in a winning locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a statement today," said Lyght, whose 74-yard fumble return for a 
touchdown helped the Rams beat Arizona, 14-12, Sunday at Anaheim Stadium, 
spoiling Buddy Ryan's regular-season debut as the Cardinals' head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people counted us out and wrote bad things about us. But we weren't 
worried about that. We heard about Buddyball, Buddyball and all that. Well, we 
came out and beat them. And the score doesn't matter, we don't care. If we win, 
2-0, we'll take it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght certainly will, especially since the Rams have won only 15 times in 49 
games since drafting him in the first round out of Notre Dame in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning? A totally new concept for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played organized sports since the second grade, and I had never played 
on a losing team until, finally, I get to the NFL," Lyght said. "It was 
everything I had worked so hard for, and to be part of a losing team was tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I've learned how to lose . . . and that's not a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But today, the Rams are 1-0 after winning their first season-opener in six 
years, and they're in first place in the NFC West for the first time since 
October, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 They are in first place largely because of the defense, which had allowed 58 
points during the past five quarters of an 0-4 exhibition season, gave up only 
one touchdown despite being on the field for more than 38 minutes in humid, 
87-degree weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was exhausted out there," said defensive end Fred Stokes, playing in his 
first game since coming off a sprained left knee in training camp. "It was hot, 
but we had to keep fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither heat, humidity, nor the Cardinal offensive line could disturb a Ram 
pass rush that was healthy for the first time in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Robert Young, whose fast start last season was cut short by a 
knee injury, contributed two sacks for minus 14 yards. Pro Bowl defensive 
tackle Sean Gilbert was back after missing nearly two weeks because of a 
sprained ankle. And Stokes contributed two tackles and shared a sack with David 
Rocker, who spelled Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the Rams sacked Arizona quarterback Steve Beuerlein four times for 
minus 30 yards, including Jimmie Jones' 10-yard sack at the Cardinal six-yard 
line on their last possession of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals gained only 230 yards total offense, the fewest the Ram defense 
has allowed since giving up 175 against Pittsburgh in the second week of last 
season. Arizona tailback Ron Moore, who ripped the Rams for 129 yards and three 
touchdowns in a 38-10 Arizona victory last season, was used primarily as a 
decoy Sunday, gaining only 65 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense won it for us," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "They made play after 
play after play." 
</P>
<P>
 The big plays: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lyght, beaten in the end zone by Ricky Proehl late in the second quarter, 
closed the gap and knocked the ball away at the last moment. 
</P>
<P>
 * An interception by starting strong safety Marquez Pope early in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * A fourth-quarter interception by rookie free safety Keith Lyle at the Rams' 
30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cornerback Robert Bailey's recovery of a muffed punt return by teammate 
Johnny Bailey at the Rams' 44 with 2 minutes 49 seconds left, the biggest 
special teams play for the Rams in a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 * A dropped ball by Cardinal wide receiver Proehl, who had beaten Ram 
cornerback Steve Israel by three steps, took his eye off the ball at the Rams' 
10 and dropped a sure touchdown with 7:49 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lyght's 74-yard fumble return, which broke the Rams' record of 54 yards set 
by Jack Dwyer in 1952 against San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Joe Kelly forced the fumble when his arm knocked the ball loose 
from running back Larry Centers on a sweep play. The ball sailed right into the 
waiting arms of Lyght, who ran untouched down the left sideline and taunted the 
Cardinals by backpedaling the final five yards into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's with Lyght's new attitude? 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the play they were showing highlights of guys running into the end 
zone real sweet (on the scoreboard)," Lyght said. "So I said to myself, 'I'm 
going to do something stupid.' "

PRO FOOTBALL: RAMS 14, ARIZONA CARDINALS 12; BEUERLEIN TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR 
CARDINAL LOSS; FOOTBALL: WITH PLENTY OF CHANCES TO PASS OFF THE BLAME, 
QUARTERBACK CALLS HIS OWN NUMBER. 
</P>

<P>
 Arizona Cardinals' quarterback Steve Beuerlein took that long, slow, walk 
normally reserved for Ram quarterbacks. You know it, that helmet-in-hand, dirge 
of a stroll to the losers' locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of things to think about after the 14-12 loss to the Rams on 
Sunday. Mainly, how could a team so many predict will go to the playoffs lose 
to a team so many predict is going nowhere -- except Baltimore, St. Louis or 
Hartford, Conn.? 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Beuerlein had showered, he was ready to point a finger -- at 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go down the list and ask what happened, what happened, what 
happened?" said Beuerlein, a Servite High graduate. "The bottom line is I 
didn't play the way I needed to play." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a painful statement of the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Beuerlein was an all-too-familiar figure at Anaheim Stadium, one Ram fans have 
seen before. He overthrew receivers. He underthrew receivers. He appeared to 
panic under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 At times he looked more like Jim Everett than Everett himself. Only difference 
was Beuerlein was taking the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind there were others around to shoulder the burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Ricky Proehl dropped a sure touchdown pass in the fourth 
quarter. He was open on the 10-yard line, but the ball bounced off his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 So there was Proehl to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened exactly," Beuerlein said. "I heard he had a chance 
to make the play. Ricky makes that play nine times out of 10. I didn't see the 
play, I was on my back." 
</P>
<P>
 So there was the offensive line to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had people in my face, but that would be putting it on someone else," 
Beuerlein said. "The Rams played more man-to-man than we expected. They blitzed 
a few more times than we expected." 
</P>
<P>
 So there were the Rams to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was nothing major," Beuerlein said. "I had chances to make plays and I 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 So we're back to Square 1. There was Beuerlein to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers support that. Beuerlein was 18 of 40 for 158 yards with two passes 
intercepted. This against a secondary that quarterbacks feasted on during the 
exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were guys open and I've got to make the throws," Beuerlein said. "I 
didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 And he deteriorated as the game went on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals had possession three times in the fourth quarter, trailing, 
14-12. All they needed was a field goal. But Beuerlein was one of seven in the 
final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 He did get the Cardinals to the Ram 34 early in the quarter. On first down he 
underthrew Proehl, who had beaten Todd Lyght deep. On second down, Beuerlein's 
pass in the flat was intercepted by Keith Lyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw some good passes and he threw some that hit the ground," Coach Buddy 
Ryan said. "He's like everybody else, he's hit and miss." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Beuerlein had only one that was really a hit, a three-yard touchdown 
pass to Lance Centers in the third quarter. It pulled the Cardinals to within 
two, 14-12. But glee was fleeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals went for two points. Beuerlein was chased from the pocket and 
his pass landed near the brass section of the Ram band. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how many hook patterns I bounced in the dirt," he said. "There 
were two to Gary Clark and one to Randall Hill. He was 20 yards away from me 
and no one was between us and I bounced it in the dirt. You can't explain that 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor could he explain the five times the Cardinals were in Ram territory in the 
first half, and the mere six points they had to show for it. Beuerlein misfired 
four times with third-down passes and the Cardinals had to settle for two Greg 
Davis field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to give the Rams credit for making big plays," Beuerlein said. "But 
I also have to look in the mirror."

NHL CAMPS; DUCKS; TWO MILLIONAIRE TEENS WILL GRAB MOST ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks' new teen-age millionaires, Paul Kariya and Oleg Tverdovsky, 
have arrived for their first training camp with full pockets but not much 
swagger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me Mr. Wilson again," Coach Ron Wilson said of Kariya, 19. 
</P>
<P>
 At 39, Wilson isn't even called Coach by most of his players, but simply Ron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to call him Dennis, as in Dennis the Menace, until he stops," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, the former Hobey Baker winner at the University of Maine who starred 
for Canada in the Olympics and World Championships, finally signed a three-year 
$6.5-million contract last week -- a full 14 months after the Ducks took him 
fourth in the 1993 NHL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, everyone is pretty much mister to me," said Kariya, who will take 
the ice with his new teammates for the first time today in a public session at 
The Pond of Anaheim. "It's something I was brought up with, respecting your 
elders as people who have a lot more experience in life. Teammates are always 
personal, but coaches and management are mister to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky, 18, an offensively talented defenseman with as youthful a face as 
Kariya, is far less well-known. He was a higher draft pick than Kariya, going 
second overall in June, but his contract will pay him $2.3 million less over 
three years. Tverdovsky said: "That's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 "One shouldn't really make that comparison because Kariya is the champion of 
the world and an offensive player," Tverdovsky said through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya and Tverdovsky are the highest-profile additions to the team, but 
General Manager Jack Ferreira has made a number of moves to strengthen a team 
that won 33 games in its first season -- sharing an NHL record with Florida -- 
but had the NHL's worst power play. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kurvers, a veteran defenseman and power-play specialist, was acquired from 
the New York Islanders in exchange for captain Troy Loney in a draft-day trade. 
Another draft-day trade brought stay-at-home defenseman Robert Dirk from 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ferreira signed winger Valeri Karpov, the team's 1993 third-round 
pick who played for Russia at Lillehammer, and Nikolai Tsulygin, a talented but 
inexperienced defenseman who was the team's second-round pick in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Randy Ladouceur will be the new team captain, replacing Loney, who 
was traded to the New York Islanders in June.

NHL CAMPS; KINGS; ATMOSPHERE HAS CHANGED ALONG WITH THE FACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Training camp resembled a joyous family reunion last season for the Kings, 
surrounded by a happy glow befitting a Stanley Cup finalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the opposite has happened now after the Kings went on to miss the 
playoffs by a 16-point margin, finishing their season on April 14. The group 
has splintered with the departures of team president Roy Mlakar, general 
manager Nick Beverley, director of player personnel Bob Owen and Luc 
Robitaille, one of the team's most popular players, who was traded to 
Pittsburgh for Rick Tocchet in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lesser players have been traded or released: defensemen Doug Houda, 
Brent Thompson, Mark Hardy and Jim Paek and forwards Phil Crowe and Rob Murphy. 
Dave Taylor retired after a distinguished 17-year NHL career with the Kings and 
was named an assistant to the general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new faces is general manager Sam McMaster, whose initiation has been 
hectic because of a rush of trades, contracts and a lengthy round of 
negotiations with restricted free agent defenseman Rob Blake. On Sunday, Blake 
reached a tentative agreement on a four-year deal, which is subject to league 
approval over contract language. Blake's agent, Ron Salcer, said the defenseman 
probably would not start practicing until the deal is cleared. The team's first 
training camp practice at Iceoplex in North Hills is today. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Tocchet, among the other newcomers at camp will be forwards Rob 
Brown, Dan Quinn, Matt Johnson and Yanic Perreault and defensemen Sean 
O'Donnell and Michel Petit. Perhaps the most intriguing addition is 18-year-old 
goaltender Jamie Storr, the Kings' first-round draft pick (seventh overall) in 
June. Storr has a chance to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best junior goalie I've seen at that level and that includes pretty 
good goalies," McMaster said. "Don Beaupre played with Minnesota as an underage 
junior, and I think he (Storr) is more prepared than Don was at that time and 
more prepared than (Tom) Barrasso." 
</P>
<P>
 The other significant new player in camp is Tocchet, whose production dwindled 
to 14 goals and 40 points last season in 51 games due to an ailing back, and he 
had off-season surgery. Coach Barry Melrose said Tocchet has been skating and 
laughed when reporters looked surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, he's not coming here in a wheelchair," Melrose said.

 At long last, Paul Kariya has arrived, and he quickly issued a word to the 
wise Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd advise people in California to stay off the streets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, 19, finally got his driver's license this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 And you thought it took him a long time to sign with the Mighty Ducks? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say, it was probably the biggest achievement of my life," Kariya 
said -- meaning the license. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a young man whose "What I Did This Summer" essay would include winning 
a gold medal for Canada at the World Championships and signing a three-year, 
$6.5 million contract with the Ducks. And getting his license comes in at No. 
1? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a lot of accidents when I was with my friends when they first got 
their licenses at 16 or 17," said Kariya, who had little reason to drive when 
he played junior hockey in Penticton, Canada, or at Maine. "I was so afraid to 
get it." 
</P>
<P>
 There were no serious injuries in the accidents, but Kariya, who was the 
passenger in a car that spun five or six times, prefers to do his 360s on the 
ice. He realized, though, that it would be tough to be an NHL player in 
Southern California if he had to find a ride to practice every day. 
</P>
<P>
 So did he cruise up in a BMW convertible on his first day at work? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, that's the farthest thing from my mind," said Kariya, who will take 
the shuttle bus from the hotel to the arena. "I don't even want to think about 
getting a car. I want to have a good training camp and make the team." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New captain: Randy Ladouceur will be captain, replacing Troy Loney, who was 
traded to the New York Islanders in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladouceur -- who at 34 is the Ducks' oldest player -- has been an NHL team 
captain before (Hartford). A stay-at-home defenseman preparing for his 13th NHL 
season, Ladouceur was an assistant captain last season, as were Todd Ewen and 
Stu Grimson. Coach Ron Wilson, who probably will announce his decision today, 
picked Ladouceur to replace Loney, keeping Ewen and Grimson as assistants and 
naming Bob Corkum as an assistant. Corkum also replaces Loney as the team's 
representative in the NHL Players Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Modest pair: Kariya and Oleg Tverdovsky, the Ducks' two teen-age millionaires, 
have arrived for their first training camp with bulging pockets but not much 
swagger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me Mr. Wilson again, " Coach Ron Wilson said of Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 At 39, Wilson isn't even called Coach by most of his players, simply Ron. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, everyone is pretty much mister to me," said Kariya, who will take 
the ice with his teammates for the first time around 2:30 p.m. today in a 
public session at The Pond. "It's something I was brought up with, respecting 
your elders as people who have a lot more experience in life. Teammates are 
always personal, but coaches and management are mister to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Tverdovsky, 18, an offensively talented defenseman with as youthful a face as 
Kariya, is far less well-known. He actually was a higher draft pick than 
Kariya, going second overall in June (Kariya was fourth last year), but his 
contract will pay him $2.3 million less over three years. Tverdovsky said 
"that's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 "One shouldn't really make that comparison because Kariya is the champion of 
the world and an offensive player," Tverdovsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya benched: Neither Kariya nor Tverdovsky is expected to be in uniform for 
the Ducks' first exhibition game Sunday against the Kings at the San Diego 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't anticipate those guys playing in a game like that," Wilson said. "I 
expect that game to be physical, and that's because the Kings have spent all 
summer trying to become more physical, and I think that's a response to us. 
We'll dress as big and physical a team as we can. I expect the Kings to do the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya and Tverdovsky are more likely to play Sept. 13 at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Labor update: Players paid their travel expenses to camp and will not receive 
per diem under unilateral rule changes Commissioner Gary Bettman imposed 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "No meal money and no training camp expenses definitely doesn't make the 
players that happy," Corkum said. "But we realize it's not something just 
Disney is doing, it's the league collectively. We'll still go work as hard as 
we can and come to work with smiles on our faces."

MINOR LEAGUE NOTEBOOK / ELLIOTT TEAFORD; DREAM TEAM MAKES UP FOR NIGHTMARE 
SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Casualties of the major league players strike continue to pile up. The latest 
victims also are players. Major league rosters would have expanded from 25 
players to 40 last Thursday, but the strike wiped out promotions for top minor 
league prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, The Times picks the first, and hopefully last, 
I-Shoulda-Been-Promoted Team, which includes the best and brightest Orange 
County minor leaguers. Sorry, no cash awards, just your name in the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not an all-star team, mind you, but a collection of the top triple-A 
producers this season. There are a few double-A and Class-A talents included, 
but primarily these are the guys who woulda, shoulda, coulda received a ticket 
to The Show for September. 
</P>
<P>
 You might notice the team is heavy on outfielders, because, well, there are a 
lot of good outfielders from Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The squad: FIRST BASE 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Pirkl (Los Alamitos High), Calgary, triple A -- Started his career as a 
catcher because he believed it was the fastest way to the majors. Turned out 
the Seattle Mariners were short on first basemen. Spent time in Seattle at the 
beginning of the season. Hitting .317 for Calgary. SECOND BASE 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Sisco (Cal State Fullerton), Wilmington, Del., Class A -- Always good 
field, good hit and a backbone for the Titans, Sisco batted .277 for the 
Royals' Carolina League team. Without the strike, he might have been pushed 
ahead to double A. SHORTSTOP 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Bates (Esperanza), Colorado Springs, triple A -- A product of the Aztec 
baseball machine, Bates impressed the Colorado Rockies enough to jump from 
short-season A ball to triple A last season. He improved his hitting this 
season, raising his average 21 points, to .288. THIRD BASE 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Nevin (Cal State Fullerton), Tucson, triple A -- Without some guy named 
Ken Caminiti entrenched at third for the Houston Astros, Nevin surely would 
have played in the majors this season. Still, he had a solid season for the 
club's top minor league affiliate, hitting .263 with 79 runs batted in. A cinch 
for a September call-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Paquette (Golden West), Tacoma, triple A -- Spent 105 games playing for 
Oakland last season, his first major league experience. He had a strong season 
for Tacoma, certainly worthy of another look as the A's battled the Angels 
(just kidding) for the American League West championship. Batted .286. OUTFIELD 
</P>
<P>
 James Buccheri (Golden West), Tacoma, triple A -- Spent his third consecutive 
season at Tacoma, and this month might have been his time for a cup of coffee 
in Oakland. Batted .303, his best average in triple A. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Cordova (Orange Coast), Salt Lake, triple A -- Rated the Minnesota 
Twins' fifth-best prospect, Cordova made a huge jump this season. Batted .354 
in 101 games in his first season at triple A. He was only a .250 hitter at 
double A in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Gipson (Loara High), Riverside, Class A -- Every so often a 63rd-round 
pick will surprise you. Gipson has grabbed the Mariners' attention with a .292 
average and 33 stolen bases in 127 games. Only his third season in pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Green (Tustin High), Syracuse, triple A -- The Toronto Blue Jays' top 
draft pick in 1991, Green has developed quickly. Spent time in Toronto at 
midseason, but returned to triple A when he didn't appear quite ready for the 
big leagues. Batting .344 in 109 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Newfield (Marina High), Calgary, triple A -- Seattle's top pick (sixth 
overall) in '90 and he was the fourth-youngest player in the majors at the end 
of last season. This was his first season at triple A. His .349 average, 19 
homers and 83 RBIs were head-turning numbers. CATCHER 
</P>
<P>
 CATCHER 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Moler (Cal State Fullerton), Reading, Pa., double A -- No, he wasn't 
going to take Darren Daulton's position away in Philadelphia, but Moler proved 
to be a pretty fair hitter. Batted .284. PITCHER 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Hansell (Kennedy High), Albuquerque, triple A -- Considering the dismal 
shape of the Dodger bullpen, it seemed only natural that Hansell would be 
called up at midseason. The prospects of a strike kept him in the minors, 
though. Perhaps it was for the best. With a 10-2 record and a 3.02 earned-run 
average in 46 appearances, 40 in relief, Hansell had his best season since 
going 14-5 with a 2.87 ERA at Class-A Bakersfield in '91. Roomed with catcher 
Mike Piazza at Bakersfield, San Antonio and Albuquerque. The two should have 
been reunited by now. Wait until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 MVP -- Hansell. The 6-foot-5 right-handed reliever is Orange County's prospect 
of the year.

<P>
 The Vaqueros won the 1992 Division II title with 10 returning starters and the 
past two Division IV titles with four returning starters. Five are back this 
year. There's certainly help on the way: Last year's freshman and sophomore 
teams were undefeated. Deal, a legitimate talent, is battling Clark and Gaitor 
to fill the shoes of Tony Mathis (1,839 yards, 26 touchdowns) as Irvine tries 
to win an unprecedented fourth consecutive section championship. Hagstrom was a 
first-team all-leaguer; Clark and Miele made the second team. Larsen replaces 
QB Mike Phelps (24 TDs, 2,233 yards); like Phelps, Larsen won't throw a varsity 
pass until his senior year. SCHEDULE

<P>
 Santa Margarita took a big hit with the graduation of receiver/defensive back 
twins Brian and Brad Finneran, who got full scholarships to Villanova. So, the 
Eagles look to their strength, running behind that huge offensive line anchored 
by Beckett and Farris. Both are mobile, being recruited heavily and have 
already received scholarship offers. Newman and Garrigan should gain some 
serious yardage, and Collins will be a good complement. With similar talent in 
1990, the Eagles also ran the ball and went 12-1. Though favored in some 
circles, Hartigan says the title still must be won against the Irvine schools.

 The Chargers, coming over from the South Coast League, didn't catch any breaks 
in the realignment. Still, they have the makings of a competitive team with 
strong, experienced offensive and defensive lines. Three of four starters 
return in the secondary, but linebackers lack varsity experience. Hanaway 
provides an offensive threat at tailback, and Wilson was 18 of 25 in his only 
start at quarterback. SCHEDULE

 Irvine won its third consecutive Southern Section title behind the rushing of 
Tony Mathis and the impressive play of quarterback Mike Phelps, the league's 
top two performers at their positions. The Vaqueros still have not lost a 
league game since joining the Sea View League in 1992; during its 10-game 
winning streak to finish the season, Irvine survived three close calls, beating 
Corona del Mar, 23-20, Santa Margarita, 29-26, and Foothill in the Division IV 
semifinals, 27-24. Another team that beat Foothill was Woodbridge, but despite 
a 7-3 overall record and a 4-3 league finish, the Warriors took fifth place and 
missed the playoffs. Santa Margarita lost a nail-biter in the first round of 
the playoffs, 25-20, to La Verne Damien, ending the high school careers of 
twins Brian and Brad Finneran, who were all-county performers at wide receiver 
and defensive back. Corona del Mar won its final three games by an average 36-9 
score, but lost its first-round playoff game to Villa Park, 30-28. Then the Sea 
Kings lost their coach, Dave Holland, who had a 106-92-10 record over two 
tenures, 1967-75, 1983-93. Holland left to become defensive coordinator at 
Grossmont College in El Cajon.

OUTLOOK 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor has reached the Southern Section playoffs 10 of the past 12 
years, and will again challenge for a berth. The Sailors' strength is defense, 
where they return six starters, including McDonough, who continues in the long 
line of standout linebackers, and Johnson, who has been impressive at 
cornerback. If Newport does struggle, it will probably be on offense, where the 
line is smallish--though physically strong--and rebuilding. Riggle and Johnson 
combined for only 25 carries last year. Lacking a tailback like the graduated 
Wade Tift (5.2 yards per carry), the offense will diversify, which puts 
pressure on Giordani to get the ball to Freeman, a big-time tight end and a 
three-year starter. Moureaux, a transfer from Kentucky, might be a key two-way 
starter. SCHEDULE

 The Warriors appear primed for serious league championship and Southern 
Section playoff runs. Woodbridge was the best non-playoff team in the division, 
maybe the section, last year, and seems to have the talent and experience to 
challenge rival Irvine. The linebacking corps, led by all-county player 
Dominelli, is solid, and Wakefield can be a dangerous runner--he averaged more 
than six yards per carry. SCHEDULE

 The Sea Kings made a good first impression on Schuster, their new coach, 
showing a good attitude and willingness to work. Those elements will have to 
make up for the need for more players. "If we lose kids," Schuster said, "we 
have to fill three positions: on offense, defense and special teams." 
Perlmutter and Taketa should have good years again. There was a chemistry 
between them a year ago--30% of Perlmutter's 70 completed passes were to 
Taketa. McDonald has been a real find, and Hogan and DiCesare are also expected 
to produce bigyears. SCHEDULE

KINGS GET TENTATIVE DEAL WITH FREE AGENT BLAKE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rob Blake, the Kings' free-agent defenseman, reached a tentative agreement 
Sunday on a four-year deal, which is subject to league approval over contract 
language. Blake's agent, Ron Salcer, said the defenseman probably would not 
start practicing with the Kings until the deal is cleared.The team's first 
training camp practice at Iceoplex in North Hills is today. 
</P>
<P>
 Those expected in camp include newcomers Rick Tocchet, Rob Brown, Dan Quinn, 
Matt Johnson, Yanic Perreault, Sean O'Donnell and Michel Petit. Perhaps the 
most intriguing addition is 18-year-old goaltender Jamie Storr, the Kings' 
first-round draft pick (seventh overall) in June. Storr has a chance to make 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best junior goalie I've seen at that level and that includes pretty 
good goalies," Kings General Manager Sam McMaster said. "Don Beaupre played 
with Minnesota as an underage junior, and I think he (Storr) is more prepared 
than Don was at that time and more prepared than (Tom) Barrasso." LISA DILLMAN

PROFESSOR STUART LEADS COUNTRY HISTORY CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NOEL DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marty Stuart knows all about traditions, and the legacy of those who came 
before him. At Knott's Berry Farm on Saturday night, his energetic first set -- 
16 songs over the course of an hour -- was so full of references to the 
hillbilly heroes of the past that on one level, it amounted to a high-voltage 
tour through the history of country music. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, such influences were so thoroughly integrated with Stuart's own rock 'n' 
roll/'90s perspective that he not only showcased country's past but its 
probable future as well. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening twang of his Telecaster, Stuart's licks -- and his moves -- 
seemed simultaneously familiar and new. He started with a pair of Merle Haggard 
standards, "Swingin' Doors" and "Today I Started Loving You Again," but he 
revved them up to a blistering rock 'n' roll energy level. With his frisky 
young five-piece band, the Rock 'n' Roll Cowboys, holding the pace, he stepped 
out for blazing guitar solos and further livened things up with some 
rubber-legged hip-shaking borrowed from another legendary hillbilly cat, Elvis 
Presley. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in his set he paid tribute to two more country legends in a single song: 
"Me & Hank & Jumpin' Jack Flash" not only describes an imaginary meeting with 
Hank Williams but is actually a country/rap update of a Tex Ritter number, "I 
Dreamed of Hillbilly Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart segued seamlessly from "Me & Hank" into an achingly soulful version of 
Williams' bluesy "My Sweet Love Ain't Around." A more surprising and even more 
effective cover was J.J. Cale's "Clyde," which was a hit in 1980 for Waylon 
Jennings. Stuart recast the key lyric as "Steve (rather than Clyde) played 
electric bass," a nod to his own bass player Steve Arnold, who responded with 
blistering bass licks that Stuart answered in turn on guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the set was a selection of Stuart's recent country hits, such 
trademark songs as "Hillbilly Rock," "Western Girls" and "Now That's Country" 
that again proved his ability to filter country and rock through one another. 
During the high-powered "Western Girls," for example, he sang the praises of 
honky-tonk angels while he and Arnold duckwalked across the stage a la Chuck 
Berry. 
</P>
<P>
 The most anticipated number, "Burn Me Down" (which Stuart used to tease the 
crowd by starting and stopping a couple of times before finally playing it all 
the way through), nodded both to Johnny Cash's "Ring of Fire" and to Presley's 
"Burning Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart included a couple of numbers from his most recent album, "Love and 
Luck" -- including his latest single, "That's What Love's About," a touching 
ballad about tenderness and commitment that, he said, is his own favorite among 
all the songs he has written -- and "It Ain't Nothin' but a Love Thing," a 
2-week-old tune he has yet to record. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He moved rapidly from song to song, with little patter. Such brief comments as 
he did make focused, more often that not, on country music traditions. He 
noted, for instance, that the tailored Western suits he and his band-mates wore 
were in the tradition of those fashioned by the late Nudie the rodeo tailor, 
for such Grand Ole Opry stars as Porter Wagoner. 
</P>
<P>
 With back to school season upon us, one couldn't help but wonder: If only our 
teachers could have as much fun with world history! 
</P>

 A Show of Support: A national coalition of museums, filmmakers and civil 
libertarians is standing behind the Pink Pyramid bookstore in Cincinnati in its 
fight against obscenity charges for renting out a film that depicts sexual 
torture of teen-agers to an undercover police officer. The coalition filed a 
brief prepared by the American Civil Liberties Union last week defending the 
right of the bookstore to rent Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini's "Salo: 
120 Days of Sodom." Lawyer Louis Sirkin -- who in 1990 successfully defended 
the Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center and its director in an obscenity trial 
for displaying Robert Mapplethorpe photographs that showed sexual acts -- is 
helping to defend the bookstore, its owner Gary Allgeier and two employees on 
misdemeanor charges. Among those supporting the bookstore: New York's Film 
Society of Lincoln Center and Museum of Modern Art, director Martin Scorsese, 
actor Alec Baldwin and the Sundance Institute.

 The Three Museums?: A statement issued by J. Paul Getty Museum director John 
Walsh expresses the museum's outrage over reports that the sculpture "The Three 
Graces" will be shared by three museums -- two in Britain and one in Spain. The 
statement suggests that the sharing is a condition of Swiss art collector Baron 
Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza's $1.24-million contribution to the effort to 
prevent the export of the 19th-Century marble sculpture by Antonio Canova from 
Britain to the Getty Museum in Malibu. "It now seems to us that anything that 
will frustrate 'The Three Graces' being put on permanent display at the Getty 
Museum is acceptable to Britain, even it if means endangering the statue 
itself," the statement said. It goes on to say that, according to experts, the 
statue "should not be moved any more than is absolutely necessary." Initial 
reports of the baron's pledge did not mention that the work would be shared.

PACIFIC SYMPHONY SOARS AT MEADOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pacific Symphony's concert at Irvine Meadows on Saturday night was like 
one of those ginsu knife ads: The initial offer just kept getting better and 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, the program of popular American music by Leonard Bernstein and 
George Gershwin was probably a can't-miss proposition, but as played by the 
orchestra under Carl St.Clair, it became a whole lot better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Before an audience of 6,616, St.Clair and the PSO dived into the music with 
what seemed a perfect mixture of exuberance and control, delivering clean, 
vivid and stylistically idiomatic performances. 
</P>
<P>
 There was even a bonus on this otherwise familiar program, in the form of 
Bernstein's unfamiliar Divertimento for Orchestra, a work written to 
commemorate the centenary of the Boston Symphony in 1980. It turned out to be 
top-drawer Bernstein, which is to say light in nature, eclectic and accessible 
in style, flashy, cute, quirky, pleasing and cheeky in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Set in eight brief movements -- with such titles as "Sennets and Tuckets," 
"Turkey Trot," "Sphinxes," and "Samba" -- the Divertimento is a three-ring 
circus of a piece, filled with popular tunes cut and pasted, distorted and 
juxtaposed to form a bright collage. Moving from fanfare to out-of-kilter 
waltz, from cool jazz to spare abstraction, from dirty jazz to folk dance, the 
work is capped by a big, romping march called "The BSO Forever" that 
simultaneously waves flags and sticks out its tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Divertimento, as in the preceding Overture to "Candide" and Symphonic 
Dances from "West Side Story," the PSO and St.Clair showed an ease with the 
popular styles that allowed them to speak fluidly and authentically. 
Technically, the performances were tight, well balanced and blazingly colored. 
Bright amplification seemed an asset, not a liability. 
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, with the help of baritone Peter Lightfoot, soprano 
Geraldine McMillian and the William Grant Still Chorale, St.Clair offered 11 
selections from "Porgy and Bess." These, too, unfolded in flowing and spirited 
readings with St.Clair, leading from memory, insinuating the orchestral 
accompaniment behind the singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightfoot, with rounded vowels and resonant tone, may have elevated his 
characters from Catfish Row to the country club, but he phrased stylishly and 
sang enthusiastically. McMillian, in a resounding but focused soprano, gave 
appropriately sultry and emotional readings of her numbers. The Chorale 
produced tight and joyous sounds en masse, and in "Gone, Gone, Gone" revealed 
solo voices in vigorous health.

LOUNGE OFFERS MOST (SAM, THAT IS) AND BEST NEW VENUE FOR JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Doesn't anybody know about this gig yet?" one patron was overheard asking 
Saturday night in the lounge at the Kikuya restaurant. Apparently not, because 
only a handful of listeners were on hand to hear a solid little quartet led by 
guitarist Doug MacDonald and featuring veteran flute/saxman Sam Most. 
</P>
<P>
 But if future acts are as rewarding as this one -- and upcoming appearances 
look promising -- Orange County may have something it dearly needs: a place to 
hear competent, straight-ahead jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The room itself is well-suited, separate from the restaurant and to the side 
of the bar (one end of which affords a perfect spot to see and hear the music). 
The bandstand is in a mirror-lined corner, a touch that gives the place the 
feel of a Times Square cocktail lounge circa 1965. The audience sits at tables 
scattered around a small dance floor, or on a black vinyl settee that wraps 
around two sides of the room with accompanying tables and stools. The acoustics 
throughout are direct and clean; an intimate experience is guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, intimacy was just what the doctor ordered. Most, 63, often is 
credited with being the first be-bop flutist. He began working in Tommy 
Dorsey's band in 1948, released his first album in 1953, was voted Downbeat's 
"New Star" in '54 and worked in a wide variety of contexts during the '50s and 
'60s including stints with such disparate artists as Chris Connor, Teddy 
Wilson, Buddy Rich and Louie Bellson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was, not surprisingly, a bit of nostalgia at play during the first two 
sets as he explored such warhorses as "Flamingo" and "Lady Be Good." But his 
performance was more than just a rehash: He spun pleasantly melodic 
improvisations in breathy tones that were perfect for the lush life setting. 
</P>
<P>
 With tenor and alto saxophone and concert and alto flutes resting in stands to 
his right, Most sang his way through "Night and Day" and "I Thought About You" 
in a reserved, almost conversational style that brought Chet Baker to mind. 
Most scatted through long passages with quick, light-footed phrasing that was 
impressive for its ongoing string of ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 On tenor, his tones shimmered beneath a push of air, recalling the sultry 
stylings of Stan Getz. At times, the soft tones were almost flutelike in 
quality, especially when sounded in the upper register. On alto, Most was 
equally breathy, even when playing up-tempo passages as he did during "Lady Be 
Good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it was his flute playing that was most impressive. "Falling In Love" was 
given a light but vigorous treatment. Using the larger alto flute for "The 
Shadow Of Your Smile," he wound through lyrical lines against a bossa nova 
pace, finishing his statements with brief trills or rolling passages. His 
vibrato resonated with warmth and suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Most seemed comfortable with the backing he got from MacDonald, bassist Jack 
Prather and drummer Nick Martinis, breaking into one of his impish grins 
whenever they executed a particularly demanding or lovely passage. 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonald, a consistently satisfying electric guitarist, used smooth tones and 
sharp chordal strums to trace the outlines of the tunes, sometimes turning his 
amp down completely to provide strummed rhythmic pulses in the tradition of 
Charlie Christian. His solos were mix-and-match affairs -- short, single-note 
bursts and long, involved lines sharing space with melodic chordal 
constructions. 
</P>
<P>
 Prather's fine sense of pitch and strong woody tone were especially winning in 
this intimate atmosphere. His bowed solo spots, most notably during "I Thought 
About You," lent dignified, almost classical airs. Martinis was responsive with 
both sticks and brushes, accenting statements from Most and MacDonald while 
keeping time in impeccable style. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Doug MacDonald Trio plays at Kikuya, 8052 Adams Ave., Huntington Beach, 
Friday with singer Stephanie Haynes and Saturday with saxophonist Gordon 
Brisker. Three sets a night, starting at 8. No cover. (714) 536-6665.

WEEKEND REVIEWS; DANCE; A SIMPLE 'THREE TALES' FROM GOLDBERG TROUPE AT THE FORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An outdoor setting doesn't necessarily require simplicity of means or concept. 
But Naomi Goldberg must have felt it does, because she drastically and 
disturbingly simplified her usually interesting choreography to the point of 
its becoming threadbare and insipid when her Los Angeles Modern Dance and 
Ballet troupe introduced her new "Three Tales" Saturday at the John Anson Ford 
Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 The tales emerged heavily dependent for their meanings upon the plot summaries 
provided in the program booklet. Certainly the choreography itself did not tell 
the stories very completely or skillfully. There were lots of poses and freezes 
and little creation or development of character. Again and again, whole 
passages of prerecorded music would go by with little or no movement occurring 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 What movement vocabulary and narrative structure there was looked heavily 
indebted to Martha Graham. Had her ghost witnessed the proceedings it would 
have become increasingly disquieted. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the final piece, "The Sisters Grimm," appeared so derived 
from Mark Morris' deconstruction of the "Nutcracker" -- Morris calls his 
version "The Hard Nut" -- that Goldberg's piece probably should have been 
called "The Hard Sleeping Beauty." But it was an atypical mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Three Tales," as well as Goldberg's solo Prologue ("Mango"), were derived 
from various cultures. "Princess of the Moon" was adapted by Philip Kan Gotanda 
from an 8th-Century Japanese tale and it was danced to excerpts from Robert 
Moran's "From the Towers of the Moon." Luis Alfaro reinterpreted a Mexican folk 
tale as the basis for Goldberg's "La Llorona," which was danced to music by 
Carlos Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Sisters Grimm," as mentioned, was an effort to update "Sleeping Beauty," 
this time to music by Daniel Lentz. "Mango" was adapted from Trinidad folklore 
by Nasser Nasser, and it was danced to music by Fredric Myrow. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Princess," the theme was the transforming power of love. The moon princess 
descends to Earth, encounters human love but must return home where she at 
least is able to share her deepened insights with her attendants. 
Unfortunately, among other deficiencies, Goldberg devised too weak a pas de 
deux for Kathryn Sanders (Moon Princess) and Damon Cadena-White (Prince of the 
Village) to carry the weight of a transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 "La Llorona" had far darker, moralizing meanings. A young woman (the appealing 
Alissa Mello) is raped by a villager (a stolid Tim Fox) who tears out her 
tongue so that she cannot reveal his identity. Apparently, the original folk 
tale serves to caution wayward youth. Here, the pervasive Grahamisms verged on 
parody. Al-faro's long and very detailed program notes also related the 
repentance and death of the rapist, but this part was omitted from the 
choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 The new sleeping beauty turned out to be a spoiled teen-ager living among 
tyrannical servants. Goldberg got in a few good jokes. This beauty (Susan Marie 
Castang) took an inordinate time to wake up, and she and her Prince Charming 
(Fox) were seen 25 years later with about 19 little kids. Happily ever after, 
indeed. But again the choreography spun its wheels trying to eat up measures of 
the music. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Mango," Goldberg executed the rapid shifts between abrupt angular 
movements and difficult held balances with precision and clarity. But they 
didn't amount to much; the piece didn't go anywhere.

COUNTERPUNCH: WARNING: REAL SEALS ARE NOT 'ANDRE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGH T. RYONO, Hugh T. Ryono, a free-lance writer and photographer on marine 
subjects, volunteers as media relations officer and helps care for animals at 
the Marine Mammal Care Center at Fort MacArthur. The nonprofit center 
rehabilitates sick and injured seals and sea lions for release into the wild. 
He is a photo imaging systems instructor for the Agfa Division of Miles Inc. 
and formerly a photographic specialist on Northrop's Stealth bomber program. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Andre," the tale of the friendship between a wild seal and a Maine family, is 
a very enjoyable movie and will probably lead to a greater appreciation of 
pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) by the youth of America (" 'Andre': A Seal That 
Wins Approval," Calendar, Aug. 17). 
</P>
<P>
 Although the type of marine mammal portraying Andre does not live off the East 
Coast -- the real Andre was a harbor seal -- the movie does show the beauty and 
intelligence of the California sea lion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wild sea lions (and seals) do live off our Southern California coast and this 
is where a wonderful movie could lead to a tragic interaction between children 
and animals if accurate information and warnings aren't given to the public. A 
child encountering a wild sea lion at the beach might approach it thinking it 
will act like Andre. 
</P>
<P>
 With jaw strength as powerful as a pit bull, a sea lion pup could inflict a 
painful, vicious bite on anyone trying to pet it. The sea lion's main defense 
is its teeth and it will use them on a perceived threat. Parents should make 
sure that their kids realize that wild animals are not pets and can be 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is some general information on our local pinnipeds. 
</P>
<P>
 * The four main species of pinnipeds seen offshore of Southern California are 
the California sea lion, the Northern elephant seal, the harbor seal and, 
occasionally, the Northern fur seal. 
</P>
<P>
 * They are protected by the National Marine Fisheries Service from human 
harassment with fines up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seemingly abandoned seal pups found on beaches should be left alone and 
given a wide berth. The mother seal may have left the pup on the beach while it 
goes out to forage for food. If there are people nearby the mother may abandon 
the pup. 
</P>
<P>
 * Just because a pinniped is up on the beach doesn't mean it's sick. It may 
have come ashore to rest or just to get warm. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you do come upon a sick or injured animal on the beach, leave it alone! 
Do not pour water on the animal. The animal may have come ashore to get warm 
and pouring water on it may cause hypothermia. Call the local animal control 
agency and let trained professionals handle the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 * And remember: The seals and sea lions of the Southern California coast are 
wild and do bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoy the marine mammals off our coast, but please respect their wildness.

COUNTERPUNCH: HOW INDUSTRY CAN DO ITS SHARE FOR AMERICAN SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLWOOD E. KIESER, Paulist Father Ellwood E. Kieser produced the TV series 
Insight and the film Romero, wrote an autobiography, Hollywood Priest, a 
Spiritual Struggle, and heads the Humanitas Prize organization that encourages 
communication of human values through entertainment programming. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American family is in trouble. This is obvious. The figures speak for 
themselves. Not just the divorce rate, but the skyrocketing number of babies 
being born to unmarried women, 30% in the general population, 62% in the black 
community; and the exploding percentage of our children being raised in 
single-parent homes. According to the 1991 figures just released ("Traditional 
Family Nearly the Exception, Census Finds," Part A, Aug. 30), almost 50% of 
American children are growing up without one or both of their parents. In no 
other society on the face of this planet has the percentage been so high. 
</P>
<P>
 Does it make any difference? According to the recent Carnegie study, it makes 
a huge difference. Children from single-parent homes are statistically much 
more likely to have problems in school, drop out before graduation, be abused 
and become abusers, run afoul of the criminal justice system, have serious 
psychological problems, attempt suicide, get hooked on drugs and alcohol, and, 
in later life, fail in love and work. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no denying we have a problem, a big one. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people point their fingers at those of us who work in the entertainment 
community and say it is our motion pictures and television shows that are the 
primary cause of the problem. I remain unconvinced. Too often it is true, we 
have copped out and catered to the lowest common denominator but I think the 
schools, the government, the churches and the business community must also 
accept their share of the responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if we producers, writers, directors and actors have not totally caused the 
problem, I do think there is much we can do to solve it. How? 
</P>
<P>
 * Sex: First, in our shows, we can present human sexuality as the beautiful 
and wholesome facet of the human personality that God made it to be. Sex is 
special. Important. Significant. It says something: It says, "I belong to you, 
only to you, forever." 
</P>
<P>
 To perform that act and not mean what it says -- to make love casually -- 
without commitment, without deep caring -- is to reduce one's partner to an 
object. It's to use and exploit that person. 
</P>
<P>
 The temptation for us in the industry is to tell our viewers what they want to 
hear rather than what they need to hear. What they need to hear is that good 
things are worth waiting for, that delaying gratification is the test of the 
maturely loving person, that self-giving rather than self-indulgence is the 
purpose of the sexual act. 
</P>
<P>
 * Relationship: Second, we can illumine and support in our shows those 
qualities that make marriage work -- self-acceptance; realistic expectations; 
honesty and trust in communication; a readiness to grow, to transcend one's ego 
and leave one's narcissism behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people enter marriage thinking it a state of guaranteed intimacy. 
Automatically they think they will live happily ever after. That is an illusion 
we should not reinforce. The reality is marriage is a state where you struggle 
for intimacy and that struggle is a rigorous and scary one. The determination 
to hang in there, to build the relationship one brick at a time, in good times 
and in bad, in sickness and in health, to give and give and give until it hurts 
and then some, this is how you become a mature person, learn to love and make a 
marriage work. Our shows should make that clear. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parenting: Third, I think we can illumine and encourage the whole process of 
parenting. The kids need so much, emotionally as well as physically. It 
sometimes seems a bottomless pit. 
</P>
<P>
 And the pressures on parents are colossal. Economic pressures. Social 
pressures. Educational pressures. Media pressures. Pressures from the kids' 
peers. Single parents have an especially tough time of it. I don't know how 
some of them do it. 
</P>
<P>
 In our shows, I think we can help parents understand their kids and we can 
help kids understand their parents. We can help them realize that all 
relationships are two-way streets, that parents have needs too, that each side 
must be prepared to learn from the other, to give as well as receive. And we 
can celebrate the fulfillment that flows from good parenting and 
unconditionally affirm the selflessness that it entails. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not easy to be a good parent. But nothing is more important. The future 
of American society is in the hands of today's parents.

TCHAIKOVSKY LIGHTS FIREWORKS AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Given ever-improving fireworks displays, 26 summers can certainly fly by. At 
the annual Tchaikovsky Spectaculars at Hollywood Bowl -- formally begun as a 
ritual in 1969, though Tchaikovsky evenings were already a cliche at the 
outdoor amphitheater by then -- that time has evaporated before our ears. 
Still, we have some happy memories. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 edition, played by the Hollywood Bowl Orchestra led by John Mauceri, 
contributed to those remembrances. And, of course, it was well-attended, a 
reported 16,167 listeners crowding the Bowl Friday, and a full-house, the 
regulation 17,979, in attendance Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Heard and experienced at Friday's performance was a rare revival of the 
composer's symphonic fantasy, "The Tempest," along with a polished account of 
the "1812" Overture to accompany the elegant and exciting fireworks show. More 
important, even, was the local debut of Russian pianist Nikolai Demidenko, in 
the First Piano Concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a resident of Great Britain, the 39-year old Demidenko is a pianistic 
presence of strong authority and abundant accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tone he produces -- here amplified and projected through the Bowl's 
unreliable, highly complex sound-system -- seems to be smallish, and not 
particularly well-colored. Nevertheless, the pianist's technical resources have 
facets. He gets around the keyboard without perspiration, delivers deadly 
accurate octaves and finger-work with a stunning reliability and hardly ever 
makes an ugly sound. 
</P>
<P>
 He did some surprising and unorthodox dawdling in parts of the concerto 
through which others walk briskly. Yet he is so musical and self-convinced that 
one tends to want to accept his individual touches. At the piano, Demidenko 
exhibits genuine personality and likability. He should return soon to show us 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 What Mauceri & Co., in fine orchestral voice -- ensemble values tightly 
delivered, cohesion of choirs solid and resonant, solo voices clear -- showed 
the assembled throng was smooth and polished Tchaikovsky playing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One didn't mind a five-minute spoken program note on "The Tempest" because the 
conductor, as always, proved so interesting as raconteur. And the performance 
itself made that much more sense after the preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the evening were excerpts from "The Sleeping Beauty," 
lovingly re-created by all forces. At the end came a taut "1812" Overture with 
illuminating visuals created by Pyro-Spectaculars, with Gene Evans as special 
effects consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong and cohesive USC Trojan Marching Band contributed to the general 
effect.

'TRUE LIES': BECOMING EQUAL PARTNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "It's Not True That 'Lies' Helps Women" (Aug. 29): Can political 
correctness blind one to the real virtues and intentions of a movie? You might 
think so by reading Carol Treadwell's Counterpunch to Douglas Eby's "True Lies" 
Counterpunch ("Curtis' True Role in 'Lies': Empowerment," Aug. 8). Treadwell 
misrepresents the intent of key scenes, along with the movie's message, one in 
which the hero learns to accept his wife as an equal partner. 
</P>
<P>
 In "True Lies," we are deliberately presented with a seemingly sexist female 
character -- Jamie Lee Curtis as the doting suburban housewife. But the Curtis 
character is not at all what she initially appears to be. She is, in fact, the 
true lie of "True Lies." 
</P>
<P>
 In a key sequence that Treadwell had so much trouble with, Curtis is 
interrogated by her husband, Arnold Schwarzenegger, with the help of a two-way 
mirror. The scene not only demonstrates that Curtis has aspirations beyond her 
role as a housewife, it also dramatizes how Schwarzenegger, by failing to 
acknowledge Curtis as a complete person, is in very real danger of losing her. 
When Curtis violently cracks the mirror, it is not, as Treadwell mentions, a 
sign of her "inability" but a dramatic warning to Schwarzenegger -- he can no 
longer "hide behind the mirror," i.e.: his carefully ordered lies, his sexism. 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell also misinterprets the movie's Tom Arnold character. The Arnold 
character is an "example" to Schwarzenegger of what he could become -- bitter, 
sexist, divorced -- if he fails to change.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a sequence in which Curtis performs a humorous striptease is not, as 
Treadwell would have us believe, a scene in which "a husband needs to see his 
wife as a prostitute." Yes, of course Schwarzenegger is entranced by his wife's 
dance, but, on a more fundamental level, he's alarmed by the fact that Curtis 
is committed to her duties as a spy -- that she's acting independently.  
</P>
<P>
 "True Lies" presents an accessible portrayal of a couple who undergo a 
transformation. "True Lies," with all of its typical bang-bang action-movie 
accouterments, may well be one of the more openly feminist movies of the year.

RULING FILMLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re the Counterpunch "Who Played the Last Action Heroine?" by Nancy Leff (Aug. 
22): Leff claims that "testosterone rules filmland." For her edification: Money 
rules filmland.If Martians bought the majority of tickets, then we would see a 
preponderance of Martian-themed flicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Leff casually assumes that 50% of ticket buyers are female. Really!? There 
must be an enormous increase in Dutch-treat dating arrangements (men should be 
so lucky) that no one else has seemed to notice! 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot claim intimate knowledge of the hormonal makeup of Dawn Steel or 
Sherry Lansing, but "Cool Runnings" or "Clear and Present Danger" are produced 
because they are good stories that happen to have men as central characters. 
Why is that? Because, in the dating environment, it's "boys" who are reaching 
into their pockets to pay for the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 If women wish for more female-centric films, perhaps they should try reaching 
for their purses more often. It's worked in TV. Since women are the purchasing 
agent for the family, most TV fare, with the obvious exception of sports, is 
aimed squarely at them.

A TIMELESS MIX OF STYLES AT L.A. CLASSIC JAZZ FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 11th annual L.A. Classic Jazz Festival, concluding today at two airport 
area hotels, got away to an operationally uncertain but musically splendid 
start over the weekend. A new administration had had little time to conquer the 
testing logistics of importing several dozen musicians from all over the world. 
Clarinet star Ken Peplowski was a no-show because his plane ticket never 
arrived. The printed program had to have an insert because of the number of 
schedule changes. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the music that matters. As before, the mix ran from the most stoutly 
preservationist of trad ("Struttin' With Some Barbecue" seems to be this year's 
anthem of choice) to the lively junction where mainstream edges toward the 
flatted fifths of bop. 
</P>
<P>
 Bach has been a sort of ghostly presence at this year's event. The number of 
Bach-like entwining contrapuntal choruses, dazzling in conception and 
execution, has been astonishing. The interplay between pianist Dick Hyman and 
guitarist Howard Alden on a very fast "How High the Moon" at a Friday afternoon 
set was breathtakingly beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more contrapuntal fireworks between cornetist Warren Vache and 
soprano saxman Bob Wilbur on, of all infrequent choices here, "Strike Up the 
Band" (taken at 100-yard-dash tempo), and between Vache and Jackie Coon on 
fluegelhorn during a Saturday night set. You were reminded, not for the first 
time, that jazz can be beautiful as well as propulsive. 
</P>
<P>
 The late player-arranger Dick Cary's Tuesday night rehearsal band reassembled 
in a double-session tribute to him, with Dick Hamilton as leader (doubling on 
piano and trumpet, as Cary often did). Cary, who died in April, left a great 
legacy of exciting and demanding charts, including many originals. The group, 
with trombonist Betty O'Hara and tenor saxman Dick Hafer chief among the 
soloists, did them and Cary full justice.

 Drummer Louis Bellson gave a three-hour dance concert Saturday night with a 
powerhouse and well-disciplined big band. Several of the other drummers in 
residence fell by to pay homage to the last of the great band-era 
percussionists, now 70, but seemingly inexhaustible with his energy and 
inventiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 For jazz esoterica, nothing quite matched the Canadian vibraphonist Peter 
Appleyard's musical and visual impersonations of his fellow mallet-wielders 
Terry Gibbs, Milt Jackson, Red Norvo and Lionel Hampton -- a deft and amusing 
historical footnote. 
</P>
<P>
 Several foreign groups with enthusiastic followings here were on hand again: 
Fat Sam's from Scotland, Paco Gatsby from Guatemala, Greentown from Slovenia, 
Yoshio Toyama from Tokyo and Lillian Boutte from Hamburg (by way of New 
Orleans). Gatsby gives jazz a distinctly Latin flavor, but the others re-import 
the American sound with fidelity augmented by crowd-pleasing antics. Toyama 
echoes Louis Armstrong most remarkably. 
</P>
<P>
 The most sheerly entertaining among the many domestic groups may well be Sorta 
Dixie, a long-running Las Vegas lounge act that alternates its expert and 
gung-ho playing with some four-part vocal harmony. It brings down the house 
(always ready for nostalgia anyway) with "Juke Box Saturday Night," the Glenn 
Miller version augmented by tributes to the Dorsey brothers and the Four 
Freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Festivals are no easier to summarize than smorgasbords, yard sales or 
anthologies. What the classic proves again, however, is that jazz exists along 
a timeless spectrum of approaches, but at its heart always are individual 
performers, playing and singing with skill, imagination and passion.

'IN LIVING COLOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Les Firestein's lament to "In Living Color's" passing ("Two Gaps in the TV 
Tapestry," Aug. 29): While it is painful that a quality show like "In Living 
Color" gets canceled for any reason, it was infinitely more painful to watch a 
show that once coveted the highest praise of being "too good for television" 
become simply unfunny. 
</P>
<P>
 A show that I looked forward to watching each week, a show that (as Firestein 
agrees) went too far and made people laugh while tackling a variety of 
controversial topics, ceased to do either consistently.(The show's downward 
spiral seemed to coincide with Keenen Ivory Wayans' losing battle with Fox 
executives.) Throughout the 1992-93 season, I wondered how long Jim Carrey 
could carry the show. The next season I found out -- not very far.

FAILURE'S 'PRE-PALOOZA' PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rumbling to the stage as a "Pre-Palooza Party," four bands crowded into the 
Whisky on Friday, acting as a reminder of what their once- alternative brand of 
rock called home before MTV and pop radio discovered it for the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 This tour, headlined by L.A.'s Failure, has traveled alongside the massive 
Lollapalooza festival this summer, typically appearing in a city just a day or 
two before the bigger acts arrived.It's also offered a look at the possible 
next wave, particularly for the bands Failure and Sponge. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliminating most of the most dirgelike numbers from its repertoire, Failure 
has now mastered a personal style that balances power with subversive pop 
hooks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Whisky, singer-guitarist Ken Andrews led the trio through selections 
from their new "Magnified" album, singing with measured calm and control in 
spite of the thundering roar around him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponge was a less moody presence, but rose to similar heights with a 
passionate mix of alluring melodies and charged guitar rock. The Detroit 
quintet played music laced with adrenaline and pop invention culled from the 
band's "Rotting Pinata" album. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, San Diego's Rust offered little more than over-amped sludge. 
Frontman John B. hopped and shouted across the stage in an indecipherable rage, 
a la Henry Rollins. Inch, also from San Diego, mixed Sonic Youth rock jazzbo 
and some Minutemen-style quirkiness to uneven results, too often falling into 
easy single-chord patterns. STEVE APPLEFORD

DISNEYLAND'S FIREWORKS CAN BE A REAL BOMB; NEIGHBORHOODS: FOR THOSE LIVING 
NEAREST THE PARK, LABOR DAY AND END OF SUMMER'S NIGHTLY SHOWS COME AS BLESSED 
RELIEF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For most, Labor Day is a time for back-yard barbecues and re-energizing for 
school and work. But for Betty Ronconi and scores of residents who live only 
blocks away from Disneyland, the holiday means the shelling finally stops. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Magic Kingdom's spectacular "Fantasy in the Sky" fireworks may leave 
countless summer visitors cheering, the nightly display rates near zero on the 
applause meter with the theme park's closest neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday marked the end of a long summer siege for some residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Labor Day is always a relief for us because the fireworks are over," said 
Ronconi, 65, who lives on Walnut Street. "Earlier this summer, they were 
practically blasting us out of our house. In the front bedroom, the walls and 
windows were shaking. It was frightening, and I don't frighten easily." 
</P>
<P>
 "We literally count down the days to Labor Day," added Sharon Hoffman, 48, 
also a close neighbor of the theme park. "They really are a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why they couldn't just limit the show to Saturday nights," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's fireworks have long been a sore point. Residents railed against them 
during May hearings about Disney's proposed $3-billion expansion. They urged 
planning commissioners to impose stricter noise standards on the park, but 
their appeals fell upon deaf ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disturbed with the city for not showing any concern for neighbors of 
the Disney park area," said Richard Anthony, who has lived blocks away from 
Disneyland since 1957. "The city just cares about Disney." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood pounding begins each summer night a little after 9:30 p.m. 
when -- as park officials put it -- Tinkerbell flies from the Matterhorn to 
Sleeping Beauty's Castle to ignite the famed pyrotechnics. During the 10-minute 
show, 196 fireworks shells are sent exploding skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like thunder," said Disney neighbor Shylie Lewis, 71. "The dogs 
jump over their fences and go yipping down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the noise, Anthony leaves his home several times a week at the 
dreaded hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take off and go to the Dairy Queen and celebrate the fact I'm not at home 
listening to that garbage," said Anthony, 53. "What else can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials say they try to be attentive to their neighbors' concerns. 
But park officials would not disclose the number of complaints they receive 
because of the fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to make sure the neighbors are happy," said Pam Espinosa, a 
Disneyland spokeswoman. "When they complain, we listen." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Disney officials customarily end the fireworks on Sunday because 
a show Labor Day night might "interrupt the sleep of neighboring students" who 
return to class Tuesday, Espinosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors who live seven or eight blocks from Disneyland say the fireworks are 
indeed noisy but are worth the assault on the ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fireworks have provided us with so much entertainment over the years," 
said Bob Ball, who lives across the street from Disneyland Hotel. "I'm 68 years 
old and I still go out in the front lawn and look at them. And you can bet when 
the grandkids are here, we are out there watching them too." 
</P>
<P>
 But closer to ground zero, residents still resent the nightly fireworks show. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really make me jump," said Lewis. "Can't they make fireworks that look 
pretty but don't make noise? Why do they have to go boom?"

VIDEO ARCADE APPEALS TO THEIR SENSES; RECREATION: THE IRVINE CENTER IS A VISUAL 
CORNUCOPIA FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. AND THE MAN WHO KEEPS IT OVERFLOWING ENJOYS THE 
ACTION.

 Daryl Hicks works at one of Orange County's newest summer hot spots, and he 
doesn't even have a suntan. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks is a technician at the Palace Park arcade, a dark and antiseptic place 
where the temperature is always an air-conditioned 71 degrees and the bright 
light comes from more than 100 flickering video game screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks has spent the summer making sure the chaos and mayhem is limited to the 
game monitors and that all the yelling is screams of joy and excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old Mission Viejo resident says it's no surprise that 
technology-savvy kids raised on television happily forgo a day at the beach for 
the sense-pounding experience of "Street Fighter," "Jurassic Park" and "Mortal 
Kombat." "With TV, you just watch. With these new games, you are drawn in," he 
said, noting that virtual-reality technology is making the newest video games 
more exciting and realistic-looking than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much going on. It's different every time you play," he said. "With 
an old game like Ms. Pac Man, you get the sense that you are on the outside 
looking in. With the new games, you have more of a sense of being part of the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 The arcade, which opened in July, is packed with as many as 1,500 people a 
day, which keeps Hicks running. 
</P>
<P>
 One minute, he is helping a little girl place her token into a skeet ball 
machine, the next he's is repairing an aging Galaga machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The job places him in constant contact with his youthful customers, whose 
tastes he must consider when purchasing new games and deciding which 
attractions have passed their prime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important that I keep in touch and know what they like. That's how 
you select the right games," said Hicks, who studied electronics at Saddleback 
Valley College and worked at a Disneyland arcade before joining Palace Park. 
"It definitely keeps me young." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds are beginning to thin slightly as kids head back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 But on a warm and breezy afternoon last week, teens in the arcade formed a 
line to play one of the summer's hottest games, a car-racing adventure called 
Daytona Deluxe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is much cooler than the beach," said Sammy Kim, a 14-year-old Irvine 
resident, standing next to an "antique" Ms. Pac Man machine, circa 1986. "I can 
spend hours here and still not play everything. You go to the beach and all 
there is to do is go in the water and sit in the sand. . . . That gets boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening, Irvine's first arcade-amusement park has quickly become the 
destination of choice for thousands youths looking for things to do during 
summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The park includes a miniature golf course, batting cages and bumper-boat 
rides. But the arcade, which resembles a disco with its tall black walls and 
flashing red strobe lights, is by far the biggest attraction, generating about 
40% of revenues, said the general manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said the arcade's customers are drawn by more than the violence and gore 
that some video games offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Palace Park's most popular game is a relatively benign and low-tech attraction 
called "Dinoscore." The object of the game is to hit targets with coins fired 
from a gun. Players who hit the targets receive tickets that can be redeemed 
for prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daytona car-racing game is also popular, even though it is far less 
graphic than some of the bloody combat attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want games that they can interact with," Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age boys make up a good chunk of the arcade's clientele. They gravitate 
to some of the "super-attractions" like Galaxian 2, which is played in front of 
a movie theater-size screen in a room decorated with flashing lights and 
computer panels to resemble a spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25,000-square-foot arcade also attracts teen-age girls, younger children 
who come with their parents, and business people in suits who wander in from 
nearby office towers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact that this is a controlled environment. . . . It's secure," 
said Dina Hernandez of Santa Ana, who brought her 7-year-old son, David, to 
Palace Park. "I don't feel comfortable having him just go to the park or hang 
out on the street. It's not safe out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Though summer is the arcade's busy season, Hicks will keep the job throughout 
the year. He said it blends his longtime love of video games with his interest 
in electronics and trouble-shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a job with a future," he said, looking out at the scores of 
kids intently guiding their joysticks and firing buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said his goal is to make sure customers have an enjoyable experience -- 
even if that means occasionally fighting the urge to sneak out of the dark 
arcade for a moment and soak-in the summer sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I feel lucky to be inside when it's really hot," he said. "And I'll be 
happy to be in here when the rain starts."

HOMEBOYS TO DOUGH BOYS; FORMER GANG MEMBERS EXPLORE BETTER LIVING BY BAKING 
</P>

 They are young hands, at one time inclined to wield a weapon and flash signals 
in a brotherhood of violence. Now, they spend their days learning the ritual of 
coaxing unformed dough into loaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeboy Bakery is back in business. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brush with fiscal disaster, the bakery that was conceived as a recipe 
to end the urban warfare on streets around the Aliso Village public housing 
project may have found salvation with a combination of business savvy and 
street smarts. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstered by advice from a seasoned restaurateur, a UCLA computer analysis and 
the promise of large orders from USC and White Memorial Hospital, Homeboy 
Bakery once again is finding work for idle hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Just six months ago, the bakery was at the brink of failure -- the oven was 
broken, the ceiling leaked and chaos seemed to reign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were getting in over our heads," said Father Jerry Helfrich, director of 
Proyecto Pastoral at Dolores Mission Church, the umbrella organization that 
oversees the bakery. "I just said, 'Stop. Let's get this thing organized.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing metamorphosis has been so complete, a health inspector on a return 
visit thought he was in a different building, said manager Ruben Rodriguez.  
</P>
<P>
 "The place was in a shambles," Rodriguez said. "We were in trouble. The kids 
went through a very painful procedure. We didn't know if we could survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Survival meant remodeling the floor, the roof and everything in between. 
Homeboy's operation now is smoother, aimed at supplying large institutions with 
simple but unique products, instead of a wide menu for a bevy of small 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 A former food-processing foreman, Rodriguez is determined to teach his nine 
employees how to run a tight ship by the time the test runs are over and 
serious baking begins later this month. He was enlisted for the job by Father 
Gregory Boyle at Dolores Mission, who asked him to try it out for two weeks. 
That was four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle, who directs the Jobs for a Future program at the parish, has been 
blessed with a handful of mini-miracles. A Southern California Gas Co. worker 
brought the oven up to standards, free of charge. Later, he told Boyle he did 
it because his own son had fallen victim to a gang shooting. An exterminator 
who found out the bakery was a church project charged a wholesale price for the 
chemicals, and nothing for labor, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jesse Leonard, a Santa Monica restaurateur who has hired workers through 
Boyle, spent hours on the telephone trying to keep Homeboy from getting in over 
its head. Her mantra: Keep it simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeboy also hired Nathan Dakduk, who learned to bake in Venezuela as a 
teen-ager, to guide the young bakers through their trial runs. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was USC, whose medical school is nearby, that stepped up and said it 
was ready to buy whatever the bakery can turn out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said to start slow and work our way up," said Boyle. "I give them a lot 
of credit. They could go anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 USC has not signed a contract yet, but is firmly committed to helping the 
bakery, said Margo Allen, assistant director for dining services. "They're a 
great bunch of guys," she said. "You can tell they have a lot of aspirations. 
We want to help them get there." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's business school also provided a boost with a computerized cost 
analysis, said Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 No government money has gone into Homeboy Bakery, Rodriguez boasts. But the 
area soon could become eligible for federal loans as part of President 
Clinton's urban aid plan penned in response to the 1992 riots. Vice President 
Al Gore recently made a stop at Homeboy to tout the program, though the Secret 
Service felt obliged to keep him away from the homeboys with serious criminal 
records, Boyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bakery has made all the difference for people like Hugo Narvaez, 21, who 
sports a tattoo of his gang affiliation across the nape of his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to show not all of us are out to hurt people," he said, chopping 
chilies for the jalapeno-and-cheese rolls. "Given the opportunity, all of us 
would have a job. I got my homeboy Puppet and my homeboy Little Chopper to 
join." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow gang members were not instantly won over by Narvaez' reformation nearly 
two years ago, he said. But they respected the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they're waiting to get in," he said. "Here, there's actually a chance. 
Father Greg and Father Jerry are pushing us to get an education. They don't 
want us to do this permanently." 
</P>
<P>
 Narvaez plans to study at night this fall to finish the requirements for a 
high school equivalency degree. He was all but thrown out of high school the 
first time around -- "dropped out, kicked out. I guess I was left with no 
alternative," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 28, Armando Gomez has survived 14 years in the Tiny Dukes gang. He readily 
displays the scars of belonging: a bullet wound in his shin, stab puncture in 
his abdomen, and a scalp slash from a machete. "I'm lucky I'm right here 
talking to you," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gomez also remains a nominal gang member -- there is no retirement, 
he quips -- he no longer looks the part. His hair is tied back in a ponytail, 
far from the regimental crew cut common to his former comrades. Like Narvaez, 
Gomez is trying to finish high school, which he left before his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never looked up to anyone. No one said, 'Don't do that. It's wrong' because 
they were afraid of me. I was too crazy," he said, pointing to the younger 
homeboys. At 18 years old, you want to prove yourself, he said. Usually that 
means putting a gun in your hand. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular night, Gomez has something else to prove -- that he can 
knead rolls with the same hands that once helped steer his life off track. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to kill the dough," coaches Dakduk. "Just a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Dakduk holds up a cupped hand. "This is your mold," he tells them. Clumsily, 
then more confidently, they mimic his motions.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you just give them a hand, teach them how to do things, they're willing to 
learn," said Dakduk.

STREET SMART / AARON CURTISS: FOR DRUNK DRIVERS, HOLIDAY MEANS ANOTHER 
CRACKDOWN

 At least he was honest about it: Javier was drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the harsh electric glow of a California Highway Patrol sergeant's 
flashlight, the bleary-eyed Boyle Heights resident blithely confessed that he 
had quaffed a six-pack of Budweiser before climbing into his Dodge Colt and 
driving the wrong way up a freeway off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few hours into the long Labor Day weekend, Javier's holiday was over. 
He would wake up in jail Saturday morning with more than just a headache and a 
bad case of cottonmouth. His car would be impounded, and he still would have 
the probable suspension of his license and a hefty court fine to look forward 
to. 
</P>
<P>
 Better, though, than not waking up at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we hadn't found him, we would probably be looking at a fatality," said 
Sgt. Robbie Roberts, stepping carefully around a stinking puddle of Javier's 
vomit in the middle of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier wasn't the first drunk hauled into jail and off the road during a 
nightlong holiday weekend patrol of Los Angeles- area freeways. And he wouldn't 
be the last. Roberts and other officers from the CHP and Los Angeles Police 
Department were out in force each of the nights throughout the Labor Day 
weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts netted dozens of drivers with blood-alcohol levels above the 
legal limit, some so far from sober that they wet their pants and could not 
remember where they lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Such crackdowns -- now a regular part of most weekends and holidays -- appear 
to be saving lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of drunk-driving-related fatalities has fallen steadily over the 
past five years. In 1987, 2,754 people were killed as a result of drunk driving 
in California. By 1992, that number had dropped a third to 1,832. In Los 
Angeles County alone, drunk driving fatalities fell from 542 in 1990 to 367 in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials attribute the drop to tougher penalties resulting 
from activism by grass-roots organizations such as Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving. Once treated lightly, drunk drivers now face harsh reactions from the 
courts, their insurance companies and even their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not laughing anymore," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once the drivers have been picked up, they are transported to the Parker 
Center parking lot. Old buses and mobile homes form a horseshoe. Long tables 
line one side, long benches the other. On the benches sit the drunks -- some 
glum, some still smiling. At the tables sit officers and civilian volunteers 
carefully filling out the stack of paperwork that accompanies any arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 This is IBARS, the LAPD's Immediate Booking and Release System, which speeds 
up the processing of people who

 have been arrested so that patrol officers can spend more time on the street 
patrolling instead of filling out forms. The standard booking process can take 
an officer more than two hours, about a quarter of his or her shift. 
</P>
<P>
 The routine is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Drunks are brought to the command post by patrol officers and cuffed to one of 
the benches for a few minutes. Officers fill out preliminary forms, then 
administer a breath test on the Intoximeter 3000, which measures the amount of 
alcohol in a person's bloodstream. 
</P>
<P>
 With a blood alcohol content of 0.08%, a person is considered legally drunk. 
On Friday and Saturday, many drivers showed blood alcohol levels double or even 
triple what is legal. It showed. Many stood glassy-eyed as officers explained 
the fairly simple procedure: Just blow into the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 These cops have heard it all. CHP Officer T.J. O'Donnell said sometimes the 
drunks are telling the truth. "When a guy says he's only had two beers, he is 
being honest," O'Donnell said. "What he's not telling you is that they were the 
giant size." 
</P>
<P>
 After administering the breath test, the officer can return to the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The drunk is put into an old bus fitted with cages to sober up while 
volunteers call his home. Often, a family member will pick the driver up; but 
sometimes, drunks are driven home one by one at dawn in a refurbished city bus. 
</P>

<P>
 Spotting a drunk driver on the road can be tricky. Often, Roberts said, the 
guy weaving back and forth is just a bad driver -- either tired or distracted 
or fumbling with the radio dial. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize that driving is a full-time job," Roberts said, 
maneuvering his cruiser through the concrete spaghetti of the East Los Angeles 
Interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 After about 2 a.m., though, somewhere between 40% and 50% of the drivers "are 
definitely in a position where they could be under the influence, or very 
close," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, spotting them is easy. 
</P>
<P>
 As he pulled off the eastbound Pomona Freeway at Downey Road, Roberts was 
surprised by a pair of headlights coming the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts flashed his rooftop lights and shined his spotlight into the stalled 
car. Javier, the hapless driver, looked away, as if he were going to try to 
back the car down the ramp. But the car didn't budge. 
</P>
<P>
 From 20 feet away, Javier's car smelled like spoiled beer. Upon closer 
inspection, Roberts discovered why. Javier, 18, had vomited all over the 
driver's side. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many cervezas have you had?" Roberts asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six," Javier answered frankly. A seventh rolled about on the floor of his 
car. He fumbled through sobriety tests such as counting off his fingers one by 
one and standing erect with his eyes closed, head tilted back. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, Javier was cuffed and in the front seat of a patrol car. His 
car had been towed away. And he had thrown up once again. Still, he smiled 
meekly as backup officers took him away. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later on the Hollywood Freeway through Downtown, Roberts spotted 
a Mercedes drifting from side to side in its lane. Near Broadway he flashed it 
to the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 A false alarm. The guy was just tired after spending the day with relatives. 
So Roberts cautioned him to be careful and sent him back into the blur of 
taillights heading toward Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "He promised to pull off and get a cup of coffee," Roberts said. "Hopefully, 
he will."

HIT-AND-RUN SUSPECTED IN DEATH OF JET SKIER AT LAKE; ACCIDENT: GLENDORA MAN, 
51, MAY HAVE BEEN HIT BY ANOTHER USER OF THE 400-POUND MACHINES, WHICH ARE 
PROHIBITED IN SOME CALIFORNIA CITIES.

<P>
 A 51-year-old Glendora man was killed while jet skiing at Castaic Lake State 
Recreation Area on Sunday in an apparent hit-and-run accident that may have 
been caused by another jet skier who fled after the crash, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie Ronald Ellis was found floating in the water about 10:15 a.m. by an 
unidentified friend who accompanied him to the lake, said Steve Henrickson, a 
supervisor at the county-run state park. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital, where he was pronounced dead 
by an emergency room physician, said Deputy Brian Jones of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. Jones said homicide detectives were investigating 
a tip that another skier may have struck Ellis' craft and fled. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first boating fatality of the season at the park and the third 
since the recreational facility opened in 1972. In 1992, a Foster City woman 
died when she was accidentally hit by a jet ski driven by her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's homicide detectives suspect that Ellis may have collided with 
another rider in the upper part of the lake, Jones said. That area -- about one 
mile long, 1/2-mile wide and 200 to 300 feet deep -- was roped off for the 
exclusive use of jet ski riders in 1987 due to safety concerns, Henrickson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaic was one of the first state-owned parks to designate an area for jet 
skiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrickson said there were between 40 and 50 jet skiers in the water at the 
time of the accident but none said they saw or heard the accident. He said 
there was damage to Ellis' jet ski but he could not determine if the damage was 
caused by a previous accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an unusual incident, but we do have a lot of fender-benders with 
these things," he said. In a 1992 interview, Henrickson said: "Their mode of 
operation is to go wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Henrickson said Ellis, who weighed about 250 pounds, might have suffered a 
medical trauma while aboard his Sea-Doo watercraft because he saw no sign of a 
physical injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no visible wounds on him whatsoever," Henrickson said. "We all 
think we know things conclusively by the evidence in hand, and it turns out to 
be totally wrong. I think when they finish with an autopsy, it will reveal a 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Jet skis have been prohibited in several California cities, including Malibu 
in 1992, after complaints arose about the 400-pound, smoke-blowing machines, 
which became popular in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Boaters, surfers and other beach-goers complain that some jet ski riders share 
the aggressiveness that motivates some off-road riders to attempt dangerous 
stunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently there is no state law regulating the use of the 50-horsepower 
machines, other than that the driver must be over 12 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, manufacturers have begun offering training to jet ski owners 
to reduce accidents.

SECOND PARENTHOOD; GRANDPARENTS CALLED UPON TO RAISE CHILDREN'S CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN and ROSE HOWERTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At an age when she was supposed to be through with rearing children, Michele 
MacKenzie is cooking, cleaning and caring for her two grandsons, ages 9 and 2 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 The 52-year-old Van Nuys grandmother did this kind of work while raising her 
own daughter, but she never dreamed of having to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 MacKenzie became a mother to young Shawn and Scotty when drugs and alcohol 
consumed her daughter's life, forcing the retired Pacific Bell employee into an 
exhausting second parenthood that can be both joyous and depressing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I dwell on the most is that I'm just at a time in life where I 
could do as I please," she said. "But you don't have that time because you have 
kids now." 
</P>
<P>
 So many grandparents are taking the place of their adult children as parents 
that a support group has recently formed in Glendale, and others are expected 
to soon form in North Hollywood and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult children are out of the picture for a number of reasons: drug and 
alcohol abuse, incarceration, mental illness and death by murder, suicide or 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandparents, and even some great-grandparents, are left with a swirl of 
emotions and responsibilities at a time when they should be enjoying the golden 
years, or at least planning for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'grand' part is taken out of the grandparent and grandchildren," said 
Sylvie de Toledo, founder of the support group Grandparents as Parents, which 
has several chapters in Southern California, including Glendale's. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not what grandparents want to be doing at this stage of their lives," 
she added. "They want nothing more than to have their adult children get it 
together and be good, appropriate parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "(They) were looking forward to being the doting grandparent, not the parent 
all over again," she said. "The grandparent part of you wants to do all the 
neat things that grandparents do, and the parent part of you has to be the 
disciplinarian. You can't be both." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many grandparents are trying. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the 1990 census, an estimated 3.2 million children under the age of 
18 live with relatives besides their parents, with the vast majority being 
grandparents, Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, an average of 20,694 children a month move in with 
relatives -- a rate that outpaces that of foster home placements. 
</P>
<P>
 As a spokesman with the county Department of Children's Services put it: "The 
trend is clearly in the direction of relatives taking care of children." 
</P>
<P>
 It is happening in families of all racial, social and economic backgrounds, 
from the sprawling San Fernando Valley to the rural farmlands of Wisconsin, 
according to the National Assn. of Grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 MacKenzie, who grew up in a middle-class neighborhood in Culver City, dreams 
of spending more time with her 77-year-old mother and traveling to Montana, 
Utah and the Midwest like her grandparents did. 
</P>
<P>
 But those plans are on hold for at least 16 years until 2 1/2-year-old Scotty 
is old enough to begin living on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the lives of MacKenzie and her companion of 26 years, Jim Johnson, 
revolve around those of her grandchildren. MacKenzie said she has not spoken to 
her 32-year-old daughter for nearly 16 months, partly to protect her grandsons 
from the pain of losing their mother again. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a month, fewer than a dozen grandparents meet in a lounge at the 
Glendale Adult Recreation Center to share advice and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional get-togethers are a time for many of the grandmothers to trade 
tips, such as where to find good day care and how to stand up to their 
occasionally combative adult children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once in a great while, you go to a meeting where everyone's laughing and 
joking," said grandmother Samantha Scott, who also belongs to a support group 
in Culver City. "But that's few and far between. I don't think I've gone to one 
meeting where I haven't busted out crying." 
</P>
<P>
 Seated in a small one-bedroom apartment in North Hollywood that she shares 
with her 2-year-old grandson, Anthony, Scott wiped tears from her eyes as she 
described the agonizing years with her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, the 50-year-old grandmother said, her daughter was uncontrollable and 
sought refuge in gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott has legal custody of her grandson. But she is fighting for the right to 
visit her 15-month-old granddaughter, Ashley, who is still living with her 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm deathly afraid of my daughter," said Scott, who stays in regular contact 
with her daughter but does not tell her where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of me feels guilty, but I knew I did everything I could to be a good 
mother. The only thing I could not provide was a father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my daughter, and I always will," she added. "But I hate her for 
everything she's done to my two grandchildren."

RECALLING WHEN RELIGION HIT HOME FOR HOME RUN HITTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Remember, if you can, what a major league pennant race is like. 
</P>
<P>
 Go back 60 years, in fact, to when heavy hitter Hank Greenberg was helping the 
Detroit Tigers win their first pennant in 25 years -- and, at a crucial point, 
dealt with a much-publicized conflict between his faith and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Jewish High Holy Days approached in September, 1934, Greenberg, a Jew 
from the Bronx, knew that of course he wouldn't play on Yom Kippur, Judaism's 
holiest day, which culminates the 10-day reflective period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers' hold on first place in the pennant race was threatened by the 
second-place New York Yankees, a legendary team that included Lou Gehrig and 
Babe Ruth. And the Tigers were scheduled to face the Boston Red Sox in a 
crucial game on Rosh Hashanah, the first of the holy days. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg's dilemma: Could a righteous Jew suit up on Rosh Hashanah? 
</P>
<P>
 As tonight's Rosh Hashanah ceremonies approached, Earl S. Draimin of North 
Hills recalled that debate 60 years ago, when he was a 17-year-old in Detroit. 
Newspaper headlines in days before the Sept. 10 game alternated between good 
news -- "Hank Will Play" -- and bad -- "Hank Won't Play" -- Draimin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hank Greenberg was only in his second season then, but he was already the 
first big baseball star who was also Jewish," said Draimin, a retired 
manufacturer of television stands and an avid baseball fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg, a first baseman, would finish the 1934 season with 26 homers and a 
.339 batting average. Four years later, he would hit 58 home runs to share the 
record (still standing) with Jimmy Foxx of the Athletics for most home runs in 
a season by a right-handed batter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger pitcher Sandy Koufax, another observant Jew, whose four no-hitters in 
the 1960s put him into the Baseball Hall of Fame, refused to pitch the opening 
game of the World Series in 1965 because the game fell on Yom Kippur. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish law, as interpreted by the Orthodox and Conservative branches of 
Judaism, calls for fasting and abstinence from sex and work on Yom Kippur. 
Whereas the rules for Rosh Hashanah are less restrictive, it is still supposed 
to be a non-working day. But the liberal Reform wing of Judaism generally urges 
followers to engage in prayerful introspection on both days and attend 
synagogue services, but leaves the question of work up to the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Greenberg was raised in an Orthodox Jewish family, the 23-year-old 
ballplayer felt a strong tug of team loyalty in 1934, said Draimin, who 
recalled that reporters elicited a variety of opinions from Detroit rabbis on 
whether an exception was possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg later told reporters that he received telegrams giving him 
conflicting advice from rabbis and Jewish advisers all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Came the big day and Hank was at the Shaarey Tzedec Synagogue that morning, 
so I had to drop in at least to see him, because my apartment was only a block 
away," Draimin said. 
</P>
<P>
 An account in the Detroit Free Press said that Greenberg left the synagogue 
just before game time. "Hank Greenberg chose to play the game because he didn't 
want to 'go back on his team,' " wrote a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before ballparks were equipped with lights for night games, all 
games were played in the afternoon. Draimin said he took the streetcar to Navin 
Field (later renamed Briggs Stadium, then Tiger Stadium) "and got a seat around 
third base for 50 cents" for the game against the Red Sox. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the very first inning it looked like Hank had made the wrong decision," 
Draimin said. Boston scored one run after Greenberg let a potential double-play 
ball get by and prolonged the inning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game was 1-0 until the seventh inning when Hank made amends with a 
terrific four-bagger into Cherry Street to tie the score," Draimin said. 
</P>
<P>
 As confirmed by Draimin's photocopies of that games's box score and partial 
newspaper accounts, the game was one out away from going into extra innings 
when Greenberg came to bat with nobody on base in the bottom of the ninth. "He 
homered a second time and Detroit went crazy," Draimin said. 
</P>
<P>
 As quoted by the Detroit Free Press after the game, Greenberg said, "I did a 
lot of praying before the game and I am going to do a lot of it after, but 
certainly the good Lord did not let me down." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said in his autobiography that he had grown away from his 
ancestral faith, Greenberg did sit out the game on Yom Kippur nine days later 
-- and the Tigers lost, although by then they had a better grip on first place. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, he said that when he showed up in a synagogue that day, he was 
embarrassed because the congregation broke into applause in the midst of the 
service when they recognized him. 
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent years, the Detroit slugger stuck to the pattern he set in 1934: 
abstaining from play on Yom Kippur and taking the field on Rosh Hashanah. 
</P>
<P>
 Poet Edgar A. Guest wrote a poem for the Detroit News in 1935 about 
Greenberg's dedication to his beliefs, concluding with an exchange between two 
Irish fans: 
</P>
<P>
 "We shall lose the game today! We shall miss him in the infield and shall miss 
him at the bat, but he's true to his religion . . . and I honor him for that!" 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg retired after the 1947 season with a lifetime batting average of 
.313 and 331 home runs. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Draimin, who moved to Los Angeles before World War II, never met Greenberg in 
person. But after the Dodgers moved west in 1958, he began giving honors to 
baseball figures as fund-raising events for his synagogue in Van Nuys -- a 
predecessor congregation to what is now Temple Ner Maarav in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 He presented Koufax with an award after the 1959 season for the left-hander's 
feat of striking out 18 batters in one game. Don Drysdale of the Dodgers and 
Albie Pearson of the Los Angeles Angels, both non-Jewish, received awards in 
1962. Later, his synagogue honored Dodger catcher Norm Sherry, who is Jewish, 
and Fran Cey, the Jewish wife of Dodger third baseman Ron Cey, who was known 
for her charitable work. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg lived his last years in Beverly Hills, where he died of cancer in 
1986. Draimin said he telephoned Greenberg early that year, reaching the 
ex-ballplayer at a tennis club, to talk about the 1934 Rosh Hashanah game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him that was the most exciting baseball game I'd ever seen," said 
Draimin, who is a Dodger season ticket-holder. "He told me that his biggest 
thrill came the morning after, when the newspaper headline, 'TIGERS WIN,' was 
written in Hebraic-looking characters."

 1. SAMUEL GOMPERS MIDDLE SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 * 234 E. 112th St., Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Near the turn of the century, the nationwide rallying cry of the fledgling 
labor movement led by Samuel Gompers, the father of the American Federation of 
Labor (now the AFL-CIO), was the eight-hour day. The call helped attract 
workers to the cause of unionism. California instituted the eight-hour day for 
women workers in 1913; it later was extended to minors. In 1974, adult men were 
finally brought under the state wage and hour law. Gompers always summed up 
what he wanted for his union members as "more." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year after the Samuel Gompers Middle School was named after 
the union leader in 1936, PTA members protested. They wanted it named in honor 
of humorist Will Rogers. In the early 1950s, the Lakewood Unified School 
District also named one of its elementary schools after the union leader. 
</P>
<P>
 2. 3RD STREET TUNNEL 
</P>
<P>
 * Hill and 3rd streets, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 20, 1900, 12 workmen were buried alive and others were disabled by a 
landslide in the half-completed 3rd Street Tunnel. Two days earlier, two 
workmen had been killed in a cave-in at the same site. The contractors declared 
they had no liability for workers injured on the job, and city officials 
decided that since it was an accident, no liability could be attached. Angry 
Los Angeles trade unionists lobbied year after year following the accidents to 
get worker's compensation legislation to protect workers like these. It took 
more than a decade, but in 1911, legislators enacted a voluntary plan of 
compensation benefits. Two years later, benefits were made compulsory, 
regardless of fault. 
</P>
<P>
 3. EMBASSY HOTEL AND AUDITORIUM 
</P>
<P>
 * 851 S. Grand Ave., Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Originally built as a concert hall in 1914, the auditorium served as a 
rallying place for progressive organizations and immigrant unions from the 
1920s to the 1950s. In 1933, Rose Pesotta, a Jewish woman who would later 
become vice president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, led 
1,500 dressmakers in an organizing meeting here, launching a monthlong strike 
which won them a small wage increase and recognition. The hotel/auditorium has 
been closed since January's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 4. LOS ANGELES TIMES 
</P>
<P>
 * 1st Street and Broadway, Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Early on the morning of Oct. 1, 1910, a huge explosion tore apart the Los 
Angeles Times building on the northeast corner of 1st Street and Broadway, 
setting off a roaring fire that killed 20 men. The anti-union paper immediately 
blamed the bomb blast on leaders of organized labor. The confession of two 
ironworkers' leaders, John and Jim McNamara, discredited labor's fight against 
the open shop, and organized labor suffered a severe setback as a result of the 
bombing. The bitter and often violent struggle between labor and capitalists 
would grip the nation until the outbreak of World War II. However, Los Angeles, 
which embraced the open shop principle, remained mostly on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times building was rebuilt on the same site, with a plaque commemorating 
the men who died. When that building was torn down in 1938, the plaque went 
into storage. Today, the site, later occupied by a state building that was also 
torn down, is fenced off and filled with six-foot-high weeds. Plans for a new 
civic center office tower on the site have been collecting dust since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 5. CESAR CHAVEZ AVENUE 
</P>
<P>
 * Through Boyle Heights and East Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 A former apricot picker and founder of the United Farm Workers union, Cesar 
Chavez fought to organize farm workers in California's Central Valley and 
fasted to bring attention to the plight of the workers and their families. In 
1965, Chavez began urging consumers to boycott table grapes, eventually forcing 
the growers to the bargaining table. Ten years later, the state Legislature 
passed the Agriculture Labor Relations Act, the landmark law that gave farm 
workers the right to collective bargaining and to seek redress for unfair job 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In honor of the late labor leader, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
and City Council renamed Brooklyn Avenue, one of the city's oldest streets, 
which extends from the Los Angeles River to Atlantic Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 6. UPTON SINCLAIR'S HOUSE 
</P>
<P>
 * 464 N. Myrtle Ave., Monrovia 
</P>

 Pulitzer Prize-winning author and social reformer Upton Sinclair shocked the 
nation in 1906 when he described the filth in Chicago's slaughterhouses and the 
horrors of working conditions there in his book "The Jungle." Government 
inspection of meat began soon after his book was published, but it wasn't until 
1970 that the Occupational Safety and Health Act was passed.

<P>
 After Pasadena became too crowded for him, Sinclair moved to Monrovia, where 
he lived from 1942 to 1966.

 7. STRAWBERRY FIELDS 
</P>
<P>
 * Bounded by Rush Street, Central Avenue, Whittier Narrows Recreation Center 
and the Rio Hondo River, South El Monte 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1933, years before developers paved over the strawberry fields that 
were part of the City of El Monte, several thousand pickers went on strike, 
protesting their low wages of 9 cents an hour. Their leader was Zenaida (Sadie) 
Castro, a feisty Mexican American and one of the few pickers who spoke English. 
When she wasn't holding off the union busters, she was cooking rice and beans 
for the strikers. As news of the strike spread, Mexican and Japanese immigrant 
workers in the celery and onion fields of Venice, Culver City and Santa Monica 
demanded higher wages. Within a few months, pickers' wages were increased to 20 
cents an hour. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

EX-SCOUT LEADER LOSES LAWSUIT OVER HIS FIRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Highland Park-area Boy Scout leader who was fired after being accused 
of registering 1,400 nonexistent members has lost a lawsuit that sought damages 
for what he considered a wrongful termination. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge dismissed the case last week after ruling 
that former area leader Aster M. Amit submitted fake membership registrations 
to Boy Scout officials and that he failed to prove he was ordered to do so by 
his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by Judge Stephen E. O'Neil said Amit "simply gave no credible 
testimony whatsoever" to prove his case. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also cited testimony by Boy Scout executive Edward C. Jacobs that 
Amit's termination came because of the fake registrations. "You cheat, you get 
caught, you're fired," Jacobs testified. "When we learn of (cheating), we fire 
the employee." 
</P>
<P>
 Amit was fired April 3, 1991, from his job recruiting low-income and minority 
boys in the Highland Park area. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard P. Dieffenbach, the attorney for the Boy Scouts, said the ruling 
vindicates the organization and brings an end "to all the bad publicity that 
was generated . . . on this subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Amit could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute started in March, 1991, when a fired Scout community director 
claimed that the local council routinely inflated membership rosters to attract 
larger donations, which sometimes are based on membership. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the area council asked the national organization to audit its 
membership figures. That audit turned up evidence of 1,400 nonexistent members, 
all signed up by Amit. The area council fired Amit from his $18,000-a-year job 
and demanded his supervisor's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy Scout supervisors have tightened registration procedures since the matter 
came to light, Dieffenbach said.

CHILDREN TREATED TO SCHOOL SHOPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an American ritual as old as the public school system, the annual fall 
trek to buy new clothes, pencils and paper before the start of the new school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Los Angeles Police Department and the Northridge-Chatsworth 
Rotary Club maintain that new supplies are more than just a luxury: They can 
also be a part of building a child's self-esteem.And too many Los Angeles 
children have never known the excitement of the back-to-school shopping trip, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, 25 children from the Junior Watch program at the LAPD's 
Devonshire station were treated to a shopping spree, with help from the 
Northridge-Chatsworth Rotary Club, the Police Activity League Supporters and 
Mervyn's. 
</P>
<P>
 Each child picked out $46 worth of clothing and also received a new backpack 
containing a notebook, paper, pencils and a ruler. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy, 11, walked through rack after rack of frilly dresses and bright print 
shorts, searching for the perfect items. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents don't take me shopping that much," she said. "I like to look nice, 
especially for my first year at junior high." She ran her choices -- a pair of 
shorts, undergarments, a shirt and a pair of jeans -- by her friends, and 
Officer Sally Barnes, who created the Junior Watch program for at-risk 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all these new clothes and supplies," Barnes told them, "I expect to see 
report cards coming in with outstanding grades."

TIP FOILS ABDUCTION OF GIRL, 3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 3-year-old girl was returned safely to her mother after being abducted 
briefly early Sunday from their Nisson Road apartment, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bizarre incident played out when a neighbor notified 20-year-old Laura 
Morgan at about 1:40 a.m. Sunday that an unknown man was seen carrying her 
child, Elizabeth Morgan, within the apartment complex, said Tustin Police Sgt. 
David Kreyling. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan and her boyfriend, 32-year-old Chris Thompson, chased the man, who put 
the girl down unharmed and fought briefly with Thompson before escaping, 
Kreyling said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man had apparently reached in a bedroom window of the single-story 
apartment and snatched Elizabeth while her mother and Thompson slept, Kreyling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt although the two men "slugged it out a little bit," Kreyling 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect was described as white, between 40 and 45 years old, about 6 feet 
tall and 180 pounds with brown hair and brown eyes. He fled in a brown, 1980s 
vintage four-door compact car. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are investigating the incident as a kidnaping, and Morgan's ex-husband 
has been initially ruled out as a suspect, Kreyling said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investigators say everything is on the up-and-up with the ex-husband," 
Kreyling said. "It's strange. Throughout the U.S. we seem to be getting more 
and more of these things. . . . This ended in a nice way for a change."

BLAZE DAMAGES APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A transient who left a smoldering cigarette in an earthquake-damaged apartment 
building in Chatsworth was blamed for causing a fire Sunday that resulted in 
$3,000 in damage to a second-story unit, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze broke out in an abandoned building in the 10000 block of De Soto 
Avenue around 11:30 a.m., said Brian Humphrey of the Los Angeles Fire 
Department.The building was damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake and was fenced 
and boarded to discourage trespassing, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 20 firefighters about 25 minutes to extinguish the blaze, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, dozens of damaged apartment buildings in the San 
Fernando Valley have become havens for transients, according to the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators found evidence indicating that someone had been living in 
the unit prior to the blaze, Humphrey said.

FIREFIGHTERS LABOR TO DOUSE BLAZE AT RECYCLING FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters took nearly eight hours Sunday to put out a stubborn fire in a 
large pile of wood chips at a compost and recycling yard in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said 13 companies 
and 65 firefighters responded to the blaze, which broke out at 4:36 a.m. on the 
12400 block of West Branford Street. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries and no structures were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey could not estimate the cost of the damage because the wood was 
discarded and headed for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the fire at the Comet Co., a compost and recycling firm, is under 
investigation, Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Bill Jackson, one of the firm's owners, said he believes the fire was 
deliberately set. Jackson said that a chain-link fence around the property had 
been cut with wire cutters. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing appeared to be missing Sunday, but Jackson said his business has been 
burglarized several times in the past two years.

MAN ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A police Special Weapons and Tactics team stormed a house in Panorama City 
early Sunday and arrested a man on suspicion of kidnaping his girlfriend and 
holding her in a bathroom for six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Frank Reynoso of the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill Division 
identified the suspect as Frank Fisher, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began about 1:30 a.m. when police arrived in the 13000 block of 
Tonopah Street on a domestic dispute call. Fisher had barricaded himself in the 
bathroom with his girlfriend and her daughter, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man released the younger woman but refused to let his girlfriend leave, 
Reynoso said. Members of the department's SWAT team forced their way into the 
house at about 8 a.m. and arrested Fisher, Reynoso said. No one was hurt.

VALLEY CHRONICLE: PATHOLOGIST-LAWYER BELIEVES IN TYING UP LOOSE ENDS ON JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Griffith D. Thomas of Sherman Oaks has developed a case of phone phobia. 
</P>
<P>
 These days he never knows whether a caller wants to talk about business, 
murder and mayhem or bow ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, 54, both a pathologist and a lawyer, has made news recently because of 
his choice of neckwear. Along with his sharp wit, his sharp ties have gained 
him some measure of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 But because he has served as an expert witness in many murder cases, 
particularly when DNA is an issue, he has received calls from TV producers who 
want him to tie up the O. J. Simpson case into sound bites. 
</P>
<P>
 That idea is so ignorant it makes him angry. Thomas does like to talk about 
his sartorial splendor and doesn't mind getting caught up in the knotty 
question of common ties versus bow ties. 
</P>
<P>
 That began when he was profiled in the Los Angeles Daily Journal and mentioned 
the benefits of performing autopsies in a bow tie. 
</P>
<P>
 He repeated part of that explanation in a letter to California Lawyer 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote, in part: "I enjoyed your article on bow ties in Style and thought 
you would enjoy my ultimately pragmatic reason (as a lawyer and a physician who 
conducts autopsies) for wearing bow ties for over 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm doing an autopsy, a regular tie will fall into the corpse's thoracic 
cavity," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The comment was printed all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas didn't know whether to be flattered by the attention or not. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was definitely happier talking to fellow professionals about the 
question than he was with having to repeatedly turn down the jaundiced 
journalists from certain television shows who assumed he would go on camera and 
make pronouncements about the Simpson case whether he had all the facts or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The money offered, he says, would have made it worth his time and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 A man with a bachelor's degree from Loyola University, a medical degree from 
USC and a jurisprudence degree from UCLA who is board-certified in anatomical, 
clinical and forensic pathology, Thomas says ties are good talking points but 
forensic medicine should be left to those working on a case. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who did his pathology residency at Yale University after graduating at 
the top of his medical school class, thought picking up a law degree would be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did very badly the first year. I struggled to keep up," he says. "There is 
a tremendous difference in the way of thinking between law and medicine. I had 
to retrain my thinking in order to graduate," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing medical school he did a tour of duty with the U.S. Public 
Health Service. He went to Japan as a member of a commission that interviewed 
survivors of the atomic bomb blasts. He says it changed his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then a political conservative, he became a practicing liberal, 
championing those he felt were misunderstood and under-represented, including 
those in right-to-die cases, victims of AIDS and other controversial causes. 
</P>
<P>
 He is married to a former Catholic nun and now co-chairs the Los Angeles 
County Bar Assn.'s bioethics committee, an area of law he thinks will grow more 
and more complex. 
</P>
<P>
 And he continues to wear bow ties. Fall on Head Clears Vision of North 
Hollywood Woman 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 22, Jerrilyn Miller was at a Malibu party with her boyfriend. 
They'd been drinking and arguing, and when she backed away from him, she fell 
off a 30-foot cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 She was banged up badly. She remembered nothing. Nothing at all, says Miller, 
now 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "I must have been in the hospital for weeks and couldn't remember anything 
that happened before I arrived," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Later she shined shoes in Hollywood, and then sold sandwiches at A&M Records 
and at 20th Century Fox Studios. She went through a rotten marriage, and a 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 When the graduate of North Hollywood High School inherited enough money 
several years ago so that she didn't need to work, she decided to devote 
herself to good works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just do little things, like carrying around dog food in my car for homeless 
people with animals," Miller says. "I write articles for the Valley Storefront 
in North Hollywood and about the people who work and volunteer there." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have written several plays and had them produced in the Valley," says 
Miller. "I know it could have turned out differently if my parents and friends 
hadn't been there for me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to commit random acts of kindness, like giving little girls ribbons, 
or doing a favor for someone. I know what goes around comes around," she adds. 
Overheard: 
</P>
<P>
 "He's in touch with his inner child. I wish he would meet up with his outer 
adult."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County homicide detectives are investigating the death of an 
elderly Lake Los Angeles woman whose charred body was found in the debris of a 
garage fire, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters found the body of the unidentified 87-year-old woman after they

CARRYING OUT THEIR MARCHING ORDERS -- IN STYLE; YOUTH: A NEW DIRECTOR AND 
CHOREOGRAPHER FINE-TUNE SAUGUS HIGH SCHOOL'S BAND PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the end of summer comes the familiar ritual of training camp for Saugus 
High School senior Robert Chesebrough. 
</P>
<P>
 There's all the sweat that comes from hustling through new patterns and 
running back to his starting position, only to repeat the same patterns. And if 
you screw up, Robert said, chances are you'll have to run a lap around the 
football field. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert isn't practicing for the school's football team. The 17-year-old plays 
trumpet for the school's marching band. And he says he faces more of a 
challenge than do his classmates practicing football plays nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is more intense physically, but here you have to be more mentally 
focused, or you lose it," he said. "It's hot, it's intense, and if you're not 
paying attention, you lose your place in the set." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and the other band members don't seem to mind the hard work. After all, 
it has transformed a non-competitive band that some say was "dying" from lack 
of student interest into one of the most competitive in Southern California 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? A coaching change, according to band members. 
</P>
<P>
 Band director Robert Gibson, 41, took charge five years ago, when the band of 
about 30 students was accustomed to standing in place while performing halftime 
tunes. Entering competitions was never seriously considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the director then was not an aggressive person," Gibson said. "He 
wouldn't go out and go that extra two or three miles, let alone the extra 
mile." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said one of the biggest reasons for his success has been bringing drill 
choreographer Todd Ryan, a longtime friend, to the school for a week each of 
the last four years to design the band's routine. Supporters said the school 
was the first in Santa Clarita to bring in an outside choreographer -- now all 
of them do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normal bands march in squares and circles, but he has us do walk-throughs and 
other things that normally a group of people can't do," said Jamie Kamp, 17, a 
senior who wields a flag as part of the visual-effects portion of the show -- 
something that didn't exist in earlier years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 students are in the band this year, down from about 100 the year 
before only because many have been transferred to a new school opening this 
fall. The 70 have championships to defend in three of five regional 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, five Saugus High students were selected to participate in the Rose 
Bowl's high school band, the only Santa Clarita Valley students selected for 
the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Ryan's five days at the school ended Friday. He divided his time between 
shouting commands from a small tower at the edge of the field and walking 
between the rows of marchers. He barked out orders and marching chants like a 
military cadence. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we were running laps this morning, so you can make your body move 
that much faster," he told the students through a bullhorn. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ryan, 36, a resident of Madison, Wis., describes himself as an easygoing 
guy. He said he started designing band programs 10 years ago when he finished 
college, because he saw few others doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 He has arranged programs for high school bands appearing in the Orange Bowl 
and Rose Bowl games, plus several programs in Europe. He works with about 2,000 
students a year -- 1,500 at a multi-school summer band camp, the rest at eight 
to 10 schools like Saugus that hire him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan's work with the Saugus band this year was made possible by the school's 
parent advisory committee, which raised $3,000 through bake sales and other 
unpretentious fund-raisers, said Lester Freeman, committee vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said the effort pays dividends when he sees the band on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the difference between driving a Mercedes-Benz and driving a 
Chevrolet," he said.

DISTRICT OKS $107,000 FOR REPAIRS AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District has authorized $107,000 for emergency 
repairs to the electrical system at Corona del Mar High School, where aging 
lead cables gave out and caused a campus blackout Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old cable deteriorated and allowed water to seep into lines, 
causing the outage.The school's main circuit breaker also failed. 
</P>
<P>
 It meant 750 feet of high-voltage cable had to be replaced before the power 
could came back on, said Carolyn Stocker, the school district's executive 
director of business services and auxiliary operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is another piece which should done, but it's holding its own," she 
said. "What you're seeing is the infrastructure in our schools is aged and in 
need of replacement." 
</P>
<P>
 The malfunction, which occurred when an air-conditioning contractor threw the 
switch to turn on the new units, kept the lights out for 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes were not in session, Stocker said, but the problem delayed completion 
of the air-conditioning project and forced the district to pay premium prices 
for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were paying a higher price because we were paying for overtime," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocker said she will seek authorization to have the other, 500-foot section 
replaced during the winter school break, at an estimated cost of $40,000. HOLLY

MAN, WOMAN SLAIN NEAR DOWNTOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man and a woman were killed early Sunday when automatic rifle fire from the 
sidewalk riddled their passing car in a drug- and gang-infested area near 
Downtown Los Angeles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, reportedly in their late 20s or early 30s, were riding in a car 
on Burlington Avenue in the Westlake district when the attack occurred about 
2:40 a.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 They suffered multiple gunshot wounds, and their car crashed into a utility 
pole. Their identities were not immediately released. No one had been arrested 
in the shootings, said police, who knew of no motive in the killings.

PIPE BOMB FOUND ON GARDEN GROVE FREEWAY DEFUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A small pipe bomb found on the shoulder of the westbound Garden Grove Freeway 
was safely removed and defused by the Orange County Sheriff's bomb squad Sunday 
morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The westbound lanes between Euclid and Brookhurst streets were closed for an 
hour and 10 minutes after a California Department of Transportation cleanup 
crew found the device at 10:09 a.m., a California Highway Patrol dispatcher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One end of the 1-by-6-inch device appeared to have a fuse that had been 
burned, but it didn't detonate, said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Bill Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not known how the device came to be placed on the freeway shoulder.

HUNTINGTON DISTRICT TO TRIM LANGUAGE, ARTS REQUIREMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The school board that governs all high schools in Huntington Beach, 
Westminster and Fountain Valley has proposed lowering the arts-or-language 
requirement for graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Union High School District trustees last week introduced a 
policy revision that calls for reducing by six months the time a student must 
take either a foreign language or visual or performing arts in order to 
graduate. The lowered requirement would be effective for the class graduating 
in June, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Current school district policy requires a student to take two years of a 
foreign language or two years of a visual or performing arts course. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised policy would allow a student to graduate with 1 1/2 years of 
foreign language or visual or performing arts, or a mixture of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 The board gave first reading to the policy revision with no debate or 
discussion. Second reading and adoption of the measure is scheduled at the 
board's Sept. 20 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 District Supt. David Hagen said he does not think cutting the arts-or-language 
requirement is academically harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are doing is giving the students more flexibility," Hagen said. "The 
district has very heavy graduation requirements, such as requiring three years 
of mathematics. This (change) would allow some of our kids to take more classes 
that they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Many four-year colleges and universities require a high school graduate to 
have completed at least two years of a foreign language before being considered 
for admission. Hagen said he believes college-oriented students will continue 
to complete two years of language. He noted that the classes will still be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Dirk Voss, a frequent critic of the district, also said he 
supports the language-or-arts change, saying many high school students want to 
take more business and science courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss said the reduction in the arts-or-language requirement allows students 
more opportunity to take classes they feel they need. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to reducing the language-or-arts requirement for graduation, the 
school board's action also proposes to remove a computer-knowledge provision. 
Current district policy requires each high school student to "demonstrate 
competency in computer education" before being able to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 The new change would remove that requirement. Hagen said computers are 
commonly used both in schools and at homes, so students no longer need to be 
tested for computer competency. The old requirement was enacted in the early 
1980s, when computers where relatively new, Hagen said.

SHOP TALK: MANY AVENUES CAN BE TAKEN IN DISPUTE OVER LAYOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Do you have a question about an on-the-job situation? If so, please mail it 
to Shop Talk, Los Angeles Times, P.O. Box 2008, Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Or 
call (714) 966-7873 and leave a voice mail message with your name and where you 
live. Questions of general interest will be answered in this column on Mondays.

<P>
 Question: I worked for a publishing company until last spring, when I got into 
an argument with my supervisor. Two weeks later, I was conveniently "laid off" 
-- as part of a restructuring that eliminated my job only. On the day I was let 
go, I was given only four hours to clean out my desk. 
</P>
<P>
 All full-time employees at that company are given 10 hours each month to be 
used for vacations and sick leave. When I left the company, I was owed 45 such 
hours for which I have never been paid. Is there any way, short of a lawsuit, 
that I can get the company to give me that money due me? 
</P>
<P>
 -- F.A., Dana Point 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The Labor Code requires payment of all wages immediately upon 
discharge. "Wages" include accrued vacation time. Sick leave is not generally 
treated as "wages" by law, but if your employer had a policy that unpaid sick 
leave is payable upon termination of employment, then it too would be included 
as wages. 
</P>
<P>
 If the employer does not pay your wages as required, the wages for which it is 
responsible continue for up to 30 working days. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have other claims as well. Many companies have an "open door" policy 
and encourage dialogue to resolve differences. Your manager may have violated 
this policy if he was unnecessarily belligerent and vengeful, and you were laid 
off in bad faith. You may then have a claim for lost earnings until you find 
new work at equal pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Restructuring" or "downsizing" is a legitimate reason for layoff, but it 
cannot be used as an excuse for violating company policies, discrimination or 
getting rid of whistle-blowers. If the "argument" you had with your employer 
concerned your objection to illegal practices or discrimination, and the 
employer retaliated against you for those objections, you would have a claim 
not just for lost wages, but also for emotional distress and even "punishment" 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Without filing a lawsuit through an attorney you can encourage your employer 
to pay you those wages in the following ways: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Explaining the law -- Perhaps the easiest way to educate your former 
employers regarding the law is by sending them a copy of this response. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Labor commissioner -- The California labor commissioner will help you 
recover wage claims without charge. Call (714) 558-4111. It may take many 
months to complete the process. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Small-claims court -- A quick alternative is filing a small-claims suit 
yourself. However, you are limited to $5,000, and if you win your employer can 
appeal it to a higher court, where attorneys would be used. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Attorney negotiation -- Even without filing a suit, an attorney can put 
pressure on your employer to pay you what is owed.

 Question: I'm a manager at a mid-size company and oversee the work of several 
supervisors and other exempt personnel. We count on those who are on salary to 
stay in the office as long as needed to get the work finished, but we let them 
set their own hours. 
</P>
<P>
 What should I do with a salaried worker who performs his duties but often 
slips out early while others are busy and who usually comes in late the day 
after a late-night session to meet a deadline? 
</P>
<P>
 -- G.M., Tustin 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You need to communicate your expectations to this employee as soon as 
possible. The problem could be as simple as a lack of understanding about what 
the supervisor's job entails. On the other hand, it sounds as if there might 
already be quite a bit of resentment from the other supervisors who feel this 
individual is not pulling his or her weight. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is the case, a group meeting might be needed so that you and the 
supervisors can discuss what the expectations are for completing work projects. 
It may be that you need to have greater structure -- developing some guidelines 
or policies concerning work hours and workload. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the majority of supervisors seem to understand the importance of working 
late on projects, you probably want to allow the group some say in the 
implementing of any policy decisions regarding work scheduling.

 Question: I worked for a company as an independent contractor and have two 
contracts signed by these people, both of which have 30-day termination 
clauses. The job was terminated by them in June, without the 30-day notice. One 
of the contracts indicates that litigation can take place only in Indiana. When 
should I start legal action? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.M., Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: You can start legal action immediately, but you should first think 
carefully about whether litigation is really worth the cost and trouble. It 
appears that the most you could recover in a lawsuit is 30 days' worth of pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Most independent contractor agreements may be terminated for any reason 
whatsoever upon the giving of the prescribed amount of notice, but if such 
notice is not given, all you can sue for is the pay you would have earned 
during the notice period. You cannot collect emotional distress damages, 
punitive damages or attorney fees in this type of lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 You should weigh the cost of hiring an attorney, paying court costs, and 
perhaps even having to travel to Indiana to sue (though a California court 
might allow you to sue here and apply Indiana law) against the amount of money 
you are likely to recover if you win.

 Question: I work for a large retail organization that pays no salary, only 
commission. We are required to punch in on a daily basis and work certain 
hours. We're also required to spend about 50 hours in the store and work 
overtime, as much as 20 extra hours a week, depending on when there are sales. 
Is this legal or do they need to give us a salary? 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.L., Orange 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: In general, the law does not impose any limit on the number of hours 
an employee may be required to work, nor does it give employees the right to 
refuse to work overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue appears to be whether you are entitled to overtime pay, (i.e. 1 1/2 
times your regular pay). The law excludes from the minimum wage and overtime 
provisions executive, administrative and professional employees and outside 
salespeople -- employees who customarily and regularly work away from their 
employer's place of business. Also excluded from the overtime pay provisions 
are certain commissioned employees of retail and service businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Your job description may fall within this exclusion. However, since the 
regulations concerning this area are quite complex, it would be advisable for 
you to contact the state Labor Department to determine whether you are an 
employee entitled to overtime pay.

O.C. ENTERPRISE: COOKIE CREATIONS CUT OUT FOR SUCCESS; IRVINE FIRM OFFERS 
FLOURY BOUQUETS FOR ALL OCCASIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARILYN BANKOLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Substituting flour for flowers, this business' recipe for success is to 
deliver bright, buttery bouquets throughout Orange County's office buildings, 
hospitals and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a strategy that Cookie Creations' founders, Ryan and Susan Slate, say has 
yielded double the sales that they expected when they began 21 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Cookie Creations is a specialty retailer that mixes the marketing techniques 
of a flower shop with the tasty appeal of a bakery. It makes and sells cookie 
bouquets and other decorative bakery goods that are most often bought as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets hectic," Susan Slate says. "We thought we'd get a break after June of 
this year, but it hasn't been true." The spring gift-giving season -- with 
presents for grads, dads and brides -- usually tapers off in late June, but 
monthly sales have continued to grow, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners say they expect sales to increase to $250,000 this year, compared 
to $165,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of Cookie Creations' success is an oversized butter-sugar 
cookie that the company bakes and decorates, then fastens to a stick and 
arranges in a basket. The average "bouquet" contains seven cookies and costs 
$37.50. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're different, original and a good substitute for flowers -- especially 
for men who don't like to get flowers," Susan Slate says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fountain Valley couple say they selected an Irvine strip mall for their 
bakery because of its young, affluent population and sizable business 
community. "We had to find an area that wouldn't think $5 was an outrageous 
amount to pay for a cookie," Susan Slate says. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts say that the company's marketing strategy seeks to tap a 
certain desire among many Americans, especially those 20 to 25 years old, to 
maintain a low-fat diet but occasionally splurge. 
</P>
<P>
 "People seem to still want to be able to treat themselves to something on more 
of the decadent end," says Jannie Herchuk, an audit partner in the Costa Mesa 
office of the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Specialty gift-food businesses such as Cookie Creations have been growing in 
popularity for the past five years, Herchuk says, adding that having a good 
location in an upscale area with high foot traffic is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 The bakery site doubles as factory and showroom for Cookie Creations. 
Passersby can get a whiff of freshly baked goodies and a kaleidoscope of color 
from the more than 50 bright bouquets on display. One whimsical basket filled 
with cookies shaped like clown faces suggests, "Let's Clown Around." "Holy Cow! 
You're 50 Now," says a bouquet of cookies resembling cows. A third basket, 
adorned with cookies decorated to look like an apple, a schoolhouse and 
chalkboard, heads "To a Class Act." 
</P>
<P>
 At the back of the shop, about six workers roll, cut, bake, drill, decorate, 
arrange and package the cookies for local deliveries or for shipping. Cookies 
can also be purchased separately or in bouquets of three to 12. A single 
decorated cookie costs $5. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent visit, the factory was abuzz with an order that came in around 
lunchtime for five, 12-cookie baskets to be shipped by 4 p.m. (The store 
normally requires a day's notice for large orders but can churn out more than 
150 cookies in 24 hours if necessary.) Two workers wrap the cookies in bubble 
plastic while store manager Bette Weitl whips trays from the oven. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace of business is very seasonal, Weitl says. During holidays the staff 
doubles in number to about 12, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 An early Cookie Creations customer is Scott Kambak, an educational 
psychologist in Fullerton, who began ordering cookie baskets as gifts to those 
who refer patients to him. Kambak, who directs a private school for students 
with learning and emotional disabilities, says he heard about Cookie Creations 
from his sister shortly after it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did the number of referrals grow but so too did his orders at Cookie 
Creations. He says he now sends about 24 bouquets a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a very unique thank you," he says. "The price seems right to me . . 
. because of the response that we get. They're very, very unique, very, very 
exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine orthodontist James Passamano orders cookies for his patients to help 
them celebrate when their braces come off. The cookies -- one for each patient 
-- are shaped like a big tooth and say, "Keep Smiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Cookie Creations' designs are gleaned from children's coloring books, 
Susan Slate says. Professional cake decorators help refine the product. 
</P>
<P>
 Store manager Weitl says the shop often gets requests for cookies decorated 
with a company's logo or motif. People also come to the store with pictures and 
portraits. Only once was she forced to turn down a design: a special request 
for a racy bridal shower gift. 
</P>
<P>
 But such snags seem minor compared to the Slates' earliest and biggest hurdle: 
finding just the right cookie recipe. They needed a cookie that would taste 
good, hold its shape in the oven, withstand considerable decorating and remain 
upright on a wooden stem.  
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Slate says the winning combination of ingredients came from his 
grandmother in Orange, who sent over a recipe for vanilla butterfingers she had 
clipped from a newspaper about 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Slates admit they knew little about operating a bakery when they started 
Cookie Creations. Susan Slate was a sixth-grade teacher at Richman Elementary 
in Fullerton and Ryan was completing a master's degree in business 
administration at USC when they opened Cookie Creations. 
</P>
<P>
 After the birth of their daughter Melanie in April, Susan Slate says, she 
decided to teach part time this fall. Ryan Slate began working at a Los Angeles 
toy company after stepping away from the business in March, leaving most of the 
day-to-day operations in the hands of store manager Weitl, who is his aunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members have helped the store since its start, the Slates say. Unable 
to receive conventional business financing, the couple raised about $65,000 to 
start the business by taking out personal loans and refinancing their home. 
Family members offered sweat equity. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad is an electrician, my brother is a contractor and Ryan's cousin is a 
plumber," Susan Slate says. "My brother-in-law took the photos for the 
brochure. My mother helped put wallpaper up and Ryan's grandmother helped when 
it got really busy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Slates say they had considered purchasing a franchise of Cookies by 
Design, a Dallas-based corporation with several stores in California, but 
decided they would rather do it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Perry, who opened a Cookies by Design shop in Redondo Beach 10 months 
ago, estimates that the parent company has grown by 60% in the past three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry says he expects to soon be profitable after his initial $70,000 to 
$80,000 investment. "It's about where we thought we should be. . . . Maybe we 
expected a little higher than we produced," he says. Primary competition in 
this type of business comes from florists, he says. "But the key is that we can 
personalize" the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 C.J. Albers, who owns Conroy's Flowers in Irvine, says she does not get many 
requests for cookie bouquets, but she does get "numerous" orders for bouquets 
of flowers accompanied by boxes of cookies. The flower shop can arrange for 
cookie bouquets on request, she says, "but I don't see that as a big source of 
revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Florist manager Shahida Aziz says she too gets "crazy" requests for 
cookies on a stem but turns them down. Rather, she says, the shop offers 
gourmet baskets that can be filled with just about anything. The trend for 
orders at florists is more toward specialty gift baskets, Aziz says. "Everybody 
wants something unusual or something new." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of Cookie Creations say there is plenty of room for more of its 
bakeries in Orange County. If the pace of growth holds up, the Slates say, they 
will consider opening another shop in Newport Beach or Huntington Beach. "But 
it takes a considerable amount of energy to put one of these things together."

BRIGHTER OUTLOOK FOR CALIFORNIA; PLAYING A NEW TUNE; MANUFACTURERS SPENDING 
AGAIN FOR PLANTS, EQUIPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Derrick McCoy, a 19-year-old student at El Camino College in Torrance, 
saw the newspaper ad, he couldn't believe his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Buy Co., a national retailer of consumer electronics, said it was 
planning to open seven new stores in Southern California by November and would 
be having job fairs to hire 1,400 people. 
</P>
<P>
 He rushed right down to the Torrance Holiday Inn, where he waited in line last 
week with fellow student Billy Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we saw the ad, we thought it was a lie at first," said McCoy, who had 
become used to being rebuffed for jobs at other retailers. Other employers 
"usually say they're not hiring -- or if they say they are, they say it's 
temporary." 
</P>
<P>
 McCoy's disbelief is understandable. He came of age in a California seemingly 
unable to shake a job-draining, confidence-shaking recession. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, the story is different. California is pulling itself out of its 
recessionary pit. Companies around the state are starting to spend money again: 
for new plants, new equipment and, to a lesser extent, new employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Though forecasts continue to predict slow, if any, overall growth in state 
employment or output in the next few years -- and though news of layoffs, 
out-of-state defections and business closures continues -- there are signs of 
life in specific sectors and areas of the state. These include retailers, 
entertainment companies and makers of everything from guitars to steel to 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing some strong indications of recovery," said Gary Conley, 
president of the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. "We have 
individual companies that are coming to us, both retailers and industrial 
companies, with specific plans for major expansion in the area. It's 
particularly important that we're seeing retailers, . . . because that is a 
strong sign of confidence in the economy overall." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Lee, regional manager of Minneapolis-based Best Buy, echoed that 
sentiment: "We're optimistic. We're prepared to come into California. . . . 
We're a very cost-effective operation; we're able to compete and withstand very 
low profit margins." 
</P>
<P>
 A survey by Manpower International released last month found that 23% of 
California companies are planning to increase staffing levels in the last 
quarter of this year, whereas 12% plan cuts. The latter "is not a low number -- 
but it is significantly better than it has been in the past," said Sue 
Foigelman, the temporary employment firm's area manager in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the outlook is particularly strong for Greater Los Angeles, 
where 27% of employers said they will be increasing staffing and only 5% said 
they will be cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists attribute the renewed optimism to a variety of factors. The 
recession has driven land prices and rents to rock-bottom levels. Retail sales, 
meanwhile, have surged -- in part fueled by the infusion of federal emergency 
money in the wake of January's Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative changes last year reformed the state's fraud-ridden workers' 
compensation system and provided tax relief to businesses. And some executives 
talk about a new attitude of accommodation toward business on the part of local 
and state officials. 
</P>
<P>
 As of the end of July, commercial loans by large California banks were up 8.9% 
above the level of a year before, said Lynn Reaser, chief economist at First 
Interstate Bancorp. That reverses a longtime trend of declining lending, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen business loan demand increase this year, a sign of greater 
optimism on the part of companies," Reaser said. "They're investing in 
inventory and upgrading equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is not to suggest that California is out of the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still important impediments to robust overall growth. The decline in 
defense and aerospace jobs continues, with new worries raised last week by the 
proposed merger of Lockheed and Martin Marietta. Rising interest rates threaten 
to derail a rebound in home sales. Housing prices remain near their 
recessionary lows. New residential and commercial construction remains weak. 
And companies are relying on gains in productivity rather than employment to 
increase output. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of all those factors, the state's economy continues to lag the 
rest of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are positive signs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, firms as diverse as guitar-maker Fender Musical 
Instruments in the Inland Empire, broadcaster CBS in Studio City and 
pharmaceutical manufacturer Vestar Inc. in San Dimas are planning major 
expansions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fender, the Arizona-based maker of a well-known line of electric guitars, is 
expanding its Corona manufacturing operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a switch from what has come to be expected, Fender is moving some 
production from a plant in Oregon back to California, to a 103,000-square-foot 
building that the company bought next to its existing guitar plant. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the firm will build a second plant to make professional 
electronic sound equipment and amplifiers. When completed in the next six to 10 
months, the new plant will generate 100 new jobs, with the potential for 
another 200 in the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Help from Corona officials in easing the permit process and surmounting other 
regulatory hurdles was key in persuading Fender to expand production in 
California, said Kurt Hemrich, Fender's executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "California surprised us," he said. "It turned around, seemed to pursue us and 
(was) eager to have us expand here." 
</P>
<P>
 In Studio City, CBS is spending $30 million to expand its 30-acre Studio 
Center, where television programs for CBS and other networks are produced in 16 
studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next two years, the network will build seven new studios and three 
sets of production offices, and also a bridge across the Los Angeles River to 
link the new facilities with the old. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion is just one of many in the entertainment industry, a sign of 
Hollywood's robust economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're turning away business right now, to the tune of between $3 million and 
$4 million a year," said Michael L. Klausman, president of CBS Studio Center. 
"That's kind of sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Exports are responsible for the gains at Vestar, which sells 100% of its 
injectable anti-fungal drugs outside the country. "Business is growing, " said 
Michael E. Hart, executive vice president and chief financial officer. "We've 
gone from $4 million in sales in 1990 to an expected over $40 million this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The firm is spending $30 million to buy state-of-the-art equipment, double its 
space and quintuple its manufacturing capacity. Construction is scheduled to be 
completed this month. The expansion will add 20 to 25 high-paid jobs to the 
current 150 in San Dimas when regulatory approvals are complete in another six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Vestar decided to expand in Southern California because it relies on proximity 
to researchers at Caltech and Cal Poly Pomona, because land prices were cheap 
and because it can draw on skilled employees from all over the region, Hart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller firms such as Vestar are doing much of the growing in California. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of more than 650 California small businesses in April by the National 
Federation of Independent Business found optimism at its highest levels since 
October, 1992. The confidence level dipped slightly in July but remains 
relatively high, said Jeff Van Hulle, a research fellow at the federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Construction Industry Research Board reports that requests for industrial 
building permits were up 52.3% in the first six months of 1994 compared with 
the year before. With construction of office buildings and retail space still 
depressed, the growth indicates a surge in development of manufacturing and 
industrial space, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison Co. alone is working with Southland firms 
considering 130 possible expansion projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of companies that during the recession postponed decision making also 
postponed investment in new plants," said Barry Sedlik, Edison's manager of 
business retention. "They're now in the process of making that decision." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the Rosemead-based utility is seeing fewer firms that are 
weighing moves out of state, though nearby states such as Nevada, Arizona and 
Utah continue to recruit heavily. "Companies are taking a second look at 
California," Sedlik said. 
</P>
<P>
 BHP Coated Steel Corp., for example, is building a $60-million manufacturing 
plant in Rancho Cucamonga for a subsidiary that will produce metallic-coated 
steel products. When completed next July, the BHP Steel USA plant will create 
100 high-wage jobs and produce 150,000 tons of steel a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm considered building the plant out of state. But President Jerry Smith 
said BHP Steel got help from one of the state's special task forces, dubbed 
"Red Teams," which sat down with executives to work out a way to cut through 
the regulatory bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got our environmental permits in less than a month," Smith said. "Also, 
the city of Rancho Cucamonga was very helpful, and we got permits in six weeks 
that normally take two or three times as long." 
</P>
<P>
 California had some inherent advantages, as well. The company, owned by 
Australia's Broken Hill Proprietary energy conglomerate, likes the state's 
varied customer base, which helped BHP Steel ride out the recession without 
losing sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a diverse state that when one industry is down, you still have 
the flexibility to move to other (customers)," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Punch Press Products, a metal stamping firm in Vernon, is building 
a new 38,000-square-foot manufacturing plant, with additional space for new 
offices, next to its current 100,000-square-foot facility. The new plant is 
scheduled to be completed in October. 
</P>
<P>
 As did BHP Steel, Punch Press was able to weather the recession in part 
because of the diversity of its customer base, Vice President Ron Ryan said. 
Sales have gone from about $12 million four years ago to about $23 million this 
year. Though the current expansion won't result in new jobs, the firm has about 
doubled its staff in the last few years to 220 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're committed to the Los Angeles area," Ryan said, ". . . because we have a 
good customer base . . . (and) good employees who are trained and live in the 
area." Growing Again 
</P>
<P>
 When the final numbers are tallied, 1994 will be an up year for California's 
long-sickly economy, forecasters say. And the Western Blue Chip consensus of 
economic forecasts says 1995 growth will be more vigorous. 03,17,12,12

BRIGHTER OUTLOOK FOR CALIFORNIA; SMALLER FIRMS SPELL EXITING AGING GIANTS; 
TRANSITION: FOR FIRST TIME EVER, WITH A TOTAL OF 48, STATE IS HOME TO MORE 
FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES THAN ANY OTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lockheed Corp.'s plans to shift its corporate headquarters to the East Coast 
as it blends into a newly merged company may sound like the latest proof that 
California has lost its luster for major employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all the fears of a corporate exodus, the truth may be surprising: Even 
as aging corporate citizens like Lockheed trim their ties to the region, a 
striking number of fast-growing enterprises are thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 By key measures, from the Fortune 500 ranking of industrial giants -- more are 
now based in California than anywhere else -- to surveys of swift-growing, 
adolescent companies, the Golden State jumps out as a popular home base for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The community of employers is changing dramatically, however -- a 
transformation that is cause for hope as well as worry, according to experts. 
</P>
<P>
 The growing presence of firms in international trade, information and other 
non-defense technologies bodes well for job creation. But at the same time, the 
reduced role of established corporate players such as Security Pacific Bank 
(swallowed up by Bank of America in 1992), aerospace giant Lockheed (set to 
merge with Maryland-based Martin Marietta) and others is taking a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's corporations are becoming more anonymous and less likely to 
participate in the community as fully as the fading elite of corporate movers 
and shakers. While some anti-elitists may choose not to mourn their passing, 
the shift has made it harder to raise money for charity, cultural programs and 
other social activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a simple equation, and it doesn't have a simple answer," declares 
Ray Remy, president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Many different economic forces are at work -- and the pressures are not unique 
to California. Mergers and buyouts in the 1980s removed such household names as 
Crocker Bank, PSA and Western Airlines from the Southern California corporate 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings and loan debacle meant the demise of such established thrifts as 
Columbia and HomeFed, also large presences in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate survivors, meanwhile, often have scaled back their spending and 
other community involvements, reflecting cost-cutting pressures that have 
spread throughout private industry in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 This reality applies to some of the state's most familiar corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, for example, Arco disclosed that it was eliminating the entire staff 
of its company foundation, a vehicle that had been used to promote education 
reform, job training and other social objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 And long before last week's announcement, some observers had noticed that 
Lockheed was edging away from its once active role in community activities as 
it turned inward amid the aerospace decline. Once upon a time, all you had to 
do was name the problem, "and Lockheed would be there," Remy said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was Lockheed alone. When business leaders needed to convene for a local 
matter, "you could call Security Pacific Bank and they would hold the event for 
you in the corporate dining room on the top floor. It was wonderful," said Jack 
Kyser, chief economist at the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just don't replace a Security Pacific or a Lockheed," Kyser said. "These 
are major voids that are going to take years to fill in." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such laments, many big-name corporations remain in California, and 
other less-famous ones are joining the club. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time ever, California this year was the most popular home for 
companies in the Fortune 500, with a total of 48, compared to Illinois's 44 and 
New York's 43. The Big Apple has its own cause for concern; this was the first 
time New York slipped out of its traditional No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 Such established California firms as Chevron, Hewlett-Packard, Arco and 
Rockwell were on the list. But there were newer names, as well: Solectron, a 
circuit board maker in Milpitas; SynOptics Communications, a supplier of 
computer network equipment in Santa Clara; Cisco Systems, a computer networking 
equipment maker in Menlo Park, and 3Com of Santa Clara, also in the networking 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's contingent included Mattel, AST Research, Western 
Digital and others. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate list compiled by Forbes, which includes service companies along 
with industrial firms, dramatizes California's ongoing appeal to business: In 
1985, the Golden State was home to 82 of the nation's largest public companies. 
By last year, that number had risen to 89 (although the share in Los Angeles 
dipped slightly). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most dramatic, however, is California's allure for smaller, fast-growing 
companies. In Inc. magazine's annual rankings of the fast-track crowd, 
California typically lands about 12 companies in the top 100 -- more than New 
York, Texas or Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, San Diego, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Sacramento are among 
the nation's most popular magnets for fast-growing "gazelle" firms, according 
to studies by Cognetics, a research group in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, however, these smaller, surging enterprises are a very different animal 
from their older and larger corporate cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 They may trod a a quiet path, garnering little public recognition; and 
typically, they focus their efforts on competitive demands. Little energy is 
left over for community activities, such as funding a new museum or 
back-slapping with the traditional elite. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have PR departments. They don't have a vice president in charge of 
going to meetings," notes Joel Kotkin, a frequent writer on the California 
economy. "And they don't have a guy who sits down every year to decide, 'How do 
I spend the $3 million I have for charity?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The corporate society that is emerging also may have more fragile community 
ties than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Jules Tygiel, a California historian and author of a recent book on the 1920s 
oil boom in Los Angeles, points out that an indigenous capitalist elite once 
had powerful roots in Los Angeles, through its interests in real estate, 
finance, media and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Their "livelihood and well-being really were tied to the livelihood and 
well-being of the Los Angeles community," said Tygiel, a professor at San 
Francisco State University. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, by contrast, he wonders if enterprises in such fields as technology and 
information -- where the market is global -- feel the same intense links to the 
local scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, some of the emerging magnates of industry are demonstrating a 
community conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based AST Research, one of the world's largest makers of personal 
computers, has donated hundreds of computers to schools in Southern California. 
On top of that, its executives have made large donations to local colleges -- 
including $1 million to UC Irvine by Chief Executive Safi Qureshey. 
</P>
<P>
 Remy hopes that such involvements will become more common as the new corporate 
titans mature, that "they'll become more visible and more ingrained in the 
corporate community." 
</P>
<P>
 The process is far from complete. In the late 1980s, Los Angeles corporations 
would lend some 4,000 individuals to help the United Way raise money, recalls 
John S. Moawad, senior vice president at the United Way of Greater Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the number is closer to 2,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, a range of economic pressures -- including corporate relocations -- 
have cost the charity up to $10 million a year since the easier fund-raising 
days of the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In the new corporate world, the United Way has to rely much less heavily on an 
identifiable corporate elite and plunge into the more anonymous, 
less-understood world of mid-sized business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to go out and try to find smaller customers," Moawad said. "I have to 
make more calls to get the same gross. We've got to get in pace with that -- 
and we know it."

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: INVESTORS WILL HAVE TO GET OFF FENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine you're the typical money manager getting back to work this week after 
summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 If you oversee a U.S. stock portfolio, you've earned only about 0.5% for your 
clients so far this year, even after August's big rally. That's about 
one-quarter what they would have earned just sitting in a money market fund. 
</P>
<P>
 If you manage a bond portfolio, you're in the red to the tune of about 2.2%, 
as bond yields hover one to two percentage points above year-end '93 levels 
despite recent signs of slower economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, summer's over, everybody's back in the office, and you've got four months 
left in the year to make some money for your investors -- or face their 
disdain, not to mention that of your superiors, who determine how big (or not) 
your annual bonus will be. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of the calendar will be bearing down on Wall Streeters beginning 
this week, and that could help set the tone for stock and bond markets' 
near-term trends. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, many investment pros will have to make some big bets on the 
markets' direction over the next few months -- up or down -- to have any hope 
of producing hefty portfolio returns for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would pretty much count on everybody . . . getting more aggressive," said 
Robert Markman, head of Minneapolis-based Markman Capital Management, which 
directs $265 million of clients' assets in mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether any new-found aggressiveness is more likely to incite stock and 
bond rallies than selloffs remains to be seen. What seems certain is that many 
investors will have to get off the fence about the economy, and bet either that 
it slows further in the fourth quarter or stays on a healthy growth track. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, last Friday's August employment report didn't help the 
fence-sitters make up their minds. The markets rallied in the morning on news 
that only 179,000 jobs were created in August, then sold off mildly after a 
closer look at the report showed that the average workweek still is rising, as 
is manufacturing employment. 
</P>
<P>
 The workweek and manufacturing-employment indicators suggest inherent strength 
in the economy, which many investors these days immediately associate with 
higher inflation -- reigniting the cycle of fear over future potential 
interest-rate hikes by the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're growing tired of this tug-of-war over the economy, so are many Wall 
Streeters. And that, combined with the calendar, could hasten big investors' 
decisions to do something substantial with their money between now and 
year-end: Bet more heavily on stocks, or on bonds, or on cash as a safe haven. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What follows are a few of the broad investment themes that some pros believe 
sidelined investors could latch onto in a major way, as the home stretch for 
markets in 1994 begins: 
</P>
<P>
 * Get used to a healthy economy -- and take advantage of it. The argument here 
is that the Fed hasn't materially harmed the U.S. economic recovery with higher 
interest rates, and anyway that accelerating growth in the rest of the world 
will add to U.S. growth what higher rates subtract. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to bet that the expansion goes on and on, some investors advise 
sticking with industrial stocks, and in particular buying commodity producers 
like paper, chemical and mining companies -- especially if they pull back after 
their latest run-up. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing, all-capitalist world is bound to consume more basic goods. Yet John 
Lonski, economist at Moody's Investors Service in New York, notes that even 
with significant price increases this year, many commodities "are still below 
levels in effect toward the end of the 1980s." There's almost assuredly more to 
come, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One big believer in commodity producers such as Alcoa and International Paper 
is Mark Howlowesko, who manages the global Templeton World and Templeton Growth 
stock funds. "I feel that we're moving from a period of increasing inflation in 
financial assets (i.e., stocks) to increasing inflation in hard assets," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 And while some commodity bears worry that supplies will more than keep up with 
demand, Howlowesko doesn't see it. With financial assets, he says, "you can 
produce more with the stroke of a pen" if demand rises. "That's a lot harder to 
do with hard assets." 
</P>
<P>
 * Overcome economic uncertainty by sticking with true growth stocks -- or with 
true value. If more investors give up trying to guess the economy's next move 
and just feel desperate to put more money to work in stocks, some pros see 
classic growth issues as the big winners this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The definition of a growth stock is a company whose earnings are expected to 
rise at a brisk pace no matter what the economic backdrop. To Rod Linafelter, 
manager of the $2.2-billion Berger One-Hundred stock fund in Denver, that 
describes such technology stocks as Microsoft and Oracle Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got 30% of the portfolio in technology, and I can't recall a time when I 
felt more comfortable with the technology earnings outlook," Linafelter says. 
Individual tech companies may have their problems, but he sees no evidence that 
businesses and consumers will significantly slow their pace of investment in 
computers and related equipment overall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Lazarchic, manager of the IDS Managed Retirement fund in Minneapolis, 
agrees that if the debate is between growth stocks and value stocks (the latter 
being slower-growing but less-expensively priced stocks), "I think growth is 
going to work better than value now. There just aren't that many real values 
left." 
</P>
<P>
 He includes computer chip leader Intel and soft-drink giant PepsiCo in his 
growth-stock fold. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can find true value, however, that may be as good a place as any to 
hedge your bet on the broad market's next move. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Glasebrook, who runs the Quest for Value Opportunity stock fund in New 
York, regards such stocks as Avon Products and insurer Transamerica Corp. as 
bona fide values, selling for relatively low price-to-earnings multiples yet 
boasting very high returns on equity. His portfolio now is concentrated in 
those types of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Small stocks deserve better, in any economy. The average small-company 
stock, as measured by the Nasdaq composite index, still is down 2.3% 
year-to-date, even after August's sharp rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron Wien, strategist at Morgan Stanley & Co. in New York, argues that 
small-stock prices in general don't adequately reflect the companies' earnings 
potential. A Morgan universe of "emerging-growth" stocks, for example, is 
priced at about 15 times estimated 1995 earnings per share, just slightly above 
the 14 times for the blue-chip Standard & Poor's 500 index. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the smaller companies' estimated average annual earnings growth rate over 
the next five years is 22%, versus the S&P's 7%, Wien says. 
</P>
<P>
 If markets still work, the price-to-earnings multiple of faster-growing 
smaller stocks deserves to be much higher than the S&P's, Wien notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Di Carlo, manager of the John Hancock Special Equities small-stock 
fund in Boston, agrees. "There's been an incredible valuation contraction" 
among small stocks this year, he says, and he believes it can't last. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields may already reflect the worst-case scenario. Almost nobody likes 
the bond market anymore, but Bessemer Trust Co.'s investment chief, Stan Nabi, 
argues that bonds at current yields offer stiff competition for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 With seven-year U.S. Treasury notes yielding 7%, Nabi says, "That's a very 
decent return considering that inflation is only about 2.5%." Even if inflation 
is perking up, Nabi says, real bond yields already reflect that, while he 
regards many stocks as overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds, naturally, are the best bet for anyone who wants to gamble that the 
economy will slow dramatically this fall. IDS's Lazarchic, in fact, expects to 
raise his fund's bond allocation from the current 10%, to reap any payoff that 
might occur in bonds should investors suddenly flock to the slow-economy camp 
-- even if it's only a temporary rush. 
</P>
<P>
 * Like Elvis, cash is still king. Short-term money market investments have 
generally been the best place to hide this year, and Wall Street's bears -- and 
even some non-bears -- don't think that will change this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Engel, senior research analyst at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis, says 
the summer stock rally was only a blip in the trend. "We're still expecting a 
prolonged bear market," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His firm rates the market's relative value using 30 different measures, 
including "book" value and dividend yields. The points awarded to the market 
for those measures can total as much as a positive 1,815 or a negative 1,740. 
</P>
<P>
 The current reading: A negative 860, or bear-market territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Ognar, manager of the Strong Growth stock fund in Milwaukee, is no big 
bear. But he cautions investors against chasing stocks this fall. Be patient, 
and keep plenty of powder dry, he says. "Our tack now is, 'Be careful, and buy 
on weakness.' " Wall Street's Mixed Signals 
</P>
<P>
 Is the stock market's outlook rosy or black? Here's what some pros are 
focusing on: 
</P>
<P>
 * Underlying demand: It's still strong. The public stepped up its stock-mutual 
fund buying in August, and corporate takeovers and stock buybacks are booming. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, many stock funds were carrying above-average cash levels before 
the August rally, and those levels haven't changed much since. That's fuel for 
future rallies. "I've got 14% cash (in a $2.2-billion fund) and I don't want to 
be that high," says Rod Linafelter, manager of the Berger One-Hundred fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * New supply: Down. Securities Data Co. counts 80 initial public stock 
offerings in the pipeline, expecting to raise $3.2 billion by year-end. So far 
in '94, IPOs have raised an average of $2.5 billion per month.  
</P>
<P>
 * Investor expectations: Low. Even after the August rally, only 33.9% of the 
140 investment newsletter writers polled weekly by Investors Intelligence in 
New Rochelle, N.Y., are bullish. Nearly 47% are bearish. The rest expect a new 
market "correction." Many pros view a low bullish reading as a "contrary" sign 
that foretells higher stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Corporate earnings: Strong. Earnings-tracker Zacks Investment Research in 
Chicago says analysts expect S&P 500 operating earnings to be up 20% in the 
current quarter from a year ago. With restructurings of recent years, "Even the 
smallest (sales) increases go right to companies' bottom lines now," says Ben 
Zacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Overall valuation: Not cheap, but not expensive either? The average S&P 500 
stock is priced at 19 times the past four quarters' earnings per share, and 15 
times estimated 1994 earnings. Many Wall Streeters see that as a reasonable 
valuation. More troublesome, however, is the still-low average stock dividend 
yield of 2.76% -- historically a bear-market signal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Seasonal trends: Worrisome, short-term. September is historically a losing 
month for stocks. In the last 10 years in particular, the S&P 500 has fallen in 
September 80% of the time. End-of-Summer Checkup

FOOTNOTES /JAMES BATES: COURTING THE COLLECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Noted courtroom artist David Rose of Hollywood has reached a verdict: that his 
drawings might be worth something to collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The 84-year-old Rose, still active in drawing courtroom scenes for news 
organizations when cameras are banned, is marketing his original drawings via 
catalogue through Great Neck, N.Y.-based MLG Distributing. 
</P>
<P>
 The price range is from $900 to $5,000, with the most expensive being an 
autographed drawing of former Philippines First Lady Imelda Marcos during the 
New York trial in which she was acquitted of criminal fraud charges. (Rose 
includes a lapel pin Marcos gave him of the Philippines flag.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of his more famous drawings of international trials are being 
sold, the drawings largely depict Southern California cases he covered, 
including Rodney King testifying in the federal trial of Los Angeles police 
officers, John DeLorean's trial in which he was acquitted of dealing cocaine 
and the palimony case involving the late actor Lee Marvin. 
</P>
<P>
 He's even offering for $2,000 each a couple of drawings that he made recently 
while he happened to be sitting in on a hearing in the murder case involving 
former football star O.J. Simpson. Can Minute Maid Still Use It? 
</P>
<P>
 Last week came word that lawyers for O.J. Simpson are seeking to register as a 
trademark the name "O.J." to stop unauthorized exploitation of the former 
football star's name in the wake of his highly publicized trial on murder 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem: there are a fair number of Southland businesses that have been 
using the initials "O.J." in their names for years, as a brief scan of local 
phone books shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, there is O.J. Fashions, O.J.'s Treasures and the O&J Coffee 
Shop. Arcadia boasts O.J.'s Deli. In Baldwin Park, there is O.J. Insulation. 
Covina has a fast-food place simply called O.J.'s. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has O.J. Propane and O.J. Construction. Then there is O&J 
Appliance Repair Installation & Service in Reseda. This Movie Pitch Is a Strike 
</P>
<P>
 In a case of being ahead of the curve ball, a movie about a baseball strike 
was already in the works when the real one started last month, albeit with a 
different plot. 
</P>
<P>
 Producers Mace Neufeld and Robert Rehme, who have made such films for 
Paramount Pictures as "Clear and Present Danger," are working with actor James 
Woods developing the movie "Twilight" involving a strike by prima donna Chicago 
Cubs players on the eve of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The walkout results in the club deciding to bring back former Cubs who never 
had an opportunity to play in the October Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the real-life baseball strike, the ending remains a mystery for now. 
Picassos of Publicity 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing that they are breaking up their firm, Hollywood publicists 
Michael Levine and Mitchell Schneider, whose celebrity clients have included 
Michael Jackson, issued a statement saying, "we decided that we wanted new 
canvases upon which to draw and create."

FORENSIC TOOL; THE FIRM USES COMPLEX MATH IN VIDEO IMAGE-ENHANCING TECHNOLOGY 
THAT HELPS IN FINDING SUSPECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It started out as just a speck on a photograph of a man who threw a brick at 
truck driver Reginald Denny at Florence and Normandie avenues in the opening 
hours of the 1992 Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Leonid Rudin subjected it to a complicated computer algorithm and a 
slew of complex mathematical equations, that speck -- originally less than 
1/6,000th the size of the total photograph -- was revealed to be a rose-shaped 
tattoo on the arm of the man, later identified in court as Damian Monroe 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The tattoo was one of several details uncovered by Cognitech, Rudin's Santa 
Monica image processing firm, that helped place Williams and co-defendant Henry 
Keith Watson at the crime scene, said prosecutors, who won convictions of 
Williams, Watson and others involved in the beating of Denny and in assaults on 
several others at the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the start of what Cognitech's co-chief executives, Rudin and 
Stanley Osher, believe could be a multibillion-dollar business in image 
enhancement for law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Reginald Denny case, we found out there was a market" for their 
uniquely sophisticated brand of image analysis, said Osher, who is a professor 
of mathematics at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just flexing our muscles, and suddenly our doors wouldn't stay closed 
and our phone wouldn't stop ringing," added Rudin, also Cognitech's director of 
research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since the Denny trial, Cognitech engineers -- who had been 
entirely dependent on Defense Department research and analysis contracts until 
they applied their optics expertise to commercial markets -- have analyzed 
dozens of videos and photographs for law enforcement agencies, insurance 
companies and private investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 At an average of cost of $5,000, though, their consulting services are not 
cheap. And the seven-person staff can only take on five cases a month.  
</P>
<P>
 So to meet demand in this emerging market and increase the company's current 
nearly $1 million in annual revenue, Rudin and Osher plan to sell their image 
enhancement technology in a do-it-yourself software package called "Police 
Video Workstation." They envision police detectives, insurance claim managers 
and others with desks equipped with powerful personal computers using Cognitech 
software. That software will be priced between $500 and $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody would love to have it," said Beth McGee, a spokeswoman for 
the National Assn. of Police Organizations in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Video from surveillance cameras in convenience stores, parking garages and 
police patrol cars is increasingly being used as evidence by law enforcement 
and insurance companies, industry groups said. Cognitech's software clarifies 
those images, which are then used to find suspects and against those suspected 
of filing false claims. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, an automated teller machine camera happened to record someone in 
a car fleeing the scene of Manhattan Beach Police Officer Martin Ganz's killing 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very far away and extremely fuzzy," Cognitech engineer Stephen Jensen 
said of the images recorded. "We sharpened it up and got information about the 
bumper, the wheels, the side molding, what color it was, where there were 
dents, etc." 
</P>
<P>
 Using Cognitech technology, police were able to identify the getaway car -- a 
1988 gray Daihatsu. When Ganz murder defendant Roger Hoan Brady was picked up 
earlier this month in Oregon, that car was in his possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies have hired Cognitech to analyze videos of people suspected 
of making false disability claims. Industry groups say such claims cost 
insurers millions of dollars a year. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, Rudin said, "we have a positive ID of a guy who's supposed to be 
paralyzed and he's playing football." 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurers are working hard to eliminate fraud, and they'll (take a serious 
look at buying) anything that is going to help them do that," said Bill 
Schroeder, vice president for claims of the Alliance of American Insurers in 
Schaumburg, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional methods of enlarging photographs and video images rely on linear 
mathematics equations that smooth over background "static and noise," revealing 
general shapes but not the distinct features needed for identification. 
Cognitech's algorithms are based on far more complicated partial differential 
equations, which are used to design airplane wings and analyze supersonic 
booms. This nonlinear math can find the sharp edges in pictures, resulting in 
greater image clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Davis, an investment analyst with Ventana Growth Fund in Irvine, said 
Cognitech is the only company using this type of technology for image 
processing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudin and Osher say that is because it is a cutting-edge approach developed 
for military use. 
</P>
<P>
 "This technology used to be directed mostly toward scientific pursuits, but 
with the decline of aerospace industry, more and more attention is being given 
to law enforcement and public safety issues," said Terrance Montonye, technical 
director of the International Society of Optical Engineering, which for the 
first time included a session on law enforcement technology at its annual 
meeting in July. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10% of the country's 15,000 to 17,000 law-enforcement agencies are large 
enough to easily afford the nearly $10,000 it will cost to buy the Cognitech 
software and the computer equipment to run it, said Craig Fraser, associate 
director of Police Executive Research, a Washington, D.C. think tank. He said 
more departments will enter the market as the price of computer hardware drops. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudin said Cognitech plans to lend its Police Video Workstations to the Los 
Angeles Police Department and nine other departments around the country early 
next year for a six-month trial. He said he expects to bring the product to 
market at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not soon enough for Faye Arfa, a lawyer who successfully defended a 
client against charges of attempted murder and robbery with the help of 
Cognitech imaging analysis. Its analysis of video from a convenience store 
camera contradicted the account of an eyewitness against Arfa's client. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a significant breakthrough and a very useful tool," Arfa said. "It would 
be a real asset to be able to have this technology available on an everyday 
basis."

 Quake Insurance Hearing: 
</P>
<P>
 State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi has called Farmers Insurance Group 
on the carpet for its decision to raise deductibles on its earthquake insurance 
policies to 25% from 10%, effective Sept. 1. He has scheduled a hearing to 
discuss the matter Tuesday.Garamendi contends that the action violates the 
state insurance code, but Farmers says it is within its rights. The change 
would mean that a customer with a $160,000 policy would have to absorb the 
first $40,000 of loss. Farmers, California's third-largest residential insurer, 
is one of numerous companies that have temporarily suspended sales of new 
homeowners and earthquake coverage, citing vulnerability to another quake. 
Farmers incurred an estimated $1.1 billion in claims costs from the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake. The hearing begins at 10 a.m. at the Insurance 
Department's offices at 45 Fremont St., San Francisco.

 Assets seized as part of two money-laundering cases will be auctioned at 3 
p.m. Thursday at the Century City Marriott, following a preview that begins at 
noon. Rare wines, including vintages from the 1920s, '30s, '40s and '50s, will 
be sold, along with more than 100 pieces of Waterford crystal and other 
stemware.More than 900 ounces of gold bullion and coins will also be auctioned. 
Much of the merchandise was seized by the government in an international fraud 
and money-laundering case involving flamboyant golf tycoon Ken Mizuno and a 
Japanese company he once owned called Ken International. The company, which 
developed golf courses and other properties in Japan, admitted to selling 
52,000 memberships to the Ibaragi Country Club when only 1,830 were available. 
About $100 million was used to purchase properties in California, Nevada and 
Hawaii, the most famous being the Indian Wells Country Club and Hotel Indian

 Southern Californians will be able to comment in San Diego on Wednesday on a 
controversial proposal to deregulate the state's investor-owned electric 
utilities. The hearings are being held by the California Public Utilities 
Commission to gather opinions from ordinary citizens, in contrast to a parallel 
set of hearings seeking comments from the utility industry and 
environmentalists.The commission has proposed a competitive marketplace in 
electricity, something like the existing market for long-distance phone 
service, that would begin for large industrial ratepayers in 1996 and be 
available to residential users by 2002. But there is wide disagreement on how 
to structure this competition and whether deregulation will meet the plan's 
goal of dramatically lowering electricity rates in California. The hearing will 
begin at 7 p.m in City Council Chambers, 12th floor, City Administration 
Building, 202 C St. Further public hearings will be held in November in 
Bakersfield, Ventura, Garden Grove, Carson, San Bernardino and Huntington Park.

SON REPLACES FATHER AS HEAD OF HAFT FIRM; FEUDING: MOVE IS EVIDENCE OF NEW 
FACTIONS AMONG FAMILY CONTROLLING DART GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Herbert Haft was unexpectedly deposed by his younger son Ronald this weekend 
as chairman of a real estate company he founded decades ago.  
</P>
<P>
 A onetime ally with his father against his elder brother Robert, Ronald Haft 
replaced his father Saturday, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Ronald's lawyers announced that they expected his father to try to 
replace him as president of the Crown Books chain at a board meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves are evidence that the Haft family is breaking up into more factions 
over control of an empire that includes retailing conglomerate Dart Group Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Just four months ago, Herbert and Ronald were on the same side in settling an 
ugly family battle over Dart with Herbert's former wife Gloria, daughter Linda 
and elder son Robert. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Haft had been a key part of the management, having started both Trak 
Auto and Crown Books, both Dart subsidiaries. The settlement, reached in May, 
was not disclosed but essentially Herbert and Ronald bought a large part of the 
rest of the family's assets. The total assets of the companies are estimated at 
well over $1 billion. But Gloria, Robert and Linda Haft retained large blocks 
of voting stock in the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The real estate part of the empire, Combined Properties, issued a statement 
Saturday announcing the removal of Herbert Haft. Herbert Haft and Ronald Haft 
declined to comment. Herbert Haft's lawyers said they would move to overturn 
the actions in District of Columbia Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined Properties is one of the Washington area's largest real estate 
management companies. A private company, it manages more than 40 prime shopping 
centers and other real estate. The properties are largely owned by Herbert and 
Ronald Haft and are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haft family controls the publicly traded Dart Group Corp., which owns 
large stakes in retailers Crown Books, Trak Auto Corp. and Shoppers Food 
Warehouse Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined Properties said Herbert Haft's stake in the company was reduced to 
45% from 66%. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, Ronald Haft, 34, will hold 33% of the company's shares. He 
also continues as chief executive.

 "There was a board meeting of Combined Properties and Herbert Haft was removed 
as chairman of the board," said Robert Greenberg of Keck, Mahin & Cate, 
Combined Properties's newly appointed independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ronald Haft's attorneys, Herbert Haft plans to propose at next 
Wednesday's board meeting of Crown Books that Ronald Marshall be named the new 
president of Crown Books. They also said he may try to fire Ronald Haft from 
his job as president of Dart. 
</P>
<P>
 Dart Group also will have a board meeting next Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert Haft controls 57% of the voting rights of Dart Group, but a majority 
of Dart's board is made up of independent directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall currently is Dart's chief financial officer. According to the 
lawyers, Marshall authorized an $18-million loan from Dart Group to Herbert 
Haft that was later rescinded.  
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers from the firm Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering, who are representing Dart 
Group, said at a hearing Friday that they are unaware of an agenda item at the 
Dart board meeting concerning Ronald Haft. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't deny, however, that Herbert is seeking to install Marshall as 
president of Crown Books. 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert and Gloria Haft, who built the family fortune together from a single 
drugstore in the Adams-Morgan neighborhood in northwest Washington, D.C., 
agreed to an uncontested divorce at the same time as the financial settlement 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The divorce proceedings began in court, where Herbert accused Gloria of 
forming an "unholy alliance" with his son Robert. Gloria alleged that Herbert 
was verbally abusive, played around with other women and spent $1.5 million to 
pay off a mistress.

THE PACIFIC; CHINA PROVIDING CLUES WITH SHANGHAI PROPERTY; ASIA: LEASES MAY 
SHOW HOW BEIJING WILL TREAT VALUABLE HONG KONG REAL ESTATE IN 1997.

 Hong Kong, watch carefully: This is how China might act when it inherits some 
of Hong Kong's valuable government property in 1997 after taking over the 
British colony. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanghai's municipal government has decided to lease some of the most famous, 
and potentially most prestigious, waterfront property in the world. And it is 
taking its time to make sure it gets things right. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37 buildings in question sit on the curving western bank of the Huangpu 
River. They were built in Western style when parts of Shanghai were ruled by 
the British and French in the 1920s and 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The 220 foreign firms, mostly banks, which used to be the tenants were thrown 
out by the communists in 1949, and since then, the municipal government has 
occupied most of the more famous buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as it seeks to become the financial capital of a China that will soon 
include Hong Kong, Shanghai wants foreign businesses back. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Chinese move into Hong Kong, they won't find a historic core of prime 
real estate concentrated in the Central financial district. Still, between 
military and other government lands, they will come into a lot of property more 
valuable than they are used to dealing with. 
</P>
<P>
 China has been doing business with the outside world for years now and knows 
as well as anyone how to bargain. But this is different. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to move top-of-the-line real estate, China is seeking advice from 
private consultants about how to lure foreigners back without charging too much 
or getting ripped off in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of money at stake. Estimates say a 50-year lease for some of 
the buildings could run as high as $150 million, but since none of the details 
of the leases or even the condition of the buildings have been made public, 
prospective tenants are noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even know if there's heating in there," said Pamela George of HSBC 
Holdings (5 HK), formerly the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp. In 
Shanghai's capitalist boom times, Hong Kong Bank occupied the biggest building 
on the waterfront, which was called the Bund, a Hindi word for "embankment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before they sign up for 50 years, prospective tenants want to know about 
subletting. "It's huge," George says of her bank's old headquarters. "We don't 
use nearly that much space now in Shanghai." 
</P>
<P>
 A 50-year lease with a hefty land use premium on top of that ought to get a 
tenant the right to sublet to whomever he wants, but such a right is one of the 
things still under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive stone buildings, for all anyone knows, have not been tended to in 
over 40 years. Aside from normal upkeep, new tenants have to worry about where 
to put computers in places not designed for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The efficiency of these buildings is extremely low. It's by no means 
efficient compared to a modern building," said Nelson Wong of Hong Kong 
property agent Viger's. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should not go in to rush before they know what kind of deal they're 
doing," added Wong, who said his firm was "in very close consultations with the 
Shanghai government." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the other kinds of things Shanghai is still thinking about are: Who 
pays for modernizing a building? How much of the internal architecture can be 
altered? (The exteriors can't be changed in any way.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Helping the government to think about such questions are a variety of Hong 
Kong property agencies, brought in at Shanghai's expense to pitch their 
services as evaluators and eventually maybe brokers too. "We can provide them 
the exposure to foreign investors," said Charles Chan of agent Chesterton 
Petty. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan's is one of several firms vying to evaluate the buildings in question, 
but the government is taking its time, having invited one Hong Kong property 
company to Shanghai just last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 It will proceed with leasing just three of the buildings to start with, agents 
said. Maybe by October. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if Shanghai can't get the price it wants for the buildings? Will 
it lower its expectations as well as the asking price? Or will it just hang on 
to the buildings in the hope prices eventually rise? 
</P>
<P>
 In Hong Kong, where the property market leads the stock market and a public 
land auction gets more attention than the sayings of Gov. Chris Patten, this is 
of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market can and does plunge when prices fetched at auction are lower 
than expected, and those prices depend in part on what the government's asking 
price is. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing how the commercial property market works is important, and Shanghai 
seems to realize this. Whatever happens with the Bund properties, both Hong 
Kong and China stand to learn plenty about how the other side does business.

 Trade Gap Widens: The country's current account deficit in July widened 21% to 
$1.37 billion from a revised $1.13 billion in June, the government said. The 
nation's merchandise trade deficit expanded to $353.5 million from $118 million 
in June. Imports rose 3% and exports fell 3%, largely reflecting a drop in gold 
shipments.

$14.9 billion.Non-oil domestic exports at 1990 prices grew 19.6% from year-ago 
levels, a slowdown from the 43.7% growth posted in June. Growth was led by 
electronic products such as disk drives and integrated circuits, the board 
said. On a three-month moving average basis, trade volume rose 23.7%. The 
volume of exports increased 32.2%, while imports grew 16.2%. Exports of oil 
grew 22.1% in volume, but only 1.1% in value because of lower oil prices. The 
volume of imports rose 16.2% in July, led by electronic products and 
accessories.

HOT JOBS: A GLOBAL TAKE ON COLLECTING LATE BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When some people think of a bill collector, an image that comes to mind is 
that of actors Harry Dean Stanton and Emilio Estevez in the cult favorite "Repo 
Man." But Dave Greenberg, who represents the American Bureau of Collections in 
Santa Ana, does not work under cover of night. And his only armaments are a 
telephone, facsimile machine, computer and a professional approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think bill collectors are surly types who harass and threaten 
people who are late on their bills," Greenberg said. "I guess that's true of 
some of them, but to be really successful, you have to win people over. If I 
were to be instantly rude, why would that person waste a minute more on the 
phone with me? The situation would remain at an impasse and my client wouldn't 
be any closer to getting paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg specializes in international accounts, and that's what he likes most 
about his job. "Every day is a world tour. I may have a client in Beijing 
asking me to collect accounts in Trinidad or Togo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical day starts with Greenberg making calls from his home early in the 
morning to Europe and other parts of the Western Hemisphere. By late evening, 
he's on the phone to the Orient. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg speaks a little Spanish, French and German, but conducts most of his 
conversations in English. "It seems to be the international language of 
business," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of his work centers on repairing relations and educating people on how 
different cultures do business. An interpreter in his office is currently 
translating brochures on the American legal system from English into Mandarin, 
and Greenberg is often asked to speak at international business seminars. "This 
is not typical of what most collections agencies do, but we've built a niche 
for ourselves doing international work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg sees himself as a negotiator and advocate for his clients, which 
average about 1,500. He handles commercial accounts with debts of more than 
$25,000, and many tally into six figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do is very different than someone who is just starting out at a 
smaller agency handling consumer accounts," Greenberg said. "But some of the 
basic skills required are the same. You have to be able to accept rejection, 
because it happens every day. No matter how diplomatic you are, people will get 
very rude and colorful with you on the phone. You have to shrug it off and find 
other ways to be tenacious and fearless." OCCUPATION: Bill Collector 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Locating and contacting individuals and businesses that 
have failed to pay debts. The collector is responsible for finding out why the 
payments are not being made and for getting the debtor to pay all or a portion 
of the owed amount. Some collectors are employed by banks, credit unions and 
department stores. However, most are employed by agencies that work on retainer 
for various businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Knowledge of domestic and international contract law; good 
verbal and written skills. Some collectors have a college degree, but it is not 
a requirement. Many have a background in contract negotiations or sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of bill collectors in the county is expected to 
increase 9.3%, to 3,050. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $20,000 to $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: As negotiators, most collectors report satisfaction from their ability 
to resolve conflict and collect a client's outstanding accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Collectors are often threatened and verbally abused by those in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: May move into supervisorial and administrative positions. Some 
open their own debt collection agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "If the person we are contacting gets rude with us on the phone, we 
have to be able to shrug it off and move the conversation back to a two-way 
street. If you get ugly back, or slam the phone down in disgust, you'll never 
get them to do what you want, and that is to pay the bill."

<P>
 Last summer Oprah Winfrey devoted an entire hourlong chat show to a 
little-known Indian physician named Deepak Chopra and his book, "Ageless Mind, 
Timeless Body." 
</P>
<P>
 In a wide-ranging discussion, Chopra discoursed on Ayurvedic medicine, the 
mind, the spirit, and prolonging life through meditation, exercise and the 
elimination of toxic emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Oprah sat riveted. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight, sales of the book skyrocketed and today have passed the 1-million 
mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynics chalk Chopra's hit up to what they called "the Oprah factor," Winfrey's 
ability to sell anything. But a spin around the bestseller lists these days 
raises another possibility: that mind/body books like Chopra's are big 
business, not just in fringe New Age outposts but in malls across America as 
well: 
</P>
<P>
 * Doubleday has printed 450,000 copies of Bill Moyers' "Healing and the Mind," 
the book tie-in to his popular PBS series on mind/body medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Internist Larry Dossey's "Healing Words: The Power of Prayer and the 
Practice of Medicine" climbed to No. 10 on the New York Times bestseller list 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 * Former Yale Medical School surgeon Bernie Siegel's 1986 book, "Love, 
Medicine & Miracles," reappeared on the list this spring after spending more 
than 52 weeks on the bestseller list in the late 1980s and selling more than a 
million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big and growing area," says Mike Ferrari, a senior buyer for 
Waldenbooks at the company's headquarters in Stamford, Conn. "There's a whole 
group of authors who bridge the New Age and self-help markets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mind/body medicine books explore the relationship between the mind and 
physical health, the role that the mind may or may not play in disease and 
healing. 
</P>
<P>
 The books are hot for a number of reasons, say those in the publishing 
industry. Baby boomers bravely facing old age and infirmity are looking for 
kinder, gentler alternatives to traditional medicine. At the same time, changes 
in the health-care system are for the first time creating economic incentives 
to preach prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 So awash are readers in mind/body books that Consumer Reports Books has seen 
fit to publish a consumer's guide to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrari points to Moyers' top-selling book as "legitimizing the whole thing. 
It showed that here's a category that's worth pursuing in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain mainstreaming of the New Age movement," says Barb Burg, 
Bantam director of publicity. Shows such as "Oprah" and "20-20" have done 
favorable pieces on mind/body practitioners, she notes, adding of PBS's 
interest in the topic, "that imprimatur is really helping." 
</P>
<P>
 Bantam, attempting to capitalize on an emerging market, launched a New Age 
imprint in the early 1980s. But as the movement has infiltrated the mainstream, 
the label is often seen as a liability to wider sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, the recent Bantam release, "Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom: 
Creating Physical and Emotional Health and Healing," written by holistic 
physician Christiane Northrup. The book covers herbal medicine, visualization, 
nutrition, and the effects of thoughts and emotions on disease. "Before," Burg 
says, "we would have called it New Age. Now, it's a women's health book." 
</P>
<P>
 Sydny Miner, executive editor of trade paperback books at Simon & Schuster, 
agrees that the New Age label can harm mind/body books. "People who wouldn't 
want to consider using a New Age book would use something in psychology and 
self-help," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The notion that the mind can influence the body, that thoughts, emotions and 
beliefs can dramatically affect health stretches at least as far back as the 
4th Century BC, when Hippocrates theorized that disease resulted from a 
disharmony between mind, body and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 20th Century, the seminal mind/body work is Herbert Benson's 1975 book, 
"The Relaxation Response." The Harvard-trained cardiologist explored the links 
between high blood pressure and stress, and experimented with the use of 
biofeedback to control blood pressure. His book on the simple technique he 
called the relaxation response was an instant bestseller. Thirty printings and 
3 1/2 million copies later, Benson is the founding president of the 
Harvard-affiliated Mind/Body Medical Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told I was throwing away a brilliant career," Benson says, recalling 
comments made by friends and colleagues. "But no, the data were there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his research on the beneficial effects of transcendental meditation 
gave the TM movement a huge boost, Benson notes that his bigger contribution 
was in showing how meditation worked and translating it into non-religious, 
scientific terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market was right for the scientific proof behind (meditation). People 
were looking for other ways to achieve these benefits," he explains, adding: 
"We are in fact a model for how something alternative became mainstream." 
</P>
<P>
 Benson's work went beyond providing the hard science behind the mind/body 
mythology. It showed people how to work the mind/body connections and improve 
their lives. At bottom, it was a self-help book. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans have always been interested in quick fixes," says Bill Adler, the 
literary agent who sold "The Relaxation Response" to William Morrow and Co. 
"We're the country of the Beverly Hills Diet and Richard Simmons. It's 
interesting that in England, for example, you really can't give these books 
away. They're very skeptical of mind/body." 
</P>
<P>
 At around the same time that "The Relaxation Response" was published, 
discoveries that would lead to the new field of psychoneuroimmunology (PNI), 
the study of the mind's effect on the immune system, were taking place, and the 
mind/body field was heating up. Kenneth Pelletier's landmark "Mind as Healer 
Mind as Slayer: A Holistic Approach to Preventing Stress Disorders" was 
published in 1977, and, in 1978, Norman Cousins' book, "Anatomy of an Illness," 
charted his triumph over illness through cheerfulness, a strong will to live 
and laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Gurin, Consumer Reports editorial director, believes the work that has 
been done in the PNI field has played "a major part in the mainstreaming" of 
mind/body literature. "It's made it more plausible," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are other factors contributing to the growth of mind/body books: PNI 
researcher and mind/body author Joan Borysenko says that since 80% to 90% of 
doctor visits are due to stress and anxiety, people have begun to realize that 
"they really need a visit to a mind/body clinic." 
</P>
<P>
 Baby boomers facing old age, Miner says, are coping with the fact that "even 
though the body fails, we're living with these impediments and imperfections 
well into our 70s and 80s." Mind/body books, Gurin points out, can give readers 
a sense of control over their own health. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many people, that diminishes the stress of having serious medical 
problems," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 The demographics of book buying are another factor in the mind/body boom, many 
publishing executives say. Women, who doctors say are more open than men to 
alternative medical practices, also form the great majority of book buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Health-care reform is also serving to lend credibility to mind/body 
approaches. As caregivers switch from a fee-for-service system to managed care, 
doctors for the first time are rewarded for saving money through preventive 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiologist Dean Ornish's program for reversing heart disease, on which his 
best-selling books are based, has been endorsed by a dozen major insurers. 
Before, Ornish says, "cardiologists might have been threatened" by his system 
of diet, exercise, meditation and yoga. Now they "embrace it because the less 
money they spend, the more they save." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer Reports' "Mind/Body Medicine: How to Use Your Mind for Better 
Health," written by Gurin and New York Times psychology reporter Daniel 
Goleman, was published last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an area just reaching critical mass in terms of the amount of 
information there," Gurin says. "It was a perfect book for Consumer Reports to 
do, because there's tremendous opportunity for half-truths and quasi-truths, 
yet enough known so we could tell people what was true." 
</P>
<P>
 A compilation of chapters written by leading mind/body researchers throughout 
the country, Gurin and Goleman's book demonstrates the extent to which 
mind/body approaches have infiltrated the medical Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone sees that as a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Angell, executive editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, says: 
"What I'm seeing is a more uncritical acceptance of the notion that you can 
think your way out of diseases. To me, it's a form of wishful thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 When "Love, Medicine & Miracles," Siegel's account of "exceptional patients" 
who had used love, joy and peace of mind to overcome cancer came out, he was 
attacked by some for theories that could be interpreted to mean that cancer 
patients were somehow responsible for getting, as well as curing, their 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors go around peddling this belief, saying 'Even though we're saying you 
can think yourself out of the disease, we're not blaming you if you die of if,' 
" Angell says. "That's nonsense, because one implies the other. I think it's 
cruel, because it's hard enough being sick without being blamed for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Angell is not surprised that publishers are cranking out mind/body 
books as fast as they seem to be flying off the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is business," she says. "It makes a lot of money. Everybody is 
looking for the secret of everlasting life, and if you can sell a book saying 
that it has it, people will buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, doctoring curriculum chair Michael Wilkes admits that although there 
is "a whole lot of hyperbole" being written in the field, "to not address 
mind/body issues is to completely miss the boat in terms of promoting health."

 Freddie the computer science student had to go cold turkey last year. When 
Spud the philosopher quits for a week, he feels "very strange." Julie the 
theater historian says, "It's my hallucinogen of choice. . . . I love being 
able to slip into another body, another persona, another world." 
</P>
<P>
 All describe themselves as heavy users. Not of drugs, but of the games, chat 
lines, news groups, databases and other services on the Internet, that 
invisible digital landscape created by thousands of linked computers from 
Stockholm to Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
 These committed cybernauts have spent 40 or more hours a week on-line, have 
friends they know only by Internet nicknames, and sometimes feel that time on 
the net is the most rewarding part of their day. They are, as one researcher 
put it, "really living parallel lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Some fear that marathon netters risk disconnection from "RL," the cybername 
for real life. But one faction of psychologists and sociologists disagrees, 
saying the net is a relatively healthy place for people to deal with deeply 
rooted problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are working through something or escaping from something or finding 
something important for them," said Sherry R. Turkle, a sociologist and 
professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is writing a book 
about how people act in simulated environments. 
</P>
<P>
 Freddie has been an undergraduate at the University of Maryland, Baltimore 
County for five years, but he is still a sophomore. He blames the delay, in 
part, on what may be the most addictive activity on the net -- MUDing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some things I really get into and all else just disappears," said 
the 21-year-old, who asked that his real name not be used. 
</P>
<P>
 MUD stands for Multiple User Dungeons or Dimensions, and the technology is 
simple: computers create imaginary castles or mansions or landscapes through 
simple word descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 A room might be created, for example, with the words, "You are in a large dark 
room" or "You are in a closet stuffed with toys. There are 22 other people 
jammed in with you." Players from all over the world plug in through the 
Internet, adopt a nickname and type their conversation and actions. 
</P>
<P>
 They use simple commands such as "go" to move between rooms or "say" to talk. 
Other players in the same room or space generally can read those words and type 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not sound fascinating, but MUD players may be among the most obsessive 
on-line users. Some players say they spend 40, 50 or even 80 hours a week 
playing, stealing time from their jobs or their classes, forgetting meals, 
skipping classes, losing sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Over one two-year period, Freddie said he spent the equivalent of 42 24-hour 
days playing a single MUD adventure game, based in a computer in Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hooked, addicted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By last fall, his net life began to slop over into RL. In MUDs, players 
express their emotions -- such as a smile, a grin or a giggle -- by typing 
them. "I was sitting in my kitchen with my mom and she said something, and I 
said 'Smile,' " he recalled. "I thought, 'I'm not supposed to say it. I'm 
supposed to do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A bit shaken, he quit for more than two months. "I have not been that wrapped 
up in it since," he said. Now he is part of a team at the university designing 
and programming an educational MUD for teaching classical Greek mythology. At 
most, he MUDs himself a few hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Freddie said that, while it interfered with classes, MUDing helped him hone 
his computer skills. He also learned to express emotions without fear of 
ridicule or reprisal. "When you're with people face to face, you're wearing a 
mask," he said, echoing the views of several other MUDers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a MUD, everyone uses a nickname or "nick." "You get away with more," 
Freddie said. Inhibitions are often checked at the virtual reality cloakroom. 
"In the physical universe, you wouldn't go out there and say, 'Hey, you want to 
have sex?' " Freddie said. "But on a MUD, you can do that. And you can go off 
somewhere and do your text." (On the Internet, sex is basically dirty typing.) 
</P>
<P>
 Turkle said MUDs offer a rare chance for people to experiment with different 
personalities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ability to play another persona, another aspect of the self is one of the 
most riveting things about the Internet," she said. "Some of them are 
handicapped, some of them are not pretty people in their own eyes or the eyes 
of others. They don't feel as presentable in person as their verbal skills and 
charms and wit -- a too simplistic analogy is to Cyrano -- as they are on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 "What part of ourselves would we allow to come out if we were as beautiful as 
Julia Roberts?" she said. "Now people are having the experience of who they 
would be if they could just be their words. It's a very heady experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Rosen, a professor of psychology at Cal State Dominguez Hills, sees 
peril where Turkle sees potential. "You lose track of your normal social 
relations," Rosen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of talking to people, talking to friends, visiting, you're on the 
computer all the time. It creates this artificial feeling of closeness, whether 
you're on a game or on some bulletin board or what, that you know them. But in 
fact it's not real." People, he said, are deluded into thinking they have 
friends.

COMMITMENTS; REAL GIFTS HAVE NO STRINGS; PRESENTS CAN BE WROUGHT WITH ALL SORTS 
OF SYMBOLISM. BUT THE ADAGE THAT 'IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS' STILL RULES.

<P>
 The pressure is on: It's a birthday or anniversary or big holiday and you've 
got to get your beloved a gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe last year's present was fabulous and you don't know how to top it. Or 
perhaps it was a dud -- returned because it was the wrong whatever -- and you 
know you have to do better this time. Or, maybe there's a message you want to 
convey. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, perhaps you're on the receiving end and are tired of opening 
presents that fail to delight or even tickle your fancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for the easygoing and the lighthearted, getting and receiving gifts from 
a special someone can sometimes be frustrating -- and may signal a problem in a 
relationship, according to psychologists who have sat through long sessions 
with patients who discuss their fury at getting the dead-wrong gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Polland, a Westside psychotherapist and professor of child development 
at California State University, Northridge, remembers a woman who was 
constantly talking to her husband about wanting to leave her demanding, 
fast-track job to spend more time with the children. When he gave her a very 
expensive, high-style leather briefcase for her birthday, she flipped. 
</P>
<P>
 "She thought there was a big ulterior motive, but I think her husband just 
wasn't tuned in to how unhappy she was with her job," Polland said. The woman 
returned the briefcase to buy herself a host of other things she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Or consider the case of another woman who was tired of getting lavish gifts 
from a husband who kept her on an excruciatingly tight day-to-day budget. "I 
met alone with her husband and suggested he give her an extension course in 
money management and investment, and a check to invest," said Polland, who 
added that the gift turned out to be a big hit: It symbolized freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the woman whose husband gave her a big diamond pendant for her birthday, 
and then told her that he expected the lavish gift to make up for his screaming 
tantrums over the years of their marriage. She cried. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do gifts have such power?  
</P>
<P>
 "Because we're raised in a world in which getting stuff is equated with love 
and security," said Jane Conoley, associate dean of Teacher's College at the 
University of Nebraska, Lincoln. "The politics of material exchange is a bad 
policy; it's not the currency of love at all, but it's tempting to confuse the 
two." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the situation, true gifts have no strings, Polland said. "The minute 
a gift has a hidden agenda it really is not a present." 
</P>
<P>
 Conoley said the adults who are especially at risk for overvaluing or 
distorting the meaning behind a gift are those who were raised to see presents 
as rewards or love offerings. "When love and gifts are equated, children start 
to judge other people and their own worth by material objects," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, though, there are dynamics to gift-giving that can make the effort 
of finding the right present especially daunting, even if the stakes are no 
greater than the earnest desire to please. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Stone, a graphic artist based in Van Nuys, said he is sometimes 
frustrated by wife Terry's behavior the week or so before her birthday. She 
always buys herself something special -- such as a bread maker or something 
else for the house -- leaving him without viable gift options. "Then Terry will 
get upset because I'll mumble and grumble because I can't think of anything," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stones have talked about their problem, he said, and have decided that 
Terry just likes the simplicity of going out and getting whatever she wants. 
And there's no need to say thank you. "Getting a gift means you have to 
reciprocate," Alan Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 The real trick in gift-giving, Alan Stone said, is to manage to communicate to 
your beloved that you thought about him or her intensely and carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, he filled Terry's office with more than 100 bright helium balloons for 
her birthday. "It was like saying, 'Hey, look how much I thought about you,' " 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The best gifts communicate that thoughtfulness, Conoley said. "The idea about 
giving a gift is that you've noticed, you've taken some trouble to do some 
research or you've been attentive to the other person's interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Kay McGinty of Lake Forest remembered the best gift her now ex-husband ever 
gave her. It was the first time the two had been away without the children, and 
she woke up on a birthday morning and felt a small present under her pillow. It 
was a gold ring with her initials engraved on it. The gift seemed to suggest 
the rebirth of their relationship, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite best efforts, sometimes gifts fail to work. Marion Taylor of Van Nuys 
remembered when her ex-husband gave her a surprise birthday party. Her joy at 
the surprise was diminished by the fact that when the guests arrived, she was 
in an old bathrobe, without any makeup. "I thought he could have taken me out 
to dinner before so at least I'd be dressed up to look good for the party," she 
said. "He didn't go quite far enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Polland recalled throwing away all her pajamas right before she got married 
and buying elegant nightgowns for her new connubial lifestyle. What was her 
husband's first gift to her after the wedding? Pajamas. "I never even put them 
on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the gift-giving act becomes a test, a sort of midterm examination in 
the course of the relationship geared to tell whether the other person truly 
knows you, Conoley said. And sometimes, the sense that you always have to get 
something more expensive and more spectacular than the previous occasion is an 
unconscious effort to keep proving and doing more for the other person, she 
said. "For some, the gift-giving is about always pushing the goal line back." 
</P>
<P>
 Conoley says you should talk about the politics of gift-giving with each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 And forget ESP. The woman who is quietly hoping her husband will figure out 
what she really wants should express herself, Conoley said. "If I really want a 
big diamond ring, I need to sit down and discuss it." 
</P>
<P>
 Polland advocates not tackling the gift issue head-on, but rather, suggesting 
a whole new approach to the gift exchange. "Say something like, 'Just for fun, 
let's change our gift-giving policy . . . let's do it together -- buy a 
painting for the house, get some Rollerblades for each other,' " she suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 And Polland strongly encourages couples to go for the practically free gifts 
-- such as self-made coupons good for a free carwash or a massage, or a 
surprise picnic at the beach -- over frank materialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Conoley urges couples to put the intensity of gift exchange in perspective and 
to remember that a gift is only a symbol. "The real sign of love is living 
generously and kindly every day."

AN EVER-CHANGING 'CUBA'; FILMMAKERS RACE TO FINISH DOCUMENTARY AS COUNTRY 
TOTTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE BERGMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's what every documentary filmmaker both prays for and dreads: a volatile, 
ever-changing and newsworthy subject.  
</P>
<P>
 For director Chris Hume, it was Cuba. Almost finished with his documentary 
when the latest refugee crisis hit the headlines, Hume was spurred into the 
editing room to quickly assemble the film before it is rendered obsolete by 
political events out of his control. 
</P>
<P>
 Hume first intended "This Is Cuba" as a tongue-in-cheek travelogue about a 
country he describes as "a grotesque time capsule," but the filmmaker had his 
eye on the clock from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I had heard made me realize that Cuba as it was couldn't last," 
Hume says on a break from a frantic session in his apartment-turned-editing 
studio. "It was unnatural, it couldn't last any longer without disintegrating." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hume's options if communist Cuba was to topple before the film is finished: 
re-recording the narration and re-cutting the footage in the hopes that a 
network, public broadcasting or cable station will pick up the finished 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, in the worst-case scenario, scrapping the film altogether, leaving Hume to 
parcel out footage to news outlets eager for images to fill out their 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a classic race against time. Footage shot in Florida, for instance, of 
Cuban refugees arriving at a transition house is "already history," he says, 
because of President Clinton's recent decision to detain Cuban refugees at 
Guantanamo Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the sooner he gets a reel together, the sooner Hume can 
take advantage of Cuba's newsworthiness. "This Is Cuba" is the second 
documentary for the 29-year-old Hume, who received a B.A. in filmmaking in 1987 
from Bard College. In 1991, he won the Grand Jury Prize in the film documentary 
category at the Hamburg Film Festival in Germany for his "House Without a 
Home," which follows the journey of a house relocated from Beverly Hills to 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hume made three trips to Cuba -- first in March, then in May and again in July 
-- with just a Hi-8 camera and a few addresses in his pocket given to him by 
Cuban expatriates living in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Is Cuba" was always intended to be a bilingual production aimed at both 
Spanish-speaking and English-speaking youth cultures, with Hume acting as a 
guide through the island in the same irreverent manner as Michael Moore guided 
filmgoers through Flint, Mich., in his "Roger & Me." 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling on a tourist visa and never alerting the Cuban government to his 
presence by filing for special filming permits, Hume gained access to people 
and places he otherwise would have been restricted from. Hume interviewed 
schoolchildren, prostitutes and rock 'n' roll musicians in their homes, on the 
street and in dark alleys, trying to capture a sense of what the Cuban people 
face day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
 Often filming as Cuban police and soldiers "cruised right by," Hume was never 
caught, nor did he have to disguise his Hi-8 tapes as music cassettes as he had 
originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a country with shortages of everything except irony," Hume says. Indeed, 
when he and co-producer Ron Moler made one of the trips together, Moler golfed 
at a country club where two golf balls cost the same amount of money as a Cuban 
doctor earns in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as soon as he returned from Cuba, Hume found himself locked away in his 
Los Angeles apartment, editing on rented equipment, trying to assemble a rough 
cut to meet a deadline three weeks sooner than his original mid-September date. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hot subject right now." says Gabriel Reyes, who heads creative affairs 
at Tropix, a division of HBO Productions aimed at Latino markets in the United 
States and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't mean that it's a popular subject," Reyes adds, "it's a hot 
subject (because) no one wants to touch it . . . no one knows exactly what's 
going to happen down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-producer Florence Figueroa is still trying to lasso Latin personalities 
such as Daisy Fuentes or Esai Morales to appear at the end of the film to offer 
their opinions on the situation in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 This appeal to both the Spanish- and English-speaking worlds, along with 
Hume's humorous approach, may save the film, says Reyes. "I would hurry up and 
wrap it," Reyes advises. "It's to their benefit that it's bilingual, and if 
it's a black comedy it might have a better shot than if it's just a straight 
documentary." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, as Hume struggles to finish and Figueroa struggles to gain 
attention for their work, she says, "We'll be pleased with whatever we get."

 "Are you anybody?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's the question you repeatedly hear from kids who mass in the vicinity of 
the Emmys, Oscars and other glittery events that draw celebrities. Even if 
you're just passing by, these pursuers of luminaries come at you like beggars 
seeking handouts. 
</P>
<P>
 If you fib and say you are "somebody," autograph books are thrust at you and 
you're implored to sign. Just what VIP groupies do with the autographs of 
genuine celebrities is a puzzle. Do they frame them? Carry them around to show 
their friends? Trade them like baseball cards? File them away and them take 
them out periodically to reminisce, the way you do with photo albums? Do they 
keep them on display and ogle and touch them? Do they worship them? Dance 
around them? Sniff them? Run their hands through them like a miser does gold 
coins? The attraction mystifies. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing new in this. The famous and powerful were probably getting the 
same attention from autograph paparazzi as far back as ancient Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you sign my goat skin?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Best wishes, Caligula.

<P>
 Far too often, public figures are worshiped for wrong or insufficient reasons 
-- a message emphatically delivered in "Baseball," the new Ken Burns 
documentary series coming to PBS Sept. 18. "I was just heartbroken," says a 
90-year-old man, recalling the national shock over revelations that gamblers 
had bribed key members of the Chicago White Sox to throw the 1919 World Series 
in what came to be known as the Black Sox Scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 The most famous of the eight perpetrators was an illiterate named "Shoeless" 
Joe Jackson, a hitting star who had become the icon of schoolboys everywhere. 
That Jackson and his teammates had ever been granted hero status due to their 
glories on the field was an even bigger scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet such misplaced worship of sports figures is hardly out of the ordinary in 
the United States and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash forward to 1994 and the "national hero" brand given O.J. Simpson in 
media accounts of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald 
Lyle Goldman. No one could recall when a "national hero" had been indicted for 
murder in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how football prowess, a bankable nickname, moderate celebrity as an actor 
and a soft-spoken public demeanor earned Simpson idolhood -- or why he had 
become a role model for so many who knew him only from his public persona -- 
was not initially questioned by those covering the double-homicide case. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the emperor was wearing only a few threads. Stripping away 
the thick glaze of imagery, Simpson was merely a former great athlete and 
reputed good guy (before reports of "911" calls and wife abuse surfaced), 
hardly traits that should have earned him a pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in some media circles he was repeatedly ranked with those comic book 
champions that Fred Rogers (of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood') describes on PBS 
this week -- the ones from his childhood who "wore capes, flew through the air 
and picked up buildings with one arm." 
</P>
<P>
 As he notes on his uplifting prime-time program, "Fred Rogers' Heroes: Who's 
Helping America's Children," the 66-year-old Rogers now has a loftier set of 
heroes: "People who confirm our best dreams about being human." The hour 
profiles four of them, none of whom wear a cape. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of Chicago's toughest neighborhoods, former high school dropout 
Olomenji O'Connor heads Project Peace, a program that teaches school kids to 
resolve problems non violently through peer mediation. It's no easy task in 
this environment. When Olomenji asks a classroom of students how many come from 
families where someone has been shot, almost all hands go up. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brewster, N.Y., Dr. Sam Ross operates Green Chimneys, a year-round 
residential program of mutual healing at a working farm. In this Upstate New 
York locale, emotionally and psychologically troubled children interact with 
sick and injured animals. These kids, many of whom have been poorly nurtured 
themselves, become the nurturers of animals. "Sometimes I talk to them and tell 
them that I'm mad," says a boy about his beloved pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 The least effective segment profiles Glojean Todacheene, a Native American 
principal at Mesa Elementary School on the Navajo Reservation in Shiprock, N.M. 
Although demonstrating her compassion for students, the segment never clearly 
defines the "everlasting gift" it says she possesses as a school administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of the hour is a segment featuring Carola de la Rocha, who as an aspiring 
dancer in her 20s left her East Los Angeles home and headed for Mexico City. 
She was accepted there into the Ballet Folklorico de Amalia Hernandez, 
ultimately becoming a soloist with the famed touring company. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 De la Rocha (we also meet two of her top students) is an especially inspired 
choice for the program, departing from the more typical 
adult-helping-kids-with-problems theme. According to this profile by Los 
Angeles filmmaker Jean Victor, De la Rocha later returned to her roots, 
founding the Los Angeles Mexican Dance Company in Lincoln Heights in 1988. Her 
studio is now in downtown Los Angeles, and she turns away no one for lack of 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers' own Family Communications produced "Heroes," and he is both its 
narrator and principal interviewer, surfacing awkwardly, at times, to the 
detriment of the program. At the very least, though, this gentle hour focuses 
on those who have earned the hero label through their actions on behalf of 
others, rather than through their fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a generous current in the American spirit," Rogers said by 
phone last week. If so, it's a current too rarely tapped by the media, 
especially newscasts and other television programs that obsessively feed and 
exploit public fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been so much that's negative in the media," Rogers said. "So many 
people read and hear it, then turn to despair. I just wanted to show the many 
people who are really helping." 
</P>
<P>
 That, in itself, is rather heroic. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Fred Rogers' Heroes: Who's Helping America's Children" airs at 8 p.m. 
Tuesday on KCET-TV Channel 28, and at 8 p.m. Wednesday on KOCE-TV Channel 50 
and KVCR-TV Channel 24.

THE SAX LIFE OF BILL CLINTON; PRESIDENT'S IMPROMPTU PERFORMANCE AT CZECH CLUB 
IS IMMORTALIZED ON CD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Poor Bill Clinton. The media is after him again and this time they are calling 
him "unfocused," "limpid," "raw." And those are just the polite reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does this name-calling come from? Is it more backlash over the crime 
bill? A few verbal rounds in the battle over health care reform? Or maybe some 
analytical commentary on his diplomatic skills? 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. This time it's the President's work on the tenor saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Clinton Jam Session -- The Pres Blows," a CD chronicling an impromptu 
jam session in the Czech Republic, has been released by Daybreak, a small, jazz 
mail-order record company. The 17-minute album was recorded live at the Reduta 
Jazz Club in Prague on Jan. 11, 1994. It includes three tracks: a brief Smetana 
fanfare celebrating President Vaclav Havel's awarding of a Czech-made Amati 
tenor saxophone to Clinton, a five-minute version of "Summertime" and a 
10-minute reading of "My Funny Valentine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the album, Clinton sits in with an excellent six-piece Czech band, which 
includes baritone saxophonist Jan Konopasek, a veteran of the Stan Kenton and 
Woody Herman bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was broadcast live over Czech radio," says Bernard Brightman, president of 
Daybreak, "and a friend of mine brought me a tape. We thought it would make a 
great collectible, so we decided to release it and donate a part of the 
proceeds to the Coalition for the Homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 Copies sent to the White House elicited a cordial letter from Press Secretary 
Dee Dee Myers, thanking Brightman for the CD and noting that "everyone who 
received a copy enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
 However, an offer by Brightman to make the CD available as "a promotional item 
for the committee that is raising funds for the President's legal defense" has 
not yet received a response. A similar offer to the Democratic National 
Committee has also met with no reply. 
</P>
<P>
 There's not much chance that the CD, which has sold about 5,000 copies so far, 
will be hitting the charts any time soon. And it would be a kindness to call 
the critical reaction mixed. Comments range from Entertainment Weekly's 
description of Clinton's "surprising creativity" and FanFare's report that the 
President's solos "lope like a dope" to Billboard jazz columnist Jeff 
Levenson's expectation that the album might bypass gold and platinum and "go 
aluminum." (Copies of the CD were spotted in the comedy section of a Tower 
Records store in Manhattan.)  
</P>
<P>
 Brightman thinks most of the reaction misses the point: 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, the positive aspect is that here we have a President who supports jazz 
and likes to play the horn. He goes into a nightclub in the Czech Republic, 
they give him a new saxophone and he plays it. He tries to get through one 
number and stumbles a bit. But then he plays a second number and plays fairly 
respectably. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it wasn't anything that would make any of our major jazz musicians 
nervous. But it was the President of the United States playing jazz. That's got 
to be good for something." At the very least, it has to be considered a 
marginal improvement over the pedal-heavy piano renditions by Harry Truman of 
"The Missouri Waltz" and Richard Nixon of "Home on the Range." 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed in perspective, and granting the fact that Clinton hasn't had a lot of 
time for woodshedding his horn lately, the playing he does on the CD is about 
at the level of a moderately talented college jazz student. Typically, his 
melodic expositions are superior to his improvising, which leans toward 
repetitious riffing -- not always precisely in sync with the chord changes. In 
his worse moments, usually when he works himself into a tight corner, he has a 
tendency to revert to agitated trilling. 
</P>
<P>
 On the up side, Clinton's melodic phrasing reveals an easy, sometimes even 
appealing familiarity with the airy openness of jazz rhythm. In one or two 
instances, most notably in his improvisation on "My Funny Valentine," there is 
a sense of drama and continuity to his line suggesting that, under different 
circumstances, he may have matured into an interesting player. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it world-class jazz? Only in the astonishing picture it presents -- 
unimaginable a decade ago -- of an American President jamming with a Czech jazz 
band in a nightclub in a city that once was behind the Iron Curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for the musicd, look at it this way: Bill Clinton, the Pres, will never 
be mistaken or Lester Young, the Prez. But hearing Clinton play, even in his 
more fumbling passages, is far more entertaining than listening to speeches by 
Bob Dole or Phil Gramm. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bill Clinton Jam Session -- The Pres Blows" may be ordered from Daybreak 
Mail Order, 140 W. 22nd St., 12th Floor, New York 10011. (800) 666-5277. Price:

NETWORKS WON'T GIVE YOU MUCH OF A BREAK; TELEVISION: TO COMBAT TRIGGER-HAPPY 
REMOTE HOLDERS, EXECS ARE CUTTING COMMERCIALS BETWEEN SHOWS, DROPPING THEME 
SONGS AND SHORTENING OPENING CREDITS THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Imagine network television with no more commercials between prime-time shows. 
No more ditsy theme songs that rattle around in your head. No more long opening 
credits or closing credit crawls to sit through. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, stop imagining. As the fall season unfurls over the next few weeks, 
you'll see many of these changes transpire.  
</P>
<P>
 The major broadcast networks are dramatically revising the way they present 
their TV programs, altering the face of broadcast television as it has been 
seen for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC is going the furthest by completely eliminating TV commercials between 
programs during prime time, late night and Saturday mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it viewer-friendly formatting," said John Miller, executive vice 
president of advertising, promotion and event programming for NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are a competitive response to cable television and TV remote 
controls. Network executives have come to believe that opening and closing 
credits, theme songs and station breaks are a "surf's up!" signal for viewers 
with itchy trigger fingers to start channel surfing via remote control. And 
with 40 to 45 channels now on the average cable system, viewers can virtually 
ride an endless wave of TV programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last several seasons, the networks have experimented with strategies 
to reduce channel grazing and improve the audience flow from one show to the 
next. But what has been the clever exception in the past is quickly turning 
into the rule. Everyone seems to have caught the fever since NBC's "Frasier" 
achieved instant popularity last season -- finishing as the No. 7 show on 
television -- thanks in part to the seamless, commercial-free transitions from 
"Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the sweeping changes in store for the networks this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ABC: Producers of new shows this season have been ordered not to use theme 
songs and to keep main-title sequences under 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert calls theme songs "an antiquated 
practice" that gives the audience too much time to zap around with the remote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we ask producers to do is to begin programs with a tease, a 
prologue or a cold opening, so viewers with their thumbs on the remote control 
at the beginning of a program time period see program material as opposed to 
what a restless viewer would see as clutter," said Alan Sternfeld, senior vice 
president of program planning and scheduling for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 And series producers are being encouraged by ABC to devise creative end 
credits, sometimes known as "living" end credits. These involve bloopers, 
outtakes or a tag scene, with the credits running obliquely underneath -- as 
shows such as "Home Improvement" and "Roseanne" already do.  
</P>
<P>
 "The point is that we're trying to provide entertainment from beginning to end 
for viewers," Sternfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC will employ seamless, commercial-free transitions between shows on a 
limited basis, mostly to introduce new series -- including a smooth move from 
"Coach" into the new "Blue Skies," from "Full House" into the new "Me and the 
Boys" and from "Thunder Alley" into the new "All-American Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CBS: Main title sequences are still being used at CBS, but only in certain 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "A show that is a premise show, a la 'The Nanny,' that's what needs a main 
title," said Steve Warner, senior vice president of program planning for CBS. 
He was referring to the high-concept sitcom starring Fran Drescher as a Queens 
native who becomes a nanny for a well-to-do WASPy family. "With the song and 
title you set up what the show is about in a fun, fast and refreshing way," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But CBS is cutting back on main title sequences in new shows. Two fall 
sitcoms, "The Five Mrs. Buchanans" and "Daddy's Girls," will do without them. 
When there are main titles or theme songs, they will almost always be preceded 
by program material. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one thing we're trying to be consistent on -- all shows open on 
program material before the first commercial," Warner said. "That is the single 
biggest way to keep viewers hooked into the show. To do a seamless transition 
into the main title into the commercial gets you nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS feels the same way about seamless transitions that ABC does: They will be 
used primarily to introduce new series. Minute-by-minute network research has 
shown that during the commercial breaks between shows, the viewing level drops 
by as much as 25%. Going from one show straight into the next pulls viewers of 
an established hit into the opening of the next series, often before they 
realize it. 
</P>
<P>
 Both networks believe that established shows don't need the push of a seamless 
transition, which can create problems with advertisers. There are typically 
four commercial breaks in a half-hour TV series. By eliminating those at the 
top and bottom of the hour, networks have to push more commercials into the 
remaining breaks, making them longer and potentially less effective in getting 
a sponsor's message across.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NBC: Whether all these strategies are the future of broadcast television or 
just a passing fad will probably tell at NBC. Under a sweeping plan called "NBC 
2000," every prime-time, late-night and Saturday morning program will be linked 
together with seamless transitions beginning Sept. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to our research, people are more disturbed by the number of 
commercial breaks than by the length of them," said NBC's Miller, adding that 
viewers are more likely to sit through advertisers' commercials once they are 
engaged in a show. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of every NBC movie, series and special, viewers will see their TV 
screen split in two. One-third of the screen will contain a silent credit 
crawl, while the other two-thirds will feature programming snippets, such as a 
tag scene after a sitcom or highlights from that night's "Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, NBC has hired an entire staff of writers and producers to create a 
variety of short programming items to run alongside the credits of its shows. 
The bits include NBC trivia, backstage visits to NBC series and classic NBC 
moments. One such moment that will air is the first kiss between Barbara Eden 
and Larry Hagman on "I Dream of Jeannie." 
</P>
<P>
 "If one guy does something and it seems to work, the others will naturally 
follow," Miller said. "We're trying to get a jump on the competition."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fox: The Fox network has used many of these techniques intermittently -- cold 
show openings, seamless transitions, split-screen credit rolls -- to set it 
apart from its established competitors. The youth-oriented Fox has pushed the 
envelope even further, at times, with zany theme weeks and hosted evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Grushow, president of the Fox Entertainment Group, said his network is 
stepping up its use of cold openings and "living" credits by about 50% this 
fall, reflecting the activities of his competitors.  
</P>
<P>
 But Fox will only use seamless transitions to introduce new shows, such as it 
did Sunday night with "Hardball" and "Wild Oats." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the absence of clear-cut evidence that, indeed, this is a successful 
procedure, we will go at it selectively, assessing and analyzing the results, 
before we thrust ourselves into it the way the others have," Grushow said. "I 
do have some doubts about this procedure in the long run. If a show lacks the 
appeal of the show before it, over time you will see audience erosion -- I 
don't care what you do to stop it."

ART CENTER FILLS 3 KEY JOBS FOR MARCH DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The opening of the Huntington Beach Art Center, postponed repeatedly since 
first announced in 1991, appears a step closer to reality with the hiring of 
three key staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, who now say they will open the center in March, have hired 
Marilu Knode as its curator, Tyler Stallings as its education coordinator and 
Joe Husovsky as its exhibitions designer and preparator, according to Naida 
Osline, the city cultural services supervisor who will direct center 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Knode, an independent curator and arts administrator from Los Angeles, most 
recently worked as acting associate director of Los Angeles Contemporary 
Exhibitions (LACE), a leading alternative art space. Before that, from 1988 to 
1992, she held various positions at the Newport Harbor Art Museum in Newport 
Beach including that of assistant curator. She is scheduled to curate a major 
retrospective of Llyn Foulkes' work at the Laguna Art Museum in Laguna Beach 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallings, also from Los Angeles, is a writer, visual artist and curator 
currently employed as public arts assistant to the city of Los Angeles' 
Cultural Affairs Department. From 1991 to 1993, he planned experimental 
multimedia art classes at Oakwood High, a private school in North Hollywood. 
Stallings has read his art theory at L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Husovsky, of Irvine, has been chief preparator at Newport Harbor since 1990. 
Before that, he was preparator at the Laguna Art Museum for two years and an 
intern at the Severin Wunderman Museum in Irvine. He is to start his new job in 
late October; Knode and Stallings are to begin in January, Osline said. 
</P>
<P>
 Various problems, mostly construction-related, have delayed the opening of the 
center, which is to occupy a refurbished 11,500-square-foot building at 538 
Main St. downtown. The refurbishment is expected to cost $1.3 million.

ART MUSEUM IS 'STILL IDENTIFYING' JOB CANDIDATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her first discussion of the museum director's post since Charles Desmarais 
was fired from the job in March, the president of the Laguna Art Museum board 
said "a candidate from a nationally recognized institution" was interviewed a 
week ago today but that no job offer has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not at that point yet . . . we're still identifying potential 
candidates," president Teri Kennady said late last week, adding that a search 
committee of museum trustees and staff members has no "short list" of 
replacements for Desmarais.The number of "people we're focusing on changes from 
day to day," Kennady said, and the committee expects to interview more 
candidates "within the next couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, curator of exhibitions Susan M. Anderson, who has been acting 
director since March, said she is not applying for the position. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennady has said the board expects to hire a new director by the first of the 
year but, she added last week, "that's not to say we won't have someone 
sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 She would not provide additional information about the candidate interviewed 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 She stressed the museum's decision to use its own search committee instead of 
an outside search firm was "not in any way economic." Museum officials, she 
said, think the committee knows what it wants: a director with experience in 
running a financially sound institution, as well as artistic experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais was fired by the board without cause, an action permitted under his 
contract. Board members have declined comment on the termination except to say 
they would like to see "more energy put into administration."

'THE BURNING SEASON' FIRES UP AUDIENCE; TELEVISION: THE BRAZILIAN PREMIERE OF 
HBO'S STORY OF MURDERED RUBBER TAPPER CHICO MENDES, STARRING RAUL JULIA, 
ELICITS BOOS, CHEERS AND TEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Minutes before the glitzy premiere here of HBO's film "The Burning Season," 
the story of murdered Brazilian rubber tapper Chico Mendes, Andrew Revkin said 
that he had one wish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope it creates an emotional reaction," said Revkin, author of the 
book on which the movie about the champion of the Amazon preservation movement 
is based. 
</P>
<P>
 It did. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a horrible movie," one patron shouted from the balcony of the city's 
elegant Municipal Theater to the 1,000-member audience, which was filled with 
members of Brazil's movie, television and art community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't the Americans who made this cause. It was us, Brazilians," shouted 
another man as the final credits ran, irked that local activists didn't get 
more credit in the film for their efforts in support of Mendes. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the movie ended last Thursday, emotions in the crowd ranged from 
admiration to sadness, shame and disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The $11-million film, shot in Mexico and directed by John Frankenheimer, stars 
Raul Julia as Mendes and includes Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, American actor 
Edward James Olmos and Cuban-born actor Tomas Milian. It airs on HBO in the 
United States on Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 HBO premiered the work here at the invitation of the Rio de Janeiro Film 
Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie was a surprise," said Carlos Reichembach, a Brazilian film 
director. "It's not an easy film. It's a difficult film. It's not a film that 
has an easy commercial appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 Giovanna Gold, a well-known Brazilian actress, said the film was moving but 
inappropriate to start a film festival. "We are here to have fun and enjoy 
movies, and the trees are still burning," she said, referring to the practice 
of burning off huge tracts of the Amazon forest to make way for large ranches 
-- part of the deforestation that Mendes opposed. "That makes me feel 
uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 "It started slow," said Felicia Krumholz, a landscape architect, "but as we 
got toward the end, I was there with tears streaming down my face. I am sort of 
a child of Chico Mendes. I got involved in recycling and other projects because 
of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Others found the movie boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too bad good intentions don't always make good movies," said engineer Marcos 
Venicios. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were irritated by the fact that a work about a Brazilian hero was made by 
an American company and not a Brazilian one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel ashamed because we (Brazilians) needed the foreign media to show us 
what was happening right here in our own country," said Beth Silveira, a 
theatrical producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Many complaints concerned the veracity of the film. 
</P>

 "The big error of the movie was made before the film begins, when it says (on 
screen) that it's a true story and not inspired by a true story," said Zuenir 
Ventura, a respected Brazilian reporter who covered the trials of the two men 
convicted of murdering Mendes in 1988 and who later adopted the boy whose 
testimony helped send them to prison. (One man later escaped and the other is 
awaiting a new trial.)

 For example, some said, central to the film is Mendes' staunch opposition to 
the construction of a road into the Amazon forest. Journalists, rubber tappers 
who worked with Mendes and even writer Revkin said that Mendes never opposed 
the road. 
</P>

 "We need roads, we want roads," said Jorge Antonio Alves, 31, a rubber tapper 
who worked with Mendes and is currently president of the workers' cooperative 
in the town of Xapuri, where Mendes was murdered. "Chico was against the unfair 
distribution of the land. He was against the way the road was going to be used 
to promote more burning and clearing of the forest."

 He also took exception to a scene in which a child is killed when gunmen hired 
by land owners fire into a crowd of demonstrators. "They dramatized a little 
too much," Alves said. "No children were ever killed."

 "Chico Mendes was a more complex person than the person presented in the 
movie," said Ventura. "He was a militant of the '90s, not an activist of the 
'60s. In the film, they painted him like Martin Luther King or Gandhi, but that 
wasn't his style." Mendes was an aggressive communist, he said, whose activism 
was rooted in class struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 But over all, both Alves and Ventura gave the film a passing grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The film shows clearly that (Mendes) was a champion," Alves said. "I think it 
shows the reality of what we're going through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our struggle is not over. Two percent of the (western) state of Acre has been 
burned this year, and 6% was burned last year." Even the Chico Mendes Preserve 
-- 2.5 million acres deeded to the rubber tappers and their families after 
Mendes' death -- has already been invaded by lumber cutters, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, Chico Mendes was so little known in Brazil that the image of 
him (in the film), with all its problems, will be accepted as the truth," 
Ventura said. "Whether that's good or bad, I don't know. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a mixture of shame and pride. Shame that we allowed this to happen, 
and pride in a Brazilian hero."
